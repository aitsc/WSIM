0901.0731	the early phase of a h1743-322 outburst observed by integral, rxte,  swift, and xmm/newton	we investigate the early phase of the first state change during the 2008september-november outburst of h1743-322, first detected by the integralsatellite. we analyse integral, rxte, swift, and xmm/newton observations, whichprovide coverage of the quiescence to outburst evolution in the 3-200 kev rangeevery few days. the energy spectra are well fitted by a phenomenological modelconsisting of an exponentially cut-off power law plus a disc component. a morephysical model of thermal comptonisation (and a disc) represents the spectraequally well. in a first phase (up to mjd 54760), the photon index andtemperature of the disc do not vary significantly, and have values reminiscentof the hard state (hs). the timing analysis is also consistent with that of ahs, and shows in particular a rather high degree of variability (~30%), and astrong ~0.5-1 hz qpo with its first harmonic. the timing and spectralcharacteristics of h1743-322 are similar to those of the first hs during its2003 outburst. after mjd 54760, a change to softer spectra and a ~5-6 hz qpoindicate that the source underwent a state transition into a hard-intermediatestate (hims). we observe in both states a correlation between the qpo frequencyand the photon index, which indicates a strong link between the accretion disc,generally understood to determine the qpo frequency, and the corona, whichdetermines the qpo power. the gradual disappearance of the qpo harmonic, andthe slowly decreasing hard x-ray flux, imply that the accretion disc graduallymoved inwards during the hs.

0909.3283	the infrared/x-ray correlation of gx 339-4: probing hard x-ray emission  in accreting black holes	gx 339-4 has been one of the key sources for unravelling the accretionejection coupling in accreting stellar mass black holes. after a long period ofquiescence between 1999 and 2002, gx 339-4 underwent a series of 4 outburststhat have been intensively observed by many ground based observatories [radio,infrared(ir), optical] and satellites (x-rays). here, we present results ofthese broad-band observational campaigns, focusing on the optical-ir(oir)/x-ray flux correlations over the four outbursts. we found tight oir/x-raycorrelations over four decades with the presence of a break in the ir/x-raycorrelation in the hard state. this correlation is the same for all fouroutbursts. this can be interpreted in a consistent way by considering asynchrotron self-compton origin of the x-rays in which the break frequencyvaries between the optically thick and thin regime of the jet spectrum. we alsohighlight the similarities and differences between optical/x-ray and ir/x-raycorrelations which suggest a jet origin of the near-ir emission in the hardstate while the optical is more likely dominated by the blackbody emission ofthe accretion disc in both hard and soft state. however we find a nonnegligible contribution of 40 per cent of the jet emission in the v-band duringthe hard state.  we finally concentrate on a soft-to-hard state transition during the decay ofthe 2004 outburst by comparing the radio, ir, optical and hard x-rays lightcurves. it appears that unusual delays between the peak of emission in thedifferent energy domains may provide some important constraints on jetformation scenario.

0707.4500	tracing the jet contribution to the mid-ir over the 2005 outburst of gro  j1655-40 via broadband spectral modeling	we present new results from a multi-wavelength (radio/infrared/optical/x-ray)study of the black hole x-ray binary gro j1655-40 during its 2005 outburst. wedetected, for the first time, mid-infrared emission at 24 um from the compactjet of a black hole x-ray binary during its hard state, when the source showsemission from a radio compact jet as well as a strong non-thermal hard x-raycomponent. these detections strongly constrain the optically thick part of thesynchrotron spectrum of the compact jet, which is consistent with being flatover four orders of magnitude in frequency. moreover, using this unprecedentedcoverage, and especially thanks to the new spitzer observations, we can testbroadband disk and jet models during the hard state. two of the hard statebroadband spectra are reasonably well fitted using a jet model with parametersoverall similar to those previously found for cyg x-1 and gx 339-4. differencesare also present; most notably, the jet power in gro j1655-40 appears to be afactor of at least ~3-5 higher (depending on the distance) than that of cyg x-1and gx 339-4 at comparable disk luminosities. furthermore, a few discrepanciesbetween the model and the data, previously not found for the other two blackhole systems for which there was no mid-ir/ir and optical coverage, areevident, and will help to constrain and refine theoretical models.

1009.1367	a decelerating jet observed by the evn and vlba in the x-ray transient  xte j1752-223	the recently discovered galactic x-ray transient xte j1752-223 entered itsfirst known outburst in 2010, emitting from the x-ray to the radio regimes. itsgeneral x-ray properties were consistent with those of a black hole candidatein various spectral states, when ejection of jet components is expected. toverify this, we carried out very long baseline interferometry (vlbi)observations. the measurements were carried out with the european vlbi network(evn) and the very long baseline array (vlba) at four epochs in 2010 february.the images at the first three epochs show a moving jet component that issignificantly decelerated by the last epoch, when a new jet component appearsthat is likely to be associated with the receding jet side. the overall pictureis consistent with an initially mildly relativistic jet, interacting with theinterstellar medium or with swept-up material along the jet. the brightening ofthe receding ejecta at the final epoch can be well explained by initial dopplerdeboosting of the emission in the decelerating jet.

1101.5159	radiatively efficient accreting black holes in the hard state: the case  study of h1743-322	in recent years, much effort has been devoted to unraveling the connectionbetween the accretion flow and the jets in accreting compact objects. in thepresent work, we report new constraints on these issues, through the long termstudy of the radio and x-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate h1743-322.this source is known to be one of the `outliers' of the universal radio/x-raycorrelation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displayingfainter radio emission for a given x-ray luminosity than expected from thecorrelation. our study shows that the radio and x-ray emission of h1743-322 arestrongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state. however,this correlation is unusually steep for a black hole x-ray binary: b ~ 1.4(with l_{radio} \propto l_{x}^{b}). below a critical luminosity, thecorrelation becomes shallower until it rejoins the standard correlation with b~ 0.6. based on these results, we first show that the steep correlation can beexplained if the inner accretion flow is radiatively efficient during the hardstate, in contrast to what is usually assumed for black hole x-ray binaries inthis spectral state. the transition between the steep and the standardcorrelation would therefore reflect a change from a radiatively efficient to aradiatively inefficient accretion flow. finally, we investigate the possibilitythat the discrepancy between `outliers' and `standard' black holes arises fromthe outflow properties rather than from the accretion flow.

1108.0666	first simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of the black hole  candidate igr j17091-3624: atca, integral, swift, and rxte views of the 2011  outburst	we present the results of the first four (quasi-)simultaneous radio (atca),x-ray (swift, rxte), and gamma-ray (integral) observations of the black holecandidate igr j17091-3624, performed in february and march 2011. the x-rayanalysis shows that the source was in the hard state, and then it transited toa soft intermediate state. we study the correlated radio/x-ray behaviour ofthis source for the first time. the radio counterpart to igr j17091-3624 wasdetected during all four observations with the atca. in the hard state, theradio spectrum is typical of optically thick synchrotron emission from aself-absorbed compact jet. in the soft intermediate state, the detection ofoptically thin synchrotron emission is probably due to a discrete ejectionevent associated with the state transition. the position of igr j17091-3624 inthe radio versus x-ray luminosity diagram (aka fundamental plane) is compatiblewith that of the other black hole sources for distances greater than 11 kpc.igr j17091-3624 also appears as a new member of the few sources that show astrong quenching of radio emission after the state transition. using theestimated luminosity at the spectral transition from the hard state, and for atypical mass of 10 m_sun, we estimate a distance to the source between ~11 and~17 kpc, compatible with the radio behaviour of the source.

1108.3492	transient relativistic ejections and stationary core in xte j1752-223	the galactic x-ray transient xte j1752-223 was shown to have properties ofblack hole binary candidates. as reported in our previous paper, we identifiedtransient and decelerating ejecta in multi-epoch very long baselineinterferometry (vlbi) observations with the european vlbi network (evn) and thenrao very long baseline array (vlba). here we present new evn and vlba data inwhich a new transient ejection event and later a stationary component areidentified. the latter is interpreted as a reappearance of the radiocore/compact jet during the transition from soft to hard x-ray state. thiscomponent appears to be highly variable in brightness although effects oftropospheric instabilities might play a role too. we also re-analyze theearlier vlbi data and find that the transient ejecta closer to the coreposition has significantly higher proper motion, further strengthening the casefor strongly decelerating ejecta on the scale of several hundredmilli-arcsecond, never observed in x-ray binaries before. although the distanceof the source is not well constrained, it is clear that these ejectas are atleast mildly relativistic at the early stages. moreover, we show the largescale environment of the transient from the westerbork synthesis array datarecorded in parallel during the evn run.

1109.4143	a variable mid-infrared synchrotron break associated with the compact  jet in gx 339-4	many x-ray binaries remain undetected in the mid-infrared, a regime whereemission from their compact jets is likely to dominate. here, we report thedetection of the black hole binary gx 339-4 with the wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) during a very bright, hard accretion state in 2010. combinedwith a rich contemporaneous multiwavelength dataset, clear spectral curvatureis found in the infrared, associated with the peak flux density expected fromthe compact jet. an optically-thin slope of ~-0.7 and a jet radiative power of&gt;6x10^{35} erg/s (d/8 kpc)^2 are measured. a ~24 h wise light curve showsdramatic variations in mid-infrared spectral slope on timescales at least asshort as the satellite orbital period ~95 mins. there is also significantchange during one pair of observations spaced by only 11 s. these variationsimply that the spectral break associated with the transition from self-absorbedto optically-thin jet synchrotron radiation must be varying across the fullwavelength range of ~3-22 microns that wise is sensitive to, and more. based onfour-band simultaneous mid-infrared detections, the break lies at ~5x10^{13} hzin at least two epochs of observation, consistent with a magnetic fieldb~1.5x10^4 g assuming a single-zone synchrotron emission region. the observedvariability implies that either b, or the size of the acceleration zone abovethe jet base, are being modulated by factors of ~10 on relatively-shorttimescales.

1109.4312	overview of an extensive multi-wavelength study of gx 339-4 during the  2010 outburst	the microquasar gx 339-4 experienced a new outburst in 2010: it was observedsimultaneously at various wavelengths from radio up to soft gamma-rays. wefocused on observations that are quasi-simultaneous with those made with theintegral and rxte satellites: these were collected in 2010 march-april duringour integral target of opportunity program, and during some of the otherintegral observing programs with gx 339-4 in the field-of-view. x-raytransients are extreme systems that often harbour a black hole, and are knownto emit throughout the whole electromagnetic spectrum when in outburst. thegoals of our program are to understand the evolution of the physical processesclose to the black hole and to study the connections between the accretion andejection. we analysed radio, nir, optical, uv, x-ray and soft gamma-rayobservations. we studied the source evolution in detail by producing lightcurves, hardness-intensity diagrams and spectra. we fitted the broadband datawith phenomenological, then physical, models to study the emission coming fromthe distinct components. based on the energy spectra, the source evolved fromthe canonical hard state to the canonical soft state. the source showed x-rayspectral variations that were correlated with changes in radio, nir and opticalemission. the bolometric flux increased from 0.8 to 2.9*10^{-8} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1} while the relative flux and contribution of the hot medium globallydecreased. reprocessing in the disc was likely to be strong at the end of ourobservations. the source showed a behaviour similar to that of previousoutbursts, with some small deviations in the hard x-rays parameters' evolution.the radio, nir and optical emission from jets was detected, and seen to fade asthe source softened. the results are discussed within the context of disc andjet models.

1201.1678	disc-jet coupling in the 2009 outburst of the black hole candidate  h1743-322	we present an intensive radio and x-ray monitoring campaign on the 2009outburst of the galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary h1743-322. with thehigh angular resolution of the very long baseline array, we resolve the jetejection event and measure the proper motions of the jet ejecta relative to theposition of the compact core jets detected at the beginning of the outburst.this allows us to accurately couple the moment when the jet ejection eventoccurred with x-ray spectral and timing signatures. we find that x-ray timingsignatures are the best diagnostic of the jet ejection event in this outburst,which occurred as the x-ray variability began to decrease and the type cquasi-periodic oscillations disappeared from the x-ray power density spectrum.however, this sequence of events does not appear to be replicated in all blackhole x-ray binary outbursts, even within an individual source. in ourobservations of h1743-322, the ejection was contemporaneous with a quenching ofthe radio emission, prior to the start of the major radio flare. thiscontradicts previous assumptions that the onset of the radio flare marks themoment of ejection. the jet speed appears to vary between outbursts, with apossible positive correlation with outburst luminosity. the compact core radiojet reactivated on transition to the hard intermediate state at the end of theoutburst, and not when the source reached the low hard spectral state.comparison with the known near-infrared behaviour of the compact jets suggestsa gradual evolution of the compact jet power over a few days near the beginningand end of an outburst.

1202.3984	optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the black hole gx 339-4: i. a  focus on the continuum in the low/hard and high/soft states	the microquasar gx 339-4, known to exhibit powerful compact jets thatdominate its radio to near-infrared emission, entered an outburst in 2010 forthe fifth time in about fifteen years. an extensive radio to x-raymulti-wavelength campaign was immediately triggered, and we report here oneso/fors2+isaac optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, supportedby atca radio and rxte/swift x-ray quasi-simultaneous data. gx 339-4 wasobserved at three different epochs, once in the soft state and twice in thehard state. in the soft state, the optical and near-infrared continuum islargely consistent with the raleigh-jeans tail of a thermal process. as anexplanation, we favour irradiation of the outer accretion disc by its innerregions, enhanced by disc warping. an excess is also present at lowfrequencies, likely due to a m subgiant companion star. during the first hardstate, the optical/near-infrared continuum is well-described by the opticallythin synchrotron emission of the compact jet combined with disc irradiation andperhaps another component peaking in the ultraviolet. the spectral break wherethe jet transits from the optically thick to thin regimes, located below1.20e14 hz, is not detected and the extension of the optically thin synchrotronis consistent with the 3-50 kev spectrum. in contrast, the emission during thesecond hard state is more difficult to understand and points toward a morecomplex jet continuum. in both cases, the near-infrared continuum is found tobe variable at timescales at least as short as 20 s, although thesevariabilities are smoothed out beyond a few hundred seconds. this implies rapidvariations - in flux and frequency - of the location of the spectral break,i.e. dramatic short timescale changes of the physical conditions at the base ofthe jet, such as the magnetic field and/or the base radius.

1211.1600	the "universal" radio/x-ray flux correlation : the case study of the  black hole gx 339-4	the existing radio and x-ray flux correlation for galactic black holes in thehard and quiescent states relies on a sample which is mostly dominated by twosources (gx 339-4 and v404 cyg) observed in a single outburst. in this paper,we report on a series of radio and x-ray observations of the recurrent blackhole gx 339-4 with the australia telescope compact array, the rossi x-raytiming explorer and the swift satellites. with our new long term campaign, wenow have a total of 88 quasi-simultaneous radio and x-ray observations of gx339-4 during its hard state, covering a total of seven outbursts over a15--year period. our new measurements represent the largest sample for astellar mass black hole, without any bias from distance uncertainties, over thelargest flux variations and down to a level that could be close to quiescence,making gx 339-4 the reference source for comparison with other accretingsources (black holes, neutrons stars, white dwarfs and active galactic nuclei).our results demonstrate a very strong and stable coupling between radio andx-ray emission, despite several outbursts of different nature and separated bya period of quiescence. the radio and x-ray luminosity correlation of the forml_x ~l_rad^0.62 +/-0.01 confirms the non-linear coupling between the jet andthe inner accretion flow powers and better defines the standard correlationtrack in the radio-x-ray diagram for stellar mass black holes. we further noteepochs of deviations from the fit that significantly exceed the measurementuncertainties, especially during the formation and destruction of the compactjets ...[abridged]. we incorporated our new data in a more global study ofblack hole candidates strongly supporting a scale invariance in thejet-accretion coupling of accreting black holes, and confirms the existence oftwo populations of sources in the radio/x-ray diagram.

1303.2551	formation of the compact jets in the black hole gx 339-4	galactic black hole binaries produce powerful outflows with emit over almostthe entire electromagnetic spectrum. here, we report the first detection withthe herschel observatory of a variable far-infrared source associated with thecompact jets of the black hole transient gx 339-4 during the decay of itsrecent 2010-2011 outburst, after the transition to the hard state. we alsooutline the results of very sensitive radio observations conducted with theaustralia telescope compact array, along with a series of near-infrared,optical (oir) and x-ray observations, allowing for the first time there-ignition of the compact jets to be observed over a wide range ofwavelengths. the compact jets first turn on at radio frequencies with anoptically thin spectrum that later evolves to optically thick synchrotronemission. an oir reflare is observed about ten days after the onset of radioand hard x-ray emission, likely reflecting the necessary time to build upenough density, as well as to have acceleration (e.g. through shocks) along anextended region in the jets. the herschel measurements are consistent with anextrapolation of the radio inverted power-law spectrum, but they highlight amore complex radio to oir spectral energy distribution for the jets.

1304.3510	an evolving compact jet in the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1836-194	we report striking changes in the broadband spectrum of the compact jet ofthe black hole transient maxi j1836-194 over state transitions during itsdiscovery outburst in 2011. a fading of the optical-infrared (ir) flux occurredas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening asit returned to the hard state. the optical-ir spectrum was consistent with apower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the x-rayspectrum was softest. by fitting the radio to optical spectra with a brokenpower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thinbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. the break gradually shifted to higherfrequencies as the source hardened at x-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x10^13 hz. the radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared tobe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seendirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. the physicalprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of whichare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but couldarise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction ofaccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. this provides an unprecedentedinsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implicationsfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launchingprocess.

1304.6336	multiwavelength observations of the black hole transient xte j1752-223  during its 2010 outburst decay	galactic black hole transients show many interesting phenomena duringoutburst decays. we present simultaneous x-ray (rxte, swift, and integral), andoptical/near-infrared (o/nir) observations (smarts) of the x-ray transient xtej1752-223 during its outburst decay in 2010. the multiwavelength observationsover 150 days in 2010 cover the transition from soft to hard spectral state. wediscuss the evolution of radio emission is with respect to the o/nir lightcurve which shows several flares. one of those flares is bright and long,starting about 60 days after the transition in x-ray timing properties. duringthis flare, the radio spectral index becomes harder. other smaller flares occuralong with the x-ray timing transition, and also right after the detection ofthe radio core. we discuss the significances of these flares. furthermore,using the simultaneous broadband x-ray spectra including integral, we find thata high energy cut-off with a folding energy near 250 kev is necessary aroundthe time that the compact jet is forming. the broad band spectrum can be fittedequally well with a comptonization model. in addition, using photoelectricabsorption edges in the xmm-newton rgs x-ray spectra and the extinction of redclump giants in the direction of the source, we find a lower limit on thedistance of &gt; 5 kpc.

1309.4926	the evolving polarised jet of black hole candidate swift j1745-26	swift j1745-26 is an x-ray binary towards the galactic centre that wasdetected when it went into outburst in september 2012. this source is thoughtto be one of a growing number of sources that display "failed outbursts", inwhich the self-absorbed radio jets of the transient source are never fullyquenched and the thermal emission from the geometrically-thin inner accretiondisk never fully dominates the x-ray flux. we present multifrequency data fromthe very large array, australia telescope compact array and karoo arraytelescope (kat- 7) radio arrays, spanning the entire period of the outburst.our rich data set exposes radio emission that displays a high level of largescale variability compared to the x-ray emission and deviations from thestandard radio--x-ray correlation that are indicative of an unstable jet andconfirm the outburst's transition from the canonical hard state to anintermediate state. we also observe steepening of the spectral index and anincrease of the linear polarization to a large fraction (~50%) of the totalflux, as well as a rotation of the electric vector position angle. these areconsistent with a transformation from a self-absorbed compact jet tooptically-thin ejecta -- the first time such a discrete ejection has beenobserved in a failed outburst -- and may imply a complex magnetic fieldgeometry.

1406.7242	lofar sparse image reconstruction	context. the low frequency array (lofar) radio telescope is a giant digitalphased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in europe. itprovides discrete sets of fourier components of the sky brightness. recoveringthe original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverseproblem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methodsaims. recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete natureof radio interferometry measurement and the "compressed sensing" (cs) theory,which supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measuredvisibilities. empowered by proximal theory, cs offers a sound framework forefficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fastalgorithms. combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (dde) in thescope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based onthis framework methods. we implemented a sparse reconstruction method in thestandard lofar imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolutionperformance of this new imager with that of clean-based methods (clean andms-clean) with simulated and real lofar data results. we show that i) sparsereconstruction performs as well as clean in recovering the flux of pointsources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean squareerror is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with aneffective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the clean images.conclusions. sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic andwide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (ofsimulated and real lofar datasets). this sparse reconstruction method iscompatible with modern interferometric imagers that handle dde corrections (a-and w-projections) required for current and future instruments such as lofarand ska

1412.5819	internal shocks driven by accretion flow variability in the compact jet  of the black hole binary gx 339-4	in recent years, compact jets have been playing a growing role in theunderstanding of accreting black hole engines. in the case of x-ray binarysystems, compact jets are usually associated with the hard state phase of asource outburst. recent observations of gx 339-4 have demonstrated the presenceof a variable synchrotron spectral break in the mid-infrared band that wasassociated with its compact jet. in the model used in this study, we assumethat the jet emission is produced by electrons accelerated in internal shocksdriven by rapid fluctuations of the jet velocity. the resulting spectral energydistribution (sed) and variability properties are very sensitive to the fourierpower spectrum density (psd) of the assumed fluctuations of the jet lorentzfactor. these fluctuations are likely to be triggered by the variability of theaccretion flow which is best traced by the x-ray emission. taking the psd ofthe jet lorentz factor fluctuations to be identical to the observed x-ray psd,our study finds that the internal shock model successfully reproduces the radioto infrared sed of the source at the time of the observations as well as thereported strong mid-infrared spectral variability.

(2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. in thispaper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of thiseffect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. finally, we haveestimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation fromfour pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the paprofiles, and the theoretical framework of blaskiewicz, cordes &amp; wasserman(1991). these estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for psrb1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based onradius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recentupper limit based on pulsar timing.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1511.09118	imaging jupiter's radiation belts down to 127 mhz with lofar	context. observing jupiter's synchrotron emission from the earth remainstoday the sole method to scrutinize the distribution and dynamical behavior ofthe ultra energetic electrons magnetically trapped around the planet (becausein-situ particle data are limited in the inner magnetosphere). aims. we performthe first resolved and low-frequency imaging of the synchrotron emission withlofar at 127 mhz. the radiation comes from low energy electrons (~1-30 mev)which map a broad region of jupiter's inner magnetosphere. methods (see articlefor complete abstract) results. the first resolved images of jupiter'sradiation belts at 127-172 mhz are obtained along with total integrated fluxdensities. they are compared with previous observations at higher frequenciesand show a larger extent of the synchrotron emission source (&gt;=4 $r_j$). theasymmetry and the dynamic of east-west emission peaks are measured and thepresence of a hot spot at lambda_iii=230 {\deg} $\pm$ 25 {\deg}. spectral fluxdensity measurements are on the low side of previous (unresolved) ones,suggesting a low-frequency turnover and/or time variations of the emissionspectrum. conclusions. lofar is a powerful and flexible planetary imager. theobservations at 127 mhz depict an extended emission up to ~4-5 planetary radii.the similarities with high frequency results reinforce the conclusion that: i)the magnetic field morphology primarily shapes the brightness distribution ofthe emission and ii) the radiating electrons are likely radially andlatitudinally distributed inside about 2 $r_j$. nonetheless, the larger extentof the brightness combined with the overall lower flux density, yields newinformation on jupiter's electron distribution, that may shed light on theorigin and mode of transport of these particles.

1512.02805	spectral and timing evolution of the bright failed outburst of the  transient black hole swift j174510.8-262411	we studied time variability and spectral evolution of the galactic black holetransient swift j174510.8-262411 during the first phase of its outburst.integral and swift observations collected from 2012 september 16 until october30 have been used. the total squared fractional rms values did not drop below5% and qpos, when present, were type-c, indicating that the source never madethe transition to the soft-intermediate state. even though the source was verybright (up to 1 crab in hard x-rays), it showed a so called failed outburst asit never reached the soft state. xrt and ibis broad band spectra, wellrepresented by a hybrid thermal/non-thermalcomptonisationmodel, showed physicalparameters characteristic of the hard and intermediate states. in particular,the derived temperature of the geometrically thin disc black body was about 0.6kev at maximum.we found a clear decline of the optical depth of the coronaelectrons (close to values of 0.1), as well as of the total compactness ratiolh/ls. the hard-to-hard/intermediate state spectral transition is mainly drivenby the increase in the soft photon flux in the corona, rather than smallvariations of the electron heating. this, associated with the increasing of thedisc temperature, is consistent with a disc moving towards the compact objectscenario, i.e. the truncated-disc model. moreover, this scenario is consistentwith the decreasing fractional squared rms and increasing of the noise and qpofrequency. in our final group of observations, we found that the contributionfrom the non-thermal comptonisation to the total power supplied to the plasmais 0.59+0.02/-0.05 and that the thermal electrons cool to kte&lt;26 kev.

0806.3079	revisiting the radio/x-ray flux correlation in the black hole v404 cyg:  from outburst to quiescence	we report results of chandra x-ray and vla radio observations of the galacticaccreting black hole v404 cyg (gs 2023+338) in its quiescent state. v404 cyg isdetected at its faintest level of radio and x-ray emission with a 0.5-10 kevunabsorbed luminosity of 8.3 x 10^32 (d/3.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. the x-ray spectrumfit with an absorbed power-law model yields a photon index of 2.17 +/- 0.13.contrary to previous findings, this clearly indicates that v404 cyg undergoes -like most black holes in quiescence - a softening of its x-ray spectrum at verylow luminosity compared to the standard hard state. the quiescent radioemission is consistent with the presence of self-absorbed compact jets. we havealso reanalyzed archival data from the decay of the 1989 outburst of v404 cygin order to quantify more precisely the correlation between radio and x-rayemission in the hard state of v404 cyg. we show that this correlation extendsover five decades in x-ray flux and holds down to the quiescent state of v404cyg. the index of this correlation (~0.5) may suggest that synchrotronself-compton emission is the dominant physical process at high energy in v404cyg. however, this index is also consistent with scale invariant jet modelscoupled to an inefficiently radiating accretion disc. we discuss the propertiesof the quiescent state of black holes and highlight the fact that some of theirproperties are different from the standard hard state.

1512.09149	absorption lines from magnetically-driven winds in x-ray binaries	high resolution x-ray spectra of black hole x-ray binaries (bhbs) showblueshifted absorption lines from disk winds which seem to be equatorial. windsoccur in the softer (disk-dominated) states of the outburst and are lessprominent or absent in the harder (power-law dominated) states. we useself-similar magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) accretion-ejection models to explainthe disk winds in bhbs. in our models, the density at the base of the outflowfrom the accretion disk is not a free parameter, but is determined by solvingthe full set of dynamical mhd equations. thus the physical properties of theoutflow are controlled by the global structure of the disk. we studieddifferent mhd solutions characterized by different values of (a) the diskaspect ratio ($\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). we use twokinds of mhd solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence(warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. such heating could be from e.g.dissipation of energy due to mhd turbulence in the disk or from illumination.we use each of these mhd solutions to predict the physical parameters of anoutflow; put limits on the ionization parameter ($\xi$), column density andtimescales, motivated by observational results; and thus select regions withinthe outflow which are consistent with the observed winds. the cold mhdsolutions cannot account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. butwarm solutions can explain the observed physical quantities in the wind becausethey can have sufficiently high values of $p$ ($\gtrsim 0.1$, implying largermass loading at the base of the outflow). further from our thermodynamicequilibrium curve analysis for the outflowing gas, we found that in the hardstate a range of $\xi$ is thermodynamically unstable, and had to be excluded.this constrain made it impossible to have any wind at all, in the hard state.

astro-ph;0003460	coupling of the x-ray and radio emission in the black hole candidate a  nd compact jet source gx 339-4	we report the results of a long-term campaign of radio, soft- and hard- x-rayobservations of the galactic black hole candidate gx 339-4. in the low-hardx-ray state the system displays a strong 3-way linear correlation between soft-and hard-x-rays and radio emission, implying a coupling between thecomptonising corona and a radio-emitting compact jet. in this state the radioemission is linearly polarised at a level of around 2 %, with an almostconstant polarisation angle, indicative of a favored axis in this systemprobably related to the compact jet and/or black hole spin axis. in the offx-ray state the radio emission declines with the x-ray emission to belowdetectable levels, suggesting that it is simply a lower-luminosity version ofthe low-hard state. in the high-soft state both the hard-x-ray and radioemission are suppressed. we also note that the transitions from the low-hardstate to the high-soft state (and the reverse) are possibly associated withdiscrete ejection(s) of expanding relativistic plasma.

astro-ph;0301479	modeling the x-ray contribution of x-ray binary jets	astrophysical jets exist in both xrbs and agn, and seem to share commonfeatures, particularly in the radio. while agn jets are known to emit x-rays,the situation for xrb jets is not so clear. radio jets have been resolved inseveral xrbs in the low/hard state, establishing that some form of outflow isroutinely present in this state. interestingly, the flat-to-inverted radiosynchrotron emission associated with these outflows strongly correlates withthe x-ray emission in several sources, suggesting that the jet plasma plays arole at higher frequencies. in this same state, there is increasing evidencefor a turnover in the ir/optical where the flat-to-inverted spectrum seems toconnect to an optically thin component extending into the x-rays. we discusshow jet synchrotron emission is likely to contribute to the x-rays, in additionto inverse compton up-scattering, providing a natural explanation for thesecorrelations and the turnover in the ir/optical band. we present modelparameters for fits to several sources, and address some common misconceptionsabout the jet model.

astro-ph;0409154	on the origin of radio emission in the x-ray states of xte j1650-500  during the 2001-2002 outburst	we report on simultaneous radio and x-ray observations of the black holecandidate xte j1650-500 during the course of its 2001-2002 outburst. thescheduling of the observations allowed us to sample the properties of xtej1650-50 in different x-ray spectral states, namely the hard state, the steeppower-law state and the thermal dominant state, according to the recentspectral classification of mcclintock &amp; remillard. the hard state is consistentwith a compact jet dominating the spectral energy distribution at radiofrequencies; however, the current data suggest that its contribution as directsynchrotron emission at higher energies may not be significant. in that case,xte j1650-50 may be dominated by compton processes (either inversecomptonization of thermal disk photons and/or ssc from the base of the compactjet) in the x-ray regime. we, surprisingly, detect a faint level of radioemission in the thermal dominant state that may be consistent with the emissionof previously ejected material interacting with the interstellar medium,similar (but on a smaller angular scale) to what was observed in xte j1550-564by corbel and co-workers. based on the properties of radio emission in thesteep power-law state of xte j1650-50, and taking into account the behavior ofother black hole candidates (namely gx 339-4, xte j1550-564, and xte j1859+226)while in the intermediate and steep power-law states, we are able to present ageneral pattern of behavior for the origin of radio emission in these twostates that could be important for understanding the accretion-ejectioncoupling very close to the black hole event horizon.

astro-ph;0410353	the 2003 radio outburst of a new x-ray transient: xte j1720-318	we present radio observations of the black hole x-ray transient xtej1720-318, which was discovered in 2003 january as it entered an outburst. weanalyse the radio data in the context of the x-ray outburst and the broad-bandspectrum. an unresolved radio source was detected during the rising phase,reaching a peak of nearly 5 mjy approximately coincident with the peak of thex-ray lightcurve. study of the spectral indices suggests that at least twoejection events took place, the radio-emitting material expanding and becomingoptically thin as it faded. the broad-band spectra suggested that the accretiondisc dominated the emission, as expected for a source in the high/soft state.the radio emission decayed to below the sensitivity of the telescopes for ~6weeks but switched on again during the transition of the x-ray source to thelow/hard state. at least one ``glitch'' was superimposed on the otherwiseexponential decay of the x-ray lightcurve, which was reminiscent of themultiple jet ejections of xte j1859+226. we also present a k_s-band image ofxte j1720-318 and its surrounding field taken with the vlt.

astro-ph;0505526	discovery of x-ray jets in the microquasar h 1743-322	we report on the formation and evolution of two large-scale,synchrotron-emitting jets from the black hole candidate h 1743-322 followingits reactivation in 2003. in november 2003 after the end of its 2003 outburst,we noticed, in observations with the australia telescope compact array, thepresence of a new and variable radio source about 4.6" to the east of h1743-322, that was later found to move away from h 1743-322. in february 2004,we detected a radio source to the west of h 1743-322, symmetrically placedrelative to the eastern jet. in 2004, follow-up x-ray observations with {\emchandra} led to the discovery of x-ray emission associated with the two radiosources. this likely indicates that we are witnessing the interaction ofrelativistic jets from h 1743-322 with the interstellar medium causing in-situparticle acceleration. the spectral energy distribution of the jets during thedecay phase is consistent with a classical synchrotron spectrum of a singleelectron distribution from radio up to x-rays, implying the production of veryhigh energy ($&gt;$ 10 tev) particles in those jets. we discuss the jetkinematics, highlighting the presence of a significantly relativistic flow in h1743-322 almost a year after the ejection event.

astro-ph;0509870	on the origin of black hole x-ray emission in quiescence: chandra  observations of xte j1550-564 and h 1743-322	we report the results of observations of the black hole binaries xtej1550-564 and h 1743-322 in their quiescent state using the chandra x-rayobservatory. both sources are detected at their faintest level of x-rayemission ever observed with a 0.5-10 kev unabsorbed luminosity of 2 $\times$10$^{32}$ (d/5 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ for xte j1550-564 and 9 $\times$ 10$^{31}$(d/8 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ for h 1743-322. these luminosities are in the upperrange compared to the faintest levels observed in other black hole systems,possibly related to residual accretion for these sources with frequentoutbursts. for xte j1550-564, the chandra observations also constrain the x-rayspectrum as a fit with an absorbed power-law model yields a photon index of2.25 $\pm$ 0.08, clearly indicating a softening of the x-ray spectrum at lowerluminosities compared to the standard hard state. similar softening at lowluminosity is seen for several black hole transients with orbital periods lessthan 60 hours. most of the current models of accreting black holes are able toreproduce such softening in quiescence. in contrast, we find that systems withorbital periods longer than 60 hours appear to have hard spectra in quiescenceand their behaviour may be consistent with hardening in quiescence.

astro-ph;0511429	integral and xmm-newton observations of the x-ray pulsar igr  j16320-4751/ax j1631.9-4752	we report on observations of the x-ray pulsar igr j16320-4751 (a.k.a. axj1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with integral and xmm-newton. we refinethe source position and identify the most likely infrared counterpart. oursimultaneous coverage allows us to confirm the presence of x-ray pulsations at~1300 s, that we detect above 20 kev with integral for the first time. thepulse fraction is consistent with being constant with energy, which iscompatible with a model of polar accretion by a pulsar. we study the spectralproperties of igr j16320-4751 during two major periods occurring during thesimultaneous coverage with both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flareperiod. we detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 kev iron line in both periods.the presence of such a feature is typical of supergiant wind accretors such asvela x-1 or gx 301-2. we inspect the spectral variations with respect to thepulse phase during the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely dueto variations of the x-ray flux emitted by the source and not to variations ofthe spectral parameters.  our results are therefore compatible with the source being a pulsar in a highmass x-ray binary. we detect a soft excess appearing in the spectra as ablackbody with a temperature of ~0.07 kev. we discuss the origin of the x-rayemission in igr j16320-4751: while the hard x-rays are likely the result ofcompton emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar, based on energyargument we suggest that the soft excess is likely the emission by acollisionally energised cloud in which the compact object is embedded.

astro-ph;0512387	the galactic black hole transient h1743-322 during outburst decay:  connections between timing noise, state transitions and radio emission	multi-wavelength observations of galactic black hole transients duringoutburst decay are instrumental for our understanding of the accretion geometryand the formation of outflows around black hole systems. h1743-322, a blackhole transient observed intensely in x-rays and also covered in the radio bandduring its 2003 decay, provides clues about the changes in accretion geometryduring state transitions and also the general properties of x-ray emissionduring the intermediate and the low-hard states. in this work, we report on theevolution of spectral and temporal properties in x-rays and the flux in theradio band with the goal of understanding the nature of state transitionsobserved in this source. we concentrate on the transition from the thermaldominant state to the intermediate state that occurs on a timescale of one day.we show that the state transition is associated with a sudden increase inpower-law flux. we determine that the ratio of the power-law flux to theoverall flux in the 3--25 kev band must exceed 0.6 to observe strong timingnoise. even after the state transition, once this ratio was below 0.6, thesystem transited back to the thermal dominant state for a day. we show that theemission from the compact radio core does not turn on during the transitionfrom the thermal dominant state to the intermediate state but does turn on whenthe source reaches the low-hard state, as seen in 4u 1543-47 and gx 339-4. wefind that the photon index correlates strongly with the qpo frequency andanti-correlates with the rms amplitude of variability. we also show that thevariability is more likely to be associated with the power-law emission thanthe disk emission.

astro-ph;0611064	hard x-ray emission of the microquasar gx 339-4 in the low/hard state	we present the analysis of the high energy emission of the galactic blackhole binary gx 339-4 in a low/hard state at the beginning of its 2004 outburst.the data from 273 ks of integral observations, spread over 4 weeks, areanalyzed, along with the existing simultaneous rxte hexte and pca data. duringthis period, the flux increases by a factor of about 3, while the spectralshape is quite unchanged, at least up to 150 kev. the high energy data allowsus to detect the presence of a high energy cut-off, generally related tothermal mechanisms, and to estimate the plasma parameters in the framework ofthe comptonization models. we found an electron temperature of 60-70 kev, anoptical depth around 2.5, with a rather low reflection factor (0.2-0.4). in thelast observation, we detected a high energy excess above 200 kev with respectto thermal comptonization while at lower energy, the spectrum is practicallyidentical to the previous one, taken just 2 days before. this suggests that thelow and high energy components have a different origin.

astro-ph;0612575	simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the low/hard state of the  x-ray transient source swift j1753.5-0127	we report the results of simultaneous multiwavelength observations of thex-ray transient source swift j1753.5-0127 performed with integral, rxte, ntt,rem and vla on 2005 august 10-12. the source, which underwent an x-ray outburstsince 2005 may 30, was observed during the integral target of opportunityprogram dedicated to new x-ray novae located in the galactic halo. broad-bandspectra and fast timing variability properties of swift j1753.5-0127 areanalyzed together with the optical, near infra-red and radio data. we show thatthe source was significantly detected up to 600 kev with comptonizationparameters and timing properties typical of the so-called low/hard state ofblack hole candidates. we build a spectral energy distribution and we show thatswift j1753.5-0127 does not follow the usual radio/x-ray correlation of x-raybinaries in the low/hard state. we give estimates of distance and mass. weconclude that swift j1753.5-0127 belongs to the x-ray nova class and that it islikely a black hole candidate transient source of the galactic halo whichremained in the low/hard state during its main outburst. we discuss our resultswithin the context of comptonization and jet models.

astro-ph;9812160	multiwavelength observations of gx 339-4 in 1996. i. daily light curves  and x-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopy	as part of our multiwavelength campaign of gx 339-4 observations in 1996 wepresent our radio, x-ray, and gamma-ray observations made in july, when thesource was in a hard state (= soft x-ray low state). the radio observationswere made at the time when there was a possible radio jet. we show that theradio spectrum was flat and significantly variable, and that the radio spectralshape and amplitude at this time were not anomalous for this source. dailylight curves from our pointed observation july 9-23 using osse, from batse, andfrom the asm on rxte also show that there was no significant change in the x-and gamma-ray flux or hardness during the time the possible radio jet-likefeature was seen. the higher energy portion of our pointed rxte observationmade july 26 can be equally well fit using simple power law times exponential(ple) and sunyaev-titarchuk (st) functions. an additional soft component isrequired, as well as a broad emission feature centered on 6.4 kev. this may bean iron line that is broadened by orbital doppler motions and/or scattering offa hot medium. its equivalent width is 600 ev. our simplistic continuum fittingdoes not require an extra reflection component. both a ple and a st model alsofit our osse spectrum on its own. although the observations are not quitesimultaneous, combining the rxte and cgro spectra we find that the ple modeleasily fits the joint spectrum. however, the st model drops off too rapidlywith increasing energies to give an acceptable joint fit.
