0901.1346	high-energy particle acceleration at the radio-lobe shock of centaurus a	we present new results on the shock around the southwest radio lobe ofcentaurus a using data from the chandra very large programme observations. thex-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobeis well described by a single power-law model with galactic absorption --thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to thenucleus. we conclude that a significant fraction of the x-ray emission aroundthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. we infer that inthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, theinflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to x-ray synchrotron emittingenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as sn1006. this interpretationresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for thisemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required tobe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. we estimate thatthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughlymach 8 relative to the ambient medium. we discuss the spatial variation ofspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observationsconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongestpart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shockacceleration theory. finally, we consider the implications of these results forthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) and tev emission fromcentaurus a, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be asignificant source of uhecrs, but that tev emission from this region isexpected at levels comparable to current limits at tev energies, for plausibleassumed magnetic field strengths.

0903.2663	the jet-heated x-ray filament in the centaurus a northern middle radio  lobe	we present results from a 40 ks {\em xmm-newton} observation of the x-rayfilament coincident with the southeast edge of the centaurus a northern middleradio lobe (nml). we find that the x-ray filament consists of five spatiallyresolved x-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. the spectrum ofeach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from0.3-0.7 kev and subsolar elemental abundances. in four of the five knots,non-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling outsynchrotron or ic/cmb mechanisms for their emission. the internal pressures ofthe knots exceed that of the ambient ism or the equipartition pressure of thenml by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be shortlived ($\sim3\times10^6$ yrs). based on energetic arguments, it is implausiblethat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galacticnucleus of cen a or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation ofthe nml. in our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the x-rayknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a directinteraction with the jet. the lifetimes of the x-ray knots in the nml areroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the sw inner lobe,suggesting they were created in the same agn outburst. the most plausible modelof the nml is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is beingre-energized by the current outburst. we also report the discovery of a largescale (at least 35 kpc radius) gas halo around cen a.

0906.5364	luminosity functions of lmxbs in centaurus a: globular clusters versus  the field	we study the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxb) in the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a, concentrating primarily ontwo aspects of binary populations: the xlf behavior at the low luminosity limitand comparison between globular cluster and field sources. the 800 ksecexposure of the deep chandra vlp program allows us to reach a limitingluminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.we confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall lmxb xlf atlog(l_x)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constantdn/d(ln l). separating globular cluster and field sources, we find astatistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributionswith a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular clusterpopulation. this demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parentpopulations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire lmxb population inearly type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. as a plausibleexplanation for this difference in the xlfs, we suggest that there is anenhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which arecreated in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. due to the 4 timeshigher ionization temperature of he, such systems are subject to accretion diskinstabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, andtherefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.

0909.3776	gas entropy in a representative sample of nearby x-ray galaxy clusters  (rexcess): relationship to gas mass fraction	(abridged) we examine the radial entropy distribution and its scaling using31 nearby galaxy clusters from the representative xmm-newton cluster structuresurvey (rexcess). the entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out tor_1000 in all systems and out to r_500 in 13 systems. compared to theoreticalexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependentexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower masssystems. at r_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligiblewithin the uncertainties. mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropyis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,becoming consistent with self-similar at r_500. the dispersion in scaledentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores anddynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of twoand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. parameterising the profileswith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropyk_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skeweddistribution. the outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; theirdistribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98. renormalising thedimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile f_gas(&lt; r),leads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fractionvariations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropyproperties. we discuss a tentative scenario to explain the behaviour of theentropy and gas mass fraction in the rexcess sample, in which extra heating andmerger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority ofthe population, and a smaller fraction of systems develops a cool core.

0910.1234	the universal galaxy cluster pressure profile from a representative  sample of nearby systems (rexcess) and the y_sz-m_500 relation	(abridged) we investigate the regularity of cluster pressure profiles withrexcess, a representative sample of 33 local clusters observed with xmm-newton.the sample spans a mass range of 10^14 m_sun &lt;m_500&lt;10^15 m_sun. we derive anaverage profile from observations scaled by mass and z according to thestandard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about the mean isremarkably low beyond 0.2r_500, but increases towards the centre. deviationsabout the mean are related to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state ofthe cluster. unrelaxed systems have systematically shallower profiles whilecooling core systems are more concentrated. the scaled profiles exhibit aresidual mass dependence with a slope of about 0.12; however, the departurefrom standard scaling decreases with radius and is consistent with zero atr_500. the scatter in the core and departure from self-similar mass scaling issmaller compared to that of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure isthe quantity least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics.comparison with several state of the art numerical simulations shows goodagreement outside the core. combining the observational data below r_500 withsimulation data above, we derive the universal pressure profile, that, in ananalytical form, defines the physical pressure profile of clusters as afunction of mass and z up to the cluster 'boundary'. using this profile and theobserved pressure profiles, we investigate the scaling properties of theintegrated compton parameter y, considering both the spherically integratedquantity and the cylindrically integrated quantity, directly related to thesunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect signal. we further derive the expectedy_sz-m_500 and y_sz-l_x relations for any aperture.

0707.2154	x-ray nuclei in radio galaxies: exploring the roles of hot and cold gas  accretion	we present results from chandra and xmm-newton spectroscopic observations ofthe nuclei of z&lt;0.5 radio galaxies and quasars from the 3crr catalog, andexamine in detail the dichotomy in the properties of low- and high-excitationradio galaxies. the x-ray spectra of low-excitation sources (those with weak orabsent optical emission lines) are dominated by unabsorbed emission from aparsec-scale jet, with no contribution from accretion-related emission. thesesources show no evidence for an obscuring torus, and are likely to accrete in aradiatively inefficient manner. high-excitation sources (those with prominentoptical emission lines), on the other hand, show a significant contributionfrom a radiatively efficient accretion disk, which is heavily absorbed in thex-ray when they are oriented close to edge-on with respect to the observer.however, the low-excitation/high-excitation division does not correspond to thefri/frii division: thus the fanaroff-riley dichotomy remains a consequence ofthe interaction between the jet and the hot-gas environment through which itpropagates. finally, we suggest that accretion of the hot phase of the igm issufficient to power all low-excitation radio sources, while high-excitationsources require an additional contribution from cold gas that in turn forms thecold disk and torus. this model explains a number of properties of theradio-loud active galaxy population, and has important implications for agnfeedback mechanisms.

0911.2115	long term monitoring of the dynamics and particle acceleration of knots  in the jet of centaurus a	we present new and archival multi-frequency radio and x-ray data forcentaurus a obtained over almost 20 years at the vla and with chandra, withwhich we measure the x-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, fluxdensity variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and propermotions. we compare the observed properties with current knot formation modelsand particle acceleration mechanisms. we rule out impulsive particleacceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect thesame population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence ofextreme variability in the x-ray knots. we find the most likely mechanism forall the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed bya steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and x-ray synchrotronemission. in this scenario, the x-ray-only knots have radio counterparts thatare too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shockswhere no particles are accelerated to x-ray emitting energies. although thebase knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of amoving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots arehard to explain in this model. we detect apparent motion in three knots;however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for oragainst a faster moving `spine' within the jet. the radio-only knots, bothstationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

0911.2798	brightest cluster galaxies and core gas density in rexcess clusters	we investigate the relationship between brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) andtheir host clusters using a sample of nearby galaxy clusters from therepresentative xmm cluster structure survey (rexcess). the sample was imagedwith the southern observatory for astrophysical research (soar) in r band toinvestigate the mass of the old stellar population. using a metric radius of12h^-1 kpc, we found that the bcg luminosity depends weakly on overall clustermass as l_bcg \propto m_cl^0.18+-0.07, consistent with previous work. we foundthat 90% of the bcgs are located within 0.035 r_500 of the peak of the x-rayemission, including all of the cool core (cc) clusters. we also found anunexpected correlation between the bcg metric luminosity and the core gasdensity for non-cool core (non-cc) clusters, following a power law of n_e\propto l_bcg^2.7+-0.4 (where n_e is measured at 0.008 r_500). the correlationis not easily explained by star formation (which is weak in non-cc clusters) oroverall cluster mass (which is not correlated with core gas density). the trendpersists even when the bcg is not located near the peak of the x-ray emission,so proximity is not necessary. we suggest that, for non-cc clusters, thiscorrelation implies that the same process that sets the central entropy of thecluster gas also determines the central stellar density of the bcg, and thatthis underlying physical process is likely to be mergers.

0707.2865	a chandra study of particle acceleration in the multiple hotspots of  nearby radio galaxies	we present chandra observations of a small sample of nearby classical doubleradio galaxies which have more than one radio hotspot in at least one of theirlobes. the x-ray emission from the hotspots of these comparatively low-powerobjects is expected to be synchrotron in origin, and therefore to provideinformation about the locations of high-energy particle acceleration. in somemodels of the relationship between the jet and hotspot the hotspots that arenot the current jet termination point should be detached from the energy supplyfrom the active nucleus and therefore not capable of accelerating particles tohigh energies. we find that in fact some secondary hotspots are x-ray sources,and thus probably locations for high-energy particle acceleration after theinitial jet termination shock. in detail, though, we show that the spatialstructures seen in x-ray are not consistent with naive expectations from asimple shock model: the current locations of the acceleration of thehighest-energy observable particles in powerful radio galaxies need not becoincident with the peaks of radio or even optical emission.

0912.4354	a multiwavelength study of a young, z-shaped, fr i radio galaxy ngc 3801	we present preliminary results from a multi-wavelength study of a mergercandidate, ngc3801, hosting a young fr i radio galaxy, with a z-shapedstructure. analysing archival data from the vla, we find two hi emission blobson either side of the host galaxy, suggesting a 30 kpc sized rotating gas diskaligned with stellar rotation, but rotating significantly faster than thestars. broad, faint, blue-shifted absorption wing and an hi absorption clumpassociated with the shocked shell around the eastern lobe are also seen,possibly due to an jet-driven outflow. while 8.0 um dust and pah emission, fromspitzer and near and far uv emission from galex is seen on a large scale in ans-shape, partially coinciding with the hi emission blobs, it reveals a ~2 kpcradius ring-like, dusty, starforming structure in the nuclear region,orthogonal to the radio jet axis. its similarities with kinematically decoupledcore galaxies and other evidences have been argued for a merger origin of thisyoung, bent jet radio galaxy.

0912.4667	substructure of the galaxy clusters in the rexcess sample: observed  statistics and comparison to numerical simulations	we study the substructure statistics of a representative sample of galaxyclusters by means of two currently popular substructure characterisationmethods, power ratios and centroid shifts. we use the 31 clusters from therexcess sample, compiled from the southern rosat all-sky cluster survey reflexwith a morphologically unbiased selection in x-ray luminosity and redshift, allof which have been reobserved with xmm-newton. we investigate the uncertaintiesof the substructure parameters and examine the dependence of the results onprojection effects, finding that the uncertainties of the parameters can bequite substantial. thus while the quantification of the dynamical state ofindividual clusters with these parameters should be treated with extremecaution, these substructure measures provide powerful statistical tools tocharacterise trends of properties in large cluster samples. the centre shiftparameter, w, is found to be more sensitive in general. for the rexcess sampleneither the occurence of substructure nor the presence of cool cores depends oncluster mass. there is a significant anti-correlation between the existence ofsubstantial substructure and cool cores. the simulated clusters show on averagelarger substructure parameters than the observed clusters, a trend that istraced to the fact that cool regions are more pronounced in the simulatedclusters, leading to stronger substructure measures in merging clusters andclusters with offset cores. moreover, the frequency of cool regions is higherin the simulations than in the observations, implying that the description ofthe physical processes shaping cluster formation in the simulations requiresfurther improvement.

1001.4742	searching for the inverse-compton emission from bright cluster-centre  radio galaxies	we use deep archival chandra and xmm-newton observations of three of thebrightest cluster-centre radio galaxies in the sky, cygnus a, hercules a andhydra a, to search for inverse-compton emission from the population ofelectrons responsible for the low-frequency radio emission. using simulatedobservations, we derive robust estimates for the uncertainties on thenormalization of an inverse-compton component in the presence of the variationsin background thermal temperature actually seen in our target objects. usingthese, together with the pressures external to the lobes, we are able to placeinteresting upper limits on the fraction of the energy density in the lobes ofhydra a and her a that can be provided by a population of relativisticelectrons with standard properties, assuming that the magnetic field is notdominant; these limits are consistent with the long-standing idea that theenergy density in these lobes is dominated by a non-radiating particlepopulation. in cygnus a, we find evidence in the spectra for an additional hardcomponent over and above the expected thermal emission, which is plausibly adetection of inverse-compton emission; even in this case, though, someadditional non-radiating particles and/or a departure from our standardassumptions on the electron spectrum are necessary to allow pressure balance atthe mid-point of the lobes. as this is not the case in other fanaroff-rileyclass ii radio galaxies, we suggest that the rich environment of cygnus a mayhave some effect on its lobe particle content.

1009.0702	parsec-scale imaging of the radio-bubble seyfert galaxy ngc 6764	we have observed the composite active galactic nucleus (agn)-starburst galaxyngc 6764 with the very long baseline array at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz. theseobservations have detected a "core-jet" structure and a possible weakcounterjet component at 1.6 ghz. the upper limits to the core and jet (1.6-4.9ghz) spectral index are 0.6 and 0.3, respectively. taken together with the highbrightness temperature of ~10^7 k for the core region, the radio emissionappears to be coming from a synchrotron jet. at a position angle of 25 degrees,the parsec-scale jet seems to be pointing closely toward the western edge ofthe southern kpc-scale bubble in ngc 6764. a real connection between theparsec- and sub-kpc-scale emission would not only suggest the presence of acurved jet, but also a close link between the agn jet and the radio bubbles inngc 6764. we demonstrate that a precessing jet model can explain the radiomorphology from parsec- to sub-kpc scales, and the model best-fit parameters ofjet speed and orientation are fully consistent with the observedjet-to-counterjet surface brightness ratio. the jet however appears to bedisrupted on scales of hundreds of parsecs, possibly due to interaction withand entrainment of the interstellar medium gas, which subsequently leads to theformation of bubbles. the jet energetics in ngc 6764 suggest that it would take12-21 myr to inflate the (southern) bubble. this timescale corresponds roughlyto the starburst episode that took place in ngc 6764 about 15-50 myr ago, andcould be indicative of a close connection between jet formation and thestarburst activity in this galaxy.

1108.0558	the entrainment-limited evolution of fr ii sources: maximum sizes and a  possible connection to fr is	we construct a simple theoretical model to investigate how entrainmentgradually erodes high-speed fr ii jets. this process is described by embeddinga mixing-layer model developed originally to describe fr i objects in aself-similar model for the lobe structure of classical fr ii sources. followingthe classical fr ii models, we assume that the lobe is dominated by theparticles injected from the central jet. the entrainment produces a boundaryshear layer which acts at the interface between the dense central jet and theless denser surrounding lobe, and the associated erosion of the jet placesinteresting limits on the maximum size of fr ii sources. the model shows thatthis limit depends mainly on the initial bulk velocity of the relativistic jettriggered. the bulk velocities of fr iis suggested by our model are in goodagreement with that obtained from direct pc-scale observations on ordinaryradio galaxies and quasars. finally, we discuss how fr iis may evolve into fris upon reaching their maximum, entrainment-limited sizes.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

1303.1533	challenges to our understanding of radio relics: x-ray observations of  the toothbrush cluster	the cluster 1rxs j0603.3+4214 is a merging galaxy cluster that hosts threeradio relics and a giant radio halo. the northern relic, the toothbrush, is1.9-mpc long and has an unusual linear morphology. according to simplediffusive shock acceleration theory, its radio spectral index indicates a machnumber of 3.3-4.6. here, we present results from a deep xmm-newton observationof the cluster. we observe two distinct cluster cores that have survived themerger. the presence of three shocks at or near the locations of the radiorelics is confirmed by density and temperature discontinuities. however, theobservation poses several puzzles that challenge our understanding of radiorelics: (i) at the toothbrush, the shock mach number is not larger than 2, inapparent conflict with the shock strength predicted from the radio spectrum;(ii) at the toothbrush, the shock front is, in part, spatially offset from theradio emission; (iii) at the eastern relic, we detect a temperature jumpcorresponding to a mach number of approximately 2.5, but there is no associatedsurface brightness discontinuity. we discuss possible explanations for thesefindings.

1306.2319	the hot and energetic universe: the evolution of galaxy groups and  clusters	major astrophysical questions related to the formation and evolution ofstructures, and more specifically of galaxy groups and clusters, will still beopen in the coming decade and beyond: what is the interplay of galaxy,supermassive black hole, and intergalactic gas evolution in the most massiveobjects in the universe - galaxy groups and clusters? what are the processesdriving the evolution of chemical enrichment of the hot diffuse gas inlarge-scale structures? how and when did the first galaxy groups in theuniverse, massive enough to bind more than 10^7 k gas, form? focussing on theperiod when groups and clusters assembled (0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5), we show that, due to thecontinuum and line emission of this hot intergalactic gas at x-ray wavelengths,athena+, combining high sensitivity with excellent spectral and spatialresolution, will deliver breakthrough observations in view of theaforementioned issues. indeed, the physical and chemical properties of the hotintra-cluster gas, and their evolution across time, are a key to understand theco-evolution of galaxy and supermassive black hole within their environments.

1306.2322	the hot and energetic universe: the astrophysics of galaxy groups and  clusters	as the nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies trace the large-scaledistribution of matter in the universe. they are thus privileged sites in whichto investigate the complex physics of structure formation. however, thecomplete story of how these structures grow, and how they dissipate thegravitational and non-thermal components of their energy budget over cosmictime, is still beyond our grasp. fundamental questions such as how do hotdiffuse baryons accrete and dynamically evolve in dark matter potentials? howand when was the energy that we observe in the icm generated and distributed?where and when are heavy elements produced and how are they circulated? arestill unanswered. most of the cluster baryons exists in the form of a diffuse,hot, metal-enriched plasma that radiates primarily in the x-ray band (theintracluster medium, icm), allowing the x-ray observations of the evolvingcluster population to provide a unique opportunity to address these topics.athena+ with its large collecting area and unprecedented combination of highspectral and angular resolution offers the only way to make major advances inanswering these questions. athena+ will show how the baryonic gas evolves inthe dark matter potential wells by studying the motions and turbulence in theicm. athena+ will be able to resolve the accreting region both spatially andspectroscopically, probing the true nature and physical state of the x-rayemitting plasma. athena+ has the capabilities to permit a definitiveunderstanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structurethrough the study of the cluster population.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

0801.3430	galaxy-cluster gas-density distributions of the representative  xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess)	we present a study of the structural and scaling properties of the gasdistributions in the intracluster medium (icm) of 31 nearby (z &lt; 0.2) clustersobserved with xmm-newton, which together comprise the representative xmm-newtoncluster structure survey (rexcess). in contrast to previous studies, thissample is unbiased with respect to cluster dynamical state, and it fullysamples the cluster x-ray luminosity function. the clusters cover a temperaturerange of 2.0 -- 8.5 kev and possess a variety of morphologies. the samplingstrategy allows us to compare clusters with a wide range of central coolingtimes on an equal footing. we present non-parametric gas-density profiles outto distances ranging between 0.8 r_500 and 1.5 r_500. the central gas densitiesdiffer greatly from system to system, with no clear correlation with systemtemperature. at intermediate radii the scaled density profiles show much lessscatter, with a clear dependence on system temperature, consistent with thepresence of an entropy excess as suggested in previous literature. however, atlarge scaled radii this dependence becomes weaker: clusters with kt &gt; 3 kevscale self-similarly, with no temperature dependence of gas-densitynormalisation. we find some evidence of a correlation between dynamical stateand outer gas density slope, and between dynamical state and both central gasnormalisation and cooling time. we find no evidence of a significant bimodalityin the distributions of central density, density gradient, or cooling time.finally, we present the gas mass-temperature relation for the rexcess sample,which is consistent with the expectation of self-similar scaling modified bythe presence of an entropy excess in the inner regions of the cluster, and hasa logarithmic intrinsic scatter of ~10%.

1309.1394	rejuvenated radio galaxies j0041+3224 and j1835+6204: how long can the  quiescent phase of nuclear activity last?	we present radio observations of two well-known double-double radio galaxies,j0041+3224 and j1835+6204, at frequencies ranging from 150 to 8460 mhz, usingboth the giant metrewave radio telescope and the very large array. theseobservations, over a large radio frequency range, enable us to determine thespectra of the inner and outer lobes. our detailed spectral ageing analysis oftheir inner and outer lobes demonstrates that the outer doubles ofdouble-double radio galaxies are created by the previous cycle of activity,while the inner doubles are due to the present cycle of activity. the (coresubtracted) spectra of the inner doubles of both sources are power laws over alarge frequency range. we found that the duration of the quiescent phase ofj0041+3224 is between 4 and 28 per cent of the active phase of the previousactivity. the outer north-western lobe of j1835+6204 has a compact hotspot andthe regions of both the outer hotspots have close to power-law (rather thancurved) spectra, which indicates that the outer lobes are still fed by jetmaterial ejected in the previous episode just before the central engine stoppedpowering the jet. we estimate that the duration of the quiescent phase ofj1835+6204 is $\lapp$5 per cent of the duration of the active phase of theprevious activity. therefore, we conclude that the duration of the quiescentphase can be as short as a few per cent of the active phase in radio galaxiesof this type.

1309.1397	episodic radio galaxies j0116$-$4722 and j1158+2621: can we constrain  the quiescent phase of nuclear activity?	we present multifrequency radio observations of two well known episodicfr\,ii radio galaxies (j0116$-$4722 and j1158+2621) and a detailedinvestigation of the life-cycle of episodic radio galaxies from their spectraland radiative properties. combining our previous work with the present results,we either constrain or place very good limits on the active and quiescentphases of a small sample of episodic fr\,ii radio galaxies. the duration of thequiescent phase can be as small as the hotspot fading time of the previousepisode, and as high as a few tens of myr; however, for none of the sources inour sample is it close to the duration of the active phase of the previousepisode. we also find that for many episodic radio galaxies, the nucleus isvariable at radio wavelengths. for our small sample of 7 episodic radiogalaxies, we find 4 to have strongly variable cores, a much larger proportionthan is generally found in samples of normal fr\,ii radio galaxies. studieswith larger samples will be required to establish a statistical associationbetween core variability and episodic radio activity.

1312.5183	the particle content of low-power radio galaxies in groups and clusters	the synchrotron-radiating particles and magnetic fields in low-power radiogalaxies (including most nearby cluster-centre sources), if at equipartition,can provide only a small fraction of the total internal energy density of theradio lobes or plumes, which is now well constrained via x-ray observations oftheir external environments. we consider the constraints on models for thedominant energy contribution in low-power radio-galaxy lobes obtained from adetailed comparison of how the internal equipartition pressure and externalpressure measured from x-ray observations evolve with distance for two radiogalaxies, 3c 31 and hydra a. we rule out relativistic-lepton dominance of theradio lobes, and conclude that models in which magnetic field or relativisticprotons/ions carried up the jet dominate lobe energetics are unlikely. finally,we argue that entrainment of material from the jet surroundings can provide thenecessary pressure, and construct a simple self-consistent model of theevolution of the entrainment rate required for pressure balance along the100-kpc scale plumes of 3c 31. such a model requires that the entrainedmaterial is heated to temperatures substantially above that of the surroundingintra-group or cluster medium, and that the temperature of the thermalcomponent of the jet increases with distance, though remainingsub-relativistic.

1402.1770	an x-ray survey of the 2jy sample. i: is there an accretion mode  dichotomy in radio-loud agn?	we carry out a systematic study of the x-ray emission from the active nucleiof the 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.7 2jy sample, using chandra and xmm-newton observations. wecombine our results with those from mid-ir, optical emission line and radioobservations, and add them to those of the 3crr sources. we show that thelow-excitation objects in our samples \redit{show signs} of radiativelyinefficient accretion. we study the effect of the jet-related emission on thevarious luminosities, confirming that it is the main source of soft x-rayemission for our sources. we also find strong correlations between theaccretion-related luminosities, and identify several sources whose opticalclassification is incompatible with their accretion properties. we derive thebolometric and jet kinetic luminosities for the samples and find a differencein the total eddington rate between the low and high-excitation populations,with the former peaking at ~1 per cent and the latter at ~20 per centeddington. our results are consistent with a simple eddington switch when theeffects of environment on radio luminosity and black hole mass calculations areconsidered. the apparent independence of jet kinetic power and radiativeluminosity in the high-excitation population in our plots supports a model inwhich jet production and radiatively efficient accretion are not stronglycorrelated in high-excitation objects, though they have a common underlyingmechanism.

1402.7174	vlba observations of mrk 6: probing the jet-lobe connection	we present the results of high resolution vlbi observations at 1.6 and 4.9ghz of the radio-loud seyfert galaxy, mrk 6. these observations are able todetect a compact radio core in this galaxy for the first time. the core has aninverted spectral index ($\alpha^{1.6}_{4.9}$=+1.0$\pm$0.2) and a brightnesstemperature of $1\times10^8$ k. three distinct radio components which resemblejet elements and/or hot spots, are also detected. the position angles of theseelongated jet elements point, not only to a curved jet in mrk 6, but alsotowards a connection between the agn and the kpc-scale radio lobes/bubbles inthis galaxy. firmer constraints on the star formation rate provided by newherschel observations (sfr $&lt;0.8$ m$_\sun$ yr$^{-1}$) make the starburst-windpowered bubble scenario implausible. from plasma speeds obtained via priorchandra x-ray observations, and ram pressure balance arguments for the ism andradio bubbles, the north-south bubbles are expected to take $7.5\times10^6$ yrto form, and the east-west bubbles $1.4\times10^6$ yr. we suggest that the jetaxis has changed at least once in mrk 6 within the last $\approx10^7$ yr. acomparison of the nuclear radio-loudness of mrk 6 and a small sample of seyfertgalaxies with a subset of low-luminosity fri radio galaxies reveals a continuumin radio properties.

0802.4297	an xmm-newton study of the environments, particle content and impact of  low-power radio galaxies	we present a detailed study of the environments of a sample of nine low-powerradio galaxies, based on new and archival xmm-newton observations. we reportnew detections of group-scale environments around three radio galaxies, 3c 296,ngc 1044 and 3c 76.1. as with previous studies, we find that fr-i radiogalaxies inhabit group environments ranging over nearly two orders of magnitudein bolometric x-ray luminosity, but find no evidence for a tight relationshipbetween large-scale x-ray environment and radio-source properties such as size,radio luminosity, and axial ratio. we confirm earlier work showing thatequipartition internal pressures are typically lower than the externalpressures acting on the radio lobes, so that additional non-radiating particlesmust be present or the lobes must be magnetically dominated. we present thefirst direct observational evidence that entrainment may provide this missingpressure, in the form of a relationship between radio-source structure andapparent pressure imbalance. finally, our study provides further support forthe presence of an apparent temperature excess in radio-loud groups compared tothe group population as a whole. for five of eight temperature excesses, theenergy required to inflate the radio lobes is comparable to the energy requiredto produce this excess by heating of the group gas; however, in three cases thecurrent radio source appears too weak to produce the temperature excess. itremains unclear whether the temperature excess can be directly associated withthe current phase of agn activity, or whether it is instead either a signatureof previous agn activity or simply an indicator of the particular set of groupproperties most conducive to the growth of an fr-i radio galaxy.

0803.3595	evidence for non-hydrostatic gas motions in the hot ism of centaurus a	we present preliminary results from a deep (600 ks) {\em chandra} observationof the hot interstellar medium of the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a (cena). we find a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas $\sim$3.5 kpc fromthe nucleus spanning a 120$^\circ$ arc. the temperature of the gas is0.60$\pm$0.05 and 0.68$\pm$0.10 kev, interior and exterior to thediscontinuity, respectively. the elemental abundance is poorly constrained bythe spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity,there is a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. thiswould imply that the gas is moving at 470$\pm$100 km s$^{-1}$, or mach1.0$\pm$0.2 (1.2$\pm$0.2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external(internal) to the discontinuity. alternatively, pressure balance could bemaintained if there is a large (factor of $\sim$7) discontinuity in theelemental abundance. we suggest that the observed discontinuity is the resultof non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i.e. sloshing) due to the recentmerger. in this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients areimportant in the visibility of the discontinuity. cen a is in the late stagesof merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in densityand abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the twogalaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after themerger. the pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on thetemporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. the jet could have decollimatedcrossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

1510.08392	deep chandra observations of pictor a	we report on deep chandra observations of the nearby broad-line radio galaxypictor a, which we combine with new australia telescope compact array (atca)observations. the new x-ray data have a factor 4 more exposure thanobservations previously presented and span a 15-year time baseline, allowing adetailed study of the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of the agn,jet, hotspot and lobes. we present evidence for further time variation of thejet, though the flare that we reported in previous work remains the mostsignificantly detected time-varying feature. we also confirm previous tentativeevidence for a faint counterjet. based on the radio through x-ray spectrum ofthe jet and its detailed spatial structure, and on the properties of thecounterjet, we argue that inverse-compton models can be conclusively rejected,and propose that the x-ray emission from the jet is synchrotron emission fromparticles accelerated in the boundary layer of a relativistic jet. for thefirst time, we find evidence that the bright western hotspot is alsotime-varying in x-rays, and we connect this to the small-scale structure in thehotspot seen in high-resolution radio observations. the new data allow us toconfirm that the spectrum of the lobes is in good agreement with thepredictions of an inverse-compton model and we show that the data favour modelsin which the filaments seen in the radio images are predominantly the result ofspatial variation of magnetic fields in the presence of a relatively uniformelectron distribution.

0807.4136	chandra evidence for agn feedback in the spiral galaxy ngc 6764	we report the chandra detection of x-ray emission spatially coincident withthe kpc-scale radio bubbles in the nearby (d_l ~ 31 mpc) agn-starburst galaxyngc 6764. the x-ray emission originates in hot gas (kt ~ 0.75 kev), which mayeither be contained within the radio bubbles, or in a shell of hot gassurrounding them. we consider three models for the origin of the hot gas: (1) astarburst-driven galactic wind, (2) shocked gas associated with the expandingradio bubbles, and (3) gas heated and entrained into the bubbles by jet/isminteractions in the inner agn outflow. we rule out a galactic wind based onsignificant differences from known galactic wind systems. the tightcorrespondence between the brightest x-ray emission and the radio emission inthe inner outflow from the seyfert nucleus, as well as a correlation betweenx-ray and radio spectral features suggestive of shocks and particleacceleration, lead us to favour the third model; however, we cannot firmly ruleout a model in which the bubbles are driving large-scale shocks into the galaxyism. in either agn-driven heating scenario, the total energy stored in the hotgas is high, ~10^56 ergs, comparable to the energetic impact of low-power radiogalaxies such as centaurus a, and will have a dramatic impact on the galaxy andits surroundings.

astro-ph;0503203	an x-ray study of magnetic field strengths and particle content in frii  radio sources	we present a chandra and xmm-newton study of x-ray emission from the lobes of33 classical double radio galaxies and quasars. we report new detections oflobe-related x-ray emission in 11 sources. together with previous detections wefind that x-ray emission is detected from at least one radio lobe in ~75percent of the sample. for all of the lobe detections, we find that themeasured x-ray flux can be attributed to inverse-compton scattering of thecosmic microwave background radiation, with magnetic field strengths in thelobes between (0.3 - 1.3) b_eq, where the value b_eq corresponds toequipartition between the electrons and magnetic field assuming a fillingfactor of unity. there is a strong peak in the magnetic field strengthdistribution at b ~ 0.7 b_eq. we find that &gt; 70 percent of the radio lobes areeither at equipartition or electron dominated by a small factor. thedistribution of measured magnetic field strengths differs for narrow-line andbroad-line objects, in the sense that broad-line radio galaxies and quasarsappear to be further from equipartition; however, this is likely to be due to acombination of projection effects and worse systematic uncertainty in the x-rayanalysis for those objects. our results suggest that the lobes of classicaldouble radio sources do not contain an energetically dominant protonpopulation, because this would require the magnetic field energy density to besimilar to the electron energy density rather than the overall energy densityin relativistic particles.

astro-ph;0603090	the x-ray nuclei of intermediate-redshift radio sources	we present a chandra and xmm-newton spectral analysis of the nuclei of theradio galaxies and radio-loud quasars from the 3crr sample in the redshiftrange 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. in the range of radio luminosity sampled by these objects,mostly friis, it has been clear for some time that a population of radiogalaxies (`low-excitation radio galaxies') cannot easily participate in modelsthat unify narrow-line radio galaxies and broad-line objects. we show thatlow-excitation and narrow-line radio galaxies have systematically differentnuclear x-ray properties: while narrow-line radio galaxies universally show aheavily absorbed nuclear x-ray component, such a heavily absorbed component israrely found in sources classed as low-excitation objects. combining our datawith the results of our earlier work on the z&lt;0.1 3crr sources, we discuss theimplications of this result for unified models, for the origins of mid-infraredemission from radio sources, and for the nature of the apparent fri/friidichotomy in the x-ray. the lack of direct evidence for accretion-related x-rayemission in frii lergs leads us to argue that there is a strong possibilitythat some, or most, frii lergs accrete in a radiatively inefficient mode.however, our results are also consistent with a model in which the accretionmode is the same for low- and high-excitation friis, with the lower accretionluminosities in frii lergs attributed instead to more efficient radioluminosity production in those objects.

astro-ph;0608700	an improved deprojection and psf-deconvolution technique for  galaxy-cluster x-ray surface-brightness profiles	we have developed a regularisation procedure for the direct deprojection andpsf-deconvolution of x-ray surface brightness profiles of clusters of galaxies.this procedure allows us to obtain accurate density profiles in astraightforward manner from x-ray observations (in particular data fromxmm-newton, where the psf correction is important), while retaining informationabout substructure in the gas distribution, in contrast to analytic modellingof the profiles. in addition to describing our procedure, we present here adetailed investigation of the accuracy of the method and its error calculationsover a wide range of input profile characteristics and data quality using montecarlo simulations. we also make comparisons with gas density profiles obtainedfrom chandra observations, where the psf correction is small, and with profilesobtained using analytic modelling, which demonstrate that our procedure is auseful improvement over standard techniques. this type of method will beespecially valuable in the ongoing analysis of unbiased and complete samples ofx-ray clusters, both local and distant, helping to improve the quality of theirresults.

astro-ph;0609480	temperature profiles of a representative sample of nearby x-ray galaxy  clusters	a study of the structural and scaling properties of the temperaturedistribution of the hot, x-ray emitting intra-cluster medium of galaxyclusters, and its dependence on dynamical state, can give insights into thephysical processes governing the formation and evolution of structure. weanalyse the x-ray temperature profiles from xmm-newton observations of 15nearby (z &lt; 0.2) clusters, drawn from a statistically representative sample.the clusters cover a temperature range from 2.5 kev to 8.5 kev, and present avariety of x-ray morphologies. we derive accurate projected temperatureprofiles to ~ 0.5 r_200, and compare structural properties (outer slope,presence of cooling core) with a quantitative measure of the x-ray morphologyas expressed by power ratios. we also compare the results to recentcosmological numerical simulations. once the temperature profiles are scaled byan average cluster temperature (excluding the central region) and the estimatedvirial radius, the profiles generally decline in the region 0.1 r_200 &lt; r &lt; 0.5r_200. the central regions show the largest scatter, attributable mostly to thepresence of cool core clusters. there is good agreement with numericalsimulations outside the core regions. we find no obvious correlations betweenpower ratio and outer profile slope. there may however be a weak trend with theexistence of a cool core, in the sense that clusters with a central temperaturedecrement appear to be slightly more regular. the present results lend furtherevidence to indicate that clusters are a regular population, at least outsidethe core region.

astro-ph;0701458	a radio through x-ray study of the hot spots, active nucleus, and  environment of the nearby fr ii radio galaxy 3c 33	we present results from {\em chandra}/acis-s, {\em spitzer}, {\emxmm-newton}, {\em hst}, and vla observations of the radio hot spots, extendedenvironment, and nucleus of the nearby ($z$=0.0597) fr ii radio galaxy 3c 33.this is a relatively low-power fr ii radio galaxy, and so we expect, {\it apriori}, to detect a significant x-ray synchrotron component to the emissionfrom the hot spots. we detect x-ray emission coincident with the two knots ofpolarized optical emission from the southern hot spot (shs), as well as alongthe northwest arm of this hot spot. we also detect x-ray emission from twocompact regions of the northern hot spot (nhs), as well as diffuse emissionbehind the radio peak. the x-ray flux density of the region at the tip of thesouthern hot spot, the most compact radio feature of the southern lobe, isconsistent with the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) process. the x-ray fluxdensities of the other three regions of the shs and the two compact regions ofthe nhs are an order of magnitude or more above the predictions from either thessc and inverse-compton scattering of the cmb (ic/cmb) mechanisms, thusstrongly disfavoring these scenarios unless they are far from equipartition($b$ $\sim$4-14 times smaller than the equipartition values). the x-ray fluxfrom the diffuse region behind the nhs is consistent with the ic/cmb predictionassuming a small departure from equipartition. we conclude that the x-rayemission is synchrotron emission from multiple populations of ultrarelativisticelectrons unless these regions are far from equipartition. there must thereforebe unresolved substructure within each knot, similar to that which is found inchandra observations of nearby fr i jets such as centaurus a and 3c 66b.

astro-ph;0701857	hot and cold gas accretion and feedback in radio-loud active galaxies	we have recently shown that x-ray observations of the population of`low-excitation' radio galaxies, which includes most low-power, fanaroff-rileyclass i sources as well as some more powerful fanaroff-riley class ii objects,are consistent with a model in which the active nuclei of these objects are notradiatively efficient at any waveband. in another recent paper allen et al.have shown that bondi accretion of the hot, x-ray emitting phase of theintergalactic medium (igm) is sufficient to power the jets of several nearby,low-power radio galaxies at the centres of clusters. in this paper we combinethese ideas and suggest that accretion of the hot phase of the igm issufficient to power all low-excitation radio sources, while high-excitationsources are powered by accretion of cold gas that is in general unrelated tothe hot igm. this model explains a number of properties of the radio-loudactive galaxy population, and has important implications for the energy inputof radio-loud active galactic nuclei into the hot phase of the igm: the energysupply of powerful high-excitation sources does not have a direct connection tothe hot phase.

astro-ph;0702094	shock heating in the nearby radio galaxy ngc 3801	we report the chandra detection of shock-heated shells of hot gas surroundingthe radio lobes of the nearby (d_l ~ 53 mpc) low-power radio galaxy ngc 3801.the shells have temperatures of 1 kev and 0.7 kev, compared to an ismtemperature of 0.23 kev. the estimated expansion speed of the shells is 850km/s, corresponding to a mach number of ~ 4. this is the second x-ray detectionof strong shocks produced by a low-power radio galaxy, and allows us to measuredirectly the contribution of shock heating to the radio galaxy's totalenergetic input to the ism. we show that the gas properties of the shells andsurrounding ism are consistent with the rankine-hugoniot shock jump conditions.we estimate the energy stored in the hot gas shells (thermal + kinetic energy)to be 1.7x10^56 ergs, which is equivalent to the thermal energy of the ismwithin ~11 kpc of the galaxy centre, and a factor of ~25 larger than theinferred pdv work required to inflate the lobe cavities, indicating that energytransfer from the agn to its environment is dominated by shock heating duringthis stage of radio-source evolution. our results provide direct evidence thatshock heating in the early supersonic phase of fri radio-source expansion canhave important long-term effects on the properties of the host galaxy ism.finally, we discuss the merger history of ngc 3801, the fuelling of its agn andthe role of this type of system in feedback models.

astro-ph;0703080	the interaction between radio lobes and hot gas in the nearby radio  galaxies 3c285 and 3c442a	we present chandra observations of two nearby radio galaxies in groupenvironments, 3c285 and 3c442a. the host galaxies of both sources are involvedin mergers with nearby massive galaxies, and the hot gas in the systems isextended along lines joining the interacting galaxies. both sources show strongevidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas.we argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent of the existence ofthe radio lobes in these systems, and argue that hot gas shaped by an ongoingmassive galaxy merger may play an important role in the dynamics of radio lobesin other objects. for 3c442a, our observations show that gas is being drivenout of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair, and the impliedconstraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motionswith respect to the group-scale hot gas. the previously known filamentary radiostructure in the center of 3c442a may be a result of the interaction betweenhot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre-existing radio-emitting plasma. in3c285, where there is no ongoing galaxy merger, the powerful radio source isprobably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group.

astro-ph;0703553	the representative xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess) of an  x-ray luminosity selected galaxy cluster sample	the largest uncertainty for cosmological studies using clusters of galaxiesis introduced by our limited knowledge of the statistics of galaxy clusterstructure, and of the scaling relations between observables and cluster mass.to improve on this situation we have started an xmm-newton large programme forthe in-depth study of a representative sample of 33 galaxy clusters, selectedin the redshift range z=0.055 to 0.183 from the reflex cluster survey, havingx-ray luminosities above 0.4 x 10^44 h_70^-2 erg s^-1 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kevband. this paper introduces the sample, compiles properties of the clusters,and provides detailed information on the sample selection function. we describethe selection of a nearby galaxy cluster sample that makes optimal use of thexmm-newton field-of-view, and provides nearly homogeneous x-ray luminositycoverage for the full range from poor clusters to the most massive objects inthe universe. for the clusters in the sample, x-ray fluxes are derived andcompared to the previously obtained fluxes from the rosat all-sky survey. wefind that the fluxes and the flux errors have been reliably determined in therosat all-sky survey analysis used for the reflex survey. we use the sampleselection function documented in detail in this paper to determine the x-rayluminosity function, and compare it with the luminosity function of the entirereflex sample. we also discuss morphological peculiarities of some of thesample members. the sample and some of the background data given in thisintroductory paper will be important for the application of these data in thedetailed studies of cluster structure, to appear in forthcoming publications.

0809.3784	galaxy cluster x-ray luminosity scaling relations from a representative  local sample (rexcess)	(abridged) we examine the x-ray luminosity scaling relations of 31 nearbygalaxy clusters from the representative xmm-newton cluster structure survey(rexcess). the objects are selected in x-ray luminosity only, optimallysampling the cluster luminosity function; temperatures range from 2 to 9 kevand there is no bias toward any particular morphological type. pertinent valuesare extracted in an aperture corresponding to r_500, estimated using the tightcorrelation between y_x and total mass. the data exhibit power law relationsbetween bolometric x-ray luminosity and temperature, y_x and total mass, allwith slopes that are significantly steeper than self-similar expectations. weexamine the causes for the steepening, finding that the primary driver appearsto be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. scatter about therelations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. the naturallogarithmic scatter about the raw x-ray luminosity-temperature relation isabout 70%, and about the x-ray luminosity-y_x relation it is 40%. cool core andmorphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual spacewith respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematicallyto the high luminosity side, the latter to the low luminosity side. exclusionof the central regions serves to reduce the scatter by more than 50%. using y_xas a mass proxy, we derive a malmquist bias corrected luminosity-mass relationand compare with previous determinations. our results indicate that luminositycan be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has importantimplications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to beundertaken with planck and erosita, and ultimately for the use of clusters forcosmological purposes.
