0901.4553	discovery of x-ray emission from the wolf-rayet star wr142 of oxygen  subtype	we report the discovery of weak yet hard x-ray emission from the wolf-rayet(wr) star wr142 with the xmm-newton x-ray telescope. being of spectral subtypewo2, wr142 is a massive star in a very advanced evolutionary stage, shortbefore its explosion as a supernova or gamma-ray burst. this is the firstdetection of x-ray emission from a wo-type star. we rule out any serendipitousx-ray sources within approx 1" of wr142. wr142 has an x-ray luminosity ofl_x=7\times10^{30} erg/s, which constitutes only $\lsim 10^{-8}$ of itsbolometric luminosity. the hard x-ray spectrum suggests a plasma temperature ofabout 100 mk. commonly, x-ray emission from stellar winds is attributed toembedded shocks due to the intrinsic instability of the radiation driving. fromqualitative considerations we conclude that this mechanism cannot account forthe hardness of the observed radiation. there are no hints for a binarycompanion. therefore the only remaining, albeit speculative explanation mustrefer to magnetic activity. possibly related, wr142 seems to rotate extremelyfast, as indicated by the unusually round profiles of its optical emissionlines. our detection implies that the wind of wr142 must be relativelytransparent to x-rays, which can be due to strong wind ionization, windclumping, or non-spherical geometry from rapid rotation.

1006.3344	supernova remnants and star formation in the large magellanic cloud	it has often been suggested that supernova remnants (snrs) can trigger starformation. to investigate the relationship between snrs and star formation, wehave examined the known sample of 45 snrs in the large magellanic cloud tosearch for associated young stellar objects (ysos) and molecular clouds. wefind seven snrs associated with both ysos and molecular clouds, three snrsassociated with ysos but not molecular clouds, and eight snrs near molecularclouds but not associated with ysos. among the 10 snrs associated with ysos,the association between the ysos and snrs can be either rejected or cannot beconvincingly established for eight cases. only two snrs have ysos closelyaligned along their rims; however, the time elapsed since the snr began tointeract with the ysos' natal clouds is much shorter than the contractiontimescales of the ysos, and thus we do not see any evidence of snr-triggeredstar formation in the lmc. the 15 snrs that are near molecular clouds maytrigger star formation in the future when the snr shocks have slowed down to&lt;45 km/s. we discuss how snrs can alter the physical properties and abundancesof ysos.

1101.0280	observational constraints on superbubble x-ray energy budgets	the hot, x-ray-emitting gas in superbubbles imparts energy and enrichedmaterial to the interstellar medium (ism) and generates the hot ionized medium,the ism's high-temperature component. the evolution of superbubble energybudgets is not well understood, however, and the processes responsible forenhanced x-ray emission in superbubbles remain a matter of debate. we presentchandra acis-s observations of two x-ray-bright superbubbles in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), dem l50 (n186) and dem l152 (n44), with an emphasis ondisentangling the true superbubble x-ray emission from non-related diffuseemission and determining the spatial origin and spectral variation of the x-rayemission. an examination of the superbubble energy budgets shows that on theorder of 50% of the x-ray emission comes from regions associated with supernovaremnant (snr) impacts. we find some evidence of mass-loading due to swept-upclouds and metallicity enrichment, but neither mechanism provides a significantcontribution to the x-ray luminosities. we also find that one of thesuperbubbles, dem l50, is likely not in collisional ionization equilibrium. wecompare our observations to the predictions of the standard weaver et al. modeland to 1-d hydrodynamic simulations including cavity supernova impacts on theshell walls. our observations show that mass-loading due to thermal evaporationfrom the shell walls and snr impacts are the dominant source of enhanced x-rayluminosities in superbubbles. these two processes should affect mostsuperbubbles, and their contribution to the x-ray luminosity must be consideredwhen determining the energy available for transport to the ism.

1202.4463	rebirth of x-ray emission from the born-again planetary nebula a 30	the planetary nebula (pn) a30 is believed to have undergone a very latethermal pulse resulting in the ejection of knots of hydrogen-poor material.using hst images we have detected the angular expansion of these knots andderived an age of 850+280-150 yr. to investigate the spectral and spatialproperties of the soft x-ray emission detected by rosat, we have obtainedchandra and xmm-newton observations of a30. the x-ray emission from a30 can beseparated into two components: a point-source at the central star and diffuseemission associated with the hydrogen-poor knots and the cloverleaf structureinside the nebular shell. to help us assess the role of the current stellarwind in powering this x-ray emission, we have determined the stellar parametersof the central star of a 30 using a non-lte model fit to its optical and uvspectrum. the spatial distribution and spectral properties of the diffuse x-rayemission is suggestive that it is generated by the post-born-again and presentfast stellar winds interacting with the hydrogen-poor ejecta of the born-againevent. this emission can be attributed to shock-heated plasma, as thehydrogen-poor knots are ablated by the stellar winds, under which circumstancesthe efficient mass-loading of the present fast stellar wind raises its densityand damps its velocity to produce the observed diffuse soft x-rays. chargetransfer reactions between the ions of the stellar winds and material of theborn-again ejecta has also been considered as a possible mechanism for theproduction of diffuse x-ray emission, and upper limits on the expected x-rayproduction by this mechanism have been derived. the origin of the x-rayemission from the central star of a 30 is puzzling: shocks in the present faststellar wind and photospheric emission can be ruled out, while the developmentof a new, compact hot bubble confining the fast stellar wind seems implausible.

0804.1812	multiple and precessing collimated outflows in the planetary nebula ic  4634	with its remarkable double-s shape, ic 4634 is an archetype ofpoint-symmetric planetary nebulae (pn). in this paper, we present a detailedstudy of this pn using archival hst wfpc2 and ground-based narrow-band imagesto investigate its morphology, and long-slit spectroscopic observations todetermine its kinematics and to derive its physical conditions and excitation.the data reveal new structural components, including a distant string of knotsdistributed along an arc-like feature 40"-60" from the center of the nebula, askin of enhanced [o iii]/h-alpha ratio enveloping the inner shell and thedouble-s feature, and a triple-shell structure. the spatio-kinematical studyalso finds an equatorial component of the main nebula that is kinematicallyindependent from the bright inner s-shaped arc. we have investigated in detailthe bow shock-like features in ic 4634 and found that their morphological,kinematical and emission properties are consistent with the interaction of acollimated outflow with surrounding material. indeed, the morphology andkinematics of some of these features can be interpreted using a 3d numericalsimulation of a collimated outflow precessing at a moderate, time-dependentvelocity. apparently, ic 4634 has experienced several episodes ofpoint-symmetric ejections oriented at different directions with the outers-shaped feature being related to an earlier point-symmetric ejection and theoutermost arc-like string of knots being the relic of an even much earlierpoint-symmetric ejection. there is tantalizing evidence that the action ofthese collimated outflows has also taken part in the shaping of the innermostshell and inner s-shaped arc of ic 4634.

1412.2793	the chandra planetary nebulae survey (chanplans): iii. x-ray emission  from the central stars of planetary nebulae	we present x-ray spectral analysis of 20 point-like x-ray sources detected inchandra planetary nebula survey (chanplans) observations of 59 planetarynebulae (pne) in the solar neighborhood. most of these 20 detections areassociated with luminous central stars within relatively young, compactnebulae. the vast majority of these point-like x-ray-emitting sources at pncores display relatively "hard" ($\geq0.5$~kev) x-ray emission components thatare unlikely to be due to photospheric emission from the hot central stars(cspn). instead, we demonstrate that these sources are well modeled byoptically-thin thermal plasmas. from the plasma properties, we identify twoclasses of cspn x-ray emission: (1) high-temperature plasmas with x-rayluminosities, $l_{\rm x}$, that appear uncorrelated with the cspn bolometricluminosity, $l_{\rm bol}$; and (2) lower-temperature plasmas with $l_{\rmx}/l_{\rm bol}\sim10^{-7}$. we suggest these two classes correspond to thephysical processes of magnetically active binary companions and self-shockingstellar winds, respectively. in many cases this conclusion is supported bycorroborative multiwavelength evidence for the wind and binary properties ofthe pn central stars. by thus honing in on the origins of x-ray emission frompn central stars, we enhance the ability of cspn x-ray sources to constrainmodels of pn shaping that invoke wind interactions and binarity.

astro-ph;0105341	detection of an x-ray pulsar wind nebula and tail in snr n157b	we report chandra x-ray observations of the supernova remnant n157b in thelarge magellanic cloud, which are presented together with an archival hstoptical image and a radio continuum map for comparison. this remnant containsthe recently discovered 16 ms x-ray pulsar psr j0537-6910, the most rapidlyrotating young pulsar known.  using phase-resolved chandra imaging, we pinpoint the location of the pulsarto within an uncertainty of less than 1 arcsec. psr j0537-6910 is not detectedin any other wavelength band. the x-ray observations resolve three distinctfeatures: the pulsar itself, a surrounding compact wind nebula which isstrongly elongated and a feature of large-scale diffuse emission trailing fromthe pulsar. this latter comet tail-shaped feature coexists with enhanced radioemission and is oriented nearly perpendicular to the major axis of the pulsarwind nebula. we propose the following scenario to explain these features. thebright, compact nebula is likely powered by a toroidal pulsar wind ofrelativistic particles which is partially confined by the ram-pressure from thesupersonic motion of the pulsar. the particles, after being forced out from thecompact nebula (the head of the ``comet''), are eventually dumped into a bubble(the tail), which is primarily responsible for the extended diffuse x-ray andradio emission. the ram-pressure confinement also allows a natural explanationfor the observed x-ray luminosity of the compact nebula and for the unusuallysmall x-ray to spin-down luminosity ratio, compared to similarly energeticpulsars. we estimate the pulsar wind lorentz factor of n157b as about 4 times10^6 (with an uncertainty of a factor about 2, consistent with that inferredfrom the modeling of the crab nebula.

astro-ph;0401431	energy crisis in the superbubble dem l 192 (n 51d)	superbubbles surrounding ob associations provide ideal laboratories to studythe stellar energy feedback problem because the stellar energy input can beestimated from the observed stellar content of the ob associations and theinterstellar thermal and kinetic energies of superbubbles are well-defined andeasy to observe. we have used dem l 192, also known as n 51d, to carry out adetailed case study of the energy budget in a superbubble, and we find that theexpected amount of stellar mechanical energy injected into the ism,(18+-5)x10^51 ergs, exceeds the amount of thermal and kinetic energies storedin the superbubble, (6+-2)x10^51 ergs. clearly, a significant fraction of thestellar mechanical energy must have been converted to other forms of energy.the x-ray spectrum of the diffuse emission from dem l 192 requires a power-lawcomponent to explain the featureless emission at 1.0-3.0 kev. the origin ofthis power-law component is unclear, but it may be responsible for thediscrepancy between the stellar energy input and the observed interstellarenergy in dem l 192.

astro-ph;0401435	hot interstellar gas and stellar energy feedback in the antennae  galaxies	we have analyzed chandra archival observations of the antennae galaxies tostudy the distribution and physical properties of its hot interstellar gas.eleven distinct diffuse x-ray emission regions are selected according to theirunderlying interstellar structures and star formation activity. the x-rayspectra of these regions are used to determine their thermal energy contentsand cooling timescales. young star clusters in these regions are alsoidentified and their photometric measurements are compared to evolutionarystellar population synthesis models to assess their masses and ages. thecluster properties are then used to determine the stellar wind and supernovaenergies injected into the ism. comparisons between the thermal energy in thehot ism and the expected stellar energy input show that young star clusters aresufficient to power the x-ray-emitting gas in some, but not all, active starformation regions. super-star clusters, with masses &gt;= 1x10^5 m_sol, heat theism, but the yield of hot interstellar gas is not directly proportional to thecluster mass. finally, there exist diffuse x-ray emission regions which do notshow active star formation or massive young star clusters. these regions may bepowered by field stars or low-mass clusters formed within the last ~100 myr.

astro-ph;0406295	supernova remnants in the magellanic clouds. iv. x-ray emission from the  largest snr in the lmc	we present the first x-ray detection of snr 0450-70.9 the largest knownsupernova remnant (snr) in the large magellanic cloud. to study the physicalconditions of this snr, we have obtained xmm-newton x-ray observations, opticalimages and high-dispersion spectra, and radio continuum maps. optical images ofsnr 0450-70.9 show a large, irregular elliptical shell with bright filamentsalong the eastern and western rims and within the shell interior. the interiorfilaments have higher [s ii]/halpha ratios and form an apparent inner shellmorphology. the x-ray emission region is smaller than the full extent of theoptical shell, with the brightest x-ray emission found within the smallinterior shell and on the western rim of the large shell. the expansionvelocity of the small shell is ~220 km/s, while the large shell is ~120 km/s.  the radio image shows central brightening and a fairly flat radio spectralindex over the snr. however, no point x-ray or radio source corresponding to apulsar is detected and the x-ray emission is predominantly thermal. therefore,these phenomena can be most reasonably explained in terms of the advanced ageof the large snr. using hydrodynamic models combined with a nonequilibriumionization model for thermal x-ray emission, we derived a lower limit on thesnr age of about 45,000 yr, well into the later stages of snr evolution.despite this, the temperature and density derived from spectral fits to thex-ray emission indicate that the remnant is still overpressured, and thus thatthe development is largely driven by hot gas in the snr interior.

astro-ph;0406349	parsec-scale x-ray flows in high-mass star-forming regions	we present chandra/acis images of several high-mass star-forming regions. themassive stellar clusters powering these hii regions are resolved at thearcsecond level into hundreds of stellar sources, similar to those seen incloser young stellar clusters. however, we also detect diffuse x-ray emissionon parsec scales that is spatially and spectrally distinct from the pointsource population. for nearby regions (e.g. m17 and rosette) the emission issoft, with plasma temperatures less than 10 million degrees, in contrast towhat is seen in more distant complexes (e.g. rcw49, w51).  this extended emission most likely arises from the fast o-star windsthermalized either by wind-wind collisions or by a termination shock againstthe surrounding media. we have established that only a small portion of thewind energy and mass appears in the observed diffuse x-ray plasma; in theblister hii regions, we suspect that most of it flows without cooling into thelow-density interstellar medium through blow-outs or fissures in thesurrounding neutral material. these data provide compelling observationalevidence that strong wind shocks are present in hii regions.

astro-ph;0407491	an optical and x-ray examination of two radio supernova remnant  candidates in 30 doradus	the giant hii region 30 doradus is known for its violent internal motions andbright diffuse x-ray emission, suggesting the existence of supernova remnants(snrs), but no nonthermal radio emission has been detected. recently, lazendicet al. compared the h-alpha/h-beta and radio/h-alpha ratios and suggested twosmall radio sources to be nonthermal and thus snr candidates; however, nooptical or x-ray counterparts were detected. we have used high-resolutionoptical images and high-dispersion spectra to examine the morphological,spectral, and kinematic properties of these two snr candidates, and still findno optical evidence supporting their identification as snrs. we have alsodetermined the x-ray luminosities of these snr candidates, and find them 1-3orders of magnitude lower than those commonly seen in young snrs. highextinction can obscure optical and x-ray signatures of an snr, but wouldprohibit the use of a high radio/h-alpha ratio to identify nonthermal radioemission. we suggest that the snr candidate mcrx j053831.8-690620 is associatedwith a young star forming region; while the radio emission originates from theobscured star forming region, the observed optical emission is dominated by theforeground. we suggest that the snr candidate mcrx j053838.8-690730 isassociated with a dust/molecular cloud, which obscures some optical emissionbut not the radio emission.

(2001) that the spectra of theseshells are notably different, with shell a requiring a high iron abundance fora good spectral fit, implying a type ia origin. we further explicitly compareabundance ratios to model predictions for type ia and type ii supernovae. thelow ratios for shell a (o/fe of 1.5 and ne/fe of 0.2) and the high ratios forshell b (o/fe of 30--130 and ne/fe of 8--16) are consistent with type ia andtype ii origins, respectively. the difference between the snr progenitor typescasts some doubt on the suggestion that these snrs are interacting with oneanother.

astro-ph;0602456	the dissolving rosette hh2 jet bathed in harsh uv radiation of the  rosette nebula	herbig-haro flows discovered in photoionized medium forms a separate categoryand detailed studies of which become one of the key issues to our understandingof jet production and evolution. the rosette hh2 jet is the second of suchflows that immersed in the spectacular hii region of the rosette nebula.however, its disconnected jet components are detached from the proposed energysource, have additional unusual properties and thus a disputable nature. inthis paper, we investigate through high-quality echelle spectrographs thephysical nature of the jet system. the jet shows distinctly different velocitycomponents. it is believed to be composed of a fast neutral jet with anapproaching velocity of -39.5 km $^{-1}$ as respect to the systemic rest frame,and likely an extensive, photoevaporated envelope dissolving at roughly thesound speed. this led us to infer a fast dissipating nature of the jet systembeing bathed in the fully photoionized medium of rosette.  in addition, time series photometric observations provide evidence that theenergy source is highly variable, with amplitudes of up to ${&gt;}$ 1 mag in r &amp;i. this is consistent well with an early evolutionary status of the jet drivingstar with a red, late type spectrum in the optical.
