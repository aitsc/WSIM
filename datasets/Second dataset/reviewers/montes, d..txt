0901.1634	multiwavelength optical observations of two chromospherically active  binary systems: v789 mon and gz leo	this paper describes a multiwavelengh optical study of chromospheres in twox-ray/euv selected active binary stars with strong h_alpha emission, v789 mon(2re j0725-002) and gz leo (2re j1101+223). the goal of the study is todetermine radial velocities and fundamental stellar parameters inchromospherically active binary systems in order to include them in theactivity-rotation and activity-age relations. we carried out high resolutionechelle spectroscopic observations and applied spectral subtraction techniquein order to measure emission excesses due to chromosphere. the detailed studyof activity indicators allowed us to characterize the presence of differentchromospheric features in these systems and enabled to include them in a largeractivity-rotation survey. we computed radial velocities of the systems usingcross correlation with the radial velocity standards. the double-line spectralbinarity was confirmed and the orbital solutions improved for both systems. inaddition, other stellar parameters such as: spectral types, projectedrotational velocities (vsini), and the equivalent width of the lithium lii6707.8 aa absorption line were determined.

0904.0196	quantifying the contamination by old main-sequence stars in young moving  groups: the case of the local association	the associations and moving groups of young stars are excellent laboratoriesfor investigating stellar formation in the solar neighborhood. previous resultshave confirmed that a non-negligible fraction of old main-sequence stars ispresent in the lists of possible members of young stellar kinematic groups. adetailed study of the properties of these samples is needed to separate theyoung stars from old main-sequence stars with similar space motion, andidentify the origin of these structures. we used stars possible members of theyoung (~ 10 - 650 myr) moving groups from the literature. to determine the ageof the stars, we used several suitable age indicators for young main sequencestars, i.e., x-ray fluxes and other photometric data. we also usedspectroscopic data, in particular the equivalent width of the lithium line li iand halpha, to constrain the range of ages of the stars. by combiningphotometric and spectroscopic data, we were able to separate the young stars(10 - 650 myr) from the old (&gt; 1 gyr) field ones. we found, in particular, thatthe local association is contaminated by old field stars at the level of ~30%.this value must be considered as the contamination for our particular sample,and not of the entire local association. for other young moving groups, it ismore difficult to estimate the fraction of old stars among possible members.however, the level of x-ray emission can, at least, help to separate two agepopulations: stars with &lt;200 myr and stars older than this. our results areconsistent with a scenario in which the moving groups contain both groups ofyoung stars formed in a recent star-formation episode and old field stars withsimilar space motion. only by combining x-ray and optical spectroscopic data isit possible to distinguish between these two age populations.

1002.4391	chromospheric activity and rotation of fgk stars in the solar vicinity.  an estimation of the radial velocity jitter	context: chromospheric activity produces both photometric and spectroscopicvariations that can be mistaken as planets. large spots crossing the stellardisc can produce planet-like periodic variations in the light curve of a star.these spots clearly affect the spectral line profiles and their perturbationsalter the line centroids creating a radial velocity jitter that mightcontaminate" the variations induced by a planet. precise chromospheric activitymeasurements are needed to estimate the activity-induced noise that should beexpected for a given star. aims: we obtain precise chromospheric activitymeasurements and projected rotational velocities for nearby (d &lt; 25 pc) cool(spectral types f to k) stars, to estimate their expected activity-relatedjitter. as a complementary objective, we attempt to obtain relationshipsbetween fluxes in different activity indicator lines, that permit atransformation of traditional activity indicators, i.e, caii h &amp; k lines, toothers that hold noteworthy advantages. methods: we used high resolution(~50000) echelle optical spectra. to determine the chromospheric emission ofthe stars in the sample, we used the spectral subtraction technique. rotationalvelocities were determined using the cross-correlation technique. to inferactivity-related radial velocity (rv) jitter, we used empirical relationshipsbetween this jitter and the r'_hk index. results: we measured chromosphericactivity, as given by different indicators throughout the optical spectra, andprojected rotational velocities for 371 nearby cool stars. we have builtempirical relationships among the most important chromospheric emission lines.finally, we used the measured chromospheric activity to estimate the expectedrv jitter for the active stars in the sample.

1007.1132	a spectroscopy study of nearby late-type stars, possible members of  stellar kinematic groups	nearby late-type stars are excellent targets for seeking young objects instellar associations and moving groups. the origin of these structures is stillmisunderstood, and lists of moving group members often change with time andalso from author to author. most members of these groups have been identifiedby means of kinematic criteria, leading to an important contamination ofprevious lists by old field stars. we attempt to identify unambiguous movinggroup members among a sample of nearby-late type stars by studying theirkinematics, lithium abundance, chromospheric activity, and other age-relatedproperties. high-resolution echelle spectra ($r \sim 57000$) of a sample ofnearby late-type stars are used to derive accurate radial velocities that arecombined with the precise hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions to computegalactic-spatial velocity components. stars are classified as possible membersof the classical moving groups according to their kinematics. the spectra arealso used to study several age-related properties for young late-type stars,i.e., the equivalent width of the lithium li~{\sc i} \space 6707.8 \space \aa\space line or the $r'_{\rm hk}$ index. additional information like x-rayfluxes from the rosat all-sky survey or the presence of debris discs is alsotaken into account. the different age estimators are compared and the movinggroup membership of the kinematically selected candidates are discussed. from atotal list of 405 nearby stars, 102 have been classified as moving groupcandidates according to their kinematics. i.e., only $\sim$ 25.2 \% of thesample. the number reduces when age estimates are considered, and only 26moving group candidates (25.5\% of the 102 candidates) have ages in agreementwith the star having the same age as an mg member

1009.2587	discovery of "isolated" comoving t tauri stars in cepheus	during the course of a large spectroscopic survey of x-ray active late-typestars in the solar neighbourhood, we discovered four lithium-rich stars packedwithin just a few degrees on the sky. these very young stars are projectedseveral degrees away from the cepheus-cassiopea clouds, in front of an areavoid of interstellar matter. as such, they are very good "isolated" t tauristar candidates. we acquired high-resolution optical spectra as well asphotometric data allowing us to investigate in detail their nature and physicalparameters with the aim of testing the "runaway" and "in-situ" formationscenarios. we derive accurate radial and rotational velocities and perform anautomatic spectral classification. the spectral subtraction technique is usedto infer chromospheric activity level in the h-alpha line core and clean thespectra of photospheric lines before measuring the equivalent width of thelithium absorption line. both physical (lithium content, magnetic activity) andkinematical indicators show that all stars are very young (ages in the range10-30 myr). in particular, the spectral energy distribution of tyc4496-780-1displays a strong near- and far-infrared excess, typical of t tauri stars stillsurrounded by an accretion disc. they also share the same galactic motion,proving that they form a homogeneous moving group of stars with the sameorigin. the most plausible explanation of how these "isolated" t tauri starsformed is the "in-situ" model, although accurate distances are needed toclarify their connection with the cepheus-cassiopeia complex.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1409.2348	chemical tagging of the ursa major moving group: a northern selection of  fgk stars	stellar kinematic groups are kinematical coherent groups of stars which mightshare a common origin.these groups spread through the galaxy over time due totidal effects caused by galactic rotation and disc heating.however, thechemical information survives these processes. the information provided by theanalysis of chemical elements can reveal the origin of these kinematic groups.here we investigate the origin of the stars that belong to the ursa majormoving group. we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations obtainedfrom three different spectrographs of kinematically selected fgk stars of theursa major moving group. stellar atmospheric parameters (teff, log(g), xi, and[fe/h]) were determined using our own automatic code (stepar) which makes useof the sensitivity of iron equivalent widths measured in the spectra. wecritically compare the stepar results with other methods (teff values derivedusing the infrared flux method and log(g) values based on hipparcosparallaxes). we derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements, and their[x/fe] ratios of all stars in the sample. we perform a differential abundanceanalysis with respect to a reference star of the uma mg (hd115043). we havealso carried out a systematic comparison of the abundance pattern of the ursamajor mg and the hyades sc with the thin disc stellar abundances. our chemicaltagging analysis indicates that the ursa major mg is less affected by fieldstar contamination than other moving groups (such as the hyades sc). we find aroughly solar iron composition for the finally selected stars, whereas the[x/fe] ratios are roughly sub-solar except for super-solar barium abundance.weconclude that 29 out of 44 (i.e. 66 %) candidate stars share a similar chemicalcomposition. in addition, we find that the abundance pattern of the ursa majormg might be marginally different from that of the hyades sc.

1412.8711	origin of galactic type-ia supernovae: sn 1572 and sn 1006	we have been searching for surviving companions of progenitors of galactictype-ia supernovae, in particular sn 1572 and sn 1006. these companion starsare expected to show peculiarities: (i) to be probably more luminous than thesun, (ii) to have high radial velocity and proper motion, (iii) to be possiblyenriched in metals from the snia ejecta, and (iv) to be located at the distanceof the snia remnant. we have been characterizing possible candidate stars usinghigh-resolution spectroscopic data taken at 10m-keck and 8.2m-vlt facilities.we have identified a very promising candidate companion (tycho g) for sn 1572,but we have not found any candidate companion for sn 1006, suggesting that snevent occurred in 1006 could have been the result of the merging of two whitedwarfs. adding these results to the evidence from the other direct searches,the clear minority of cases (20\% or less) seem to disfavour thesingle-degenerate channel or that preferentially the single-degenerateescenario would involve main-sequence companions less massive than the sun.therefore, it appears to be very important to continue investigating these andother galactic type-ia sne such as the johannes kepler sn 1604.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1503.02082	testing the chemical tagging technique with open clusters	context. stars are born together from giant molecular clouds and, if weassume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we expectthem to share the same chemical composition. most of the stellar aggregates aredisrupted while orbiting the galaxy and most of the dynamic information islost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing the stellar formation historyis to analyze the chemical abundances that we observe today.  aims. the chemical tagging technique aims to recover disrupted stellarclusters based merely on their chemical composition. we evaluate the viabilityof this technique to recover co-natal stars that are no longer gravitationallybound.  methods. open clusters are co-natal aggregates that have managed to survivetogether. we compiled stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age openclusters, homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17 abundancespecies, and applied machine learning algorithms to group the stars based ontheir chemical composition. this approach allows us to evaluate the viabilityand efficiency of the chemical tagging technique.  results. we found that stars at different evolutionary stages have distinctchemical patterns that may be due to nlte effects, atomic diffusion, mixing,and biases. when separating stars into dwarfs and giants, we observed that afew open clusters show distinct chemical signatures while the majority show ahigh degree of overlap. this limits the recovery of co-natal aggregates byapplying the chemical tagging technique. nevertheless, there is room forimprovement if more elements are included and models are improved.

astro-ph;0602123	analysis and modeling of high temporal resolution spectroscopic  observations of flares on ad leo	we report the results of a high temporal resolution spectroscopic monitoringof the flare star ad leo. during 4 nights, more than 600 spectra were taken inthe optical range using the isaac newton telescope (int) and the intermediatedispersion spectrograph (ids). we have observed a large number of short andweak flares occurring very frequently (flare activity &gt; 0.71 hours-1). this isin favour of the very important role that flares can play in stellar coronalheating. the detected flares are non white-light flares and, though most ofsolar flares belong to this kind, very few such events had been previouslyobserved on stars. the behaviour of different chromospheric lines (balmerseries from h_alpha to h_11, ca ii h &amp; k, na i d_1 &amp; d_2, he i 4026 aa and he id_3) has been studied in detail for a total of 14 flares. we have alsoestimated the physical parameters of the flaring plasma by using a procedurewhich assumes a simplified slab model of flares. all the obtained physicalparameters are consistent with previously derived values for stellar flares,and the areas - less than 2.3% of the stellar surface - are comparable with thesize inferred for other solar and stellar flares. finally, we have studied therelationships between the physical parameters and the area, duration, maximumflux and energy released during the detected flares.

astro-ph;9506025	application of the spectral subtraction technique to the caii h &amp; k and  h$\epsilon$ lines in a sample of chromospherically active binaries	we present new spectroscopic observations in the ca~{\sc ii} h \&amp; k lineregion for a sample of 28 chromospherically active binary systems (rs$~$cvn andby$~$dra classes), with different activity levels. by using the spectralsubtraction technique (subtraction of a synthesized stellar spectrumconstructed from reference stars of similar spectral type and luminosity class)we obtain the active-chromosphere contribution to the ca~{\sc ii} h \&amp; k linesand to the h$\epsilon$ line when it is present. we have compared the emissionequivalent widths obtained with this technique with those obtained byreconstruction of the absorption line profile below the emission peak(s). theemissions arising from each individual star were obtained when it was possibleto deblend the contribution of both components. the ca~{\sc ii} line profilescorresponding to different seasons and orbital phases are analysed in order todetermine the contribution of each component and to study the chromosphericactivity variations.

astro-ph;9511125	the behaviour of the excess caii h &amp; k and h_epsilon emissions in  chromospherically active binaries	in this work we analyze the behaviour of the excess ca~{\sc ii} h \&amp; k andh$\epsilon$ emissions in a sample of 73 chromospherically active binary systems(rs$~$cvn and by$~$dra classes), of different activity levels and luminosityclasses. this sample includes the 53 stars analyzed by fern\'andez-figueroa etal. (1994) and the observations of 28 systems described by montes et al.(1995c). by using the spectral subtraction technique (subtraction of asynthesized stellar spectrum constructed from reference stars of spectral typeand luminosity class similar to those of the binary star components) we obtainthe active-chromosphere contribution to the ca~{\sc ii} h \&amp; k lines in these73 systems. we have determined the excess ca~{\sc ii} h \&amp; k emissionequivalent widths and converted them into surface fluxes. the emissions arisingfrom each component were obtained when it was possible to deblend bothcontributions. we have found that the components of active binaries aregenerally stronger emitters than single active stars for a given effectivetemperature and rotation rate. a slight decline of the excess ca~{\sc ii} h \&amp;k emissions towards longer rotation periods, p$_{\rm rot}$, and larger rossbynumbers, r$_{0}$, is found. when we use r$_{0}$ instead of p$_{\rm rot}$ thescatter is reduced and a saturation at r$_{0}$ $\approx$~0.3 is observed. agood correlation between the excess ca~{\sc ii}~k and h$\epsilon$ chromosphericemission fluxes has been found. the correlations obtained between the excessca~{\sc ii}~k emission and other activity indicators, (c~{\sc iv} in thetransition region, and x-rays in the corona) indicate that the exponents of thepower-law relations increase with the formation temperature of the spectralfeatures.

astro-ph;9605038	h_alpha emission fluxes and lithium abundances of low mass stars in the  young open cluster ic 4665	as part of a long term effort to understand pre-main sequence li burning, wehave obtained high resolution spectroscopic observations of 14 late type stars(g0--m1) in the young open cluster ic~4665. most of the stars have \hafilled-in and \li absorption, as expected for their young age. from theequivalent widths of \ha emission excess (obtained using the spectralsubtraction technique) and the \lii feature, we have derived \ha emissionfluxes and photospheric li abundances. the mean li abundance of ic~4665solar-type stars is log n(li)=3.1; the same as in other young clusters($\alpha$~per, pleiades) and t tauri stars. our results support the conclusionsfrom previous works that pms li depletion is very small for masses $\sim$ 1\msun . among the ic 4665 late-g and early k-type stars, there is a spread inli abundances of about one order of magnitude. the li-poor ic~4665 members havelow \ha excess and vsin{\it i}$\le$10. hence, the li-activity-rotationconnection which has been clearly established in the pleiades also seems tohold in ic 4665. one m-type ic~4665 star that we have observed does not showli, implying a very efficient li depletion as observed in $\alpha$~per stars ofthe same spectral type.  the level of chromospheric activity and li depletion among the low mass starsof ic 4665 is similar to that in the pleiades. in fact, we note that the liabundance distributions in several young clusters  ($\alpha$~per, pleiades, ic~2391, ic~4665) and in post t tauri stars arestrikingly similar. this result suggests that \ha emission and li abundance notwell correlated with age for low mass stars between 20 and 100 myr old. weargue that a finer age indicator, the ``ll-clock", would be the luminosity at
