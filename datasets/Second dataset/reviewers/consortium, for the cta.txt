0908.1410	cta - a project for a new generation of cherenkov telescopes	gamma-rays provide a powerful insight into the non-thermal universe andperhaps a unique probe for new physics beyond the standard model. currentexperiments are already giving results in the physics of acceleration of cosmicrays in supernova remnants, pulsar and active galactic nuclei with almost ahundred sources detected at very-high-energies so far. despite its relativelyrecent appearance, very high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has proven to havereached a mature technology with fast assembling, relatively cheap and reliabletelescopes. the goal of future installation is to increase the sensitivity by afactor ten compared to current installations, and enlarge the energy domainfrom few tens of gev to a hundred tev. gamma-ray spectra of astrophysicalorigin are rather soft thus hardly one single size telescope can cover morethan 1.5 decades in energy, therefore an array of telescopes of 2,3 differentsizes is required. hereafter, we present design considerations for a cherenkovtelescope array (cta), a project for a new generation of highly automatedtelescopes for gamma-ray astronomy. the status of the project, technicalsolutions and an insight in the involved physics will be presented.

0709.2048	cherenkov telescope array: the next-generation ground-based gamma-ray  observatory	high energy gamma-ray astronomy is a newly emerging and very successfulbranch of astronomy and astrophysics. exciting results have been obtained bythe current generation cherenkov telescope systems such as h.e.s.s., magic,veritas and cangaroo. the h.e.s.s. survey of the galactic plane has revealed alarge number of sources and addresses issues such as the question about theorigin of cosmic rays. the detection of very high energy emission fromextragalactic sources at large distances has provided insights in the starformation during the history of the universe and in the understanding of activegalactic nuclei. the development of the very large cherenkov telescope arraysystem (cta) with a sensitivity about an order of magnitude better than currentinstruments and significantly improved sensitivity is under intense discussion.this observatory will reveal an order of magnitude more sources and due to itshigher sensitivity and angular resolution it will be able to detect new classesof objects and phenomena that have not been visible until now. a combination ofdifferent telescope types will provide the sensitivity needed in differentenergy ranges.

1204.3624	optical intensity interferometry with the cherenkov telescope array	with its unprecedented light-collecting area for night-sky observations, thecherenkov telescope array (cta) holds great potential for also optical stellarastronomy, in particular as a multi-element intensity interferometer forrealizing imaging with sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution. such anorder-of-magnitude increase of the spatial resolution achieved in opticalastronomy will reveal the surfaces of rotationally flattened stars withstructures in their circumstellar disks and winds, or the gas flows betweenclose binaries. image reconstruction is feasible from the second-ordercoherence of light, measured as the temporal correlations of arrival timesbetween photons recorded in different telescopes. this technique (oncepioneered by hanbury brown and twiss) connects telescopes only with electronicsignals and is practically insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and toimperfections in telescope optics. detector and telescope requirements are verysimilar to those for imaging air cherenkov observatories, the main differencebeing the signal processing (calculating cross correlations between singlecamera pixels in pairs of telescopes). observations of brighter stars are notlimited by sky brightness, permitting efficient cta use during also bright-moonperiods. while other concepts have been proposed to realize kilometer-scaleoptical interferometers of conventional amplitude (phase-) type, both in spaceand on the ground, their complexity places them much further into the futurethan cta, which thus could become the first kilometer-scale optical imager inastronomy.

1208.5686	surveys with the cherenkov telescope array	surveys open up unbiased discovery space and generate legacy datasets oflong-lasting value. one of the goals of imaging arrays of cherenkov telescopeslike cta is to survey areas of the sky for faint very high energy gamma-ray(vhe) sources, especially sources that would not have drawn attention were itnot for their vhe emission (e.g. the galactic "dark accelerators"). more thanhalf the currently known vhe sources are to be found in the galactic plane.using standard techniques, cta can carry out a survey of the region |l|&lt;60degrees, |b|&lt;2 degrees in 250 hr (1/4th the available time per year at onelocation) down to a uniform sensitivity of 3 mcrab (a "galactic plane survey").cta could also survey 1/4th of the sky down to a sensitivity of 20 mcrab in 370hr of observing time (an "all-sky survey"), which complements well the surveysby the fermi/lat at lower energies and extended air shower arrays at higherenergies. observations in (non-standard) divergent pointing mode may shortenthe "all-sky survey" time to about 100 hr with no loss in survey sensitivity.we present the scientific rationale for these surveys, their place in themulti-wavelength context, their possible impact and their feasibility. we findthat the galactic plane survey has the potential to detect hundreds of sources.implementing such a survey should be a major goal of cta. additionally, about adozen blazars, or counterparts to fermi/lat sources, are expected to bedetected by the all-sky survey, whose prime motivation is the search forextragalactic "dark accelerators".

1210.3215	binaries with the eyes of cta	the binary systems that have been detected in gamma rays have proven veryuseful to study high-energy processes, in particular particle acceleration,emission and radiation reprocessing, and the dynamics of the underlyingmagnetized flows. binary systems, either detected or potential gamma-rayemitters, can be grouped in different subclasses depending on the nature of thebinary components or the origin of the particle acceleration: the interactionof the winds of either a pulsar and a massive star or two massive stars;accretion onto a compact object and jet formation; and interaction of arelativistic outflow with the external medium. we evaluate the potentialitiesof an instrument like the cherenkov telescope array (cta) to study thenon-thermal physics of gamma-ray binaries, which requires the observation ofhigh-energy phenomena at different time and spatial scales. we analyze thecapability of cta, under different configurations, to probe the spectral,temporal and spatial behavior of gamma-ray binaries in the context of the knownor expected physics of these sources. cta will be able to probe with highspectral, temporal and spatial resolution the physical processes behind thegamma-ray emission in binaries, significantly increasing as well the number ofknown sources. this will allow the derivation of information on the particleacceleration and emission sites qualitatively better than what is currentlyavailable.

1307.3056	impact of e-elt laser light on cherenkov telescope array cameras	as one of the options, the cherenkov telescope array (cta) consortium isconsidering the possibility to install its southern array in chile, in theatacama desert. the envisaged site is situated about 5 km from the futureeuropean extremely large telescope (e-elt), which will operate 8 parallel dclasers emitting at 589.2 nm, to create an artificial 6.8 magnitude star at analtitude of 90 km. the guide stars are used for the adaptive optics of thetelescope. although having the artificial stars in the field-of-view of a ctatelescope would happen rather seldom, and can be avoided by coordinatedscheduling, the laser beams may cross the field-of-view of a telescope morefrequently and leave spurious light tracks, hence complicating the analysis ofthe shower images. we derive an approximate formula to estimate the expectednumber of photons from molecular and aerosol scattering of the laser light beaminto the field-of-view of a camera pixel. we then present several specificcases of laser influence on the cta camera pixels, based on the selecteddirection of the laser beam, using the expected quantum efficiency of thecamera photomultipliers at the given wavelength.

1307.3677	flashcam: a fully digital camera for the cherenkov telescope array	flashcam is a cherenkov camera development project centered around a fullydigital trigger and readout scheme with smart, digital signal processing, and a"horizontal" architecture for the electromechanical implementation. the fullydigital approach, based on commercial fadcs and fpgas as key components,provides the option to easily implement different types of triggers as well asdigitization and readout scenarios using identical hardware, by simply changingthe firmware on the fpgas. at the same time, a large dynamic range and highresolution of low-amplitude signals in a single readout channel per pixel isachieved using compression of high amplitude signals in the preamplifier andsignal processing in the fpga. the readout of the front-end modules into acamera server is ethernet-based using standard ethernet switches. in itscurrent implementation, data transfer and backend processing rates of ~3.8gbytes/sec have been achieved. together with the dead-time-free front end eventbuffering on the fpgas, this permits the cameras to operate at trigger rates ofup to several tens of khz.  in the horizontal architecture of flashcam, the photon detector plane (pdp),consisting of photon detectors, preamplifiers, high voltage-, control-, andmonitoring systems, is a self-contained unit, which is interfaced throughanalogue signal transmission to the digital readout system. the horizontalintegration of flashcam is expected not only to be more cost efficient, it alsoallows pdps with different types of photon detectors to be adapted to theflashcam readout system. this paper describes the flashcam concept, itsverification process, and its implementation for a 12 m class cta telescopewith pmt-based pdp.

1503.05481	strategy implementation for the cta atmospheric monitoring program	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) is the next generation facility ofimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes. it will reach unprecedentedsensitivity and energy resolution in very-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. ctawill detect cherenkov light emitted within an atmospheric shower of particlesinitiated by cosmic-gamma rays or cosmic rays entering the earth's atmosphere.from the combination of images the cherenkov light produces in the telescopes,one is able to infer the primary particle energy and direction. a correctenergy estimation can be thus performed only if the local atmosphere is wellcharacterized. the atmosphere not only affects the shower development itself,but also the cherenkov photon transmission from the emission point in theparticle shower, at about 10-20 km above the ground, to the detector. cherenkovlight on the ground is peaked in the uv-blue region, and therefore molecularand aerosol extinction phenomena are important. the goal of cta is to controlsystematics in energy reconstruction to better than 10%. for this reason, acareful and continuous monitoring and characterization of the atmosphere isrequired. in addition, cta will be operated as an observatory, with data madepublic along with appropriate analysis tools. high-level data quality can onlybe ensured if the atmospheric properties are consistently and continuouslytaken into account. in this contribution, we concentrate on discussing theimplementation strategy for the various atmospheric monitoring instrumentscurrently under discussion in cta. these includes raman lidars and ceilometers,stellar photometers and others available both from commercial providers andpublic research centres.

1508.06473	modern middleware for the data acquisition of the cherenkov telescope  array	the data acquisition system (daq) of the future cherenkov telescope array(cta) must be ef- ficient, modular and robust to be able to cope with the verylarge data rate of up to 550 gbps coming from many telescopes with differentcharacteristics. the use of modern middleware, namely zeromq and protocolbuffers, can help to achieve these goals while keeping the development effortto a reasonable level. protocol buffers are used as an on-line data for- mat,while zeromq is employed to communicate between processes. the daq will becontrolled and monitored by the alma common software (acs). protocol buffersfrom google are a way to define high-level data structures through an in-terface description language (idl) and a meta-compiler. zeromq is a middlewarethat augments the capabilities of tcp/ip sockets. it does not implement veryhigh-level features like those found in corba for example, but makes use ofsockets easier, more robust and almost as effective as raw tcp. the use ofthese two middlewares enabled us to rapidly develop a robust prototype of thedaq including data persistence to compressed fits files.

1508.06622	prospects on testing lorentz invariance violation with the cherenkov  telescope array	the assumption of lorentz invariance is one of the founding principles ofmodern physics and violation of that would have deep consequences to ourunderstanding of the universe. potential signatures of such a violation couldrange from energy dependent dispersion introduced into a light curve to achange in the photon-photon pair production threshold that changes the expectedopacity of the universe. astronomical sources of very high energy (vhe) photonscan be used as test beams to probe fundamental physics phenomena, however, sucheffects would likely be small and need to be disentangled from intrinsic sourcephysics processes. the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will be the nextgeneration ground based observatory of vhe photons. it will have improved fluxsensitivity, a lower energy threshold (tens of gev), broader energy coverage(nearly 5 decades) and improved energy resolution (better than 10\% over muchof the energy range) compared to current facilities in addition to excellenttime resolution for short timescale and rapidly varying phenomena. the expectedsensitivity of this facility leads to us to examine in this contribution thekinds of limits to lorentz invariance violation (liv) that we could expect toobtain on vhe observations of active galactic nuclei (agn), gamma ray bursts(grbs) and pulsars with cta. with a statistical sample and wide variety ofsources cta has the potential to set model independent limits.

1509.02345	development of a sipm camera for a schwarzschild-couder cherenkov  telescope for the cherenkov telescope array	we present the development of a novel 11328 pixel silicon photomultiplier(sipm) camera for use with a ground-based cherenkov telescope withschwarzschild-couder optics as a possible medium-sized telescope for thecherenkov telescope array (cta). the finely pixelated camera samples air-showerimages with more than twice the optical resolution of cameras that are used incurrent cherenkov telescopes. advantages of the higher resolution will be abetter event reconstruction yielding improved background suppression andangular resolution of the reconstructed gamma-ray events, which is crucial inmorphology studies of, for example, galactic particle accelerators and thesearch for gamma-ray halos around extragalactic sources. packing such a largenumber of pixels into an area of only half a square meter and having a fastreadout directly attached to the back of the sensors is a challenging task. forthe prototype camera development, sipms from hamamatsu with through silicon via(tsv) technology are used. we give a status report of the camera design andhighlight a number of technological advancements that made this developmentpossible.

1509.02681	the arcade raman lidar system for the cherenkov telescope array	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) is the next generation of ground-basedvery high energy gamma-ray instruments; the facility will be organized in twoarrays, one for each hemisphere. the atmospheric calibration of the ctatelescopes is a critical task. the atmosphere affects the measured cherenkovyield in several ways: the air-shower development itself, the variation of thecherenkov angle with altitude, the loss of photons due to scattering andabsorption of cherenkov light out of the camera field-of-view and thescattering of photons into the camera. in this scenario, aerosols are the mostvariable atmospheric component in time and space and therefore need acontinuous monitoring. lidars are among the most used instruments inatmospheric physics to measure the aerosol attenuation profiles of light. thearcade lidar system is a very compact and portable raman lidar system that hasbeen built within the firb 2010 grant and is currently taking data in lamar,colorado. the arcade lidar is proposed to operate at the cta sites with thegoal of making a first survey of the aerosol conditions of the selected siteand to use it as a calibrated benchmark for the other lidars that will beinstalled on site. it is proposed for cta that the arcade lidar will be firstupgraded in italy and then tested in parallel to a lidar of the earlinetnetwork in l'aquila. upgrades include the addition of the water vapour ramanchannel to the receiver and the use of new and better performing electronics.it is proposed that the upgraded system will travel to and characterize bothcta sites, starting from the first selected site in 2016.
