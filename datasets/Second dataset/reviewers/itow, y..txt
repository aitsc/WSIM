0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

0708.1066	observation of the first gravitational microlensing event in a sparse  stellar field : the tago event	we report the observation of the first gravitational microlensing event in asparse stellar field, involving the brightest (v=11.4 mag) andclosest (~ 1 kpc)source star to date. this event was discovered by an amateurastronomer, a.tago, on 2006 october 31 as a transient brightening, by ~4.5 mag during a ~15day period, of a normal a-type star (gsc 3656-1328) in the cassiopeiaconstellation. analysis of both spectroscopic observations and the light curveindicates that this event was caused by gravitational microlensing rather thanan intrinsically variable star. discovery of this single event over a 30 yearperiod is roughly consistent with the expected microlensing rate for the wholesky down to v = 12 mag stars. however, the probability for finding events withsuch a high magnification (~ 50) is much smaller, by a factor ~1/50, whichimplies that the true event rate may be higher than expected. this discoveryindicates the potential of all sky variability surveys, employing frequentsampling by telescopes with small apertures and wide fields of view, forfinding such rare transient events, and using the observations to exploregalactic disk structure and search for exo-planets.

1006.1396	determining the physical lens parameters of the binary gravitational  microlensing event moa-2009-blg-016	we report the result of the analysis of the light curve of the microlensingevent moa-2009-blg-016. the light curve is characterized by a short-durationanomaly near the peak and an overall asymmetry. we find that the peak anomalyis due to a binary companion to the primary lens and the asymmetry of the lightcurve is explained by the parallax effect caused by the acceleration of theobserver over the course of the event due to the orbital motion of the eartharound the sun. in addition, we detect evidence for the effect of the finitesize of the source near the peak of the event, which allows us to measure theangular einstein radius of the lens system. the einstein radius combined withthe microlens parallax allows us to determine the total mass of the lens andthe distance to the lens. we identify three distinct classes of degeneratesolutions for the binary lens parameters, where two are manifestations of thepreviously identified degeneracies of close/wide binaries and positive/negativeimpact parameters, while the third class is caused by the symmetric cycloidshape of the caustic. we find that, for the best-fit solution, the estimatedmass of the lower-mass component of the binary is (0.04 +- 0.01) m_sun,implying a brown-dwarf companion. however, there exists a solution that isworse only by \delta\chi^2 ~ 3 for which the mass of the secondary is above thehydrogen-burning limit. unfortunately, resolving these two degenerate solutionswill be difficult as the relative lens-source proper motions for both aresimilar and small (~ 1 mas/yr) and thus the lens will remain blended with thesource for the next several decades.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1403.3092	candidate gravitational microlensing events for future direct lens  imaging	the mass of the lenses giving rise to galactic microlensing events can beconstrained by measuring the relative lens-source proper motion and lens flux.the flux of the lens can be separated from that of the source, companions tothe source, and unrelated nearby stars with high-resolution images taken whenthe lens and source are spatially resolved. for typical ground-based adaptiveoptics (ao) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately longtime baselines or high relative proper motions. we provide a list ofmicrolensing events toward the galactic bulge with high relative lens-sourceproper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens masswith future high-resolution imaging. we investigate all events from 2004 --2013 that display detectable finite-source effects, a feature that allows us tomeasure the proper motion. in total, we present 20 events with mu &gt;~ 8 mas/yr.of these, 14 were culled from previous analyses while 6 are new, includingogle-2004-blg-368, moa-2005-blg-36, ogle-2012-blg-0211, ogle-2012-blg-0456,moa-2012-blg-532, and moa-2013-blg-029. in &lt;~12 years the lens and source ofeach event will be sufficiently separated for ground-based telescopes with aosystems or space telescopes to resolve each component and further characterizethe lens system. furthermore, for the most recent events, comparison of thelens flux estimates from images taken immediately to those estimated fromimages taken when the lens and source are resolved can be used to empiricallycheck the robustness of the single-epoch method currently being used toestimate lens masses for many events.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1502.06663	reanalyses of anomalous gravitational microlensing events in the  ogle-iii early warning system database with combined data	we reanalyze microlensing events in the published list of anomalous eventsthat were observed from the ogle lensing survey conducted during 2004-2008period. in order to check the existence of possible degenerate solutions andextract extra information, we conduct analyses based on combined data fromother survey and follow-up observation and consider higher-order effects. amongthe analyzed events, we present analyses of 8 events for which either newsolutions are identified or additional information is obtained. we find thatthe previous binary-source interpretations of 5 events are better interpretedby binary-lens models. these events include ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2007-blg-159, ogle-2007-blg-491, ogle-2008-blg-143, and ogle-2008-blg-210.with additional data covering caustic crossings, we detect finite-sourceeffects for 6 events including ogle-2006-blg-215, ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2006-blg-450, ogle-2008-blg-143, ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513.among them, we are able to measure the einstein radii of 3 events for whichmulti-band data are available. these events are ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513. for ogle-2008-blg-143, we detecthigher-order effect induced by the changes of the observer's position caused bythe orbital motion of the earth around the sun. in addition, we presentdegenerate solutions resulting from the known close/wide or eclipticdegeneracy. finally, we note that the masses of the binary companions of thelenses of ogle-2006-blg-450 and ogle-2008-blg-210 are in the brown-dwarfregime.

1503.03505	measurement of very forward neutron energy spectra for 7 tev  proton--proton collisions at the large hadron collider	the large hadron collider forward (lhcf) experiment is designed to use thelhc to verify the hadronic-interaction models used in cosmic-ray physics.forward baryon production is one of the crucial points to understand thedevelopment of cosmic-ray showers. we report the neutron-energy spectra for lhc$\sqrt{s}$ = 7 tev proton--proton collisions with the pseudo-rapidity $\eta$ranging from 8.81 to 8.99, from 8.99 to 9.22, and from 10.76 to infinity. themeasured energy spectra obtained from the two independent calorimeters of arm1and arm2 show the same characteristic feature before unfolding the differencein the detector responses. we unfolded the measured spectra by using themultidimensional unfolding method based on bayesian theory, and the unfoldedspectra were compared with current hadronic-interaction models. the qgsjetii-03 model predicts a high neutron production rate at the highestpseudo-rapidity range similar to our results and the dpmjet 3.04 modeldescribes our results well at the lower pseudo-rapidity ranges. however nomodel perfectly explains the experimental results in the whole pseudo-rapidityrange. the experimental data indicate the most abundant neutron production raterelative to the photon production, which does not agree with predictions of themodels.

1505.06037	moa-2007-blg-197: exploring the brown dwarf desert	we present the analysis of moa-2007-blg-197lb, the first brown dwarfcompanion to a sun-like star detected through gravitational microlensing. theevent was alerted and followed-up photometrically by a network of telescopesfrom the planet, moa, and ufun collaborations, and observed at high angularresolution using the naco instrument at the vlt. from the modelling of themicrolensing light curve, we derived the binary lens separation in einsteinradius units (s~1.13) and a mass ratio of (4.732+/-0.020)x10^{-2}. annualparallax, lens orbital motion and finite source effects were included in themodels. to recover the lens system's physical parameters, we combined theresulting light curve best-fit parameters with (j,h,ks) magnitudes obtainedwith vlt naco and calibrated using irsf and 2mass data. we derived a lens totalmass of 0.86+/-0.04 msun and a lens distance of 4.2+/-0.3 kpc. we find that thecompanion of moa-2007-blg-197l is a brown dwarf of 41+/-2 mjup observed at aprojected separation of 4.3+/-0.1 au, and orbits a 0.82+/-0.04 msun g-k dwarfstar. we study the statistical properties of this population of brown dwarfsdetected by microlensing, transit, radial velocity, and direct imaging (most ofthese objects orbit solar-type stars), and we performed a two-dimensional,non-parametric probability density distribution fit to the data, which draws astructured brown dwarf landscape. we confirm the existence of a region that isstrongly depleted in objects at short periods and intermediate masses (p&lt;30 d,m~30-60 mjup), but also find an accumulation of objects around p~500 d and m~20mjup, as well as another depletion region at long orbital periods (p&gt;500 d) andhigh masses (m&gt;50 mjup). while these data provide important clues on mechanismsof brown dwarfs formation, more data are needed to establish their relativeimportance, in particular as a function of host star mass.

0806.0025	a low-mass planet with a possible sub-stellar-mass host in microlensing  event moa-2007-blg-192	we report the detection of an extrasolar planet of mass ratio q ~ 2 x 10^(-4)in microlensing event moa-2007-blg-192. the best fit microlensing model showsboth the microlensing parallax and finite source effects, and these can becombined to obtain the lens masses of m = 0.060 (+0.028 -0.021) m_sun for theprimary and m = 3.3 (+4.9 -1.6) m_earth for the planet. however, theobservational coverage of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, andthe radius of the source was estimated without the benefit of a source starcolor measurement. as a result, the 2-sigma limits on the mass ratio and finitesource measurements are weak. nevertheless, the microlensing parallax signalclearly favors a sub-stellar mass planetary host, and the measurement of finitesource effects in the light curve supports this conclusion. adaptive opticsimages taken with the very large telescope (vlt) naco instrument are consistentwith a lens star that is either a brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of themain sequence. follow-up vlt and/or hubble space telescope (hst) observationswill either confirm that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-masslens star and enable a precise determination of its mass. in either case, thelens star, moa-2007-blg-192l, is the lowest mass primary known to have acompanion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet, moa-2007-blg-192lb, isprobably the lowest mass exoplanet found to date, aside from the lowest masspulsar planet.

0809.2997	microlensing event moa-2007-blg-400: exhuming the buried signature of a  cool, jovian-mass planet	we report the detection of the cool, jovian-mass planet moa-2007-blg-400lb.the planet was detected in a high-magnification microlensing event (with peakmagnification a_max = 628) in which the primary lens transited the source,resulting in a dramatic smoothing of the peak of the event. the angular extentof the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller thanthe angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is alsosmoothed out by the finite source size. thus the deviation from a single-lensfit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). nevertheless, we demonstratethat the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertainedfrom the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairlyprecise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the largesignificance (\delta\chi^2=1070) of the detection. the planet/star projectedseparation is subject to a strong close/wide degeneracy, leading to twoindistinguishable solutions that differ in separation by a factor of ~8.5.upper limits on flux from the lens constrain its mass to be m &lt; 0.75 m_sun(assuming it is a main-sequence star). a bayesian analysis that includes allavailable observational constraints indicates a primary in the galactic bulgewith a mass of ~0.2-0.5 m_sun and thus a planet mass of ~ 0.5-1.3 m_jupiter.the separation and equilibrium temperature are ~0.6-1.1au (~5.3-9.7au) and~103k (~34k) for the close (wide) solution. if the primary is a main-sequencestar, follow-up observations would enable the detection of its light and so ameasurement of its mass and distance.
