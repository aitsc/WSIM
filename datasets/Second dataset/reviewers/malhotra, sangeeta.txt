0904.2032	galaxy assembly and smbh/agn-growth from cosmic dawn to the end of  reionization	[abridged] we propose a tiered, uv--near-ir, cosmological broad- andmedium-band imaging and grism survey that covers ~10 deg^2 in two epochs tom_ab=28, ~3 deg^2 in seven epochs to m_ab=28, and ~1 deg^2 in 20 epochs tom_ab=30 mag. such a survey is an essential complement to jwst surveys (&lt;~0.1deg^2 to m_ab&lt;~31 mag at lambda&gt;1100nm and z&gt;~8). we aim to: (1) understand inhow galaxies formed from perturbations in the primordial density field bystudying faint ly\alpha-emitting and lyman-break galaxies at 5.5&lt;~z&lt;~8 andtrace the metal-enrichment of the igm; (2) measure the evolution of the faintend of the galaxy luminosity function (lf) from z~8 to z~0 by mapping theramp-up of popii star formation, (dwarf) galaxy formation and assembly, andhence, the objects that likely completed the h-reionization at z~6; (3)directly study the lambda&lt;91.2nm escape fractions of galaxies and weak agn fromz~4.0--2.5, when the he reionization finished; (4) measure the mass- andenvironment-dependent galaxy assembly process from z~5 to z~0, combiningaccurate (sigma_z/(1+z) &lt;~ 0.02) photo-z's with spatially resolved stellarpopulations and kpc-scale structure for &gt;~5x10^6 galaxies; (5) trace thestrongly epoch-dependent galaxy merger rate and constrain how dark energyaffected galaxy assembly and the growth of smbhs; (6) study &gt;~10^5 weakagn/feeding smbhs in the faint-end of the qso lf, over 10 deg^2 and measure howthe growth of smbhs kept pace with galaxy assembly and spheroid growth, and howthis process was shaped by various feedback processes over cosmic times sincez~8. the proposed study is not feasible with current instrumentation but arguesfor a wide-field (&gt;~250 arcmin^2), high-resolution (&lt;~0.02--0.11 [300--1700nm]), uv--near-ir imaging facility on a 4m-class space observatory.

0906.0985	improved photometric redshifts with surface luminosity priors	we apply bayesian statistics with prior probabilities of galaxy surfaceluminosity (sl) to improve photometric redshifts. we apply the method to asample of 1266 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the goods north andsouth fields at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 2.0. we start with spectrophotometric redshifts(spzs) based on probing evolution and reionization spectroscopically grismspectra, which cover a wavelength range of 6000-9000a, combined with(u)bviz(jhk) broadband photometry in the goods fields. the accuracy of spzredshifts is estimated to be \sigma (\delta(z))=0.035 with an systematic offsetof -0.026, where \delta(z)=\delta z / (1+z), for galaxies in redshift range of0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.25. the addition of the sl prior probability helps break thedegeneracy of spz redshifts between low redshift 4000 a break galaxies andhigh-redshift lyman break galaxies which are mostly catastrophic outliers. forthe 1138 galaxies at z &lt; 1.6, the fraction of galaxies with redshift deviation\delta (z) &gt; 0.2 is reduced from 15.0% to 10.4%, while the rms scatter of thefractional redshift error does not change much.

0906.4554	a plethora of agn among lyman alpha galaxies at low redshift	we investigate the fraction of z ~ 0.3 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes)which host active galactic nucleus activity, which is typically from 1 - 5% at2 &lt; z &lt; 6. using optical spectroscopy of 23 laes at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.45 selectedwith galex uv data, we probe for agn with a variety of methods, including linewidths, diagnostic line ratios, high-ionization emission, infrared activity andx-ray luminosity. we found that our sample of low-redshift laes has an agnfraction of 43 ^{+18}{-26}%, significantly higher than at high redshift. whileprevious results have shown that low-redshift laes have a lower space densitythan their high-redshift analogs, these results show that star-forming laes atlow-redshift are rarer still. accounting for differences in available agnclassification methods, we conclude that rest-frame optical spectroscopy isnecessary to identify low-luminosity agns in laes at high redshift, and thatlimits on the x-ray flux are necessary to determine the extent to which the agncontaminates the lyman alpha fluxes.

0906.5159	a physical model of lyman alpha emitters	we present a simple physical model for populating dark matter halos withlyman alpha emiiters(laes) and predict the physical properties of laes atz~3-7. the central tenet of this model is that the ly-alpha luminosity isproportional to the star formation rate (sfr) which is directly related to thehalo mass accretion rate. the only free parameter in our model is then thestar-formation efficiency (sfe). an efficiency of 2.5% provides the best-fit tothe ly-alpha luminosity function (lf) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this sfe toconstruct ly-alpha lfs at other redshifts. our model reproduce the ly-alphalfs, stellar ages, sfr ~1-10; msun/yr, stellar masses ~ 10^7-10^8 msun and theclustering properties of laes at z~3-7. we find the spatial correlation lengthsro ~ 3-6 mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. finally, we estimate thefield-to-field variation ~ 30% for current volume and flux limited surveys,again consistent with observations. our results suggest that the starformation, and hence ly-alpha emission in laes is powered by the accretion ofnew material, and that the physical properties of laes do not evolvesignificantly over a wide range of redshifts. relating the accreted mass,rather than the total mass of halos, to the ly-alpha luminosity of laesnaturally gives rise to the duty cycle of laes.

0908.0739	early-type galaxies in the pears survey: probing the stellar populations  at moderate redshift	using hst/acs slitless grism spectra from the pears program, we study thestellar populations of morphologically selected early-type galaxies in thegoods north and south fields. the sample - extracted from a visualclassification of the (v2.0) hst/acs images and restricted to redshifts z&gt;0.4 -comprises 228 galaxies (f775w&lt;24 abmag) out to z~1.3 over 320 arcmin2, with amedian redshift zm=0.75. this work significantly increases our previous samplefrom the grapes survey in the hudf (18 galaxies over ~11 arcmin2; pasquali etal. 2006b). the grism data allow us to separate the sample into `red' and`blue' spectra, with the latter comprising 15% of the total. three differentgrids of models parameterising the star formation history are used to fit thelow-resolution spectra. over the redshift range of the sample - correspondingto a cosmic age between 5 and 10 gyr - we find a strong correlation betweenstellar mass and average age, whereas the **spread** of ages (defined by therms of the distribution) is roughly ~1 gyr and independent of stellar mass. thebest-fit parameters suggest it is formation epoch and not formation timescale,that best correlates with mass in early-type galaxies. this result - along withthe recently observed lack of evolution of the number density of massivegalaxies - motivates the need for a channel of (massive) galaxy formationbypassing any phase in the blue cloud, as suggested by the simulations of dekelet al.

0707.4182	a luminosity function of lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift 4.5	we present a catalog of 59 z=4.5 lyman alpha emitting galaxiesspectroscopically confirmed in a campaign of keck/deimos follow-up observationsto candidates selected in the large area lyman alpha (lala) narrow-band imagingsurvey. we targeted 97 candidates for spectroscopic follow-up; by accountingfor the variety of conditions under which we performed spectroscopy, weestimate a selection reliability of about 76%. together with our previoussample of keck/lris confirmations, the 59 sources confirmed herein bring thetotal catalog to 73 spectroscopically confirmed z=4.5 lyman alpha emittinggalaxies in the 0.7 square degrees covered by the lala imaging. as with thekeck/lris sample, we find that a non-negligible fraction of the confirmed lymanalpha lines have rest-frame equivalent widths (w_{rest}) which exceed themaximum predicted for normal stellar populations: 17% -- 31% (93% confidence)of the detected galaxies show w_{rest} &gt; 190 aa, and 12% -- 27% (90%confidence) show w_{rest} &gt; 240 aa. we construct a luminosity function of z=4.5lyman alpha emission lines for comparison to lyman alpha luminosity functionsspanning 3.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.6. we find no significant evidence for lyman alphaluminosity function evolution from z ~ 3 to z ~ 6. this result supports theconclusion that the intergalactic medium remains largely reionized from thelocal universe out to z=6.5. it is somewhat at odds with the pronounced drop inthe cosmic star formation rate density recently measured between z~3 and z~6 incontinuum-selected lyman-break galaxies, and therefore potentially sheds lighton the relationship between the two populations.

1006.1895	first spectroscopic measurements of [oiii] emission from lyman-alpha  selected field galaxies at z ~ 3.1	we present the first spectroscopic measurements of the [oiii] 5007 a line intwo z ~ 3.1 lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (laes) using the new near-infraredinstrument lucifer1 on the 8.4m large binocular telescope (lbt). we alsodescribe the optical imaging and spectroscopic observations used to identifythese lya emitting galaxies. using the [oiii] line we have measured accuratesystemic redshifts for these two galaxies, and discovered a velocity offsetbetween the [oiii] and ly-alpha lines in both, with the lya line peaking 342and 125 km/s redward of the systemic velocity. these velocity offsets implythat there are powerful outflows in high-redshift laes. they also ease thetransmission of lya photons through the interstellar medium and intergalacticmedium around the galaxies. by measuring these offsets directly, we can refineboth lya-based tests for reionization, and lya luminosity function measurementswhere the lya forest affects the blue wing of the line. our work also providesthe first direct constraints on the strength of the [oiii] line inhigh-redshift laes. we find [oiii] fluxes of 7 and 36 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2in two z ~ 3.1 laes. these lines are strong enough to dominate broad-band fluxmeasurements that include the line (in thiscase, k_s band photometry). spectralenergy distribution fits that do not account for the lines would thereforeoverestimate the 4000 a (and/or balmer) break strength in such galaxies, andhence also the ages and stellar masses of such high-z galaxies.

1006.3071	the luminosity function of lyman alpha emitters at redshift z=7.7	lyman alpha (lya) emission lines should be attenuated in a neutralintergalactic medium (igm). therefore the visibility of lya emitters at highredshifts can serve as a valuable probe of reionization at about the 50% level.we present an imaging search for z=7.7 lya emitting galaxies using anultra-narrowband filter (filter width= 9a) on the newfirm imager at the kittpeak national observatory. we found four candidate lya emitters in a surveyvolume of 1.4 x 10^4 mpc^3, with a line flux brighter than 6x10^-18 erg/cm^2/s(5 sigma in 2" aperture). we also performed a detailed monte-carlo simulationincorporating the instrumental effects to estimate the expected number of lyaemitters in our survey, and found that we should expect to detect one lyaemitter, assuming a non-evolving lya luminosity function (lf) between z=6.5 andz=7.7. even if one of the present candidates is spectroscopically confirmed asa z~8 lya emitter, it would indicate that there is no significant evolution ofthe lya lf from z=3.1 to z~8. while firm conclusions would need bothspectroscopic confirmations and larger surveys to boost the number counts ofgalaxies, we successfully demonstrate the feasibility of sensitivenear-infrared (1.06 um) narrow-band searches using custom filters designed toavoid the oh emission lines that make up most of the sky background.

0708.4226	effects of dust geometry in lyman alpha galaxies at z = 4.4	equivalent widths (ews) observed in high-redshift lyman alpha galaxies couldbe stronger than the ew intrinsic to the stellar population if dust is presentresiding in clumps in the inter-stellar medium (ism). in this scenario,continuum photons could be extinguished while the lyman alpha photons would beresonantly scattered by the clumps, eventually escaping the galaxy. weinvestigate this radiative transfer scenario with a new sample of six lymanalpha galaxy candidates in the goods cdf-s, selected at z = 4.4 withground-based narrow-band imaging obtained at ctio. grism spectra from the hstpears survey confirm that three objects are at z = 4.4, and that another objectcontains an active galactic nuclei (agn). if we assume the other five (non-agn)objects are at z = 4.4, they have rest-frame ews from 47 -- 190 a. we presentresults of stellar population studies of these objects, constraining theirrest-frame uv with hst and their rest-frame optical with spitzer. out of thefour objects which we analyzed, three objects were best-fit to contain stellarpopulations with ages on the order of 1 myr and stellar masses from 3 - 10 x10^8 solar masses, with dust in the amount of a_1200 = 0.9 - 1.8 residing in aquasi-homogeneous distribution. however, one object (with a rest ew ~ 150 a)was best fit by an 800 myr, 6.6 x 10^9 solar mass stellar population with asmaller amount of dust (a_1200 = 0.4) attenuating the continuum only. in thisobject, the ew was enhanced ~ 50% due to this dust. this suggests that large ewlyman alpha galaxies are a diverse population. preferential extinction of thecontinuum in a clumpy ism deserves further investigation as a possible cause ofthe overabundance of large-ew objects that have been seen in narrow-bandsurveys in recent years.

1012.4010	dust extinction and metallicities of star-forming lyman alpha emitting  galaxies at low redshift	we present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of 12galex-discovered star-forming lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 0.3.we measure the emission line fluxes from these galaxies by fitting theirobserved spectra to stellar population models in order to correct forunderlying stellar absorption. we revisit earlier stellar population modelfitting results, finding that excluding now-known agns lowers the typicalstellar population age and stellar mass of this sample to ~ 300 myr and ~ 4 x10^9 msol, respectively. we calculate their dust extinction using the balmerdecrement, and find a typical visual attenuation of av ~ 0.3 mag, similar tothat seen in many high-redshift laes. comparing the ratio of lyalpha/halpha andthe lyman alpha equivalent widths to the measured dust extinction, we find thatthe isms in these objects appear to be neither enhancing nor seriouslyattenuating the lyman alpha equivalent widths, as would be the case in aquasi-clumpy ism. lastly, we perform a detailed analysis of the gas-phasemetallicities of these galaxies, and we find that most galaxies in our samplehave z &lt; 0.4 zsol. we find that at a fixed stellar mass, these low-redshift laeanalogs are offset by ~ 0.6 dex lower in metallicity from the general galaxypopulation at similar redshifts based on the local mass-metallicityrelationship. this implies that galaxies with lyman alpha in emission may besystematically more metal poor than star-forming galaxies at the same stellarmass and redshift, similar to preliminary results at z ~ 2.

1106.2811	x-ray constraints on the lyman-alpha escape fraction	we have coadded x-ray flux of all known lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the 4msec chandra deep field south (cdf-s) region, to place sensitive upper limitson the average unobscured star-formation rate (sfr_x) in these galaxies. a verysmall fraction of lyman-alpha galaxies in the field are individually detectedin the x-rays, implying a low fraction of agn activity. after excluding the fewx-ray detected laes, we stack the undetected laes located in the 4 ms cdf-sdata and 250 ks extended cdf-s (ecdfs) data, and compute a 1-\sigma upper limiton sfr_x &lt; 14, 28, 28, 140, 440, 880 m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ for laes located at z= 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.5, 5.7 and 6.5, respectively. the upper limit of sfr_x inlaes can be then be compared to sfr$_{ly\alpha}$ derived from lyman-alpha lineand thus can constrain on the lyman-alpha escape fraction($f^{esc}_{ly\alpha}$). we derive a lower limit on f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 14%(84 % confidence level, 1-\sigma lower limit) for laes at redshift z ~ 2.1 andz ~ 3.1-3.2. at z &gt; 4, the current lae samples are not of sufficient size toconstrain sfr_x well. by averaging all the laes at z&gt; 2, the x-raynon-detection constrains f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 17% (84 % confidence level,1-\sigma lower limit), and rejects f(lyman-alpha escape) &lt; 5.7% at the 99.87%confidence level from 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.5.

1106.2816	sizing up lyman-alpha and lyman break galaxies	we show that populations of high redshift galaxies grow more luminous as theygrow in linear size. this is because the brightness per unit area has adistinct upper limit due to the self-regulating nature of star-formation. as acorollary, we show that the observed increase in characteristic luminosity oflyman break galaxies (l*) with time can be explained by their increase in size,which scales as 1/h(z). in contrast, lyman-alpha selected galaxies have acharacteristic, constant, small size between redshift z=2.25 and 6.5. coupledwith a characteristic surface brightness, this can explain their non-evolvingultraviolet continuum luminosity function. this compact physical size seems tobe a critical determining factor in whether a galaxy will show lyman-alphaemission. we base these conclusions on new size measurements for a sample ofabout 170 lyman-alpha selected galaxies with hubble space telescope broad-bandimaging, over the redshift range 2.25 &lt; z &lt; 6. we combine these with a similarnumber of lyman-alpha selected galaxies with half-light radii from theliterature, and derive surface brightnesses for the entire combined sample.

1106.6055	searching for z~7.7 lyman alpha emitters in the cosmos field with  newfirm	the study of ly-alpha emission in the high-redshift universe is a usefulprobe of the epoch of reionization, as the ly-alpha line should be attenuatedby the intergalactic medium (igm) at low to moderate neutral hydrogenfractions. here we present the results of a deep and wide imaging search forly-alpha emitters in the cosmos field. we have used two ultra-narrowbandfilters (filter width of ~8-9 {\deg}a) on the newfirm camera, installed on themayall 4m telescope at kitt peak national observatory, in order to isolately-alpha emitters at z = 7.7; such ultra-narrowband imaging searches haveproved to be excellent at detecting ly-alpha emitters. we found 5-sigmadetections of four candidate ly-alpha emitters in a survey volume of 2.8 x 10^4mpc^3 (total survey area ~760 arcmin^2). each candidate has a line flux greaterthan 8 x 10^-18 erg s^-1 cm^-2. using these results to construct a luminosityfunction and comparing to previously established ly-alpha luminosity functionsat z = 5.7 and z = 6.5, we find no conclusive evidence for evolution of theluminosity function between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7. statistical monte carlosimulations suggest that half of these candidates are real z = 7.7 targets, andspectroscopic follow-up will be required to verify the redshift of thesecandidates. however, our results are consistent with no strong evolution in theneutral hydrogen fraction of the igm between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7, even if onlyone or two of the z = 7.7 candidates are spectroscopically confirmed.

1107.2648	predicting the merger fraction of lyman alpha emitters from redshift z~3  to z~7	rapid mass assembly, likely from mergers or smooth accretion, has beenpredicted to play a vital role in star-formation in high-redshift lyman-alpha(lya) emitters. here we predict the major merger, minor merger, and smoothaccreting lya emitter fraction from z~3 to z~7 using a large dark mattersimulation, and a simple physical model that is successful in reproducing manyobservations over this large redshift range. the central tenet of this model,different from many of the earlier models, is that the star-formation in lyaemitters is proportional to the mass accretion rate rather than the total halomass. we find that at z~3, nearly 35% of the lya emitters accrete their massthrough major (3:1) mergers, and this fraction increases to about 50% at z~7.this imply that the star-formation in a large fraction of high-redshift lyaemitters is driven by mergers. while there is discrepancy between the modelpredictions and observed merger fractions, some of this difference (~15%) canbe attributed to the mass-ratio used to define a merger in the simulation. wepredict that future, deeper observations which use a 3:1 definition of majormergers will find &gt;30% major merger fraction of lya emitters at redshifts &gt;3.

1207.5151	formation of metal-poor globular clusters in lyman alpha emitting  galaxies in the early universe	the size, mass, luminosity, and space density of lyman-alpha emitting (lae)galaxies observed at intermediate to high redshift agree with expectations forthe properties of galaxies that formed metal-poor halo globular clusters (gcs).the low metallicity of these clusters is the result of their formation inlow-mass galaxies. metal-poor gcs could enter spiral galaxies along with theirdwarf galaxy hosts, unlike metal-rich gcs which form in the spirals themselves.considering an initial gc mass larger than the current mass to account formultiple stellar populations, and considering the additional clusters that arelikely to form with massive clusters, we estimate that each gc with a masstoday greater than 2x10^5 msun was likely to have formed among a total stellarmass ~3x10^7 msun, a molecular mass ~10^9 msun, and 10^7 to 10^9 msun of olderstars, depending on the relative gas fraction. the star formation rate wouldhave been several msun/yr lasting for ~10^7 yrs, and the lyman-alpha luminositywould have been ~10^42 erg/s. integrating the lae galaxy luminosity functionabove this minimum, considering the average escape probability for lyalphaphotons (25%), and then dividing by the probability that a dwarf galaxy isobserved in the lae phase (0.4%), we find agreement between the co-moving spacedensity of laes and the average space density of metal-poor globular clusterstoday. the local galaxy wlm, with its early starburst and old gc, could be anlae remnant that did not get into a galaxy halo because of its remote location.

1301.0622	[oiii] emission and gas kinematics in a lyman-alpha blob at z ~ 3.1	we present spectroscopic measurements of the [oiii] emission line from twosubregions of strong lyman-alpha emission in a radio-quiet lyman-alpha blob(lab). the blob under study is lab1 (steidel et al. 2000) at z ~ 3.1, and the[oiii] detections are from the two lyman break galaxies embedded in the blobhalo. the [oiii] measurements were made with lucifer on the 8.4m largebinocular telescope and nirspec on 10m keck telescope. comparing the redshiftof the [oiii] measurements to lyman-alpha redshifts from sauron (weijmans etal. 2010) allows us to take a step towards understanding the kinematics of thegas in the blob. using both lucifer and nirspec we find velocity offsetsbetween the [oiii] and lyman-alpha redshifts that are modestly negative orconsistent with 0 km/s in both subregions studied (ranging from -72 +/- 42 --+6 +/- 33 km/s). a negative offset means lyman-alpha is blueshifted withrespect to [oiii], a positive offset then implies lyman-alpha is redshiftedwith respect to [oiii]. these results may imply that outflows are not primarilyresponsible for lyman alpha escape in this lab, since outflows are generallyexpected to produce a positive velocity offset (mclinden et al. 2011). inaddition, we present an [oiii] line flux upper limit on a third region of lab1,a region that is unassociated with any underlying galaxy. we find that the[oiii] upper limit from the galaxy-unassociated region of the blob is at least1.4 -- 2.5 times fainter than the [oiii] flux from one of the lbg-associatedregions and has an [oiii] to lyman-alpha ratio measured at least 1.9 -- 3.4times smaller than the same ratio measured from one of the lbgs.

1301.3140	the dynamical masses, densities, and star formation scaling relations of  lyman alpha galaxies	we present the first dynamical mass measurements for lyman alpha galaxies athigh redshift, based on velocity dispersion measurements from rest-frameoptical emission lines and size measurements from hst imaging, for a sample ofnine galaxies drawn from four surveys. these measurements enable us to studythe nature of lyman alpha galaxies in the context of galaxy scaling relations.the resulting dynamical masses range from 1e9 to 1e10 solar masses. we also fitstellar population models to our sample, and use them to plot the lyman alphasample on a stellar mass vs. line width relation. overall, the lyman alphagalaxies follow well the scaling relation established by observing star forminggalaxies at lower redshift (and without regard for lyman alpha emission),though in 1/3 of the lyman alpha galaxies, lower-mass fits are also acceptable.in all cases, the dynamical masses agree with established stellarmass-linewidthrelation. using the dynamical masses as an upper limit on gas mass, we showthat lyman alpha galaxies resemble starbursts (rather than "normal" galaxies)in the relation between gas mass surface density and star formation activity,in spite of relatively modest star formation rates. finally, we examine themass densities of these galaxies, and show that their future evolution likelyrequires dissipational ("wet") merging. in short, we find that lyman alphagalaxies are low mass cousins of larger starbursts.

1309.1169	high-redshift galaxies with large ionization parameters	motivated by recent observations of galaxies dominated by emission lines,which show evidence of being metal poor with young stellar populations, wepresent calculations of multiple model grids with a range of abundances,ionization parameters, and stellar ages, finding that the predicted spectralline diagnostics are heavily dependent on all three parameters. these new modelgrids extend the ionization parameter to larger values than typically explored.we compare these model predictions with previous observations of such objects,including two new lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (lae) that we have observed.our models give improved constraints on the metallicity and ionizationparameter of these previously studied objects, as we are now able to considerhigh ionization parameter models. however, similar to previous work, thesemodels have difficulty predicting large line diagnostics for high ionizationpotential species, requiring future work refining the modelling of fuv photons.our model grids are also able to constrain the metallicity and ionizationparameter of our laes, and give constraints on their ly$\alpha$ escapefractions, all of which are consistent with recent lower redshift studies oflaes.

1310.4835	ly{\alpha} equivalent width distribution of ly{\alpha} emitting galaxies  at redshift z $\sim$ 4.5	ly{\alpha} line ews provide important clues to the physical nature of highredshift laes. however, measuring the ly{\alpha} ew distribution of high-znarrowband selected laes can be hard because many sources do not have broadbandphotometry. we investigate the possible biases in measuring the intrinsicly{\alpha} ew distribution for a lae sample at z $\sim$ 4.5 in the extendedcdfs. only weak malmquist-type bias in both the intrinsic ly{\alpha} luminosityfunction and the ly{\alpha} ew distribution were found. however, the observedew distribution is severely biased if one only considers laes with detectionsin the continuum. taking the broadband non-detections into account requiresfitting the distribution of the broadband-to-narrowband ratio, which then givesa larger ew distribution scale length. assuming an exponential form of theintrinsic ly{\alpha} ew distribution dn/dew = n exp(-ew/w$_0$), we obtain w$_0$= 167+/-44{\aa} (uncorrected for igm absorption of ly{\alpha}). we discuss thelikely range of igm absorption effects in light of recent measurements ofly{\alpha} line profiles and velocity offsets. our data are consistent withly{\alpha} ew being independent of uv luminosity (i.e., we do not see evidencefor the "ando" effect). our simulations also imply that broad-band imagesshould be 0.5-1 magnitude deeper than narrowband images for an effective andreasonably complete lae survey. comparing with consistent measurements at otherredshifts, we see a strong evolution in ly{\alpha} ew distribution withredshift which goes as a power-law form of w$_0$ $\prop$(1+z)$^${\xi}, with{\xi} = 1.1$\pm$0.1 (0.6$\pm$0.1) if no igm corrections are applied to thely{\alpha} line; or {\xi} = 1.7$\pm$0.1 (1.2$\pm$0.1) after applying a maximaligm-absorption correction to ly{\alpha} line) for an exponential (a gaussian)ew distribution from z = 0.3 to 6.5.

astro-ph;0110280	lyman alpha emitters at redshift z=5.7	lyman alpha galaxies at high redshifts offer a powerful probe of both theformation of galaxies and the reionization of the intergalactic medium. lymanalpha line emission is an efficient tool for identifying young galaxies at highredshift, because it is strong in systems with young stars and little or nodust-- properties expected in galaxies undergoing their first burst ofstar-formation. lyman alpha galaxies also provide a robust test of thereionization epoch that is independent of gunn-peterson trough observations inquasar spectra and is better able to distinguish line center optical depthstau=5 from tau=10^5. this is because neutral gas scatters lyman alpha photons,dramatically ``blurring'' images of lyman alpha galaxies embedded in a neutralintergalactic medium and rendering them undetectable.  we present a photometrically selected sample of z=5.7 lyman alpha emittersderived from the large area lyman alpha survey. the presence of theselow-luminosity lyman alpha sources at z=5.7 immediately implies that thereionization redshift was &gt; 5.7. comparing these objects to our earlier z=4.5sample, we find that the number of z=5.7 emitters at fixed line luminositymarginally exceeds the no-evolution expectation, but falls well short ofpublished model predictions. the equivalent width distribution is similar atthe two redshifts. the large equivalent widths of the lyman alpha line indicateyoung galaxies undergoing their first star formation.

astro-ph;0111126	large equivalent width lyman-alpha line emission at z=4.5: young  galaxies in a young universe	the large area lyman alpha survey has found ~ 150 lyman-alpha emitters atz=4.5. while stellar models predict a maximum lyman-alpha equivalent width (ew)of 240 angstrom, 60% of the lyman-alpha emitters have ews exceeding this value.we attempt to model the observed ew distribution by combining stellarpopulation models with an extrapolation of lyman break galaxy luminosityfunction at z=4, incorporating observational selection effects and malmquistbias. to reproduce the high ews seen in the sample we need to postulate astellar initial mass function (imf) with extreme slope alpha = 0.5 (instead of2.35); zero metallicity stars; or narrow-lined active galactic nuclei. themodels also reveal that only 7.5-15% of galaxies need show lyman-alpha emissionto explain the observed number counts. this raises the possibility that eitherstar-formation in high redshift galaxies is episodic or the lyman-alphagalaxies we are seeing are the youngest 7.5-15% and that lyman-alpha isstrongly quenched by dust at about 10 mega-years of age.

astro-ph;0209544	spectroscopic confirmation of three redshift 5.7 lyman-alpha emitters  from the large area lyman alpha survey	narrow-band searches for lyman alpha emission are an efficient way ofidentifying star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. we present keck telescopespectra confirming redshifts z = 5.7 for three objects discovered in the largearea lyman alpha (lala) survey at kitt peak national observatory.  all three spectra show strong, narrow emission lines with the asymmetricprofile that is characteristically produced in high redshift lyman alphaemitters by preferential hi absorption in the blue wing of the line. theseobjects are undetected in deep bw, v, r, and 6600a narrow-band images from thenoao deep wide-field survey and from lala, as expected from lyman break andlyman alpha forest absorption at redshift z = 5.7. all three objects show largeequivalent widths (&gt;= 150a in the rest-frame), suggesting at least one of thefollowing: a top-heavy initial mass function, very low stellar metallicity, orthe presence of an active nucleus. we consider the case for an active nucleusto be weak in all three objects due to the limited width of the lyman alphaemission line (&lt; 500 km/s) and the absence of any other indicator of quasaractivity.  the three confirmed high redshift objects were among four spectroscopicallyobserved targets drawn from the sample of 18 candidates presented by rhoads andmalhotra (2001). thus, these spectra support the lyman alpha emitter populationstatistics from our earlier photometric study, which imply little evolution innumber density from z=5.7 to z=4.5 and provide strong evidence that thereionization redshift is greater than 5.7.

astro-ph;0301481	infrared emission of normal galaxies from 2.5 to 12 microns: iso  spectra, near-infrared continuum and mid-infrared emission features	we present iso-phot spectra of the regions 2.5-4.9um and 5.8-11.6um for asample of 45 disk galaxies from the u.s. iso key project on normal galaxies.the spectra can be decomposed into three spectral components: (1) continuumemission from stellar photospheres, which dominates the near-infrared (2.5-4.9um; nir) spectral region; (2) a weak nir excess continuum, which has a colortemperature of ~ 1000k, carries a luminosity of a few percent of the totalfar-infrared luminosity l(fir), and most likely arises from the ism; and (3)the well-known broad emission features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3 um, which aregenerally attributed to aromatic carbon particles. these aromatic features inemission (afes) dominate the mid-infrared (5.8-11.6 um; mir) part of thespectrum, and resemble the so-called type-a spectra observed in manynon-stellar sources and the diffuse ism in our own galaxy. the relativestrengths of the afes vary by 15-25% among the galaxies. however, littlecorrelation is seen between these variations and either iras 60um-to-100um fluxdensity ratio r(60/100) or the fir-to-blue luminosity ratio l(fir)/l(b),suggesting that the observed variations are not a direct consequence of theradiation field differences among the galaxies. we demonstrate that the nirexcess continuum and afe emission are correlated, suggesting that they areproduced by similar mechanisms and similar (or the same) material. on the otherhand, as the current star-formation activity increases, the overall strengthsof the afes and the nir excess continuum drop significantly with respect tothat of the far-infrared emission from large dust grains. this is likely aconsequence of the preferential destruction in intense radiation fields of thesmall carriers responsible for the nir/afe emission.

astro-ph;9411085	quasar populations in a cosmological constant dominated flat universe	most physical properties derived for quasars, as single entities or as apopulation, depend upon the cosmology assumed. in this paper, we calculate thequasar luminosity function and some related quantities for a flat universedominated by a cosmological constant $\lambda$ ($\lambda=0.9, \omega=0.1$) andcompare them with those deduced for a flat universe with zero cosmologicalconstant ($\lambda=0,\omega=1$). we use the aat quasar survey data (boyle etal. 1990) as input in both cases. the data are fit well by a pure luminosityevolution model for both the cosmologies, but with different evolutionaryparameters. from the luminosity function, we predict (extrapolate) a greaternumber of quasars at faint apparent magnitudes (twice the number at b=24, $z &lt;2.2$) for the $\lambda$ dominated universe. this population of faint quasars athigh redshift would result in a higher incidence of gravitational lensing. thetotal luminosity of the quasar population and the total mass tied up in blackhole remnants of quasars is not sensitive to the cosmology. however, for a$\lambda$ cosmology this mass is tied up in fewer but more massive black holes.

(1986) to measure these parameters. the terminal velocity valuesare found to be in good agreement with previous measurements. the velocitydispersion is constant with radius at the theoretically expected value of $9\pm 1 \kms$. the gaussian scale height of the hi layer increases withgalactocentric radius. the centroid of the layer deviates significantly from$z=0$. apart from small local variations, the velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$,scale height $\sigma_z$ and the centroid $z_0$ show similar variations in thefirst and the fourth quadrants. on balancing the turbulent pressure support ofthe layer against the disk gravitational potential, we confirm that additionalsupport is needed for the hi layer. the radial profile of the reduced midplanemass density is an exponential with a scale length of $3.3 \pm 0.3 \kpc$. thispicture is consistent with a constant mass-to-light ratio of the disk, andextra pressure support for the hi layer which is constant with radius in theinner galaxy.

astro-ph;9610233	through a lens darkly: evidence for dusty gravitational lenses	foreground galaxies that amplify the light from background quasars may alsodim that light if the galaxies contain enough dust. extinction by dust inlenses could hide the large number of lensed systems predicted for a flatuniverse with a large value of the cosmological constant $\lambda$. we look forone signature of dust, namely reddening, by examining optical-infrared colorsof gravitationally lensed images of quasars. we find that the lensed systemsidentified in radio and infrared searches have redder optical-ir colors thanoptically selected ones. this could be due to a bias against selecting reddened(hence extincted) quasars in the optical surveys, or due to the differences inthe intrinsic colors of optical and radio quasars. comparison of theradio-selected lensed and unlensed quasars shows that the lensed ones haveredder colors. we therefore conclude that at least part of the color differencebetween the two lens samples is due to dust.  from the color difference between lensed and unlensed radio quasars (andassuming galactic extinction law) we can reconcile a large cosmologicalconstant ($\lambda=0.9$) with the number of lensed systems observed in fluxlimited optical surveys. these results substantially weaken the strongestconstraint on cosmological scenarios that invoke a non-zero cosmologicalconstant to explain age discrepancy problems, satisfy predictions ofinflationary models of the early universe and play a role in large scalestructure formation models. they also raise the prospect of using gravitationallenses to study the interstellar medium in high redshift galaxies.

0706.0893	clustering of lyman alpha emitters at z ~ 4.5	we present the clustering properties of 151 lyman alpha emitting galaxies atz ~ 4.5 selected from the large area lyman alpha (lala) survey. our catalogcovers an area of 36' x 36' observed with five narrowband filters. we assumethat the angular correlation function w(theta) is well represented by a powerlaw a_w = theta^(-beta) with slope beta = 0.8, and we find a_w = 6.73 +/- 1.80.we then calculate the correlation length r_0 of the real-space two-pointcorrelation function xi(r) = (r/r_0)^(-1.8) from a_w through the limbertransformation, assuming a flat, lambda-dominated universe. neglectingcontamination, we find r_0 = 3.20 +/- 0.42 mpc/h. taking into account apossible 28% contamination by randomly distributed sources, we find r_0 = 4.61+/- 0.6 mpc/h. we compare these results with the expectations for theclustering of dark matter halos at this redshift in a cold dark matter model,and find that the measured clustering strength can be reproduced if theseobjects reside in halos with a minimum mass of 1-2 times 10^11 solar masses/h.our estimated correlation length implies a bias of b ~ 3.7, similar to that oflyman-break galaxies (lbg) at z ~ 3.8-4.9. however, lyman alpha emitters are afactor of ~ 2-16 rarer than lbgs with a similar bias value and implied hosthalo mass. therefore, one plausible scenario seems to be that lyman alphaemitters occupy host halos of roughly the same mass as lbgs, but shine with arelatively low duty cycle of 6-50%.

0812.0592	evolution of lyman alpha galaxies: stellar populations at z ~ 0.3	we present the results of a stellar population analysis of 30 lyman alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 0.3, previously discovered with the galaxyevolution explorer (galex). with a few exceptions, we can accurately fit modelspectral energy distributions to these objects, representing the first timethis has been done for a large sample of laes at z &lt; 3, a gap of ~ 8 gyr in thehistory of the universe. from the 26/30 laes which we can fit, we find an ageand stellar mass range of 200 myr - 10 gyr and 10^9 - 10^11 msol, respectively.these objects thus appear to be significantly older and more massive than laesat high-redshift. we also find that these laes show a mild trend towards highermetallicity than those at high redshift, as well as a tighter range of dustattenuation and interstellar medium geometry. these results suggest thatlow-redshift laes have evolved significantly from those at high redshift.
