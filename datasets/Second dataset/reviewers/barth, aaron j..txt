0907.1086	the growth of black holes: insights from obscured active galaxies	obscured or narrow-line active galaxies offer an unobstructed view of thequasar environment in the presence of a luminous and vigorously accreting blackhole. we exploit the large new sample of optically selected luminousnarrow-line active galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey at redshifts 0.1&lt; z &lt; 0.45, in conjunction with follow-up observations with the low dispersionsurvey spectrograph (ldss3) at magellan, to study the distributions of blackhole mass and host galaxy properties in these extreme objects. we find a narrowrange in black hole mass (&lt;log m_bh/m_sun&gt; = 8.0 +/- 0.7) and eddington ratio(&lt;log l/l_edd&gt; = -0.7 +/- 0.7) for the sample as a whole, surprisingly similarto comparable broad-line systems. in contrast, we infer a wide range in starformation properties and host morphologies for the sample, from disk-dominatedto elliptical galaxies. nearly one-quarter have highly disturbed morphologiesindicative of ongoing mergers. unlike the black holes, which are apparentlyexperiencing significant growth, the galaxies appear to have formed the bulk oftheir stars at a previous epoch. on the other hand, it is clear from the lackof correlation between gaseous and stellar velocity dispersions in thesesystems that the host galaxy interstellar medium is far from being in virialequilibrium with the stars. while our findings cast strong doubt on thereliability of substituting gas for stellar dispersions in high luminosityactive galaxies, they do provide direct evidence that luminous accreting blackholes influence their surroundings on a galaxy-wide scale.

0908.0003	the lick agn monitoring project: broad-line region radii and black hole  masses from reverberation mapping of hbeta	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun and also the well-studied nearby activegalactic nucleus (agn) ngc 5548. nine of the objects in the sample (includingngc 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during themonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between thecontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broadhbeta emission. we present here the light curves for the objects in this sampleand the subsequent hbeta time lags for the nine objects where thesemeasurements were possible. the hbeta lag time is directly related to the sizeof the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured widthof the hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determinethe virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine agns. theabsolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalizationderived by onken et al. we also examine the time lag response as a function ofvelocity across the hbeta line profile for six of the agns. the analysis offour leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function ofvelocity. however, sbs 1116+583a exhibits a symmetric time lag response aroundthe line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-lineregion (blr) clouds, and arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is mosteasily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. further investigationwill be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical modelsof the blr by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.

1004.0252	the lick agn monitoring project: the mbh - sigma relation for  reverberation-mapped active galaxies	(abridged) to investigate the black hole mass (mbh) vs. stellar velocitydispersion relation of active galaxies, we measured the velocity dispersions ofa sample of local seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we have recently determined mbhusing reverberation mapping. for most objects, velocity dispersions weremeasured from high s/n ratio optical spectra centered on the ca ii tripletregion (~8500 a), obtained at the keck, palomar, and lick observatories. fortwo objects, in which the ca ii triplet region was contaminated by nuclearemission, the measurement was based on high-quality h-band spectra obtainedwith the osiris at the keck-ii telescope. combining our new measurements withdata from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies withstellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based mbh measurements in therange of black hole mass 10^6&lt;mbh/m_sun&lt;10^9. we use this sample to obtainreverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of them-sigma relation of active galaxies. assuming a constant virial coefficient ffor the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60and the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log(mbh/m_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those foundfor quiescent galaxies. we derive an updated value of the virial coefficient fby finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreementwith the m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent m-sigmarelation determined by gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with anintrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. the uncertainty of the virial coefficientremains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole massdeterminations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epochspectroscopic estimates of mbh in active galaxies.

1004.2922	the lick agn monitoring project: reverberation mapping of optical  hydrogen and helium recombination lines	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7m_sun and also the well-studied nearby activegalactic nucleus (agn) ngc 5548. nine of the objects in the sample (includingngc 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during themonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between thecontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broadhbeta emission, which we have previously reported. we present here the lightcurves for the halpha, hgamma, heii 4686, and hei 5876 emission lines and thetime lags for the emission-line responses relative to changes in the continuumflux. combining each emission-line time lag with the measured width of the linein the variable part of the spectrum, we determine a virial mass of the centralsupermassive black hole from several independent emission lines. we find thatthe masses are generally consistent within the uncertainties. the time-lagresponse as a function of velocity across the balmer line profiles is examinedfor six of the agns. finally we compare several trends seen in the datasetagainst the predictions from photoionization calculations as presented bykorista &amp; goad. we confirm several of their predictions, including an increasein responsivity and a decrease in the mean time lag as the excitation andionization level for the species increases. further confirmation ofphotoionization predictions for broad-line gas behavior will require additionalmonitoring programs for these agns while they are in different luminositystates.

1007.0781	the lick agn monitoring project: velocity-delay maps from the  maximum-entropy method for arp 151	we present velocity-delay maps for optical h i, he i, and he ii recombinationlines in arp 151, recovered by fitting a reverberation model tospectrophotometric monitoring data using the maximum-entropy method. h iresponse is detected over the range 0-15 days, with the response confinedwithin the virial envelope. the balmer-line maps have similar morphologies butexhibit radial stratification, with progressively longer delays for hgamma tohbeta to halpha. the he i and he ii response is confined within 1-2 days. thereis a deficit of prompt response in the balmer-line cores but strong promptresponse in the red wings. comparison with simple models identifies two classesthat reproduce these features: freefalling gas, and a half-illuminated diskwith a hotspot at small radius on the receding lune. symmetrically illuminatedmodels with gas orbiting in an inclined disk or an isotropic distribution ofrandomly inclined circular orbits can reproduce the virial structure but notthe observed asymmetry. radial outflows are also largely ruled out by theobserved asymmetry. a warped-disk geometry provides a physically plausiblemechanism for the asymmetric illumination and hotspot features. simpleestimates show that a disk in the broad-line region of arp 151 could beunstable to warping induced by radiation pressure. our results demonstrate thepotential power of detailed modeling combined with monitoring campaigns athigher cadence to characterize the gas kinematics and physical processes thatgive rise to the broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei.

1008.0005	the supermassive black hole in m84 revisited	the mass of the central black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy m84 haspreviously been measured by two groups using the same observations ofemission-line gas with the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) on thehubble space telescope, giving strongly discrepant results: bower et al. (1998)found m_bh = (1.5^{+1.1}_{-0.6}) x 10^9 m_sun, while maciejewski &amp; binney(2001) estimated m_bh = 4 x 10^8 m_sun. in order to resolve this discrepancy,we have performed new measurements of the gas kinematics in m84 from the samearchival data, and carried out comprehensive gas-dynamical modeling for theemission-line disk within ~70 pc from the nucleus. in comparison with the twoprevious studies of m84, our analysis includes a more complete treatment of thepropagation of emission-line profiles through the telescope and stis optics, aswell as inclusion of the effects of an intrinsic velocity dispersion in theemission-line disk. we find that an intrinsic velocity dispersion is needed inorder to match the observed line widths, and we calculate gas-dynamical modelsboth with and without a correction for asymmetric drift. including the effectof asymmetric drift improves the model fit to the observed velocity field. ourbest-fitting model with asymmetric drift gives m_bh = (8.5^{+0.9}_{-0.8}) x10^8 m_sun (68% confidence). this is a factor of ~2 smaller than the mass oftenadopted in studies of the m_bh - sigma and m_bh - l relationships. our resultprovides a firmer basis for the inclusion of m84 in the correlations betweenblack hole mass and host galaxy properties.

1009.0532	the lick agn monitoring project: alternate routes to a broad-line region  radius	it is now possible to estimate black hole masses across cosmic time, usingbroad emission lines in active galaxies. this technique informs our views ofhow galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. unfortunately, there aremany outstanding uncertainties associated with these "virial" mass estimates.one of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for thebroad-line region. incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity activegalaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at lick observatory, werecalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretionluminosity other than the optical continuum. we find that the radius of thebroad-line region scales as the square root of the x-ray and hbetaluminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. on the other hand, thescaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. this isconsistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line tox-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. the radius of the broad-lineregion correlates most tightly with hbeta luminosity, while the x-ray andnarrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two. thesecorrelations provide useful alternative virial bh masses in objects with nodetectable optical/uv continuum emission, such as high-redshift galaxies withbroad emission lines, radio-loud objects, or local active galaxies withgalaxy-dominated continua.

1102.2913	feedback in luminous obscured quasars	we use spatially resolved long-slit spectroscopy from magellan to investigatethe extent, kinematics, and ionization structure in the narrow-line regions of15 luminous, obscured quasars with z&lt;0.5. increasing the dynamic range inluminosity by an order of magnitude, as well as improving the depth of existingobservations by a similar factor, we revisit relations between narrow-lineregion size and the luminosity and linewidth of the narrow emission lines. wefind a slope of 0.22 +/- 0.04 for the power-law relationship between size andluminosity, suggesting that the nebulae are limited by availability of gas toionize at these luminosities. in fact, we find that the active galactic nucleusis effectively ionizing the interstellar medium over the full extent of thehost galaxy. broad (~300-1000 km/s) linewidths across the galaxies reveal thatthe gas is kinematically disturbed. furthermore, the rotation curves andvelocity dispersions of the ionized gas remain constant out to large distances,in striking contrast to normal and starburst galaxies. we argue that the gas inthe entire host galaxy is significantly disturbed by the central activegalactic nucleus. while only ~10^7-10^8 m_sun worth of gas are directlyobserved to be leaving the host galaxies at or above their escape velocities,these estimates are likely lower limits because of the biases in both mass andoutflow velocity measurements and may in fact be in accord with expectationsfrom recent feedback models. additionally, we report the discovery of two dualobscured quasars, one of which is blowing a large-scale (~10 kpc) bubble ofionized gas into the intergalactic medium.

0709.3258	the dual-axis circumstellar environment of the type iin supernova 1997eg	we present multi-epoch spectral and spectropolarimetric observations of thetype iin supernova (sn) 1997eg that indicate the presence of a flatteneddisk-like concentration of circumstellar material surrounding nonsphericalejecta, with which the disk is misaligned. the polarization across the broad halpha, h beta, and he i 5876 lines of sn 1997eg forms closed loops when viewedin the stokes q-u plane. such loops occur when the geometrical symmetry of oneor both of the stokes parameters across spectral lines is broken, in this casemost likely by occultation of the ejecta by the equatorial circumstellar matterconcentration. the polarization of the narrow balmer lines possesses anintrinsic axis that differs by 12 degrees from that of the elongated ejecta andprobably indicates the orientation of the disk-like circumstellar material. theexistence of two different axes of symmetry in sn 1997eg suggests that neitherrotation of the progenitor nor the influence of a companion star can be thesole mechanism creating a preferred axis within the supernova system. our modelsupports the emerging hypothesis that the progenitors of some type iinsupernovae are luminous blue variable stars, whose pre-supernova mass eruptionsform the circumstellar shells that physically characterize the sn iin subclass.these conclusions, which are independent of interstellar polarization effects,would have been unobservable with only a single epoch of spectropolarimetry.

1208.1303	physical properties of the narrow-line region of low-mass active  galaxies	we present spectroscopic observations of 27 active galactic nuclei (agn) withsome of the lowest black hole (bh) masses known. we use the high spectralresolution and small aperture of our keck data, taken with the echellettespectrograph and imager, to isolate the narrow-line regions (nlrs) of theselow-mass bhs. we investigate their emission-line properties and compare themwith those of agn with higher-mass black holes. while we are unable todetermine absolute metallicities, some of our objects plausibly representexamples of the low-metallicity agn described by groves et al. (2006), based ontheir [n ii]/h_alpha ratios and their consistency with the kewley &amp; ellison(2008) mass-metallicity relation. we find tentative evidence for steeper far-uvspectral slopes in lower-mass systems. overall, nlr emission lines in theselow-mass agn exhibit trends similar to those seen in agn with higher-mass bhs,such as increasing blueshifts and broadening with increasing ionizationpotential. additionally, we see evidence of an intermediate line region whoseintensity correlates with l/l_edd, as seen in higher-mass agn. we highlight theinteresting trend that, at least in these low-mass agn, the [o iii] equivalentwidth (ew) is highest in symmetric nlr lines with no blue wing. this trend ofincreasing [o iii] ew with line symmetry could be explained by a high coveringfactor of lower ionization gas in the nlr. in general, low-mass agn preservemany well-known trends in the structure of the nlr, while exhibiting steeperionizing continuum slopes and somewhat lower gas-phase metallicities.

1212.2639	the carnegie-irvine galaxy survey. iii. the three-component structure of  nearby elliptical galaxies	motivated by recent developments in our understanding of the formation andevolution of massive galaxies, we explore the detailed photometric structure ofa representative sample of 94 bright, nearby elliptical galaxies, usinghigh-quality optical images from the carnegie-irvine galaxy survey. the samplespans a range of environments and stellar masses, from m* = 10^{10.2} to10^{12.0} solar mass. we exploit the unique capabilities of two-dimensionalimage decomposition to explore the possibility that local elliptical galaxiesmay contain photometrically distinct substructure that can shed light on theirevolutionary history. compared with the traditional one-dimensional approach,these two-dimensional models are capable of consistently recovering the surfacebrightness distribution and the systematic radial variation of geometricinformation at the same time. contrary to conventional perception, we find thatthe global light distribution of the majority (&gt;75%) of elliptical galaxies isnot well described by a single sersic function. instead, we propose that localelliptical galaxies generically contain three subcomponents: a compact (r_e &lt; 1kpc) inner component with luminosity fraction f ~ 0.1-0.15; anintermediate-scale (r_e ~ 2.5 kpc) middle component with f ~ 0.2-0.25; and adominant (f = 0.6), extended (r_e ~ 10 kpc) outer envelope. all subcomponentshave average sersic indices n ~ 1-2, significantly lower than the valuestypically obtained from single-component fits. the individual subcomponentsfollow well-defined photometric scaling relations and the stellar mass-sizerelation. we discuss the physical nature of the substructures and theirimplications for the formation of massive elliptical galaxies.

1303.1742	the low-luminosity end of the radius-luminosity relationship for active  galactic nuclei	we present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between thehbeta broad-line region (blr) radius and the luminosity of the active galacticnucleus (agn). specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surfacebrightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new agns imaged with thehubble space telescope wide field camera 3. the surface brightnessdecompositions allow us to create "agn-free" images of the galaxies, from whichwe measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measuredthrough the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. we also incorporate 20 newreverberation-mapping measurements of the hbeta time lag, which is assumed toyield the average hbeta blr radius. the final sample includes 41 agns coveringfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. the additions and updates incorporatedhere primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the r-l relationship. the bestfit to the relationship using a bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simplephotoionization arguments. only two agns appear to be outliers from therelationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubtregarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. the scatter around therelationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. a large fraction of theremaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distancesto the agn host galaxies. our results help support the possibility that the r-lrelationship could potentially be used to turn the blrs of agns intostandardizable candles. this would allow the cosmological expansion of theuniverse to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a largerrange of redshifts.

1304.2299	fossil evidence for the two-phase formation of elliptical galaxies	massive early-type galaxies have undergone dramatic structural evolution overthe last 10 gyr. a companion paper shows that nearby elliptical galaxies withm*&gt;1.3x10^{11} m_sun generically contain three photometric subcomponents: acompact inner component with effective radius re&lt;1 kpc, an intermediate-scalemiddle component with re~2.5 kpc, and an extended outer envelope with $r_e\approx 10$ kpc. here we attempt to relate these substructures with theproperties of early-type galaxies observed at higher redshifts. we find that ahypothetical structure formed from combining the inner plus the middlecomponents of local ellipticals follows a strikingly tight stellar mass-sizerelation, one that resembles the distribution of early-type galaxies at z~1.5.outside of the central kpc, the median stellar mass surface density profiles ofthis composite structure agree closest with those of massive galaxies that havesimilar cumulative number density at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 within the uncertainty. wepropose that the central substructures in nearby ellipticals are theevolutionary descendants of the "red nuggets" formed under highly dissipative("wet") conditions at high redshifts, as envisioned in the initial stages ofthe two-phase formation scenario recently advocated for massive galaxies.subsequent accretion, plausibly through dissipationless ("dry") minor mergers,builds the outer regions of the galaxy identified as the outer envelope in ourdecomposition. the large scatter exhibited by this component on the stellarmass-size plane testifies to the stochastic nature of the accretion events.

1304.4643	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: fe ii reverberation from the outer  broad-line region	the prominent broad fe ii emission blends in the spectra of active galacticnuclei have been shown to vary in response to continuum variations, but pastattempts to measure the reverberation lag time of the optical fe ii lines havemet with only limited success. here we report the detection of fe iireverberation in two seyfert 1 galaxies, ngc 4593 and mrk 1511, based on datafrom a program carried out at lick observatory in spring 2011. light curves foremission lines including h-beta and fe ii were measured by applying a fittingroutine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-linecomponents, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine thereverberation lags of the emission lines relative to v-band light curves. inboth cases the measured lag (t_cen) of fe ii is longer than that of h-beta,although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of fe iitemplate used in the fit. for spectral decompositions done using the fe iitemplate of veron-cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1304.7273	the m87 black hole mass from gas-dynamical models of space telescope  imaging spectrograph observations	the supermassive black hole of m87 is one of the most massive black holesknown and has been the subject of several stellar and gas-dynamical massmeasurements; however the most recent revision to the stellar-dynamical blackhole mass measurement is a factor of about two larger than the previousgas-dynamical determinations. here, we apply comprehensive gas-dynamical modelsthat include the propagation of emission-line profiles through the telescopeand spectrograph optics to new space telescope imaging spectrographobservations from the hubble space telescope. unlike the previous gas-dynamicalstudies of m87, we map out the complete kinematic structure of theemission-line disk within about 40 pc from the nucleus, and find that a smallamount of velocity dispersion internal to the gas disk is required to match theobserved line widths. we examine a scenario in which the intrinsic velocitydispersion provides dynamical support to the disk, and determine that theinferred black hole mass increases by only 6%. incorporating this effect intothe error budget, we ultimately measure a mass of m_bh = (3.5^{+0.9}_{-0.7}) x10^9 m_sun (68% confidence). our gas-dynamical black hole mass continues todiffer from the most recent stellar-dynamical mass by a factor of two,underscoring the need for carrying out more cross-checks between the two mainblack hole mass measurement methods.

1306.1090	on the virialization of disk winds: implications for the black hole mass  estimates in agn	estimating the mass of a supermassive black hole (smbh) in an active galacticnucleus (agn) usually relies on the assumption that the broad line region (blr)is virialized. however, this assumption seems invalid in blr models thatconsists of an accretion disk and its wind. the disk is likely keplerian andtherefore virialized. however, the wind material must, beyond a certain point,be dominated by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. here, weanalyze hydrodynamic simulations of four different disk winds: an isothermalwind, a thermal wind from an x-ray heated disk, and two line-driven winds, onewith and the other without x-ray heating and cooling. for each model, we checkwhether gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing thevolume-integrated quantities that appear in the virial theorem: internal,kinetic, and gravitational energies, we find that in the first two models, thewinds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are virializedup to a relatively large distance. the line-driven winds are virialized becausethey accelerate slowly so that the rotational velocity is dominant and the windbase is very dense. for the two virialized winds, the so-called projectedvirial factor scales with inclination angle as $1/ \sin^2{i}$. finally, wedemonstrate that an outflow from a keplerian disk becomes unvirialized moreslowly when it conserves the gas specific angular momentum -- as in the modelsconsidered here, than when it conserves the angular velocity -- as in theso-called magneto-centrifugal winds.

1509.04297	dissecting the power sources of low-luminosity emission-line galaxy  nuclei via comparison of hst-stis and ground-based spectra	using a sample of ~100 nearby line-emitting galaxy nuclei, we have built thecurrently definitive atlas of spectroscopic measurements of h_alpha andneighboring emission lines at subarcsecond scales. we employ these data in aquantitative comparison of the nebular emission in hubble space telescope (hst)and ground-based apertures, which offer an order-of-magnitude difference incontrast, and provide new statistical constraints on the degree to whichtransition objects and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (liners)are powered by an accreting black hole at &lt;10 pc. we show that while thesmall-aperture observations clearly resolve the nebular emission, the aperturedependence in the line ratios is generally weak, and this can be explained bygradients in the density of the line-emitting gas: the higher densities in themore nuclear regions potentially flatten the excitation gradients, suppressingthe forbidden emission. the transition objects show a threefold increase in theincidence of broad h_alpha emission in the high-resolution data, as well as thestrongest density gradients, supporting the composite model for these systemsas accreting sources surrounded by star-forming activity. the narrow-lineliners appear to be the weaker counterparts of the type 1 liners, where the lowaccretion rates cause the disappearance of the broad-line component. theenhanced sensitivity of the hst observations reveals a 30% increase in theincidence of accretion-powered systems at z~0. a comparison of the strength ofthe broad-line emission detected at different epochs implies potentialbroad-line variability on a decade-long timescale, with at least a factor ofthree in amplitude.

0808.0914	hubble space telescope spectroscopic observations of the narrow-line  region in nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei	(abridged) we present stis observations of 14 nearby low-luminosity activegalactic nuclei, including 13 liners and 1 seyfert, taken at multiple parallelslit positions centered on the galaxy nuclei and covering the h-alpha spectralregion. for each galaxy, we measure the emission-line velocities, line widths,and strengths, to map out the inner narrow-line region structure. there is awide diversity among the velocity fields: in a few galaxies the gas is clearlyin disk-like rotation, while in other galaxies the gas kinematics appearchaotic or are dominated by radial flows with multiple velocity components. the[s ii] line ratio indicates a radial stratification in gas density, with asharp increase within the inner 10-20 pc, in the majority of the type 1objects. we examine how the [n ii] 6583 line width varies as a function ofaperture size over a range of spatial scales, extending from scales comparableto the black hole's sphere of influence to scales dominated by the hostgalaxy's bulge. for most galaxies in the sample, we find that the emission-linevelocity dispersion is largest within the black hole's gravitational sphere ofinfluence, and decreases with increasing aperture size toward values similar tothe bulge stellar velocity dispersion measured within ground-based apertures.future dynamical modeling in order to determine black hole masses for a fewobjects in this sample may be worthwhile, although disorganized motion willlimit the accuracy of the mass measurements.

astro-ph;0006264	detailed analysis of early to late-time spectra of supernova 1993j	we present a detailed study of line structure in early to late-time spectraof supernova (sn) 1993j. spectra during the nebular phase, but within the firsttwo years after explosion, exhibit small-scale structure in the emission linesof some species, notably oxygen and magnesium, showing that the ejecta of sn1993j are clumpy. on the other hand, a lack of structure in emission lines ofcalcium implies that the source of calcium emission is uniformly distributedthroughout the ejecta. these results are interpreted as evidence that oxygenemission originates in clumpy, newly synthesized material, while calciumemission arises from material pre-existing in the atmosphere of the progenitor.spectra spanning the range 433-2454 days after the explosion show box-likeprofiles for the emission lines, clearly indicating circumstellar interactionin a roughly spherical shell. this is interpreted within the chevalier &amp;fransson (1994) model for sne interacting with mass lost during prior stellarwinds. at very late times, the emission lines have a two-horned profile,implying the formation of a somewhat flattened or disk-like structure that is asignificant source of emission. the very high signal-to-noise ratio spectra areused to demonstrate the potential significance of misinterpretation of telluricabsorption lines in the spectra of bright sne.

astro-ph;0309226	sn 1994w: evidence of explosive mass ejection a few years before  explosion	we present and analyse spectra of the type iin supernova 1994w obtainedbetween 18 and 202 days after explosion. during the first 100 days the lineprofiles are composed of three major components: (i) narrow p cygni lines withabsorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines with bvzi ~4000 km/s;(iii) broad wings most apparent in h-alpha. these components are identifiedwith the expanding circumstellar (cs) envelope (sollerman, cumming &amp; lundqvist1998), shocked cool gas in the forward postshock region, and multiple thomsonscattering in the cs envelope, respectively. the absence of broad p cygni linesfrom the supernova (sn) is the result of the formation of an optically thick,cool, dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the cs envelope. models ofthe sn deceleration and thomson scattering wings are used to recover thethomson optical depth of the cs envelope and its radial extent, 4e15 cm. thelight curve, which we reproduce by a hydrodynamical model, is powered by acombination of internal energy leakage after the explosion of an extendedpresupernova (~1e15 cm) and luminosity from circumstellar interaction. werecover the pre-explosion kinematics of the cs envelope and find it to be closeto homologous expansion with outmost velocity ~1100 km/s and a kinematic age of\~1.5 yr. the high mass and kinetic energy of the cs envelope strongly suggestthat the cs envelope was explosively ejected only a few years before explosion.

astro-ph;0410321	the survey of nearby nuclei with stis (sunns):emission-line nuclei at  hubble space telescope resolution	we present results from a program of optical spectroscopy for 23 nearbygalaxy emission-line nuclei. this investigation takes advantage of the spatialresolution of the hubble space telescope to study the structure and energeticsof the central 10 - 20 pc, and the resulting data have value for quantifyingcentral black hole masses, star formation histories, and nebular properties.this paper provides a description of the experimental design, and new findingsfrom the study of emission lines. the sample targets span a range of nebularspectroscopic class, from hii to seyfert nuclei. the line ratios indicative ofnebular ionization show only modest variations over order-of-magnitudedifferences in radius, and demonstrate in a systematic way that geometricaldilution of the radiation field from a central source cannot be assumed as aprimary driver of ionization structure. comparisons between large- andsmall-aperture measurements for the hii/liner transition objects provide a newtest that challenges conventional wisdom concerning the composite nature ofthese systems. we also list a number of other quantitative results that are ofinterest for understanding galaxy nuclei, including (1) the spatialdistribution/degree of concentration of h-alpha emission as a function ofnebular type; (2) the radial variation in electron density as a function ofnebular type; and (3) quantitative broad h-alpha estimates obtained at a secondepoch for these low-luminosity nuclei. the resulting measurements provide a newbasis for comparing the nuclei of other galaxies with that of the milky way. wefind that the galactic center is representative across a wide span ofproperties as a low-luminosity emission-line nucleus.

astro-ph;0508338	mass distribution of spiral galaxies from characteristics of spiral  structure: constraints on galaxy formation models	recently, it has been shown that a correlation exists between the rate ofshear and the spiral arm pitch angle in disk galaxies. the rate of sheardepends upon the shape of the rotation curve, which is dependent upon the massdistribution in spiral galaxies. here, we present an imporoved correlationbetween shear rate and spiral arm pitch angle, by increasing the sample size.we also use an adiabatic infall code to show that the rate of shear is moststrongly correlated with the central mass concentration, c_m. the spinparameter, $\lambda$, and the fraction of baryons that cool, f, cause scatterin this correlation. limiting this scatter, such that it is equal to that inthe correlation between shear rate and pitch angle, and using a value of f=0.1to 0.2, the spin parameter must be in the range 0.03&lt;lambda&lt;0.09 for spiralgalaxies. we also derive an equation which links spiral arm pitch angledirectly to c_m.

astro-ph;0509200	is the broad-line region clumped or smooth? constraints from the h alpha  profile in ngc 4395, the least luminous seyfert 1 galaxy	the origin and configuration of the gas which emits broad lines in type iactive galactic nuclei is not established yet. the lack of small-scalestructure in the broad emission-line profiles is consistent with a smooth gasflow, or a clumped flow with many small clouds. an attractive possibility forthe origin of many small clouds is the atmospheres of bloated stars, an originwhich also provides a natural mechanism for the cloud confinement. earlierstudies of the broad-line profiles have already put strong lower limits on theminimum number of such stars, but these limits are sensitive to the assumedwidth of the lines produced by each cloud. here we revisit this problem usinghigh-resolution keck spectra of the h alpha line in ngc 4395, which has thesmallest known broad-line region (~10^14 cm). only a handful of the requiredbloated stars (each having r~10^14 cm) could fit into the broad-line region ofngc 4395, yet the observed smoothness of the h alpha line implies a lower limitof ~10^4-10^5 on the number of discrete clouds. this rules out conclusively thebloated-stars scenario, regardless of any plausible line-broadening mechanisms.the upper limit on the size of the clouds is ~10^12 cm, which is comparable tothe size implied by photoionization models. this strongly suggests that gas inthe broad-line region is structured as a smooth rather than a clumped flow,most likely in a rotationally dominated thick disk-like configuration. however,it remains to be clarified why such a smooth, gravity-dominated flow generatesdouble-peaked emission lines only in a small fraction of active galacticnuclei.

astro-ph;0603622	constraining dark matter halo profiles and galaxy formation models using  spiral arm morphology. i. method outline	we investigate the use of spiral arm pitch angles as a probe of disk galaxymass profiles. we confirm our previous result that spiral arm pitch angles (p)are well-correlated with the rate of shear (s) in disk galaxy rotation curves,by using a much larger sample (51 galaxies) than used previously (17 galaxies).we use this correlation to argue that imaging data alone can provide a powerfulprobe of galactic mass distributions out to large lookback times. in contrastto previous work, we show that observed spiral arm pitch angles are similarwhen measured in the optical (at 0.4 um) and the near-infrared (at 2.1 um) witha mean difference of 2.3+/-2.7 degrees. this is then used to strengthen theknown correlation between p and s using b-band images. we then use two examplegalaxies to demonstrate how an inferred shear rate coupled with a bulge-diskdecomposition model and a tully-fisher derived velocity normalization can beused to place constraints on a galaxy's baryon fraction and dark matter haloprofile. we show that eso 582-g12, a galaxy with a high shear rate (slightlydeclining rotation curve) at ~10 kpc, favors an adiabatically contracted halo,with high initial nfw concentration (c_vir &gt; 16) and a high fraction of halobaryons in the form of stars (~15-40%). in contrast, ic 2522 has a low shearrate (rising rotation curve) at ~10 kpc and favors non-adiabatically contractedmodels with low nfw concentrations (c_vir ~ 2-8) and a low stellar baryonfraction &lt;10%.
