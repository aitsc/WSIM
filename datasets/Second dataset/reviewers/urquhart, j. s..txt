0902.4751	observational study of sites of triggered star formation: co and  mid-infrared observations	(abridged) bright-rimmed clouds (brcs) are isolated molecular clouds locatedon the edges of evolved hii regions where star formation is thought may havebeen triggered. in this paper we investigate the current level of starformation within a sample of brcs and evaluate to what extent star formationmay have been induced. we present the results of a programme ofposition-switched co observations towards 45 southern brcs. the 12co, 13co andc18o (j=1-0) were simultaneously observed using the 22m mopra telescope. wecomplement these observations with archival mid-ir submm and radio data.analysis of the co, mid-ir and radio data result in the clouds being dividedinto three distinct groups. we refer to these groups as spontaneous, triggered,and zapped clouds, respectively. comparing the physical parameters ofspontaneous and triggered samples we find striking differences in luminosity,surface temperature and column density with all three quantities significantlyenhanced for the clouds considered to have been triggered. furthermore, we findstrong evidence for star formation within the triggered sample by way ofmethanol and h_2o masers, embedded mid-ir point sources and co wings, however,we find evidence of ongoing star formation within only two of the spontaneoussample. we have used co, mid-ir and radio data to identify 24 of the 45southern brcs that are undergoing a strong interaction with their hii region.we can therefore exclude ~50% from future studies. 14 of the 24 interactingbrcs are found to be associated with embedded mid-ir point sources and we findstrong evidence of that these clouds are forming stars. the absence ofmid-infrared sources towards the remaining ten clouds leads us to conclude thatthese represent an earlier evolutionary stage of star formation.

0905.1174	the rms survey: 6 cm continuum vla observations towards candidate  massive ysos in the northern hemisphere	(abridged) context: the red msx source (rms) survey is an ongoingmulti-wavelength observational programme designed to return a large,well-selected sample of massive young stellar objects (mysos). we haveidentified $\sim$2000 myso candidates located throughout the galaxy bycomparing the colours of msx and 2mass point sources to those of known mysos.aims: to identify the populations of uchii regions and pne within the sampleand examine their galactic distribution. method: we have conducted highresolution radio continuum observations at 6 cm towards 659 myso candidates inthe northern hemisphere ($10\degr&lt; l &lt; 250\degr$) using the vla. in addition tothese targeted observations we present archival data towards a further 315 rmssources extracted from a previous vla survey of the inner galaxy. results: wefind radio emission towards 272 ($\sim$27% of the observed sample). usingresults from other parts of our multi-wavelength survey we separate theserms-radio associations into two distinct types of objects, classifying 51 aspne and a further 208 as either compact or uc hii regions. using this wellselected sample of hii regions we estimate their galactic scale height to be0.6\degr. conclusions: using radio continuum and archival data we haveidentified 79 pne and 391 hii regions within the northern rms catalogue. weestimate the total fraction of contamination by pne in the rms sample is oforder 10%. the sample of hii regions is probably the best representation todate of the galactic population of hii regions as a whole.

0909.1720	the rms survey: h2o masers towards a sample of southern hemisphere  massive yso candidates and ultra compact hii regions	context: the red msx source (rms) survey has identified a large sample ofcandidate massive young stellar objects (mysos) and ultra compact (uc) hiiregions from a sample of ~2000 msx and 2mass colour selected sources. aims: tosearch for h2o masers towards a large sample of young high mass stars and toinvestigate the statistical correlation of h2o masers with the earliest stagesof massive star formation. methods: we have used the mopra radio telescope tomake position-switched observations towards ~500 uchii regions and mysoscandidates identified from the rms survey and located between 190\degr &lt; l &lt;30\degr. these observations have a 4$\sigma$ sensitivity of ~1 jy and avelocity resolution of ~0.4 km/s.} results: we have detected 163 h2o masers,approximately 75% of which were previously unknown. comparing the maservelocities with the velocities of the rms sources, determined from 13coobservations, we have identified 135 rms-h2o maser associations, whichcorresponds to a detection rate of ~27%. taking into account the differences insensitivity and source selection we find our detection rate is in generalagreement with previously reported surveys. conclusions: we find similardetection rates for uchii regions and mysos candidates, suggesting that theconditions needed for maser activity are equally likely in these two stages ofthe star formation process. looking at the detection rate as a function ofdistance from the galactic centre we find it significantly enhanced within thesolar circle, peaking at ~37% between 6-7 kpc, which is consistent withprevious surveys of uc hii regions, possibly indicating the presence of a highproportion of more luminous ysos and hii regions.

0912.2682	the rms survey: far-infrared photometry of young massive stars	context: the red msx source (rms) survey is a multi-wavelength campaign offollow-up observations of a colour-selected sample of candidate massive youngstellar objects (mysos) in the galactic plane. this survey is returning thelargest well-selected sample of mysos to date, while identifying other dustcontaminant sources with similar mid-infrared colours including a large numberof new ultra-compact (uc)hii regions. aims:to measure the far-infrared (ir)flux, which lies near the peak of the spectral energy distribution (sed) ofmysos and uchii regions, so that, together with distance information, theluminosity of these sources can be obtained. methods:less than 50% of rmssources are associated with iras point sources with detections at 60 micron and100 micron, though the vast majority are visible in spitzer mipsgal or irasgalaxy atlas (iga) images. however, standard aperture photometry is notappropriate for these data due to crowding of sources and strong spatiallyvariable far-ir background emission in the galactic plane. a new techniqueusing a 2-dimensional fit to the background in an annulus around each source istherefore used to obtain far-ir photometry for young rms sources.results:far-ir fluxes are obtained for a total of 1113 rms candidatesidentified as young sources. of these 734 have flux measurements using iga 60micron and 100 micron images and 724 using mipsgal 70 micron images, with 345having measurements in both data sets.

1005.5036	characterisation of the mopra radio telescope at 16--50 ghz	we present the results of a programme of scanning and mapping observations ofastronomical masers and jupiter designed to characterise the performance of themopra radio telescope at frequencies between 16-50 ghz using the 12-mm and 7-mmreceivers. we use these observations to determine the telescope beam size, beamshape and overall telescope beam efficiency as a function of frequency. we findthat the beam size is well fit by $\lambda$/$d$ over the frequency range with acorrelation coefficient of ~90%. we determine the telescope main beamefficiencies are between ~48-64% for the 12-mm receiver and reasonably flat at~50% for the 7-mm receiver. beam maps of strong h$_2$o (22 ghz) and sio masers(43 ghz) provide a means to examine the radial beam pattern of the telescope.at both frequencies the radial beam pattern reveals the presence of threecomponents, a central `core', which is well fit by a gaussian and constitutesthe telescopes main beam, and inner and outer error beams. at both frequenciesthe inner and outer error beams extend out to approximately 2 and 3.4 times thefull-width half maximum of the main beam respectively. sources with angularsizes a factor of two or more larger than the telescope main beam will coupleto the main and error beams, and therefore the power contributed by the errorbeams needs to be considered. from measurements of the radial beam powerpattern we estimate the amount of power contained in the inner and outer errorbeams is of order one-fifth at 22 ghz rising slightly to one-third at 43 ghz.

1006.0833	ammonia observations of bright-rimmed clouds: establishing a sample of  triggered protostars	we observed 42 molecular condensations within previously identifiedbright-rimmed clouds in the ammonia rotational inversion lines nh3 (1,1),(2,2), (3,3) and (4,4) using the green bank telescope in green bank, westvirginia. using the relative peaks of the ammonia lines and their hyperfinesatellites we have determined important parameters of these clouds, includingrotational temperatures and column densities.  these observations confirm the presence of dense gas towards iras pointsources detected at submillimetre wavelengths. derived physical propertiesallow us to refine the sample of bright-rimmed clouds into those likely to besites of star formation, triggered via the process of radiatively-drivenimplosion. an investigation of the physical properties of our sources show thattriggered sources are host to greater turbulent velocity dispersions, likelyindicative of shock motions within the cloud material. these may be attributedto the passage of triggered shocks or simply the association of outflowactivity with the sources.  in all, we have refined the sugitani et al. (1991) catalogue to 15 cloudswhich are clearly star-forming and influenced by externalphotoionisation-induced shocks. these sources may be said, with highconfidence, to represent the best examples of triggering within bright-rimmedclouds.

1006.2140	the g305 star forming complex: wide-area molecular mapping of nh3 and  h2o masers	we present wide area radio (12 mm) mopra telescope observations of thecomplex and rich massive star forming region g305. our goals are to determinethe reservoir for star formation within g305 using nh3 to trace the densemolecular content, and thus, the gas available to form stars; estimate physicalparameters of detected nh3 clumps (temperature, column density, mass etc);locate current areas of active star formation via the presence of h2o andmethanol masers and the distribution of ysos and ultra compact hii regionsassociated with this region. this paper details the nh3 (j,k), (1,1), (2,2) and(3,3) inversion transition and 22 ghz h2o maser observations. we observed a\sim 1.5\circ x 1\circ region with \sim 2' angular resolution and a sensitivityof \sim 60 mk per 0.4 km s^-1 channel. we identify 15 nh3 (1,1), 12 nh3 (2,2)and 6 nh3 (3,3) clumps surrounding the central hii region. the sizes of theclumps vary between &lt; 2.6 and 10.1 pc, the average kinetic temperature of thegas is 25 k. we calculate clump masses of &gt; 10^4 m\odot and find the totalmolecular mass of the complex to be \sim 6x10^5 m\odot. we note the positionsof 56 star formation tracers, and discover a high degree of correlation withdetected nh3 clumps. we have detected 16 h2o masers, find they correlate withthe detected ammonia clumps and in general are found closer to the nh3 clumpcores than star formation tracers of later evolutionary stages.

1007.3289	probing discs around massive young stellar objects with co first  overtone emission	we present high resolution (r~50,000) spectroastrometry over the co 1stovertone bandhead of a sample of seven intermediate/massive young stellarobjects. these are primarily drawn from the red msx source (rms) survey, asystematic search for young massive stars which has returned a large, wellselected sample of such objects. the mean luminosity of the sample isapproximately 5 times 10^4 l_\odot, indicating the objects typically have amass of ~15 solar masses. we fit the observed bandhead profiles with a model ofa circumstellar disc, and find good agreement between the models andobservations for all but one object. we compare the high angular precision(0.2-0.8 mas) spectroastrometric data to the spatial distribution of theemitting material in the best-fitting models. no spatial signatures of discsare detected, which is entirely consistent with the properties of thebest-fitting models. therefore, the observations suggest that the co bandheademission of massive young stellar objects originates in small-scale disks, inagreement with previous work. this provides further evidence that massive starsform via disc accretion, as suggested by recent simulations.

1008.3149	the rms survey: distribution and properties of a sample of massive young  stars	the red msx source (rms) survey has identified a large sample of massiveyoung stellar objects (mysos) and ultra compact (uc) hii regions from a sampleof ~2000 msx and 2mass colour selected sources. using a recent catalogue ofmolecular clouds derived from the boston university-five college radioastronomy observatory galactic ring survey (grs), and by applying a galacticscaleheight cut off of 120 pc, we solve the distance ambiguity for rms sourceslocated within 18\degr &lt; |l| &gt; 54\degr. these two steps yield kinematicdistances to 291 sources out of a possible 326 located within the grs longituderange. combining distances and integrated fluxes derived from spectral energydistributions, we estimate luminosities to these sources and find that &gt; 90%are indicative of the presence of a massive star. we find the completenesslimit of our sample is ~10^4 lsun, which corresponds to a zero age mainsequence (zams) star with a mass of ~12 msun. selecting only these sources, weconstruct a complete sample of 196 sources. comparing the properties of thesample of young massive stars with the general population, we find therms-clouds are generally larger, more massive, and more turbulent. we examinethe distribution of this sub-sample with respect to the location of the spiralarms and the galactic bar and find them to be spatially correlated. we identifythree significant peaks in the source surface density at galactocentric radiiof approximately 4, 6 and 8 kpc, which correspond to the proposed positions ofthe scutum, sagittarius and perseus spiral arms, respectively. fitting a scaleheight to the data we obtain an average value of ~29+-0.5 pc, which agrees wellwith other reported values in the literature, however, we note a dependence ofthe scale height on galactocentric radius with it increases from 30 pc to 45 pcbetween 2.5 and 8.5 kpc.

0709.2040	the rms survey: mid-infrared observations of candidate massive ysos in  the southern hemisphere	abridged abstract: the red msx source (rms) survey is an ongoing effort toreturn a large, well-selected sample of massive young stellar objects (mysos)within our galaxy. a series of ground-based follow-up observations are beingundertaken in order to remove contaminant objects from our list of 2000candidates, and to begin characterising these mysos. as a part of thesefollow-up observations, high resolution (~1") mid-ir imaging aids theidentification of contaminant objects which are resolved (uchii regions, pn) asopposed to those which are unresolved (ysos, evolved stars) as well asidentifying ysos near uchii regions and other multiple sources. we present 10.4micron imaging observations for 346 candidate mysos in the rms survey in thesouthern hemisphere, primarily outside the region covered by the glimpsespitzer legacy survey. these were obtained using timmi2 on the eso 3.6mtelescope in la silla, chile. our photometric accuracy is of order 0.05jy, andour astrometric accuracy is 0.8", which is an improvement over the nominal 2"accuracy of the msx psc.

1105.3532	the australia telescope compact array broadband backend (cabb)	here we describe the compact array broadband backend (cabb) and present firstresults obtained with the upgraded australia telescope compact array (atca).the 16-fold increase in observing bandwidth, from 2 x 128 mhz to 2 x 2048 mhz,high bit sampling, and addition of 16 zoom windows (each divided into a further2048 channels) provide major improvements for all atca observations. thebenefits of the new system are: (1) hugely increased radio continuum andpolarization sensitivity as well as image fidelity, (2) substantially improvedcapability to search for and map emission and absorption lines over largevelocity ranges, (3) simultaneous multi-line and continuum observations, (4)increased sensitivity, survey speed and dynamic range due to high-bit sampling,and (5) high velocity resolution, while maintaining full polarization output.the new cabb system encourages all observers to make use of both spectral lineand continuum data to achieve their full potential.  given the dramatic increase of the atca capabilities in all bands (rangingfrom 1.1 to 105 ghz) cabb enables scientific projects that were not feasiblebefore the upgrade, such as simultaneous observations of multiple spectrallines, on-the-fly mapping, fast follow-up of radio transients (e.g., the radioafterglow of new supernovae) and maser observations at high velocity resolutionand full polarization. the first science results presented here includewide-band spectra, high dynamic-range images, and polarization measurements,highlighting the increased capability and discovery potential of the atca.

1107.3913	the rms survey: ammonia and water maser analysis of massive star forming  regions	the red msx source (rms) survey has identified a sample of ~1200 massiveyoung stellar objects (mysos), compact and ultra compact hii regions from asample of ~2000 msx and 2mass colour selected sources. we have used the 100 mgreen bank telescope to search for 22-24 ghz water maser and ammonia (1,1),(2,2) and (3,3) emission towards ~600 rms sources located within the northerngalactic plane. we have identified 308 h2o masers which corresponds to anoverall detection rate of ~50%. abridged: we detect ammonia emission towards479 of these massive young stars, which corresponds to ~80%. ammonia is anexcellent probe of high density gas allowing us to measure key parameters suchas gas temperatures, opacities, and column densities, as well as providing aninsight into the gas kinematics. the average kinetic temperature, fwhm linewidth and total nh3 column density for the sample are approximately 22 k, 2km/s and 2x10^{15} cm^{-2}, respectively. we find that the nh3 (1,1) line widthand kinetic temperature are correlated with luminosity and finding nounderlying dependence of these parameters on the evolutionary phase of theembedded sources, we conclude that the observed trends in the derivedparameters are more likely to be due to the energy output of the central sourceand/or the line width-clump mass relationship. the velocities of the peak h2omasers and the nh3 emission are in excellent agreement with each other, whichwould strongly suggest an association between the dense gas and the maseremission. moreover, we find the bolometric luminosity of the embedded sourceand the isotropic luminosity of the h2o maser are also correlated. we concludefrom the correlations of the cloud and water maser velocities and thebolometric and maser luminosity that there is a strong dynamical relationshipbetween the embedded young massive star and the h2o maser.

1111.0972	the statistics of triggered star formation: an overdensity of massive  ysos around spitzer bubbles	we present a detailed statistical study of massive star formation in theenvironment of 322 spitzer mid-infrared bubbles by using the rms survey formassive young stellar objects (ysos). using a combination of simple surfacedensity plots and a more sophisticated angular cross-correlation functionanalysis we show that there is a statistically significant overdensity of rmsysos towards the bubbles. there is a clear peak in the surface density andangular cross-correlation function of ysos projected against the rim of thebubbles. by investigating the autocorrelation function of the rms ysos we showthat this is not due to intrinsic clustering of the rms yso sample. rms ysosand spitzer bubbles are essentially uncorrelated with each other beyond anormalised angular distance of two bubble radii. the bubbles associated withrms ysos tend to be both smaller and thinner than those that are not associatedwith ysos. we interpret this tendency to be due to an age effect, with ysosbeing preferentially found around smaller and younger bubbles. we find noevidence to suggest that the ysos associated with the bubbles are any moreluminous than the rest of the rms yso population, which suggests that thetriggering process does not produce a top heavy luminosity function or initialmass function. we suggest that it is likely that the ysos were triggered by theexpansion of the bubbles and estimate that the fraction of massive stars in themilky way formed by this process could be between 14 and 30%.

1204.1578	the effect of spiral arms on star formation in the galaxy	we have examined the ratio between the integrated luminosity of massive youngstellar objects detected by the red msx source (rms) survey and the mass ofmolecular clouds in the galactic ring survey region, as a function ofgalactocentric radius. the results indicate that 60--80% of the observedincreases in the star-formation rate density associated with spiral-armfeatures are due to source crowding within the arms. of the remainder, most ofthe increase in the inner sagittarius arm is due to an enhancement in thesimple star-formation efficiency, i.e. in the number of rms sources per unitmolecular gas mass. in the inner perseus arm, the residual increase is due to ahigher than average mean source luminosity, which implies a top-heavy imf, andthis is entirely due to the presence, in the grs region, of the w49star-forming complex, which appears to be exceptional in its nature. theresults also suggest that there is little or no increase in the star-formationefficiency on kiloparsec scales in the scutum tangent region which includesw43. we discuss the possible role played by the spiral arms in influencing thestar-formation efficiency and conclude that the most likely mechanisms arerelated to orbit crowding within the arms.

1207.6159	the h2o southern galactic plane survey(hops): nh3 (1,1) and (2,2)  catalogues	the h2o southern galactic plane survey (hops) has mapped a 100 degree stripof the galactic plane (-70deg &gt; l &gt; 30deg, |b| &lt; 0.5deg) using the 22-m mopraantenna at 12-mm wavelengths. observations were conducted in on-the-fly modeusing the mopra spectrometer (mops), targeting water masers, thermal molecularemission and radio-recombination lines. foremost among the thermal lines arethe 23 ghz transitions of nh3 j,k = (1,1) and (2,2), which trace the densestparts of molecular clouds (n &gt; 10^4 cm^{-3}). in this paper we present the nh3(1,1) and (2,2) data, which have a resolution of 2 arcmin and cover a velocityrange of +/-200 km/s. the median sensitivity of the nh3 data-cubes is sigma_tmb= 0.20 +/1 0.06 k. for the (1,1) transition this sensitivity equates to a 3.2kpc distance limit for detecting a 20 k, 400 msun cloud at the 5-sigma level.similar clouds of mass 5,000 msun would be detected as far as the galacticcentre, while 30,000 msun clouds would be seen across the galaxy. we havedeveloped an automatic emission finding procedure based on the atnf duchampsoftware and have used it to create a new catalogue of 669 dense molecularclouds. the catalogue is 100 percent complete at the 5-sigma detection limit(tmb = 1.0 k). a preliminary analysis of the ensemble cloud properties suggestthat the near kinematic distances are favoured. the cloud positions areconsistent with current models of the galaxy containing a long bar. combinedwith other galactic plane surveys this new molecular-line dataset constitutes akey tool for examining galactic structure and evolution. data-cubes, spectraand catalogues are available to the community via the hops website.

1208.0599	the g305 star-forming complex: embedded massive star formation  discovered by herschel hi-gal	we present a herschel far-infrared study towards the rich massive star-forming complex g305, utilising pacs 70, 160 {\mu}m and spire 250, 350, and 500{\mu}m observations from the hi-gal survey of the galactic plane. the focus ofthis study is to identify the embedded massive star-forming population withing305, by combining far-infrared data with radio continuum, h2o maser, methanolmaser, mips, and red msx source survey data available from previous studies. byapplying a frequentist technique we are able to identify a sample of the mostlikely associations within our multi-wavelength dataset, that can then beidentified from the derived properties obtained from fitted spectral energydistributions (seds). by sed modelling using both a simple modified blackbodyand fitting to a comprehensive grid of model seds, some 16 candidateassociations are identified as embedded massive star-forming regions. we derivea two-selection colour criterion from this sample of log(f70/f500)\geq 1 andlog(f160/f350)\geq 1.6 to identify an additional 31 embedded massive starcandidates with no associated star-formation tracers. using this result we canbuild a picture of the present day star-formation of the complex, and byextrapolating an initial mass function, suggest a current population of \approx2 \times 10^4 young stellar objects (ysos) present, corresponding to a starformation rate (sfr) of 0.01-0.02 m\odot yr^-1. comparing this resolved starformation rate, to extragalactic star formation rate tracers (based on thekennicutt-schmidt relation), we find the star formation activity isunderestimated by a factor of \geq 2 in comparison to the sfr derived from theyso population.

1212.0554	co bandhead emission of massive young stellar objects: determining disc  properties	massive stars play an important role in many areas of astrophysics, butnumerous details regarding their formation remain unclear. in this paper wepresent and analyse high resolution (r ~ 30,000) near-infrared 2.3 micronspectra of 20 massive young stellar objects from the rms database, in thelargest such study of co first overtone bandhead emission to date. we fit theemission under the assumption it originates from a circumstellar disc inkeplerian rotation. we explore three approaches to modelling the physicalconditions within the disc - a disc heated mainly via irradiation from thecentral star, a disc heated mainly via viscosity, and a disc in which thetemperature and density are described analytically. we find that the modelsdescribed by heating mechanisms are inappropriate because they do not providegood fits to the co emission spectra. we therefore restrict our analysis to theanalytic model, and obtain good fits to all objects that possess sufficientlystrong co emission, suggesting circumstellar discs are the source of thisemission. on average, the temperature and density structure of the discscorrespond to geometrically thin discs, spread across a wide range ofinclinations. essentially all the discs are located within the dust sublimationradius, providing strong evidence that the co emission originates close to thecentral protostar, on astronomical unit scales. in addition, we show that theobjects in our sample appear no different to the general population of mysos inthe rms database, based on their near- and mid-infrared colours. thecombination of observations of a large sample of mysos with co bandheademission and our detailed modelling provide compelling evidence of the presenceof small scale gaseous discs around such objects, supporting the scenario inwhich massive stars form via disc accretion.

1212.1429	the correlation of dust and gas emission in star-forming environments	we present ammonia maps of portions of the w3 and perseus molecular clouds inorder to compare gas emission with submillimetre continuum thermal emissionwhich are commonly used to trace the same mass component in star-formingregions, often under the assumption of lte.  the perseus and w3 star-forming regions are found to have significantlydifferent physical characteristics consistent with the difference in sizescales traced by our observations. accounting for the distance of the w3 regiondoes not fully reconcile these differences, suggesting that there may be anunderlying difference in the structure of the two regions. peak positions ofsubmillimetre and ammonia emission do not correlate strongly. also, the extentof diffuse emission is only moderately matched between ammonia and thermalemission. source sizes measured from our observations are consistent betweenregions, although there is a noticeable difference between the submillimetresource sizes with sources in perseus being significantly smaller than those inw3. fractional abundances of ammonia are determined for our sources whichindicate a dip in the measured ammonia abundance at the positions of peaksubmillimetre column density. virial ratios are determined which show that oursources are generally bound in both regions, although there is considerablescatter in both samples. we conclude that sources in perseus are bound onsmaller scales than in w3 in a way that may reflect their previousidentification as low- and high-mass, respectively. our results indicate thatassumptions of local thermal equilibrium and/or the coupling of the dust andgas phases in star-forming regions may not be as robust as commonly assumed.

1310.4758	the rms survey: galactic distribution of massive star formation	abridged: we have used the well-selected sample of ~1750 embedded, young,massive stars identified by the rms survey to investigate the galacticdistribution of recent massive star formation. we describe the various methodsused to assign distances extracted from the literature, and solve the distanceambiguities towards ~200 sources located within the solar circle using archivalhi data. these distances are used to calculate bolometric luminosities andestimate the survey completeness (~2x10^4 lsun). in total, we calculate thedistance and luminosity of ~1650 sources, one third of which are above thesurvey's completeness threshold. examination of the sample's longitude,latitude, radial velocities and mid-infrared images has identified ~120 smallgroups of sources, many of which are associated with well known star formationcomplexes, such as w43, w49 and w51.  we compare the positional distribution of the sample with the expectedlocations of the spiral arms, assuming a model of the galaxy consisting of fourgaseous arms. the distribution of young massive stars in the milky way isspatially correlated with the spiral arms, with strong peaks in the sourceposition and luminosity distributions at the arms' galactocentric radii. theoverall source and luminosity surface densities are both well correlated withthe surface density of the molecular gas, which suggests that the massive starformation rate per unit molecular mass is approximately constant across thegalaxy.  we estimate the total luminosity of the embedded massive star population tobe ~0.76x10^8 lsun, 30% of which is associated with the ten most active starforming complexes. we measure the scale height as a function of galactocentricdistance and find that it increases only modestly from ~20-30 pc between 4 and8 kpc, but much more rapidly at larger distances.

1501.06589	6.7ghz methanol maser associated outflows: an evolutionary sequence	we present a continuing study of a sample 44 molecular outflows, observed in13co lines, closely associated with 6.7ghz methanol masers, hence calledmethanol maser associated outflows (mmaos). we compare mmao properties withthose of outflows from other surveys in the literature. in general, mmaosfollow similar trends, but show a deficit in number at low masses and momenta,with a corresponding higher fraction at the high end of the distributions. asimilar trend is seen for the dynamical timescales of mmaos. we argue that thelack of relatively low mass and young flows in mmaos is due to the inherentselection-bias in the sample, i.e. its direct association with 6.7ghz methanolmasers. this implies that methanol masers must switch on after the onset ofoutflows (hence accretion), and not before a sufficient abundance of methanolis liberated from icy dust mantles. consequently the average dynamical age ofmmaos is older than for the general population of molecular outflows. wepropose an adjusted evolutionary sequence of outflow and maser occurrence inthe hot core phase, where methanol masers turn on after the onset of theoutflow phase.

1507.02187	the rms survey: ammonia mapping of the environment of massive young  stellar objects	we present the results of ammonia observations towards 66 massive starforming regions identified by the red msx source survey. we have used the greenbank telescope and the k-band focal plane array to map the ammonia nh3 (1,1)and (2,2) inversion emission at a resolution of 30 arcsec in 8 arcmin regionstowards the positions of embedded massive star formation. we have identified atotal of 115 distinct clumps, approximately two-thirds of which are associatedwith an embedded massive young stellar object or compact hii region, while theothers are classified as quiescent. there is a strong spatial correlationbetween the peak nh3 emission and the presence of embedded objects. we derivethe spatial distribution of the kinetic gas temperatures, line widths, andnh$_3$ column densities from these maps, and by combining these data with dustemission maps we estimate clump masses, h$_2$ column densities and ammoniaabundances. the clumps have typical masses of ~1000 msun and radii ~0.5 pc,line widths of ~2 km/s and kinetic temperatures of ~16-20 k. we find nosignificant difference between the sizes and masses of the star forming andquiescent subsamples; however, the distribution maps reveal the presence oftemperature and line width gradients peaking towards the centre for the starforming clumps while the quiescent clumps show relatively uniform temperaturesand line widths throughout. virial analysis suggests that the vast majority ofclumps are gravitationally bound and are likely to be in a state of global freefall in the absence of strong magnetic fields. the similarities between theproperties of the two subsamples suggest that the quiescent clumps are alsolikely to form massive stars in the future, and therefore provide a excellentopportunity to study the initial conditions of massive pre-stellar andprotostellar clumps.

1509.00199	a distance limited sample of massive molecular outflows	we have observed 99 mid-infrared-bright, massive young stellar objects andcompact hii regions drawn from the red msx source (rms) survey in the j=3$-$2transition of $^{12}$co and $^{13}$co, using the james clerk maxwell telescope.89 targets are within 6 kpc of the sun, covering a representative range ofluminosities and core masses. these constitute a relatively unbiased sample ofbipolar molecular outflows associated with massive star formation. of these,59, 17 and 13 sources (66, 19 and 15 percent) are found to have outflows, showsome evidence of outflow, and have no evidence of outflow, respectively. thetime-dependent parameters of the high-velocity molecular flows are calculatedusing a spatially variable dynamic timescale. the canonical correlationsbetween the outflow parameters and source luminosity are recovered and shown toscale with those of low-mass sources. for coeval star formation we find thescaling is consistent with all the protostars in an embedded cluster providingthe outflow force, with massive stars up to $\sim$30 m$_{\odot}$ generatingoutflows. taken at face value, the results support the model of a scaled-upversion of the accretion-related outflow-generation mechanism associated withdiscs and jets in low-mass objects with time-averaged accretion rates of$\sim$10$^{-3}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ onto the cores. however, we also suggestan alternative model, in which the molecular outflow dynamics are dominated bythe entrained mass and are unrelated to the details of the accelerationmechanism. we find no evidence that outflows contribute significantly to theturbulent kinetic energy of the surrounding dense cores.

0806.0953	the rms survey: $^{13}$co observations of candidate massive ysos in the  northern galactic plane	context: the red msx source (rms) survey is an ongoing multi-wavelengthobservational programme designed to return a large, high-resolutionmid-infrared colour-selected sample of massive young stellar objects.  aims: a critical part of our follow-up programme is to conduct 13co molecularline observations in order to determine kinematic distances to all of our mysocandidates. these distances will allow us to identify and remove nearbylow-mass ysos and help in identifying evolved stars which are weak co emitters.  method: we have used the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt), the 13.7m telescope of the purple mountain observatory (pmo), the 20 m onsala telescopeand the 22m mopra telescope to conduct molecular line observations towards 508mysos candidates located in the 1st and 2nd quadrants.  results: we detect 13co emission towards 780 rms sources which corresponds toapproximately 84% of those observed (911). a total of 2595 emission componentsare detected above 3sigma level (typically t^*_{\rm{a}} &gt; 0.3k), with multiplecomponents being observed towards the majority of these sources -- 520 sources(~56%) -- with an average of ~4 molecular clouds detected along each line ofsight. we have used archival cs (j=2-1) and maser velocities to resolve thecomponent multiplicity towards 175 sources (~20%) and have derived a criterionwhich is used to identify the most likely component for a further 191 multiplecomponent sources. combined with the single component detections we haveobtained unambiguous kinematic velocities for 638 of the 780 mysos candidatestowards which co is detected (~80% of the detections). using the galacticrotation curve we calculate kinematic distances for all detected components.

1510.08374	infall through the evolution of high-mass star-forming clumps	with the great receiver at the stratospheric observatory for infraredastronomy (sofia), nine massive molecular clumps have been observed in theammonia $3_{2+}- 2_{2-}$ line at 1.8~thz in a search for signatures of infall.the sources were selected from the atlasgal submillimeter dust continuum surveyof our galaxy. clumps with high masses covering a range of evolutionary stagesbased on their infrared properties were chosen. the ammonia line was detectedin all sources, leading to five new detections and one confirmation of aprevious detection of redshifted absorption in front of their strong thzcontinuum as a probe of infall in the clumps. these detections include twoclumps embedded in infrared dark clouds. the measured velocity shifts of theabsorptions compared to optically thin \cseo\ (3--2) emission are0.3--2.8~km/s, corresponding to fractions of 3\%\ to 30\% of the free-fallvelocities of the clumps. the ammonia infall signature is compared withcomplementary data of different transitions of hcn, hnc, cs, and hco$^+$, whichare often used to probe infall via their blue-skewed line profiles. the bestagreement with the ammonia results is found for the hco$^+$ (4--3) transitions,but the latter is still strongly blended with emission from associatedoutflows. this outflow signature is far less prominent in the thz ammonialines, which confirms it as a powerful probe of infall in molecular clumps.infall rates in the range from 0.3 to 16~$10^{-3}\,m_\odot/$yr were derivedwith a tentative correlation with the virial parameters of the clumps. the newobservations show that infall on clump scales is ubiquitous through a widerange of evolutionary stages, from $l/m$ covering about ten to severalhundreds.

1511.05138	atlasgal-selected massive clumps in the inner galaxy, ii:  characterisation of different evolutionary stages and their sio emission	the processes leading to the birth of high-mass stars are poorly understood.we characterise here a sample of 430 massive clumps from the atlasgal survey,which are representative of different evolutionary stages. to establish acensus of molecular tracers of their evolution we performed an unbiasedspectral line survey covering the 3-mm atmospheric window between 84-117 ghzwith the iram 30m. a smaller sample of 128 clumps has been observed in the sio(5-4) transition with the apex telescope to complement the sio (2-1) line andprobe the excitation conditions of the emitting gas, which is the main focus ofthe current study. we report a high detection rate of &gt;75% of the sio (2-1)line and a &gt;90% detection rate from the dedicated follow-ups in the (5-4)transition. the sio (2-1) line with broad line profiles and high detectionrates, is a powerful probe of star formation activity, while the ubiquitousdetection of sio in all evolutionary stages suggests a continuous starformation process in massive clumps. we find a large fraction of infrared-quietclumps to exhibit sio emission, the majority of them only showing alow-velocity component (fwhm~5-6 km/s) centred at the rest velocity of theclump. in the current picture, where this is attributed to low-velocity shocksfrom cloud-cloud collisions, this can be used to pinpoint the youngest, thus,likely prestellar massive structures. based on the line ratio of the (5-4) tothe (2-1) line, our study reveals a trend of changing excitation conditionsthat lead to brighter emission in the (5-4) line towards more evolved sources.our analysis delivers a more robust estimate of sio column density andabundance than previous studies and questions the decrease of jet activity inmassive clumps as a function of age.

1511.07145	the atlasgal survey: distribution of cold dust in the galactic plane.  combination with planck data	sensitive ground-based submillimeter surveys, such as atlasgal, provide aglobal view on the distribution of cold dense gas in the galactic plane. herewe use the 353 ghz maps from the planck/hfi instrument to complement theground-based apex/laboca observations with information on larger angularscales. the resulting maps reveal the distribution of cold dust in the innergalaxy with a larger spatial dynamic range. we find examples of elongatedstructures extending over angular scales of 0.5 degree. corresponding to &gt;30 pcstructures in projection at a distance of 3 kpc, these dust lanes are veryextended and show large aspect ratios. furthermore, we assess the fraction ofdense gas ($f_{\rm dg}$), and estimate 2-5% (above a$_{\rm{v}}&gt;$7 mag) onaverage in the galactic plane. pdfs of the column density reveal the typicallyobserved log-normal distribution for low- and exhibit an excess at high columndensities. as a reference for extragalactic studies, we show the line-of-sightintegrated n-pdf of the inner galaxy, and derive a contribution of this excessto the total column density of $\sim2.2$%, above $n_{\rm h_2} =2.92\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. taking the total flux density, we provide anindependent estimate of the mass of molecular gas in the inner galaxy of$\sim1\times10^9\,m_{\odot}$, which is consistent with previous estimates usingco emission. from the mass and $f_{\rm dg}$ we estimate a galactic sfr of $\dotm = 1.3\,m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. while the distribution of diffuse gas ishomogenous in the inner galaxy, the cmz stands out with a higher dense gasfraction. the low star formation efficiency of the milky way is well explainedby the low $f_{\rm dg}$ in the galactic ism, while the high $f_{\rm dg}$towards the cmz, despite its low star formation activity, suggests that, inthat particular region of our galaxy, high-density gas is not the bottleneckfor star formation.

1512.00334	observational constraints on star cluster formation theory - i. the  mass-radius relation	stars form predominantly in groups usually denoted as clusters orassociations. the observed stellar groups display a broad spectrum of masses,sizes and other properties, so it is often assumed that there is no underlyingstructure in this diversity. here we show that the assumption of anunstructured multitude of cluster or association types might be misleading.current data compilations of clusters show correlations between cluster mass,size, age, maximum stellar mass etc. in this first paper we take a closer lookat the correlation of cluster mass and radius. we use literature data toexplore relations in cluster and molecular core properties in the solarneighborhood. we show that for embedded clusters in the solar neighborhoodthere exists a clear correlation between cluster mass and half-mass radius ofthe form $m_c = c r_c^{\gamma}$ with gamma = 1.7 +/-0.2. this correlation holdsfor infra red k band data as well as x-ray sources and for clusters containinga hundred stars up to those consisting of a few tens of thousands of stars. thecorrelation is difficult to verify for clusters containing &lt;30 stars due tolow-number statistics. dense clumps of gas are the progenitors of the embeddedclusters. we find a similar slope for the mass-size relation of dense, massiveclumps as for the embedded star clusters. this might point at a directtranslation from gas to stellar mass: however, it is difficult to relate sizemeasurements for clusters (stars) to those for gas profiles. taking intoaccount multiple paths for clump mass into cluster mass, we obtain an averagestar-formation efficiency of 18%{+9.3}{-5.7} for the embedded clusters in thesolar neighborhood. the derived mass-radius relation gives constraints for thetheory of clustered star formation. analytical models and simulations ofclustered star formation have to reproduce this relation in order to berealistic (abridged)
