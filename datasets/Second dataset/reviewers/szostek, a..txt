0909.2790	probing the behaviour of the x-ray binary cygnus x-3 with  very-long-baseline radio interferometry	in order to test the recently proposed classification of the radio/x-raystates of the x-ray binary cyg x-3, we present an analysis of the radio dataavailable for the system at much higher spatial resolutions than used fordefining the states. the radio data set consists of archival vlba data at 5 or15 ghz and new e-evn data at 5 ghz. we also present 5 ghz merlin observationsof an outburst of cyg x-3. in the x-ray regime we use quasi-simultaneous withradio, monitoring and pointed rxte observations. we find that when the radioemission from both jet and core is globally considered, the behaviour of cygx-3 at milliarcsecond scales is consistent with that described at arcsecondscales. however, when the radio emission is disentangled in a core componentand a jet component the situation changes. it becomes clear that in activestates the radio emission from the jet is dominating that from the core. thisshows that in these states the overall radio flux cannot be used as a directtracer of the accretion state.

1004.2089	multi-wavelength observations of h 2356-309	aims: the properties of the broad-band emission from the high-frequencypeaked bl lac h 2356-309 (z=0.165) are investigated. methods: very high energy(vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) observations of h 2356-309 were performed with the highenergy stereoscopic system (hess) from 2004 through 2007. simultaneousoptical/uv and x-ray observations were made with the xmm-newton satellite onjune 12/13 and june 14/15, 2005. nrt radio observations were alsocontemporaneously performed in 2005. atom optical monitoring observations werealso made in 2007. results: a strong vhe signal, ~13 sigma total, was detectedby hess after the four years hess observations (116.8 hrs live time). theintegral flux above 240 gev is i(&gt;240 gev) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observedfrom the crab nebula. a time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 gevto 2 tev and is characterized by a power law (photon index of gamma = 3.06 +-0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). significant small-amplitude variations in the vheflux from h 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not onshorter time scales. no evidence for any variations in the vhe spectral slopeare found within these data. the xmm-newton x-ray measurements show ahistorically low x-ray state, characterized by a hard, broken-power-lawspectrum on both nights. conclusions: the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) of the blazar can be adequately fit using a simple one-zonesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) model. in the ssc scenario, higher vhe fluxescould be expected in the future since the observed x-ray flux is at ahistorically low level.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1111.6975	tracing colliding winds in the uv line orbital variability of gamma-ray  binaries	gamma-ray binaries emit most of their radiated power beyond ~10 mev. thenon-thermal emission is thought to arise from the interaction of therelativistic wind of a rotation-powered pulsar with the stellar wind of itsmassive (o or be) companion star. a powerful pulsar creates an extended cavity,filled with relativistic electrons, in the radiatively-driven wind of themassive star. as a result, the observed p cyg profiles of uv resonant linesfrom the stellar wind should be different from those of single massive stars.we propose to use uv emission lines to detect and constrain the colliding windregion in gamma-ray binaries. we compute the expected orbital variability of pcyg profiles depending upon the interaction geometry (set by the ratio ofmomentum fluxes from the winds) and the line-of-sight to the system. we predictlittle or no variability for the case of ls 5039 and psr b1259-63, in agreementwith currently available hst observations of ls 5039. however, variabilitybetween superior and inferior conjunction is expected in the case of ls i+61303.

1201.3356	a giant radio flare from cygnus x-3 with associated gamma-ray emission	with frequent flaring activity of its relativistic jets, cygnus x-3 is one ofthe most active microquasars and is the only galactic black hole candidate withconfirmed high energy gamma-ray emission, thanks to detections by fermi/lat andagile. in 2011, cygnus x-3 was observed to transit to a soft x-ray state, whichis known to be associated with high-energy gamma-ray emission. we present theresults of a multi-wavelength campaign covering a quenched state, when radioemission from cygnus x-3 is at its weakest and the x-ray spectrum is very soft.a giant (~ 20 jy) optically thin radio flare marks the end of the quenchedstate, accompanied by rising non-thermal hard x-rays. fermi/lat observations (e&gt;100 mev) reveal renewed gamma-ray activity associated with this giant radioflare, suggesting a common origin for all non-thermal components. in addition,current observations unambiguously show that the gamma-ray emission is notexclusively related to the rare giant radio flares. a 3-week period ofgamma-ray emission is also detected when cygnus x-3 was weakly flaring inradio, right before transition to the radio quenched state. no gamma rays areobserved during the ~ one-month long quenched state, when the radio flux isweakest. our results suggest transitions into and out of the ultrasoft x-ray(radio quenched) state trigger gamma-ray emission, implying a connection to theaccretion process, and also that the gamma-ray activity is related to the levelof radio flux (and possibly shock formation), strengthening the connection tothe relativistic jets.

1201.4135	a multiwavelength view of the flaring state of pks 2155-304 in 2006	multiwavelength (mwl) observations of the blazar pks 2155-304 during twoweeks in july and august 2006, the period when two exceptional flares at veryhigh energies (vhe, e&gt;= 100 gev) occurred, provide a detailed picture of theevolution of its emission. the complete data set from this campaign ispresented, including observations in vhe gamma-rays (h.e.s.s.), x-rays (rxte,chandra, swift xrt), optical (swift uvot, bronberg, watcher, rotse), and in theradio band (nrt, hartrao, atca). optical and radio light curves from 2004 to2008 are compared to the available vhe data from this period, to put the 2006campaign into the context of the long-term evolution of the source. the x-rayand vhe gamma-ray emission are correlated during the observed high state of thesource, but show no direct connection with longer wavelengths. the long-termflux evolution in the optical and radio bands is found to be correlated andshows that the source reaches a high state at long wavelengths after theoccurrence of the vhe flares. spectral hardening is seen in the swift xrt data.the nightly averaged high-energy spectra of the non-flaring nights can bereproduced by a stationary one-zone ssc model, with only small variations inthe parameters. the spectral and flux evolution in the high-energy band duringthe night of the second vhe flare is modelled with multi-zone ssc models, whichcan provide relatively simple interpretations for the hour time-scale evolutionof the high-energy emission, even for such a complex data set. for the firsttime in this type of source, a clear indication is found for a relation betweenhigh activity at high energies and a long-term increase in the low frequencyfluxes.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1301.1678	search for very-high-energy \gamma-ray emission from galactic globular  clusters with h.e.s.s	globular clusters (gcs) are established emitters of high-energy (he, 100mev&lt;e&lt;100 gev) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulativeemission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (mspsrs) in the clusters' cores orfrom inverse compton (ic) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in thegc environment. these stellar clusters could also constitute a new class ofsources in the very-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) \gamma-ray regime, judgingfrom the recent detection of a signal from the direction of terzan 5 with theh.e.s.s. telescope array.  we searched for point-like and extended vhe \gamma-ray emission from 15 gcsserendipitously covered by h.e.s.s observations and also performed a stackinganalysis combining the data from all gcs to investigate the hypothesis of apopulation of faint emitters. assuming ic emission as the origin of the vhe\gamma-ray signal from the direction of terzan 5, we calculated the expected\gamma-ray flux from each of the 15 gcs, based on their number of millisecondpulsars, their optical brightness and the energy density of background photonfields.  we did not detect significant vhe \gamma-ray emission from any of the 15 gcsin either of the two analyses. given the uncertainties related to the parameterdeterminations, the obtained flux upper limits allow to rule out the simpleic/mspsr scaling model for ngc 6388 and ngc 7078. the upper limits derived fromthe stacking analyses are factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted bythe simple leptonic scaling model, depending on the assumed source extent andthe dominant target photon fields. therefore, terzan 5 still remainsexceptional among all gcs, as the vhe \gamma-ray emission either arises fromextra-ordinarily efficient leptonic processes, or from a recent catastrophicevent, or is even unrelated to the gc itself.

astro-ph;0610017	jet radio emission in cygnus x-1 and its orbital modulation	we present results of our detailed theoretical study of the observed orbitalmodulation of the radio emission in cyg x-1. the modulation occurs due tofree-free absorption in the wind from the companion star varying with theorbital phase, and our results put strong constraints on the spatialdistribution of the jet radio emission at the frequencies of 2-15 ghz. acrucial role in enhancing the asymmetry of the wind absorption suffered by thejet emission is played by the irradiation by x-rays emitted in the vicinity ofthe black hole. this increases the wind temperature by more than order ofmagnitude with respect to that of the wind of an isolated supergiant. theobserved phase lags of the minima of the radio emission with respect to thespectroscopic zero phase strongly imply the bulk of the mass of the jet isnonrelativistic (~5 x 10^8 cm/s) within the jet core. the jet can, however,become relativistic outside the core. also, the jet can have a two-componentstructure, being slow on the outside and fast inside, in which case itssynchrotron-emitting part may be relativistic already in the core. we alsoconsider the observed superorbital modulation of the radio emission (with theperiod of ~150 d) and find it can be explained by a jet precession both causingvariable wind absorption and changing the jet doppler factor. finally, weconsider the case of cyg x-3, and show that its lack of observable orbitalradio modulation (in spite of strong modulation of x-rays) is explained by thatsystem being both much more compact and much more luminous than cyg x-1.
