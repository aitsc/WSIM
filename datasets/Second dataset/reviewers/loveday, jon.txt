0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

1009.0615	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): fuv, nuv, ugrizyjhk petrosian, kron and  s\`ersic photometry	in order to generate credible 0.1-2 {\mu}m seds, the gama project requiresmany gigabytes of imaging data from a number of instruments to be re-processedinto a standard format. in this paper we discuss the software infrastructure weuse, and create self-consistent ugrizyjhk photometry for all sources within thegama sample. using ukidss and sdss archive data, we outline the pre-processingnecessary to standardise all images to a common zeropoint, the steps taken tocorrect for seeing bias across the dataset, and the creation of gigapixel-scalemosaics of the three 4x12 deg gama regions in each filter. from these mosaics,we extract source catalogues for the gama regions using elliptical kron andpetrosian matched apertures. we also calculate s\'ersic magnitudes for allgalaxies within the gama sample using sigma, a galaxy component modellingwrapper for galfit 3. we compare the resultant photometry directly, and alsocalculate the r band galaxy lf for all photometric datasets to highlight theuncertainty introduced by the photometric method. we find that (1) changing theobject detection threshold has a minor effect on the best-fitting schechterparameters of the overall population (m* +/- 0.055mag, {\alpha} +/- 0.014,{\phi}* +/- 0.0005 h^3 mpc^{-3}). (2) an offset between datasets that use kronor petrosian photometry regardless of the filter. (3) the decision to usecircular or elliptical apertures causes an offset in m* of 0.20mag. (4) thebest-fitting schechter parameters from total-magnitude photometric systems(such as sdss modelmag or s\'ersic magnitudes) have a steeper faint-end slopethan photometry dependent on kron or petrosian magnitudes. (5) our universe'stotal luminosity density, when calculated using kron or petrosian r-bandphotometry, is underestimated by at least 15%.

1108.0635	galaxy and mass assembly: stellar mass estimates	this paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically-derived stellarmass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z &lt; 0.65) galaxies in the galaxy andmass assembly (gama) spectroscopic redshift survey. these masses, as well asthe full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public aspart of gama data release 2. although the gama database does include nirphotometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fitsis significantly poorer when these nir data are included. further, for a largefraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from theoptical-plus-nir photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred fromthe optical data alone. this may indicate problems in our stellar populationlibrary, or nir data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for futureversions of the catalogue. for now, we have chosen to base our stellar massestimates on optical photometry only. in light of our decision to ignore theavailable nir data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained basedon optical data alone. we use generic properties of stellar populationsynthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle avery good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, m*/li. further, we use theobserved relation between restframe (g-i) and m*/li for real gama galaxies toargue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves,(g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate m*/li to an accuracy of &lt; ~0.1dex. this 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-m*/li relation offers a simple andtransparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimaldata, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their resultsto z &lt; ~0.4 measurements from gama.

1306.4963	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy radial alignments in gama groups	we constrain the distributions of projected radial alignment angles ofsatellite galaxy shapes within the galaxy and mass assembly survey groupcatalogue. we identify the galaxy groups using spectroscopic redshifts andmeasure galaxy projected ellipticities from sloan digital sky survey imaging.with a sample of 3,850 groups with 13,655 satellite galaxies with high qualityshape measurements, we find a less than 2-sigma signal of radial alignments inthe mean projected ellipticity components and the projected position angle whenusing galaxy shape estimates optimized for weak lensing measurements. ourradial alignment measurement increases to greater than 3-sigma significancerelative to the expectation for no alignments if we use 2-d s\'ersic model fitsto define galaxy orientations. our weak measurement of radial alignments is inconflict with predictions from dark matter n-body simulations, which weinterpret as evidence for large mis-alignments of baryons and dark matter ingroup and cluster satellites. within our uncertainties, that are dominated byour small sample size, we find only weak and marginally significant trends ofthe radial alignment angle distributions on projected distance from the groupcentre, host halo mass, and redshift that could be consistent with a tidaltorquing mechanism for radial alignments. using our lensing optimized shapeestimators, we estimate that intrinsic alignments of galaxy group members maycontribute a systematic error to the mean differential projected surface massdensity of groups inferred from weak lensing observations by -1 +/- 20% atscales around 300 kpc/h from the group centre assuming a photometric redshiftr.m.s. error of 10%, and given our group sample with median redshift of 0.17and median virial masses ~10^{13} h^{-1}m_{sun}.

1404.0377	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the wavelength-dependent sizes and  profiles of galaxies revealed by megamorph	we investigate the relationship between colour and structure within galaxiesusing a large, volume-limited sample of bright, low-redshift galaxies withoptical to near-infrared imaging from the gama survey. we fit single-component,wavelength-dependent, elliptical sersic models to all passbands simultaneously,using software developed by the megamorph project. dividing our sample bysersic index and colour, the recovered wavelength variations in effectiveradius (r_e) and sersic index (n) reveal the internal structure, and henceformation history, of different types of galaxies. all these trends depend onn; some have an additional dependence on galaxy colour. late-type galaxies (n_r&lt; 2.5) show a dramatic increase in sersic index with wavelength. this might bea result of their two-component (bulge-disk) nature, though stellar populationgradients within each component and dust attenuation are likely to play a role.all galaxies show a substantial decrease in r_e with wavelength. this isstrongest for early-types (n_r &gt; 2.5), even though they maintain constant nwith wavelength, revealing that ellipticals are a superimposition of differentstellar populations associated with multiple collapse and merging events.processes leading to structures with larger r_e must be associated with lowermetallicity or younger stellar populations. this appears to rule out theformation of young cores through dissipative gas accretion as an importantmechanism in the recent lives of luminous elliptical galaxies.

1407.4996	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): merging galaxies and their properties	we derive the close pair fractions and volume merger rates as a function ofluminosity and morphology for galaxies in the gama survey with -23 &lt; m(r) &lt; -17at 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.22. the merger fraction is about 0.015 at all luminosities(assuming 1/2 of pairs merge) and the volume merger rate is about 0.00035 percubic mpc per gyr. dry mergers (between red or spheroidal galaxies) areuncommon and decrease with decreasing luminosity. fainter mergers are wet,between blue or disky galaxies. damp mergers (one of each type) follow theaverage of dry and wet mergers. in the brighter luminosity bin (-23 &lt; m(r) &lt;-20) the merger rate evolution is flat, irrespective of colour or morphology.the makeup of the merging population does not change since z = 0.2. majormergers and dry mergers appear comparatively unimportant in the buildup of thered sequence over the past 2 gyr. we compare the colour, morphology,environmental density and degree of activity of galaxies in pairs to those ofmore isolated objects in the same volume. galaxies in close pairs tend to beboth redder and slightly more spheroid-dominated. this may be due to"harassment" in multiple previous passes prior to the current interaction.galaxy pairs do not appear to prefer significantly denser environments. thereis no evidence of an enhancement in the agn fraction in pairs, compared toother galaxies in the same volume.

1409.1358	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): refining the local galaxy merger rate  using morphological information	we use the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey to measure the localuniverse mass dependent merger fraction and merger rate using galaxy pairs andthe cas structural method, which identifies highly asymmetric merger candidategalaxies. our goals are to determine which types of mergers produce highlyasymmetrical galaxies, and to provide a new measurement of the local galaxymajor merger rate. we examine galaxy pairs at stellar mass limits down to$m_{*} = 10^{8}m_{\odot}$ with mass ratios of $&lt;$100:1 and line of sightvelocity differences of $\delta v&lt;500$ km s$^{-1}$. we find a significantincrease in mean asymmetries for projected separations less than the sum of theindividual galaxy's petrosian 90 radii. for systems in major merger pairs withmass ratios of $&lt;$4:1 both galaxies in the pair show a strong increase inasymmetry, while in minor merger systems (with mass ratios of $&gt;$4:1) the lowermass companion becomes highly asymmetric, while the larger galaxy is much lessaffected. the fraction of highly asymmetric paired galaxies which have a majormerger companion is highest for the most massive galaxies and dropsprogressively with decreasing mass. we calculate that the mass dependent majormerger fraction is fairly constant at $\sim1.3-2\%$ between$10^{9.5}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$, and increases to $\sim4\%$ at lowermasses. when the observability time scales are taken into consideration, themajor merger rate is found to approximately triple over the mass range weconsider. the total co-moving volume major merger rate over the range$10^{8.0}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$ is $(1.2 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-3}$$h^{3}_{70}$ mpc$^{-3}$ gyr$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107419	kl estimation of the power spectrum parameters from the angular  distribution of galaxies in early sdss data	we present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the sloandigital sky survey. the projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expandedover a set of karhunen-loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noiseratio in our analysis. a maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimateparameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional powerspectrum. our best estimates are gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8l = 0.915 +/-0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. we demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at orbeyond the peak of the 3d power spectrum. we discuss how the results scale withsystematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. we find that thecentral values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. we havealso explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations ofthe kl basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. we find that theimpact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties ofour fiducial result.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0108013	galaxy mass and luminosity scaling laws determined by weak gravitational  lensing	we present new measurements of scaling laws relating the luminosity ofgalaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. early imagingand spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to make weaklensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast delta sigma_+ aroundclasses of lens objects. this surface mass density contrast as a function ofradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (gmcf). becausespectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass anddistance scales are well constrained. the gmcf measured around ~31,000 lensesis well fit by a power law of the form  delta sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (r/1 mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h m_sun pc^-2.  we compare this gmcf to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and findthat it varies strongly with all three. we quantify these variations bycomparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, m_260, to thegalaxy luminosity. while m_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluestband u', there is a simple, linear relation between m_260 and luminosity inredder bands (g', r', i', and z'). we test the universality of thesemass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral andelliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. we findremarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'and z'. this consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that themeasured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that theintegrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the darkmatter environments in which they form.

astro-ph;0111058	higher order moments of the angular distribution of galaxies from early  sdss data	we present initial results for counts in cells statistics of the angulardistribution of galaxies in early data from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). we analyze a rectangular stripe $2.5^\circ$ wide, coveringapproximately 160 sq. degrees, containing over $10^6$ galaxies in the apparentmagnitude range $18 &lt; r^\prime &lt; 22$, with areas of bad seeing, contaminationfrom bright stars, ghosts, and high galactic extinction masked out. this surveyregion, which forms part of the sdss early data release, is the same as thatfor which two-point angular clustering statistics have recently been computed.the third and fourth moments of the cell counts, $s_3$ (skewness) and $s_4$(kurtosis), constitute the most accurate measurements to date of thesequantities (for $r^\prime &lt; 21$) over angular scales $0.015^\circ-0.3^\circ$.they display the approximate hierarchical scaling expected from non-linearstructure formation models and are in reasonable agreement with the predictionsof $\lambda$-dominated cold dark matter models with galaxy biasing thatsuppresses higher order correlations at small scales. the results are ingeneral consistent with previous measurements in the apm, edsgc, and deeprangesurveys. these results suggest that the sdss imaging data are free ofsystematics to a high degree and will therefore enable determination of theskewness and kurtosis to 1% and less then 10%, as predicted by colombi,szapudi, &amp; szalay (1998).

astro-ph;0202251	spectroscopic target selection in the sloan digital sky survey: the  quasar sample	we describe the algorithm for selecting quasar candidates for opticalspectroscopy in the sloan digital sky survey. quasar candidates are selectedvia their non-stellar colors in "ugriz" broad-band photometry, and by matchingunresolved sources to the first radio catalogs. the automated algorithm issensitive to quasars at all redshifts lower than z=5.8. extended sources arealso targeted as low-redshift quasar candidates in order to investigate theevolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) at the faint end of the luminosityfunction. nearly 95% of previously known quasars are recovered (based on 1540quasars in 446 square degrees). the overall completeness, estimated fromsimulated quasars, is expected to be over 90%, whereas the overall efficiency(quasars:quasar candidates) is better than 65%. the selection algorithm targetsultraviolet excess quasars to i^*=19.1 and higher-redshift (z&gt;3) quasars toi^*=20.2, yielding approximately 18 candidates per square degree. in additionto selecting ``normal'' quasars, the design of the algorithm makes it sensitiveto atypical agn such as broad absorption line quasars and heavily reddenedquasars.

astro-ph;0210215	the galaxy luminosity function and luminosity density at redshift z=0.1	using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in fiveoptical bandpasses corresponding to the sdss bandpasses shifted to match theirrestframe shape at z=0.1. we denote the bands {0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r},{0.1}{i}, {0.1}{z}, with \lambda_{eff} = [3216, 4240, 5595, 6792, 8111]angstroms respectively. we use a maximum likelihood method which allows for ageneral form for the shape of the luminosity function, simple luminosity andnumber evolution, incorporates flux uncertainties, and accounts for the fluxlimits of the survey. we find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute abmagnitudes in a mpc^3 of [-14.10 \pm 0.15, -15.18 \pm 0.03, -15.90 \pm 0.03,-16.24 \pm 0.03, -16.56 \pm 0.02] in [{0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r}, {0.1}{i},{0.1}{z}], respectively, using \omega_0 =0.3, \omega_\lambda=0.7, and h=1, andusing petrosian magnitudes. similar results are obtained using sersic modelmagnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the petrosian apertures is not amajor correction. in the {0.1}{r} band, the best fit schechter function to ourresults has \phi_\ast = (1.49 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-2} h^3 mpc^{-3}, m_\ast -5\log_{10} h = -20.44 \pm 0.01, and \alpha = -1.05\pm 0.01. in solarluminosities, the luminosity density in {0.1}{r} is (1.84 \pm 0.04) h 10^8l_{{0.1}{r},\odot} mpc^{-3}. our results are consistent with other estimates ofthe luminosity density, from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey andthe millenium galaxy catalog. they represent a substantial change (\sim 0.5mag) from earlier sdss luminosity density results based on commissioning data,almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosityfunction model.

astro-ph;0212405	luminosity function of morphologically classified galaxies in the sloan  digital sky survey	the morphological dependence of the luminosity function is studied using asample containing approximately 1500 bright galaxies classified into hubbletypes by visual inspections for a homogeneous sample obtained from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) northern equatorial stripes. early-type galaxies areshown to have a characteristic magnitude by 0.45 mag brighter than spiralgalaxies in the $r^{\ast}$ band, consistent with the `universal characteristicluminosity' in the $b$ band. the shape of the luminosity function differsrather little among different morphological types: we do not see any symptomsof the sharp decline in the faint end for the luminosity function forearly-type galaxies at least 2 mag fainter than the characteristic magnitude,although the faint end behaviour shows a slight decline ($\alpha\lsim -1$)compared with the total sample. we also show that a rather flat faint end slopefor early-type galaxies is not due to an increasing mixture of the dwarfgalaxies which have softer cores. this means that there are numerous faintearly-type galaxies with highly concentrated cores.

astro-ph;0301005	the sloan digital sky survey: the cosmic spectrum and star-formation  history	we present a determination of the `cosmic optical spectrum' of the universe,i.e. the ensemble emission from galaxies, as determined from the red-selectedsloan digital sky survey main galaxy sample and compare with previous resultsof the blue-selected 2df galaxy redshift survey. broadly we find good agreementin both the spectrum and the derived star-formation histories. if we use apower-law star-formation history model where star-formation rate $\propto(1+z)^\beta$ out to z=1, then we find that $\beta$ of 2 to 3 is still the mostlikely model and there is no evidence for current surveys missing large amountsof star formation at high redshift. in particular `fossil cosmology' of thelocal universe gives measures of star-formation history which are consistentwith direct observations at high redshift. using the photometry of sdss we areable to derive the cosmic spectrum in absolute units (i.e.$ w \aa$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$) at 2--5\aa resolution and find good agreement with publishedbroad-band luminosity densities. for a salpeter imf the best fit stellarmass/light ratio is 3.7--7.5 $\msun/\lsun$ in the r-band (corresponding to$\omstars h = 0.0025$--0.0055) and from both the stellar emission history andthe h$\alpha$ luminosity density independently we find a cosmologicalstar-formation rate of 0.03--0.04 h $\msun$ yr$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$ today.

astro-ph;0301303	the environment of passive spiral galaxies in the sdss	in previous work on galaxy clusters, several authors reported a discovery ofan unusual population of galaxies, which have spiral morphologies, but do notshow any star formation activity. these galaxies are called ``passivespirals'', and have been interesting since it has been difficult to understandthe existence of such galaxies. using a volume limited sample (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 andmr&lt;-20.5; 25813 galaxies) of the sloan digital sky survey data, we have found73 (0.28$\pm$0.03%) passive spiral galaxies and studied their environments. itis found that passive spiral galaxies live in local galaxy density 1-2mpc$^{-2}$ and 1-10 cluster-centric virial radius. thus the origins of passivespiral galaxies are likely to be cluster related. these characteristicenvironments coincide with the previously reported environment where galaxystar formation rate suddenly declines and the so-called morphology-densityrelation turns. it is likely that the same physical mechanism is responsiblefor all of these observational results. the existence of passive spiralgalaxies suggests that a physical mechanism that works calmly is preferred todynamical origins such as major merger/interaction since such a mechanism candestroy spiral arm structures. compared with observed cluster galaxy evolutionsuch as the butcher-oemler effect and the morphological butcher-oemler effect,passive spiral galaxies are likely to be a galaxy population in transitionbetween red, elliptical/s0 galaxies in low redshift clusters and blue, spiralgalaxies more numerous in higher redshift clusters.

astro-ph;0412631	large scale clustering of sloan digital sky survey quasars: impact of  the baryon density and the cosmological constant	we report the first result of the clustering analysis of sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) quasars. we compute the two-point correlation function (2pcf) ofsdss quasars in redshift space at $8h^{-1}{\rm mpc} &lt; s &lt; 500h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$,with particular attention to its baryonic signature. our sample consists of19986 quasars extracted from the sdss data release 4 (dr4). the redshift rangeof the sample is $0.72 \le z \le 2.24$ (the mean redshift is $\bar z = 1.46$)and the reddening-corrected $i$-band apparent magnitude range is $15.0 \lem_{i,{\rm rc}} \le 19.1$. due to the relatively low number density of thequasar sample, the bump in the power spectrum due to the baryon density,$\omega_{\rm b}$, is not clearly visible. the effect of the baryon density is,however, to distort the overall shape of the 2pcf.the degree of distortionmakes it an interesting alternate measure of the baryonic signature. assuming ascale-independent linear bias and the spatially flat universe, i.e.,$\omega_{\rm b} + \omega_{\rm d} + \omega_\lambda =1$, where $\omega_{\rm d}$and $\omega_\lambda$ denote the density parameters of dark matter and thecosmological constant, we combine the observed quasar 2pcf and the predictedmatter 2pcf to put constraints on $\omega_{\rm b}$ and $\omega_\lambda$. ourresult is fitted as $0.80- 2.8\omega_{\rm b} &lt; \omega_\lambda &lt; 0.90 -1.4\omega_{\rm b}$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, which is consistent withresults from other cosmological observations such as wmap.

astro-ph;0504510	detection of cosmic magnification with the sloan digital sky survey	we present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by thevariation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground largescale structure. to make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees ofphotometric observations from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containing\~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. our measurement of the galaxy-quasarcross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence andchange in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number countsthat is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. weshow that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, galactic dustextinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are wellcontrolled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. by weighting thequasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation ofquasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at &gt;4 sigmain all five sdss filters. our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scalesranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions based on the wmap concordance cosmology. as with galaxy-galaxylensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide usefulconstraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.

astro-ph;0507547	bivariate galaxy luminosity functions in the sloan digital sky survey	bivariate luminosity functions (lfs) are computed for galaxies in the newyork value-added galaxy catalogue, based on the sloan digital sky survey datarelease 4. the galaxy properties investigated are the morphological type,inverse concentration index, sersic index, absolute effective surfacebrightness, reference frame colours, absolute radius, eclass spectral type,stellar mass and galaxy environment. the morphological sample is flux-limitedto galaxies with r &lt; 15.9 and consists of 37,047 classifications to an rmsaccuracy of +/- half a class in the sequence e, s0, sa, sb, sc, sd, im. thesewere assigned by an artificial neural network, based on a training set of 645eyeball classifications. the other samples use r &lt; 17.77 with a median redshiftof z ~ 0.08, and a limiting redshift of z &lt; 0.15 to minimize the effects ofevolution. other cuts, for example in axis ratio, are made to minimize biases.a wealth of detail is seen, with clear variations between the lfs according toabsolute magnitude and the second parameter. they are consistent with an earlytype, bright, concentrated, red population and a late type, faint, lessconcentrated, blue, star forming population. this bimodality suggests two majorunderlying physical processes, which in agreement with previous authors wehypothesize to be merger and accretion, associated with the properties ofbulges and discs respectively. the bivariate luminosity-surface brightnessdistribution is fit with the choloniewski function (a schechter function inabsolute magnitude and gaussian in surface brightness). the fit is found to bepoor, as might be expected if there are two underlying processes.

astro-ph;0601434	the sdss quasar survey: quasar luminosity function from data release  three	we determine the number counts and z=0-5 luminosity function for awell-defined, homogeneous sample of quasars from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). we conservatively define the most uniform statistical sample possible,consisting of 15,343 quasars within an effective area of 1622 deg^2 that wasderived from a parent sample of 46,420 spectroscopically confirmed broad-linequasars in the 5282 deg^2 of imaging data from sdss data release three. thesample extends from i=15 to i=19.1 at z&lt;3 and to i=20.2 for z&gt;3. the numbercounts and luminosity function agree well with the results of the 2df qsosurvey, but the sdss data probe to much higher redshifts than does the 2dfsample. the number density of luminous quasars peaks between redshifts 2 and 3,although uncertainties in the selection function in this range do not allow usto determine the peak redshift more precisely. our best fit model has a flatterbright end slope at high redshift than at low redshift. for z&lt;2.4 the data arebest fit by a redshift-independent slope of beta = -3.1 (phi(l) propto l^beta).above z=2.4 the slope flattens with redshift to beta=-2.37 at z=5. this slopechange, which is significant at a &gt;5-sigma level, must be accounted for inmodels of the evolution of accretion onto supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0607630	megaz-lrg: a photometric redshift catalogue of one million sdss luminous  red galaxies	we describe the construction of megaz-lrg, a photometric redshift catalogueof over one million luminous red galaxies (lrgs) in the redshift range 0.4 &lt; z&lt; 0.7 with limiting magnitude i &lt; 20. the catalogue is selected from theimaging data of the sloan digital sky survey data release 4. the 2df-sdss lrgand quasar (2slaq) spectroscopic redshift catalogue of 13,000intermediate-redshift lrgs provides a photometric redshift training set,allowing use of annz, a neural network-based photometric-redshift estimator.the rms photometric redshift accuracy obtained for an evaluation set selectedfrom the 2slaq sample is sigma_z = 0.049 averaged over all galaxies, andsigma_z = 0.040 for a brighter subsample (i &lt; 19.0). the catalogue is expectedto contain ~5 per cent stellar contamination. the annz code is used to computea refined star/galaxy probability based on a range of photometric parameters;this allows the contamination fraction to be reduced to 2 per cent withnegligible loss of genuine galaxies. the megaz-lrg catalogue is publiclyavailable on the world wide web from http://www.2slaq.info .

astro-ph;0608635	measuring the matter density using baryon oscillations in the sdss	we measure the cosmological matter density by observing the positions ofbaryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we jointly analyse the main galaxies and lrgs in the sdssdr5 sample, using over half a million galaxies in total. the oscillations aredetected with 99.74% confidence (3.0sigma assuming gaussianity) compared to asmooth power spectrum. when combined with the observed scale of the peakswithin the cmb, we find a best-fit value of omega_m=0.256+0.029-0.024 (68%confidence interval), for a flat lambda cosmology when marginalising over thehubble parameter and the baryon density. this value of the matter density isderived from the locations of the baryon oscillations in the galaxy powerspectrum and in the cmb, and does not include any information from the overallshape of the power spectra. this is an extremely clean cosmological measurementas the physics of the baryon acoustic oscillation production is wellunderstood, and the positions of the oscillations are expected to beindependent of systematics such as galaxy bias.

astro-ph;0608636	the shape of the sdss dr5 galaxy power spectrum	we present a fourier analysis of the clustering of galaxies in the combinedmain galaxy and luminous red galaxy (lrg) sloan digital sky survey (sdss) datarelease 5 (dr5) sample. the aim of our analysis is to consider how well we canmeasure the cosmological matter density using the signature of the horizon atmatter-radiation equality embedded in the large-scale power spectrum. the newdata constrains the power spectrum on scales 100--600h^-1mpc with significantlyhigher precision than previous analyses of just the sdss main galaxies, due toour larger sample and the inclusion of the lrgs. this improvement means that wecan now reveal a discrepancy between the shape of the measured power and linearcdm models on scales 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.15hmpc^-1, with linear model fits favouring alower matter density (omega_m=0.22+/-0.04) on scales 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.06hmpc^-1 and ahigher matter density (omega_m=0.32+/-0.01) when smaller scales are included,assuming a flat lcdm model with h=0.73 and n_s=0.96. this discrepancy could beexplained by scale-dependent bias and, by analysing subsamples of galaxies, wefind that the ratio of small-scale to large-scale power increases with galaxyluminosity, so all of the sdss galaxies cannot trace the same power spectrumshape over 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.2hmpc^-1. however, the data are insufficient to clearlyshow a luminosity-dependent change in the largest scale at which a significantincrease in clustering is observed, although they do not rule out such aneffect. significant scale-dependent galaxy bias on large-scales, which changeswith the r-band luminosity of the galaxies, could potentially explaindifferences in our omega_m estimates and differences previously observedbetween 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra and the resulting parameter constraints.

astro-ph;0609178	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the star formation histories of  luminous red galaxies	we present a detailed investigation into the recent star formation historiesof 5,697 luminous red galaxies (lrgs) based on the hdelta (4101a) and [oii](3727a) lines. lrgs are luminous (l&gt;3l*), galaxies which have been selected tohave photometric properties consistent with an old, passively evolving stellarpopulation. for this study we utilise lrgs from the recently completed 2df-sdsslrg and qso survey (2slaq). equivalent widths of the hdelta and [oii] lines aremeasured and used to define three spectral types, those with only strong hdeltaabsorption (k+a), those with strong [oii] in emission (em) and those with both(em+a). all other lrgs are considered to have passive star formation histories.the vast majority of lrgs are found to be passive (~80 per cent), howeversignificant numbers of k+a (2.7 per cent), em+a (1.2 per cent) and em lrgs (8.6per cent) are identified. an investigation into the redshift dependence of thefractions is also performed. a sample of sdss main galaxies with colours andluminosities consistent with the 2slaq lrgs is selected to provide a lowredshift comparison. while the em and em+a fractions are consistent with thelow redshift sdss sample, the fraction of k+a lrgs is found to increasesignificantly with redshift. this result is interpreted as an indication of anincreasing amount of recent star formation activity in lrgs with redshift. byconsidering the expected life time of the k+a phase, the number of lrgs whichwill undergo a k+a phase can be estimated. a crude comparison of this estimatewith the predictions from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows thatthe predicted level of k+a and em+a activity is not sufficient to reconcile thepredicted mass growth for massive early-types in a hierarchical mergingscenario.

astro-ph;0610171	galaxy colour, morphology, and environment in the sloan digital sky  survey	we use the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey to investigatethe relation between galaxy rest frame u-r colour, morphology, as described bythe concentration and sersic indices, and environmental density, for a sampleof 79,553 galaxies at z &lt; ~0.1. we split the samples according to density andluminosity and recover the expected bimodal distribution in thecolour-morphology plane, shown especially clearly by this subsampling. wequantify the bimodality by a sum of two gaussians on the colour and morphologyaxes and show that, for the red/early-type population both colour andmorphology do not change significantly as a function of density. for theblue/late-type population, with increasing density the colour becomes redderbut the morphology again does not change significantly. both populations becomemonotonically redder and of earlier type with increasing luminosity. there isno significant qualitative difference between the behaviour of the twomorphological measures. we supplement the morphological sample with 13,655galaxies assigned hubble types by an artificial neural network. we find,however, that the resulting distribution is less well described by twogaussians. therefore, there are either more than two significant morphologicalpopulations, physical processes not seen in colour space, or the hubble type,particularly the different subtypes of spirals sa-sd, has an irreduciblefuzziness when related to environmental density. for each of the three measuresof morphology, on removing the density relation due to it, we recover a strongresidual relation in colour. however, on similarly removing the colour-densityrelation there is no evidence for a residual relation due to morphology.[abridged]

astro-ph;0612400	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the lrg 2-point correlation function  and redshift-space distortions	we present a clustering analysis of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) using nearly9 000 objects from the final catalogue of the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq)survey. we measure the redshift-space two-point correlation function, xi(s), atthe mean lrg redshift of z=0.55. a single power-law fits the deprojectedcorrelation function, xi(r), with a correlation length of r_0=7.45+-0.35 mpcand a power-law slope of gamma=1.72+-0.06 in the 0.4&lt;r&lt;50 mpc range. but it isin the lrg angular correlation function that the strongest evidence fornon-power-law features is found where a slope of gamma=-2.17+-0.07 is seen at1&lt;r&lt;10 mpc with a flatter gamma=-1.67+-0.03 slope apparent at r&lt;~1 mpc scales.we use the simple power-law fit to the galaxy xi(r) to model the redshift spacedistortions in the 2-d redshift-space correlation function, xi(sigma,pi). wefit for the lrg velocity dispersion, w_z, omega_m and beta, wherebeta=omega_m^0.6/b and b is the linear bias parameter. we find values ofw_z=330kms^-1, omega_m= 0.10+0.35-0.10 and beta=0.40+-0.05. these high redshiftresults, which incorporate the alcock-paczynski effect and the effects ofdynamical infall, start to break the degeneracy between omega_m and beta foundin low-redshift galaxy surveys. this degeneracy is further broken byintroducing an additional external constraint, the value of beta(z=0.1)=0.45from 2dfgrs, and then considering the evolution of clustering from z~0 toz_lrg~0.55. with these combined methods we find omega_m(z=0)=0.30+-0.15 andbeta(z=0.55)=0.45+-0.05. assuming these values, we find a value forb(z=0.55)=1.66+-0.35. we show that this is consistent with a simple ``highpeaks'' bias prescription which assumes that lrgs have a constant co-movingdensity and their clustering evolves purely under gravity.
