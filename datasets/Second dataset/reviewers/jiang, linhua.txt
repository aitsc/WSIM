0706.3706	modeling the dust properties of z ~ 6 quasars with art^2 --  all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree	the detection of large quantities of dust in z ~ 6 quasars by infrared andradio surveys presents puzzles for the formation and evolution of dust in theseearly systems. previously (li et al. 2007), we showed that luminous quasars atz &gt; 6 can form through hierarchical mergers of gas-rich galaxies. here, wecalculate the dust properties of simulated quasars and their progenitors usinga three-dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code, art^2 --all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree. art^2incorporates a radiative equilibrium algorithm for dust emission, an adaptivegrid for inhomogeneous density, a multiphase model for the ism, and asupernova-origin dust model. we reproduce the sed and dust properties of sdssj1148+5251, and find that the infrared emission are closely associated with theformation and evolution of the quasar host. the system evolves from a cold to awarm ulirg owing to heating and feedback from stars and agn. furthermore, theagn has significant implications for the interpretation of observation of thehosts. our results suggest that vigorous star formation in merging progenitorsis necessary to reproduce the observed dust properties of z~6 quasars,supporting a merger-driven origin for luminous quasars at high redshifts andthe starburst-to-quasar evolutionary hypothesis.

0905.4126	a survey of z~6 quasars in the sdss deep stripe. ii. discovery of six  quasars at z_{ab}&gt;21	we present the discovery of six new quasars at z~6 selected from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) southern survey, a deep imaging survey obtained byrepeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator. the six quasars areabout two magnitudes fainter than the luminous z~6 quasars found in the sdssmain survey and one magnitude fainter than the quasars reported in paper i(jiang et al. 2008). four of them comprise a complete flux-limited sample at21&lt;z_ab&lt;21.8 over an effective area of 195 deg^2. the other two quasars arefainter than z_ab=22 and are not part of the complete sample. the quasarluminosity function at z~6 is well described as a single power law\phi(l_{1450}) \propto l_{1450}^{\beta} over the luminosity range-28&lt;m_{1450}&lt;-25. the best-fitting slope \beta varies from -2.6 to -3.1,depending on the quasar samples used, with a statistical error of 0.3-0.4.about 40% of the quasars discovered in the sdss southern survey have verynarrow lya emission lines, which may indicate small black hole masses and higheddington luminosity ratios, and therefore short black hole growth time scalesfor these faint quasars at early epochs.

0908.0952	cosmic evolution of star formation in sdss quasar hosts since z=1	we present spitzer irs observations of a complete sample of 57 sdss type-1quasars at z~1. aromatic features at 6.2 and/or 7.7 um are detected in abouthalf of the sample and show profiles similar to those seen in normal galaxiesat both low- and high-redshift, indicating a star-formation origin for thefeatures. based on the ratio of aromatic to star-formation ir (sfir)luminosities for normal star-forming galaxies at z~1, we have constructed thesfir luminosity function (lf) of z~1 quasars. as we found earlier forlow-redshift pg quasars, these z~1 quasars show a flatter sfir lf than do z~1field galaxies, implying the quasar host galaxy population has on average ahigher sfr than the field galaxies do. as measured from their sfir lf,individual quasar hosts have on average lirg-level sfrs, which mainly arise inthe circumnuclear regions. by comparing with similar measurements oflow-redshift pg quasars, we find that the comoving sfir luminosity density inquasar hosts shows a much larger increase with redshift than that in fieldgalaxies. the behavior is consistent with pure density evolution since theaverage sfr and the average sfr/bh-accretion-rate in quasar hosts show littleevolution with redshift. for individual quasars, we have found a correlationbetween the aromatic-based sfr and the luminosity of the nuclear radiation,consistent with predictions of some theoretical models. we propose that type 1quasars reside in a distinct galaxy population that shows elliptical morphologybut that harbors a significant fraction of intermediate-age stars and isexperiencing intense circumnuclear star formation.

0707.1662	black hole masses and enrichment of z ~ 6 sdss quasars	we present sensitive near-infrared spectroscopic observations for a sample offive z ~ 6 quasars. these are amongst the most distant, currently known quasarsin the universe. the spectra have been obtained using isaac at the vlt andinclude the civ, mgii and feii lines. we measure the feii/mgii line ratio, asan observational proxy for the fe/alpha element ratio. we derive a ratio of2.7+/-0.8 for our sample, which is similar to that found for lower redshiftquasars, i.e., we provide additional evidence for the lack of evolution in thefeii/mgii line ratio of quasars up to the highest redshifts. this resultdemonstrates that the sample quasars must have undergone a major episode ofiron enrichment in less than one gyr and star formation must have commenced atz &gt; 8. the linewidths of the mgii and civ lines give two estimates for theblack hole masses. a third estimate is given by assuming that the quasars emitat their eddington luminosity. the derived masses using these three methodsagree well, implying that the quasars are not likely to be strongly lensed. wederive central black hole masses of 0.3-5.2 10^9 solar masses. we use thedifference between the redshift of mgii (a proxy for the systemic redshift ofthe quasar) and the onset of the gunn peterson trough to derive the extent ofthe ionized stromgren spheres around our target quasars. the derived physicalradii are about five mpc. using a simple ionization model, the emission of thecentral quasars would need of order 10^6-10^8 year to create these cavities ina surrounding intergalactic medium with a neutral fraction between 0.1 and 1.0.as the e-folding time scale for the central accreting black hole is on theorder of a few times 10^7 year, it can grow by one e-folding or less withinthis time span.

0910.4611	light curve templates and galactic distribution of rr lyrae stars from  sloan digital sky survey stripe 82	we present an improved analysis of halo substructure traced by rr lyrae starsin the sdss stripe 82 region. with the addition of sdss-ii data, a revisedselection method based on new ugriz light curve templates results in a sampleof 483 rr lyrae stars that is essentially free of contamination. the mainresult from our first study persists: the spatial distribution of halo stars atgalactocentric distances 5--100 kpc is highly inhomogeneous. at least 20% ofhalo stars within 30 kpc from the galactic center can be statisticallyassociated with substructure. we present strong direct evidence, based on bothrr lyrae stars and main sequence stars, that the halo stellar number densityprofile significantly steepens beyond a galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc, anda larger fraction of the stars are associated with substructure. by using anovel method that simultaneously combines data for rr lyrae and main sequencestars, and using photometric metallicity estimates for main sequence starsderived from deep co-added u-band data, we measure the metallicity of thesagittarius dsph tidal stream (trailing arm) towards r.a.2h-3h and dec~0 deg tobe 0.3 dex higher ([fe/h]=-1.2) than that of surrounding halo field stars.together with a similar result for another major halo substructure, themonoceros stream, these results support theoretical predictions that an earlyforming, smooth inner halo, is metal poor compared to high surface brightnessmaterial that have been accreted onto a later-forming outer halo. the meanmetallicity of stars in the outer halo that are not associated with detectableclumps may still be more metal-poor than the bulk of inner-halo stars, as hasbeen argued from other data sets.

1003.3432	dust-free quasars in the early universe	the most distant quasars known, at redshifts z=6, generally have propertiesindistinguishable from those of lower-redshift quasars in the rest-frameultraviolet/optical and x-ray bands. this puzzling result suggests that thesedistant quasars are evolved objects even though the universe was only seven percent of its current age at these redshifts. recently one z=6 quasar was shownnot to have any detectable emission from hot dust, but it was unclear whetherthat indicated different hot-dust properties at high redshift or if it issimply an outlier. here we report the discovery of a second quasar withouthot-dust emission in a sample of 21 z=6 quasars. such apparently hot-dust-freequasars have no counterparts at low redshift. moreover, we demonstrate that thehot-dust abundance in the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of thecentral black hole, whereas at low redshift it is almost independent of theblack hole mass. thus z=6 quasars are indeed at an early evolutionary stage,with rapid mass accretion and dust formation. the two hot-dust-free quasars arelikely to be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments and aretoo young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1106.5501	evidence for non-evolving feii/mgii ratios in rapidly accreting z~6 qsos	[abridged] quasars (qsos) at the highest known redshift (z~6) are uniqueprobes of the early growth of supermassive black holes (bhs). until now, onlythe most luminous qsos have been studied, often one object at a time. here wepresent the most extensive consistent analysis to date of z&gt;4 qsos withobserved nir spectra, combining three new z~6 objects from our ongoingvlt-isaac program with nineteen 4&lt;z&lt;6.5 sources from the literature. the newsources extend the existing sdss sample towards the faint end of the qsoluminosity function. using a maximum likelihood fitting routine optimized forour spectral decomposition, we estimate the black hole mass (mbh), theeddington ratio (defined as lbol/ledd) and the feii/mgii line ratio, a proxyfor the chemical abundance, to characterize both the central object and thebroad line region gas. the qsos in our sample host bhs with masses of ~10^9m\odot that are accreting close to the eddington luminosity, consistent withearlier results. we find that the distribution of observed eddington ratios issignificantly different than that of a luminosity-matched comparison sample ofsdss qsos at lower redshift (0.35&lt;z&lt;2.25): the average &lt;log(lbol/ledd)&gt;=-0.37(lbol/ledd~0.43) with a scatter of 0.20 dex for the z&gt;4 sample and the&lt;log(lbol/ledd)&gt;=-0.80 (lbol/ledd~0.16) with a scatter of 0.24 dex for the0.35&lt;z&lt;2.25 sample. this implies that, at a given luminosity, the mbh at high-zis typically lower than the average mbh of the lower-redshift population, i.e.the z&gt;4 sources are accreting significantly faster than the lower-redshiftones. we show that the derived feii/mgii ratios depend sensitively on theperformed analysis: our self-consistent, homogeneous analysis significantlyreduces the feii/mgii scatter found in previous studies. the measured feii/mgiiline ratios show no sign of evolution with cosmic time in the redshift range4&lt;z&lt;6.5 [...]

1107.0646	discovering the missing 2.2&lt;z&lt;3 quasars by combining optical variability  and optical/near-ir colors	the identifications of quasars in the redshift range 2.2&lt;z&lt;3 are known to bevery inefficient as their optical colors are indistinguishable from those ofstars. recent studies have proposed to use optical variability or near-ircolors to improve the identifications of the missing quasars in this redshiftrange. here we present a case study by combining both factors. we select asample of 70 quasar candidates from variables in sdss stripe 82, which arenon-uv excess sources and have ukidss near-ir public data. they are clearlyseparated into two parts on the y-k/g-z color-color diagram, and 59 of themmeet or lie close to a newly proposed y-k/g-z selection criterion for z&lt;4quasars. 44 of these 59 sources have been previously identified as quasars insdss dr7, and 35 among them are quasars at 2.2&lt;z&lt;3. we present spectroscopicobservations of 14 of 15 remaining quasar candidates using the bok 2.3mtelescope and the mmt 6.5m telescope, and successfully identify all of them asnew quasars at z=2.36 to 2.88. we also apply this method to a sample of 643variable quasar candidates with sdss-ukidss nine-band photometric data selectedfrom 1875 new quasar candidates in sdss stripe 82 given by butler &amp; bloom basedon the time-series selections, and find that 188 of them are probably newquasars with photometric redshifts at 2.2&lt;z&lt;3. our results indicate that thecombination of optical variability and optical/near-ir colors is probably themost efficient way in finding 2.2&lt;z&lt;3 quasars and very helpful for constructinga complete quasar sample. we discuss its implications to the ongoing andupcoming large optical and near-ir sky surveys.

1110.3259	dust properties in afterglow of grb 071025 at z~5	at high redshift, the universe was so young that core-collapse supernovae(sne) are suspected to be the dominant source of dust production. however, someobservations indicate that the dust production by sne is an inefficientprocess, casting doubts on the existence of abundant sne-dust in the earlyuniverse. recently, perley et al. (2010) reported that the afterglow of grb071025 - an unusually red grb at z ~ 5 - shows evidence for the sne-produceddust. since this is perhaps the only high redshift grb exhibiting compellingevidence for sne-dust but the result could easily be affected by smallsystematics in photometry, we re-examined the extinction properties of grb071025 using our own optical/near-infrared data at a different epoch. inaddition, we tested sne-dust models with different progenitor masses and dustdestruction efficiencies to constrain the dust formation mechanisms. bysearching for the best-fit model of the afterglow spectral energy distribution,we confirm the previous claim that the dust in grb 071025 is most likely tooriginate from sne. we also find that the sne-dust model of 13 or 25m_{\odot}without dust destruction fits the extinction property of grb 071025 best, whilepair-instability sne (pisne) models with a 170m_{\odot} progenitor poorly fitthe data. our results indicate that, at least in some systems at high redshift,sne with intermediate masses within 10 - 30m_{\odot} were the main contributorsfor the dust enrichment, and the dust destruction effect due to reverse shockwas negligible.

1203.1326	discovery of a protocluster at z~6	we report the discovery of a protocluster at z~6 containing at least eightcluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide-fieldimage of the subaru deep field (sdf). the overdensity of the protocluster issignificant at the 6 sigma level, based on the surface number density ofi'-dropout galaxies. the overdense region covers ~36 sq. arcmin, and includes30 i'-dropout galaxies. follow-up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these arereal z~6 galaxies (5.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.3). eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrowredshift range centered at z=6.01, corresponding to a seven-fold increase innumber density over the average in redshift space. we found no significantdifference in the observed properties, such as ly-alpha luminosities and uvcontinuum magnitudes, between the eight protocluster members and the sevennon-members. the velocity dispersion of the eight protocluster members is 647km/s, which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standardcold dark matter model. this discrepancy could be attributed to thedistinguishing three-dimensional distribution of the eight protoclustermembers. we discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy: either theprotocluster is already mature, with old galaxies at the center, or it is stillimmature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster. ineither case, this concentration of z=6.01 galaxies in the sdf may be one of thefirst sites of formation of a galaxy cluster in the universe.

1207.7137	the ninth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	the sloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii) presents the first spectroscopicdata from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). this ninth datarelease (dr9) of the sdss project includes 535,995 new galaxy spectra (medianz=0.52), 102,100 new quasar spectra (median z=2.32), and 90,897 new stellarspectra, along with the data presented in previous data releases. these spectrawere obtained with the new boss spectrograph and were taken between 2009december and 2011 july. in addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, whichdetermines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, andmetallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements intemperature estimates for stars with t_eff&lt;5000 k and in metallicity estimatesfor stars with [fe/h]&gt;-0.5. dr9 includes new stellar parameters for all starspresented in dr8, including stars from sdss-i and ii, as well as those observedas part of the sdss-iii sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration-2 (segue-2).  the astrometry error introduced in the dr8 imaging catalogs has beencorrected in the dr9 data products. the next data release for sdss-iii will bein summer 2013, which will present the first data from the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) along with another year ofdata from boss, followed by the final sdss-iii data release in december 2014.

1208.0607	a uv ultra-luminous lyman break galaxy at z=2.78 in ndwfs bootes field	we present one of the most ultraviolet (uv) luminous lyman break galaxies(lbgs) (j1432+3358) at z=2.78, discovered in the noao deep wide-field survey(ndwfs) bootes field. the r-band magnitude of j1432+3358 is 22.29 ab, more thantwo magnitudes brighter than typical l* lbgs at this redshift. the deep z-bandimage reveals two components of j1432+3358 separated by 1.0" with flux ratio of3:1. the high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) rest-frame uv spectrum shows lyaemission line and interstellar medium absorption lines. the absence of nv andciv emission lines, the non-detection in x-ray and radio wavelengths andmid-infrared (mir) colors indicate no or weak active galactic nuclei (agn)(&lt;10%) in this galaxy. the galaxy shows broader line profile with the fullwidth half maximum (fwhm) of about 1000 km/s and larger outflow velocity (~500km/s) than those of typical z~3 lbgs. the physical properties are derived byfitting the spectral energy distribution (sed) with stellar synthesis models.the dust extinction, e(b-v)=0.12, is similar to that in normal lbgs. the starformation rates (sfrs) derived from the sed fitting and the dust-corrected uvflux are consistent with each other, ~300 msun/yr, and the stellar mass is1.3e11 msun. the sfr and stellar mass in j1432+3358 are about an order ofmagnitude higher than those in normal lbgs. the sed-fitting results supportthat j1432+3358 has a continuous star formation history with the star formationepisode of 630 myr. the morphology of j1432+3358 and its physical propertiessuggest that j1432+3358 is in an early phase of 3:1 merger process. the uniqueproperties and the low space number density (~1e-7 mpc^{-3})are consistent withthe interpretation that such galaxies are either found in a short unobscuredphase of the star formation or that small fraction of intensive star-forminggalaxies are unobscured.

1210.4933	a ly-alpha emitter with an extremely large rest-frame equivalent width  of ~900a at z=6.5: a candidate of population iii-dominated galaxy?	we have identified a very interesting ly-alpha emitter, whose ly-alphaemission line has an extremely large observed equivalent width ofew_0=436^{+422}_{-149}a, which corresponds to an extraordinarily largeintrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0^{int}=872^{+844}_{-298}a afterthe average intergalactic absorption correction. the object wasspectroscopically confirmed to be a real ly-alpha emitter by its apparentasymmetric ly-alpha line profile detected at z=6.538. the continuum emission ofthe object was definitely detected in our deep z'-band image; thus, its ew_0was reliably determined. follow-up deep near-infrared spectroscopy revealedemission lines of neither he ii lambda1640 as an apparent signature ofpopulation iii, nor c iv lambda1549 as a proof of active nucleus. no detectionof short-lived he ii lambda1640 line is not necessarily inconsistent with theinterpretation that the underlying stellar population of the object isdominated by population iii. we found that the observed extremely large ew_0 ofthe ly-alpha emission and the upper limit on the ew_0 of the he ii lambda1640emission can be explained by population synthesis models favoring a very youngage less than 2-4myr and massive metal-poor (z&lt;10^{-5}) or even metal-freestars. the observed large ew_0 of ly-alpha is hardly explained by populationi/ii synthesis models with z&gt;10^{-3}. however, we cannot conclusively rule outthe possibility that this object is composed of a normal stellar populationwith a clumpy dust distribution, which could enhance the ly-alpha ew_0, thoughits significance is still unclear.

1212.4493	the z=5 quasar luminosity function from sdss stripe 82	we present a measurement of the type i quasar luminosity function at z=5using a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed quasars selected fromoptical imaging data. we measure the bright end (m_1450&lt;-26) with sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data covering ~6000 deg^2, then extend to lower luminosities(m_1450&lt;-24) with newly discovered, faint z~5 quasars selected from 235 deg^2of deep, coadded imaging in the sdss stripe 82 region (the celestial equator inthe southern galactic cap). the faint sample includes 14 quasars with spectraobtained as ancillary science targets in the sdss-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss), and 59 quasars observed at the mmt and magellantelescopes. we construct a well-defined sample of 4.7&lt;z&lt;5.1 quasars that ishighly complete, with 73 spectroscopic identifications out of 92 candidates.our color selection method is also highly efficient: of the 73 spectraobtained, 71 are high redshift quasars. these observations reach below thebreak in the luminosity function (m_1450* ~ -27). the bright end slope is steep(beta &lt;~ -4), with a constraint of beta &lt; -3.1 at 95% confidence. the breakluminosity appears to evolve strongly at high redshift, providing anexplanation for the flattening of the bright end slope reported previously. wefind a factor of ~2 greater decrease in the number density of luminous quasars(m_1450&lt;-26) from z=5 to z=6 than from z=4 to z=5, suggesting a more rapiddecline in quasar activity at high redshift than found in previous surveys. ourmodel for the quasar luminosity function predicts that quasars generate ~30% ofthe ionizing photons required to keep the universe ionized at z=5.

0712.1612	sharc-ii 350 micron observations of thermal emission from warm dust in  z&gt;=5 quasars	we present observations of four z&gt;= sdss quasars at 350 micron with thesharc-ii bolometer camera on the caltech submillimeter observatory. these areamong the deepest observations that have been made by sharc-ii at 350 micron,and three quasars are detected at &gt;=3 sigma significance, greatly increasingthe sample of 350 micron (corresponds to rest frame wavelengths of &lt;60 micronat z&gt;=5), detected high-redshift quasars. the derived rest frame far-infrared(fir) emission in the three detected sources is about five to ten timesstronger than that expected from the average sed of the local quasars given thesame 1450a luminosity. combining the previous submillimeter and millimeterobservations at longer wavelengths, the temperatures of the fir-emitting warmdust from the three quasar detections are estimated to be in the range of 39 to52 k. additionally, the fir-to-radio seds of the three 350 micron detectionsare consistent with the emission from typical star forming galaxies. the firluminosities are ~10^{13} l_solar and the dust masses are &gt;= 10^{8}m_solar.these results confirm that huge amounts of warm dust can exist in the hostgalaxies of optically bright quasars as early as z~6. the universe is so youngat these epochs (~1 gyr) that a rapid dust formation mechanism is required. weestimate the size of the fir dust emission region to be about a few kpc, andfurther provide a comparison of the seds among different kinds of dust emittingsources to investigate the dominant dust heating mechanism.

1302.4154	star formation and gas kinematics of quasar host galaxies at z~6: new  insights from alma	we present alma observations of the [c ii] 158 micron fine structure line anddust continuum emission from the host galaxies of five redshift 6 quasars. wealso report complementary observations of 250 ghz dust continuum and co (6-5)line emission from the z=6.00 quasar sdss j231038.88+185519.7. the almaobservations were carried out in the extended array at 0.7" resolution. we havedetected the line and dust continuum in all five objects. the derived [c ii]line luminosities are 1.6x10^{9} to 8.8x10^{9} lsun and the [c ii]-to-firluminosity ratios are 3.0-5.6x10^{-4}, which is comparable to the values foundin other high-redshift quasar-starburst systems and local ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies. the sources are marginally resolved and the intrinsic sourcesizes (major axis fwhm) are constrained to be 0.3" to 0.6" (i.e., 1.7 to 3.5kpc) for the [c ii] line emission and 0.2" to 0.4" (i.e., 1.2 to 2.3 kpc) forthe continuum. these measurements indicate that there is vigorous starformation over the central few kpc in the quasar host galaxies. the almaobservations also constrain the dynamical properties of the atomic gas in thestarburst nuclei. the intensity-weighted velocity maps of three sources showclear velocity gradients. such velocity gradients are consistent with arotating, gravitationally bound gas component, although they are not uniquelyinterpreted as such. under the simplifying assumption of rotation, the implieddynamical masses within the [c ii]-emitting regions are of order 10^{10} to10^{11} msun. given these estimates, the mass ratios between the smbhs and thespheroidal bulge are an order of magnitude higher than the mean value found inlocal spheroidal galaxies, which is in agreement with results from previous coobservations of high redshift quasars.

1303.0024	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6.  i. basic characteristics of the rest-frame uv continuum and lyman-alpha  emission	we present deep hst near-ir and spitzer mid-ir observations of a large sampleof spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6. the sample consists of 51lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at z ~ 5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16 lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) at 5.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.5. the near-ir images were mostly obtained withwfc3 in the f125w and f160w bands, and the mid-ir images were obtained withirac in the 3.6um and 4.5um bands. our galaxies also have deep optical imagingdata from subaru suprime-cam. we utilize the multi-band data and secureredshifts to derive their rest-frame uv properties. these galaxies have steepuv continuum slopes roughly between beta ~ -1.5 and -3.5, with an average valueof beta ~ -2.3, slightly steeper than the slopes of lbgs in previous studies.the slope shows little dependence on uv continuum luminosity except for a fewof the brightest galaxies. we find a statistically significant excess ofgalaxies with slopes around beta ~ -3, suggesting the existence of very youngstellar populations with extremely low metallicity and dust content. ourgalaxies have moderately strong rest-frame lyman-alpha equivalent width (ew) ina range of ~10 to ~200 \aa. the star-formation rates are also moderate, from afew to a few tens solar masses per year. the laes and lbgs in this sample sharemany common properties, implying that laes represent a subset of lbgs withstrong lyman-alpha emission. finally, the comparison of the uv luminosityfunctions between laes and lbgs suggests that there exists a substantialpopulation of faint galaxies with weak lyman-alpha emission (ew &lt; 20 \aa) thatcould be the dominant contribution to the total ionizing flux at z &gt;= 6.

1305.5257	deep lbt/luci spectroscopy of a lyman-alpha emitter candidate at z ~ 7.7	we present deep spectroscopic observations of a lyman-alpha emitter (lae)candidate at z ~ 7.7 using the infrared spectrograph luci on the 2 x 8.4m largebinocular telescope (lbt). the candidate is the brightest among the four z ~7.7 lae candidates found in a narrow-band imaging survey by krug et al. 2012.our spectroscopic data include a total of 7.5 hours of integration withlbt/luci and are deep enough to significantly (3.2-4.9 sigma) detect thelyman-alpha emission line of this candidate, based on its lyman-alpha flux 1.2x 10^{-17} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} estimated from the narrow-band photometry.however, we do not find any convincing signal at the expected position of itslyman-alpha emission line, suggesting that this source is not an lae at z ~7.7. the non-detection in this work, together with the previous studies of z ~7.7 laes, puts a strong constraint on the bright-end lyman-alpha luminosityfunction (lf) at z ~ 7.7. we find a rapid evolution of the lyman-alpha lf fromz ~ 6.5 to 7.7: the upper limit of the z ~ 7.7 lf is more than 5 times lowerthan the z ~ 6.5 lf at the bright end (f &gt; 1.0 x 10^{-17} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2},or l &gt; 6.9 x 10^{42} erg s^{-1}). this is likely caused by an increasingneutral fraction in the igm that substantially attenuates lyman-alpha emissionat z ~ 7.7.

1412.3845	constraining very high mass population iii stars through he ii emission  in galaxy bdf-521 at z = 7.01	numerous theoretical models have long proposed that a strong he ii 1640emission line is the most prominent and unique feature of massive populationiii (pop iii) stars in high redshift galaxies. the he ii 1640 line strength canconstrain the mass and imf of pop iii stars. we use f132n narrowband filter onthe hubble space telescope's (hst) wide field camera 3 (wfc3) to look forstrong he ii lambda 1640 emission in the galaxy bdf-521 at z=7.01, one of themost distant spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies to date. using deep f132nnarrowband imaging, together with our broadband imaging with f125w and f160wfilters, we do not detect he ii emission from this galaxy, but place a 2-sigmaupper limit on the flux of 5.3x10^-19 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. this measurementcorresponds to a 2-sigma upper limit on the pop iii star formation rate(sfr_popiii) of ~ 0.2 m_solar yr^-1, assuming a salpeter imf with 50&lt; m/m_solar&lt; 1000. from the high signal-to-noise broadband measurements in f125w andf160w, we fit the uv continuum for bdf-521. the spectral flux density is ~ 3.6x10^-11 lambda^-2.32 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 a^-1, which corresponds to an overallunobscured sfr of ~ 5 m_solar yr^-1. our upper limit on sfr_popiii suggeststhat massive pop iii stars represent &lt; 4% of the total star formation. further,the hst high resolution imaging suggests that bdf-521 is an extremely compactgalaxy, with a half-light radius of 0.6 kpc.

1502.01034	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: no evidence  for evolution in the m-sigma relation to z~1	we present host stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 88broad-line quasars at 0.1&lt;z&lt;1 (46 at z&gt;0.6) from the sloan digital sky surveyreverberation mapping (sdss-rm) project. high signal-to-noise ratio coaddedspectra (average s/n~30 per 69 km/s pixel) from sdss-rm allowed decompositionof the host and quasar spectra, and measurement of the host stellar velocitydispersions and black hole (bh) masses using the single-epoch (se) virialmethod. the large sample size and dynamic range in luminosity(l5100=10^(43.2-44.7) erg/s) lead to the first clear detection of a correlationbetween se virial bh mass and host stellar velocity dispersion far beyond thelocal universe. however, the observed correlation is significantly flatter thanthe local relation, suggesting that there are selection biases in high-zluminosity-threshold quasar samples for such studies. our uniform sample andanalysis enable an investigation of the redshift evolution of the m-sigmarelation free of caveats by comparing different samples/analyses at disjointredshifts. we do not observe evolution of the m-sigma relation in our sample,up to z~1, but there is an indication that the relation flattens towards higherredshifts. coupled with the increasing threshold luminosity with redshift inour sample, this again suggests certain selection biases are at work, andsimple simulations demonstrate that a constant m-sigma relation is favored toz~1. our results highlight the scientific potential of deep coaddedspectroscopy from quasar monitoring programs, and offer a new path to probe theco-evolution of bhs and galaxies at earlier times.

1502.02387	an investigation of the absolute proper motions of the scuss catalog	absolute proper motions for $\sim$ 7.7 million objects were derived based ondata from the south galactic cap u-band sky survey (scuss) and astrometric dataderived from uncompressed digitized sky surveys that the space telescopescience institute (stsci) created from the palomar and uk schmidt surveyplates. we put a great deal of effort into correcting the position-,magnitude-, and color-dependent systematic errors in the derived absoluteproper motions. the spectroscopically confirmed quasars were used to test theinternal systematic and random error of the proper motions. the systematicerrors of the overall proper motions in the scuss catalog are estimated as-0.08 and -0.06 mas/yr for {\mu}{\alpha} cos {\delta} and {\mu}{\delta},respectively. the random errors of the proper motions in the scuss catalog areestimated independently as 4.2 and 4.4 mas/yr for {\mu}{\alpha} cos {\delta}and {\mu}{\delta}. there are no obvious position-, magnitude-, andcolor-dependent systematic errors of the scuss proper motions. the random errorof the proper motions goes up with the magnitude from about 3 mas/yr at u &lt;18.0 mag to about 7 mas/yr at u = 22.0 mag. the proper motions of stars inscuss catalog are compared with those in the sdss catalog, and they are highlyconsistent.

1502.07418	an ultra-luminous quasar with a twelve-billion-solar-mass black hole at  redshift 6.30	so far, roughly 40 quasars with redshifts greater than z=6 have beendiscovered. each quasar contains a black hole with a mass of about one billionsolar masses ($10^9 m_\odot$). the existence of such black holes when theuniverse was less than 1 billion years old presents substantial challenges totheories of the formation and growth of black holes and the coevolution ofblack holes and galaxies. here we report the discovery of an ultra-luminousquasar, sdss j010013.02+280225.8, at redshift z=6.30. it has an optical andnear-infrared luminosity a few times greater than those of previously known z&gt;6quasars. on the basis of the deep absorption trough on the blue side of the ly$\alpha$ emission line in the spectrum, we estimate the proper size of theionized proximity zone associated with the quasar to be 26 million light years,larger than found with other z&gt;6.1 quasars with lower luminosities. we estimate(on the basis of a near-infrared spectrum) that the black hole has a mass of$\sim 1.2 \times 10^{10} m_\odot$, which is consistent with the $1.3 \times10^{10} m_\odot$ derived by assuming an eddington-limited accretion rate.

1503.03076	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: rapid civ  broad absorption line variability	we report the discovery of rapid variations of a high-velocity civ broadabsorption line trough in the quasar sdss j141007.74+541203.3. this object wasintensively observed in 2014 as a part of the sloan digital sky surveyreverberation mapping project, during which 32 epochs of spectroscopy wereobtained with the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey spectrograph. weobserve significant (&gt;4sigma) variability in the equivalent width of the broad(~4000 km/s wide) civ trough on rest-frame timescales as short as 1.20 days(~29 hours), the shortest broad absorption line variability timescale yetreported. the equivalent width varied by ~10% on these short timescales, and byabout a factor of two over the duration of the campaign. we evaluate severalpotential causes of the variability, concluding that the most likely cause is arapid response to changes in the incident ionizing continuum. if the outflow isat a radius where the recombination rate is higher than the ionization rate,the timescale of variability places a lower limit on the density of theabsorbing gas of n_e &gt; 3.9 x 10^5 cm^-3. the broad absorption line variabilitycharacteristics of this quasar are consistent with those observed in previousstudies of quasars, indicating that such short-term variability may in fact becommon and thus can be used to learn about outflow characteristics andcontributions to quasar/host-galaxy feedback scenarios.

astro-ph;0512080	a survey of z&gt;5.7 quasars in the sloan digital sky survey iv: discovery  of seven additional quasars	we present the discovery of seven quasars at z&gt;5.7, selected from ~2000 deg^2of multicolor imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the newquasars have redshifts z from 5.79 to 6.13. five are selected as part of acomplete flux-limited sample in the sdss northern galactic cap; two have largerphotometric errors and are not part of the complete sample. one of the newquasars, sdss j1335+3533 (z=5.93), exhibits no emission lines; the 3-sigmalimit on the rest-frame equivalent width of ly alpha+nv line is 5 a. it is thehighest redshift lineless quasar known, and could be a gravitational lensedgalaxy, a bl lac object or a new type of quasar. two new z&gt;6 quasars, sdss1250+3130 (z=6.13) and sdss j1137+3549 (z=6.01), show deep gunn-petersonabsorption gaps in ly alpha. these gaps are narrower the complete gunn-petersonabsorption troughs observed among quasars at z&gt;6.2 and do not have complete lybeta absorption.

astro-ph;0608006	probing the evolution of ir properties of z~6 quasars: spitzer  observations	we present spitzer observations of thirteen z~6 quasars using the infraredarray camera (irac) and multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips). allthe quasars except sdss j000552.34-000655.8 (sdss j0005-0006) were detectedwith high s/n in the four irac channels and the mips 24um band, while sdssj0005-0006 was marginally detected in the irac 8.0um band, and not detected inthe mips 24um band. we find that most of these quasars have prominent emissionfrom hot dust as evidenced by the observed 24um fluxes. their spectral energydistributions (seds) are similar to those of low-redshift quasars at rest-frame0.15-3.5 um, suggesting that accretion disks and hot-dust structures for thesesources already have reached maturity. however, sdss j0005-0006 has an unusualsed that lies significantly below low-redshift sed templates at rest-frame 1and 3.5 um, and thus shows a strong near-ir (nir) deficit and no hot-dustemission. type i quasars with extremely small nir-to-optical flux ratios likesdss j0005-0006 are not found in low-redshift quasar samples, indicating thatsdss j0005-0006 has different dust properties at high redshift. we combine thespitzer observations with x-ray, uv/optical, mm/submm and radio observations todetermine bolometric luminosities for all the quasars. we find that the fourquasars with central black-hole mass measurements have eddington ratios oforder unity.

astro-ph;0611453	the radio-loud fraction of quasars is a strong function of redshift and  optical luminosity	using a sample of optically-selected quasars from the sloan digital skysurvey, we have determined the radio-loud fraction (rlf) of quasars as afunction of redshift and optical luminosity. the sample contains more than30,000 objects and spans a redshift range of 0&lt;z&lt;5 and a luminosity range of-30&lt;m_i&lt;-22. we use both the radio-to-optical flux ratio (r parameter) andradio luminosity to define radio-loud quasars. after breaking the correlationbetween redshift and luminosity due to the flux-limited nature of the sample,we find that the rlf of quasars decreases with increasing redshift anddecreasing luminosity. the relation can be described in the form oflog(rlf/(1-rlf)) = b_0 + b_z log(1+z) + b_m (m_{2500}+26), where m_{2500} isthe absolute magnitude at rest-frame 2500a, and b_z, b_m&lt;0. when using r&gt;10 todefine radio-loud quasars, we find that b_0=-0.132+/-0.116, b_z=-2.052+/-0.261,and b_m=-0.183+/-0.025. the rlf at z=0.5 declines from 24.3% to 5.6% asluminosity decreases from m_{2500}=-26 to m_{2500}=-22, and the rlf atm_{2500}=-26 declines from 24.3% to 4.1% as redshift increases from 0.5 to 3,suggesting that the rlf is a strong function of both redshift and luminosity.we also examine the impact of flux-related selection effects on the rlfdetermination using a series of tests, and find that the dependence of the rlfon redshift and luminosity is highly likely to be physical, and the selectioneffects we considered are not responsible for the dependence.

0810.2747	a catalog of broad absorption line quasars in sloan digital sky survey  data release 5	we present a catalog of 5039 broad absorption line (bal) quasars (qsos) inthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 (dr5) qso catalog that haveabsorption troughs covering a continuous velocity range &gt;= 2000 km/s. we havefit ultraviolet (uv) continua and line emission in each case, enabling us toreport common diagnostics of bal strengths and velocities in the range -25,000to 0 km/s for siiv $\lambda$1400, civ $\lambda$1549, aliii $\lambda$1857, andmgii $\lambda$2799. we calculate these diagnostics using the spectrum listed inthe dr5 qso catalog, and also for spectra from additional sdss observing epochswhen available. in cases where bal qsos have been observed with chandra orxmm-newton, we report the x-ray monochromatic luminosities of these sources.  we confirm and extend previous findings that bal qsos are more stronglyreddened in the rest-frame uv than non-bal qsos and that bal qsos arerelatively x-ray weak compared to non-bal qsos. the observed bal fraction isdependent on the spectral signal-to-noise (s/n); for higher-s/n sources, wefind an observed bal fraction of approximately 15%. bal qsos show a similarbaldwin effect as for non-bal qsos, in that their civ emission equivalentwidths decrease with increasing continuum luminosity. however, bal qsos haveweaker civ emission in general than do non-bal qsos. sources with higher uvluminosities are more likely to have higher-velocity outflows, and the baloutflow velocity and uv absorption strength are correlated with relative x-rayweakness. these results are in qualitative agreement with models that depend onstrong x-ray absorption to shield the outflow from over-ionization and enableradiative acceleration....
