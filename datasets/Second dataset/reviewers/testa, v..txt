0901.3576	vlt/naco near-infrared observations of the transient radio magnetar 1e  1547.0-5408	despite about a decade of observations, very little is known about theoptical and infrared (ir) emission properties of the soft gamma-ray repeaters(sgrs) and of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps), the magnetar candidates, andabout the physical processes which drive their emission at these wavelengths.this is mainly due to the limited number of identifications achieved so far,five in total, and to the sparse spectral coverage obtained from multi-bandoptical/ir photometry. aim of this work is to search for a likely candidatecounterpart to the recently discovered transient radio axp 1e 1547.0-5408. weperformed the first deep near-ir (nir) observations (ks band) of 1e 1547.0-5408with the vlt on three nights (july 8th, 12th, and august 17th), after the x-raysource rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around june 2007.we detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1e1547.0-5408. the faintest of them (object 1) has a brightness k = 20.27 +/-0.05, which would yield an unabsorbed x-ray to nir flux ratio fx/fks ~ 800 for1e 1547.0-5408, i.e. on average lower than those derived for other magnetars.the non-detection of object 1 on the nights of july 8th and august 17th onlyallowed us to set an upper limit of delta ks ~ 0.2 on its nir variability,which prevented us to search for correlations with the radio or x-ray flux. wedetected no other object at the radio position down to a limit of ks ~ 21.7 (at5sigma), computed in our deepest vlt image (july 12th). from our observationswe can not confidently propose a nir counterpart to 1e 1547.0-5408. more nirobservations of object 1, e.g. to determine its colors and to monitorvariability, would be conclusive to determine whether or not it can beconsidered a plausible candidate.

0906.4035	wide and deep near-uv (360nm) galaxy counts and the extragalactic  background light with the large binocular camera	deep multicolour surveys are the main tool to explore the formation andevolution of the faint galaxies which are beyond the spectroscopic limit withthe present technology. the photometric properties of these faint galaxies areusually compared with current renditions of semianalytical models to provideconstraints on the fundamental physical processes involved in galaxy formationand evolution, namely the mass assembly and the star formation. galaxy countsover large sky areas in the near-uv band are important because they aredifficult to obtain given the low efficiency of near-uv instrumentation, evenat 8m class telescopes. a large instrumental field of view helps in minimizingthe biases due to the cosmic variance. we have obtained deep images in the360nm u band provided by the blue channel of the large binocular camera at theprime focus of the large binocular telescope. we have derived over an area of~0.4 sq. deg. the galaxy number counts down to u=27 in the vega system(corresponding to u=27.86 in the ab system) at a completeness level of 30%reaching the faintest current limit for this wavelength and sky area. the shapeof the galaxy counts in the u band can be described by a double power-law, thebright side being consistent with the shape of shallower surveys of comparableor greater areas. the slope bends over significantly at u&gt;23.5 ensuring theconvergence of the contribution by star forming galaxies to the ebl in thenear-uv band to a value which is more than 70% of the most recent upper limitsderived for this band. we have jointly compared our near-uv and k band countscollected from the literature with few selected hierarchical cdm modelsemphasizing critical issues in the physical description of the galaxy formationand evolution.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

1002.3506	early x-ray and optical observations of the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr  0418+5729	emission of two short hard x-ray bursts on 2009 june 5 disclosed theexistence of a new soft gamma-ray repeater, now catalogued as sgr 0418+5729.after a few days, x-ray pulsations at a period of 9.1 s were discovered in itspersistent emission. sgr 0418+5729 was monitored almost since its discoverywith the rossi x-ray timing explorer (2-10 kev energy range) and observed manytimes with swift (0.2-10 kev). the source persistent x-ray emission faded by afactor 10 in about 160 days, with a steepening in the decay about 19 days afterthe activation. the x-ray spectrum is well described by a simple absorbedblackbody, with a temperature decreasing in time. a phase-coherent timingsolution over the 160 day time span yielded no evidence for any significantevolution of the spin period, implying a 3-sigma upper limit of 1.1e-13 s/s onthe period derivative and of 3e+13 g on the surface dipole magnetic field.phase-resolved spectroscopy provided evidence for a significant variation ofthe spectrum as a function of the stellar rotation, pointing to the presence oftwo emitting caps, one of which became hotter during the outburst. finally, adeep observation of the field of sgr 0418+5729 with the new gran telescopiocanarias 10.4-m telescope allowed us to set an upper limit on the sourceoptical flux of i'&gt;25.1 mag, corresponding to an x-ray-to-optical flux ratioexceeding 10000, consistent with the characteristics of other magnetars.

1005.1569	the sooner: a large robotic telescope	the approach of observational astronomy is mainly aimed at the constructionof larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelengthcoverage. certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completelyfulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes(bh), neutron stars (ns) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.recently, mainly through the vela, beppo-sax and swift satellites, we reached areasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the universe and of some ofthe processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (bh). weplan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics ofvery fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extremecompact objects. the innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) thedesign (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotictelescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the uniquefeatures: "no telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengthsobservations (photometry, spectroscopy o\&amp; polarimetry); 3) high timeresolution observations. the conceptual design of the telescope and relatedinstrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: high frequencya-periodic variability, polarization, high z grbs, short grbs, grb-supernovaeassociation, multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersionspectroscopy. this experiment will turn the "exception" (like the opticalobservations of grb 080319b) to "routine".

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1011.6569	a critical analysis of the uv luminosity function at redshift~7 from  deep wfc3 data	the study of the luminosity function (lf) of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz=7 is important for ascertaining their role in the reionization of theuniverse. we perform a detailed and critical analysis of the statistical andsystematic errors in the z~7 lf determination: we have assembled a large sampleof candidate lbgs at z~7 from different surveys, spanning a large variety ofareas and depths. in particular, we have combined data from the deep (j&lt;27.4)and ultradeep (j&lt;29.2) surveys recently acquired with the new wfc3 nir cameraon hst, over the goods-ers and the hudf fields, with ground based surveys inwide and shallow areas from vlt and subaru. we have used public acs images inthe z-band to select z-dropout galaxies, and other public data both in the blue(bvi) and in the red bands to reject possible low-redshift interlopers. we havecompared our results with extensive simulations to quantify the observationaleffects of our selection criteria as well as the effects of photometricscatter, color selections or the morphology of the candidates. we have foundthat the number density of faint lbgs at z~7 is only marginally sensitive tothe color selection adopted, but it is strongly dependent from the assumptionmade on the half light distributions of the simulated galaxies, used to correctthe observed sample for incompleteness. the slope of the faint end of the lbgslf has thus a rather large uncertainty, due to the unknown distribution ofphysical sizes of the z~7 lbgs. we conclude that galaxies at z~7 are unable toreionize the universe unless there is a significant evolution in the clumpinessof the igm or in the escape fraction of ionising photons or, alternatively,there is a large population of z~7 lbgs with large physical dimensions butstill not detected by the present observations.

1307.5671	the astri mini-array science case	astri is a flagship project financed by the italian ministry of education,university and research, and led by inaf, the italian national institute ofastrophysics. within this framework, inaf is currently developing an end-to-endprototype of a small size telescope in a dual-mirror configuration (sst-2m) forthe cherenkov telescope array (cta), scheduled to start data acquisition in2014. although the astri sst-2m prototype is mainly a technologicaldemonstrator, it will perform scientific observations of the crab nebula, mrk421 and mrk 501 at e&gt;1 tev. a remarkable improvement in terms of performancecould come from the operation, in 2016, of a sst-2m mini-array, composed of afew sst-2m telescopes to be placed at final cta southern site. the sstmini-array will be able to study in great detail relatively bright sources (afew x 10e-12 erg/cm2/s at 10 tev) with angular resolution of a few arcmin andenergy resolution of about 10-15%. thanks to the stereo approach, it will bepossible to verify the wide field of view (fov) performance through thedetections of very high-energy showers with core located at a distance up to500 m, to compare the mini-array performance with the monte carlo expectationsby means of deep observations of selected targets, and to perform the first ctascience at the beginning of the mini-array operations. prominent sources suchas extreme blazars, nearby well-known bl lac objects and radio-galaxies,galactic pulsar wind nebulae, supernovae remnants, micro-quasars, and thegalactic center can be observed in a previously unexplored energy range, inorder to investigate the electron acceleration and cooling, relativistic andnon relativistic shocks, the search for cosmic-ray (cr) pevatrons, the study ofthe cr propagation, and the impact of the extragalactic background light on thespectra of the sources.

0801.4027	the structural properties and star formation history of leo t from deep  lbt photometry	we present deep, wide-field g and r photometry of the transition type dwarfgalaxy leo t, obtained with the blue arm of the large binocular telescope. thedata confirm the presence of both very young (&lt;1 gyr) as well as much older (&gt;5gyr) stars. we study the structural properties of the old and young stellarpopulations by preferentially selecting either population based on their colorand magnitude. the young population is significantly more concentrated than theold population, with half-light radii of 104+-8 and 148+-16 pc respectively,and their centers are slightly offset. approximately 10% of the total stellarmass is estimated to be represented by the young stellar population. comparisonof the color-magnitude diagram (cmd) with theoretical isochrones as well asnumerical cmd-fitting suggest that star formation began over 10 gyr ago andcontinued in recent times until at least a few hundred myr ago. the cmd-fittingresults are indicative of two distinct star formation bursts, with a quiescentperiod around 3 gyr ago, albeit at low significance. the results are consistentwith no metallicity evolution and [fe/h] ~ -1.5 over the entire age of thesystem. finally, the data show little if any sign of tidal distortion of leo t.

1311.1921	diffuse optical intracluster light as a measure of stellar tidal  stripping: the cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim $0.4 observed at lbt	we have evaluated the diffuse intracluster light (icl) in the central core ofthe galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim 0.4$ observed with the prime focuscamera (lbc) at lbt. the measure required an accurate removal of the galaxieslight within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. the residual background intensityhas then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average iclintensity profile. the latter shows an approximate exponential decline asexpected from theoretical cold dark matter models. the radial profile of theicl over the galaxies intensity ratio (icl fraction) is increasing withdecreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and thendecreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxiesbecomes dominant. theoretical expectations in a simplified cdm scenario showthat the icl fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxystellar mass ratio in the cluster. it is possible to show that the latterquantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual hostgalaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. the predictedicl fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed cdm profile, totalmass and concentration parameter of the cluster. adopting values very similarto those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in cl0024+17 we find agood agreement with the observed icl fraction profile. the galaxy counts in thecluster core have then been compared with that derived from composite clustersamples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius. the galaxy countsin the cl0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to theaverage cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broadagreement with the measured icl fraction.

0802.2613	the blue straggler population in the globular cluster m53 (ngc5024): a  combined hst, lbt, cfht study	we used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution and wide fieldmulti-wavelength observations collected at three different telescopes (hst, lbtand cfht) to probe blue straggler star (bss) populations in the globularcluster m53. almost 200 bss have been identified over the entire clusterextension. the radial distribution of these stars has been found to be bimodal(similarly to that of several other clusters) with a prominent dip at ~60'' (~2r_c) from the cluster center. this value turns out to be a factor of twosmaller than the radius of avoidance (r_avoid, the radius within which all thestars of ~1.2 m_sun have sunk to the core because of dynamical friction effectsin an hubble time). while in most of the clusters with a bimodal bss radialdistribution, r_avoid has been found to be located in the region of theobserved minimum, this is the second case (after ngc6388) where thisdiscrepancy is noted. this evidence suggests that in a few clusters thedynamical friction seems to be somehow less efficient than expected.  we have also used this data base to construct the radial star density profileof the cluster: this is the most extended and accurate radial profile everpublished for this cluster, including detailed star counts in the very innerregion. the star density profile is reproduced by a standard king model with anextended core (~25'') and a modest value of the concentration parameter(c=1.58). a deviation from the model is noted in the most external region ofthe cluster (at r&gt;6.5' from the center). this feature needs to be furtherinvestigated in order to address the possible presence of a tidal tail in thiscluster.

1404.1697	the extended structure of the dwarf irregular galaxies sextans a and  sextans b. signatures of tidal distortion in the outskirts of the local group	we present a detailed study of the stellar and hi structure of the dwarfirregular galaxies sextansa and sextansb, members of the ngc3109 association.we use newly obtained deep (r~26.5) and wide field g,r photometry to extend thesurface brightness (sb) profiles of the two galaxies down to mu_v~ 31.0mag/arcsec^2. we find that both galaxies are significantly more extended thanwhat previously traced with surface photometry, out to ~4 kpc from theircenters along their major axis. older stars are found to have more extendeddistribution with respect to younger populations. we obtain the first estimateof the mean metallicity for the old stars in sexb, from the color distributionof the red giant branch, &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-1.6. the sb profiles show significantchanges of slope and cannot be fitted with a single sersic model. both galaxieshave hi discs as massive as their respective stellar components. in both casesthe hi discs display solid-body rotation with maximum amplitude of ~50 km/s(albeit with significant uncertainty due to the poorly constrainedinclination), implying a dynamical mass ~10^{9}~m_sun, a mass-to-light ratiom/l_v~25 and a dark-to-barionic mass ratio of ~10. the distribution of thestellar components is more extended than the gaseous disc in both galaxies. wefind that the main, approximately round-shaped, stellar body of sex~a issurrounded by an elongated low-sb stellar halo that can be interpreted as atidal tail, similar to that found in another member of the same association(antlia). we discuss these, as well as other evidences of tidal disturbance, inthe framework of a past passage of the ngc3109 association close to the milkyway, that has been hypothesized by several authors and is also supported by therecently discovered filamentary configuration of the association itself.

1408.5753	a bag of tricks: using proper motions of galactic stars to identify the  hercules ultra-faint dwarf galaxy members	hercules is the prototype of the ultra-faint dwarf (ufd) galaxies. to date,there are still no firm constraints on its total luminosity, due to thedifficulty of disentangling hercules bona-fide stars from the severe galacticfield contamination. in order to better constrain hercules properties we aim atremoving foreground and background contaminants in the galaxy field using theproper motions of the milky way stars and the colour-colour diagram. we haveobtained images of hercules in the rsloan, bbessel and uspec bands with thelarge binocular telescope (lbt) and lbc-bin mode capabilities. the rsloan newdata-set combined with data from the lbt archive span a time baseline of about5 yr, allowing us to measure for the first time proper motions of stars in thehercules direction. the uspec data along with existing lbt photometry allowedus to use colour-colour diagram to further remove the field contamination.thanks to a highly-accurate procedure to derive the rsloan-filter geometricdistortion solution for the lbc-red, we were able to measure stellar relativeproper motions to a precision of better than 5 mas yr^-1 down to rsloan=22 magand disentangle a significant fraction (\&gt;90\%) of milky way contaminants. weended up with a sample of 528 sources distributed over a large portion of thegalaxy body (0.12 deg^2). of these sources, 171 turned out to be backgroundgalaxies and additional foreground stars, from the analysis of the uspec -bbessel vs. bbessel - rsloan colour-colour diagram. this leaves us with asample of 357 likely members of the hercules ufd. we compared the cleanedcolour-magnitude diagram (cmd) with evolutionary models and synthetic cmds,confirming the presence in hercules of an old population (t=12\pm 2 gyr), witha wide spread in metallicity (-3.3\&lt;[fe/h]\&lt;-1.8).

1409.0715	the extended structure of the dwarf irregular galaxy sagittarius	we present a detailed study of the stellar and hi structure of the dwarfirregular galaxy sagittarius. we use new deep and wide field photometry totrace the surface brightness profile of the galaxy out to ~5.0' (correspondingto ~1600 pc) and down to $\mu_v\simeq 30.0$ mag/arcsec$^2$, thus showing thatthe stellar body of the galaxy is much more extended than previously believed,and it is similarly (or more) extended than the overall hi distribution. thewhole major-axis profile is consistent with a pure exponential, with a scaleradius of $\simeq 340$ pc. the surface density maps reveal that thedistribution of old and intermediate-age stars is smooth and remarkablyflattened out to its edges, while the associated hi has a much rounder shape,is off-centred and presents multiple density maxima and a significant hole. noclear sign of systemic rotation is detectable in the complex hi velocity field.no metallicity gradient is detected in the old and intermediate age populationof the galaxy, and we confirm that this population has a much more extendeddistribution than young stars (age$\lt 1$ gyr).

1412.5857	the stellar counterparts of compact high velocity clouds (secco) survey.  i. photos of ghosts	we present an imaging survey aimed at searching for the stellar counterpartsof recently discovered ultra-compact high-velocity hi clouds (uchvc). adams etal. (2013) proposed these clouds to be candidate mini-haloes in the local groupand/or its surroundings, within a distance range of 0.25-2.0 mpc. using thelarge binocular telescope we obtain wide-field (~ 23' x 23') g- and r-bandimages of the twenty-five most promising and most compact clouds among thefifty-nine identified by adams et al. careful visual inspection of all theimages does not reveal any stellar counterpart even slightly resembling leop,the only local dwarf galaxy that was found as a counterpart to a previouslydetected high velocity cloud. only a possible distant (d&gt;3.0 mpc) counterpartto hvc274.68+74.70-123 has been identified on our images. the point sourcephotometry in the central 17.3' x 7.7' chips reaches r&lt;= 26.5, and is expectedto contain most of the stellar counterparts to the uchvcs. however, no obviousstellar over-density is detected in any of our fields, in marked contrast toour comparison leop field in which the dwarf galaxy is detected at a &gt;30 sigmasignificance level. only hvc352.45+59.06+263 may be associated with a weakover-density, whose nature cannot be ascertained with our data. sensitivitytests shows that our survey would have detected any dwarf galaxy dominated byan old stellar population, with an integrated absolute magnitude m_v&lt;= -8.0, ahalf-light radius r_h&lt;= 300 pc, and lying within 1.5 mpc from us, therebyconfirming that it is unlikely that the observed uchvcs are associated withstellar counterparts typical of known local group dwarf galaxies.

(2013) as a possible mini-halo within the local groupof galaxies. the spectroscopic follow-up of the brightest sources within thecandidate reveals the presence of two hii regions whose radial velocity iscompatible with physical association with the uvhvc. the available data doesnot allow us to give a definite answer on the nature of the newly identifiedsystem. a few alternative hypotheses are discussed. however, the most likelypossibility is that we have found a new faint dwarf galaxy residing in thevirgo cluster of galaxies, which we name secco-1. independently of its actualdistance, secco-1 displays a ratio of neutral hydrogen mass to v luminosity ofm_{hi}/l_v&gt;= 20, by far the largest among local dwarfs. hence, it appears as anearly star-less galaxy and it may be an example of the missing links betweennormal dwarfs and the dark mini halos that are predicted to exist in largenumbers according to the currently accepted cosmological model.

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

astro-ph;0301585	the dwarf low surface brightness galaxy population of the virgo cluster  i. the faint-end-slope of the luminosity function	the widely varying dwarf galaxy counts in different environments provide astrong challenge to standard hierarchical clustering models. the luminosityfunction is not universal, but seems to be strongly dependent upon environment.in this paper we describe an automated procedure for detecting and measuringvery low surface brightness (lsb) features in deep ccd data. we apply thisprocedure to large area ccd survey fields of the virgo cluster. we show thatthere are many more faint ($-10 \geq m_{b} \geq -14$) low surface brightnessgalaxies than what would be predicted from extrapolation of the virgo clustercatalogue luminosity function. over our limited range of measurement the faintend slope of the luminosity function becomes $\alpha=- 1.6$. the luminosityfunction is flatter in the inner regions of the cluster than it is in the outerregions. although these galaxies contribute a small fraction of the totalstellar light of the cluster, they may contribute significantly to the mass ingalaxies if they have large mass-to-light ratios similar to those recentlymeasured for local group dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0305157	the optical counterpart to sax j1808.4-3658 in quiescence: evidence of  an active radio pulsar?	the optical counterpart of the binary millisecond x-ray pulsar saxj1808.4-3658 during quiescence was detected at v = 21.5 mag by homer et al.(2001). this star shows a 6% semi-amplitude sinusoidal modulation of its fluxat the orbital period of the system. it was proposed that the modulation arisesfrom x-ray irradiation of the intrinsically faint companion by a remnantaccretion disk, and that the bulk of the optical emission arises from viscousdissipation in the disk. the serious difficulty in this scenario lies in theestimate of the irradiating luminosity required to match the observationaldata, that is a factor 10-50 higher than the quiescent x-ray luminosity of thissource. to overcome this problem, we propose an alternative scenario, in whichthe irradiation is due to the release of rotational energy by the fast spinningneutron star, switched on, as magneto-dipole rotator (radio pulsar), duringquiescence. our computations indicate that the optical magnitudes are fullyconsistent with this hypothesis. in this case the observed optical luminositymay be the first evidence that a radio pulsar is active in this system inquiescence, a key phase for understanding the evolution of this class ofobjects.

astro-ph;0401334	accurate x-ray position of the anomalous x-ray pulsar xte j1810-197 and  identification of its likely ir counterpart	we report the accurate sub-arcsec x-ray position of the new anomalous x-raypulsar (axp) xte j1810-197, derived with a chndra-hrc target of opportunityobservation carried out in november 2003. we also report the discovery of alikely ir counterpart based on a vlt (ir band) target of opportunityobservation carried out in october 2003. our proposed counterpart is the onlyir source (ks=20.8) in the x-ray error circle. its ir colors as well as thex-ray/ir flux ratio, are consistent with those of the counterparts of all otheraxps (at variance with field star colors). deep gunn-i band images obtained atthe 3.6m eso telescope detected no sources down to a limiting magnitude of24.3. moreover, we find that the pulsed fraction and count rates of xtej1810-197 remained nearly unchanged since the previous chandra and xmm-newtonobservations (2003 august 27th and september 8th, respectively). we brieflydiscuss the implications of these results. in particular, we note that thetransient (or at least highly variable) nature of this axp might imply arelatively large number of hidden members of this class.

astro-ph;0406309	vlt fors-1 observations of ngc 6397: evidence for mass segregation	we present (v,v-i) vlt-fors1 observations of the galactic globular clusterngc 6397. we derive accurate color--magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions(lfs) of the cluster main sequence (ms) for two fields extending from a regionnear the centre of the cluster out to ~ 10 arcmin. the photometry of thesefields produces a narrow ms extending down to v ~ 27, much deeper than anyprevious ground based study on this system and comparable to previous hstphotometry. the v, v-i cmd also shows a deep white dwarf cooling sequencelocus, contaminated by many field stars and spurious objects. we concentratethe present work on the analysis of the mslfs derived for two annuli atdifferent radial distance from the center of the cluster. evidence of aclear-cut correlation between the slope of the observed lfs before reaching theturn-over, and the radial position of the observed fields inside the clusterarea is found. we find that the lfs become flatter with decreasing radius (x ~0.15 for 1'&lt; r1 &lt; 5.5'; x ~ 0.24 for 5.5'&lt; r2 &lt;9.8'; core radius, rc = 0.05'),a trend that is consistent with the interpretation of ngc 6397 as a dynamicallyrelaxed system. this trend is also evident in the mass function.

astro-ph;0511829	a rapid and dramatic outburst in blazar 3c 454.3 during may 2005 -  optical and infrared observations with rem and ait	the flat-spectrum radio quasar 3c 454.3 is well known to be a highly activeand variable source with outbursts occurring across the whole electromagneticspectrum over the last decades. in spring 2005, 3c 454.3 has been reported toexhibit a strong optical outburst which subsequently triggered multi-frequencyobservations of the source covering the radio up to gamma-ray bands. here, wepresent first results of our near-ir/optical (v, r, i, h band) photometryperformed between may 11 and august 5, 2005 with the rapid eye mount (rem) atla silla in chile and the automatic imaging telescope (ait) of the perugiauniversity observatory. 3c 454.3 was observed during an exceptional andhistorical high state with a subsequent decrease in brightness over our 86 daysobserving period. the continuum spectral behaviour during the flaring anddeclining phase suggests a synchrotron peak below the near-ir band as well as ageometrical origin of the variations e.g. due to changes in the direction offorward beaming.

astro-ph;0604139	red giant stars in the large magellanic cloud clusters	we present deep j,h,ks photometry and accurate color magnitude diagrams downto k ~18.5, for a sample of 13 globular clusters in the large magellanic cloud.this data set combined with the previous sample of 6 clusters published by ourgroup gives the opportunity to study the properties of giant stars in clusterswith different ages (ranging from ~80 myr up to ~3.5 gyr). quantitativeestimates of star population ratios (by number and luminosity) in theasymptotic giant branch, the red giant branch and the he-clump, have beenobtained and compared with theoretical models in the framework of probing theso-called phase transitions. the agb contribution to the total luminositystarts to be significant at ~200 myr and reaches its maximum at ~5-600 myr,when the rgb phase transition is starting. at ~900 myr the full developing ofan extended and well populated rgb has been completed. both the occurrence ofthe agb and rgb phase transitions are sharp events, lasting a few hundreds myronly. these empirical results agree very well with the theoretical predictionsof simple stellar population models based on canonical tracks and thefuel-consumption approach.

astro-ph;0609825	uves/vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb 050730 afterglow: probing  the features of the grb environment	we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of the opticalafterglow of grb050730, obtained with uves@vlt about hours after the grbtrigger. the spectrum shows that the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 3.967 iscomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorptionsystem. we detect strong cii*, siii*, oi* and feii* fine structure absorptionlines associated to the second and third component. for the first threecomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of thegrb explosion. component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not presentany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionizationfeatures, such as civ and ovi, suggesting that this component is very close tothe grb site. from the analysis of low and high ionization lines and finestructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from thesite of the grb explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. weevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. however, this should not be taken asrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to thehydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while thatof the other elements presumably comes from the ism closer to the grb site.furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modifysignificantly these values. the mean [c/fe] ratio agrees well with thatexpected by single star-formation event models. interestingly the [c/fe] ofcomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with grb dustdestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the grbsite.

(2005).these new x-ray observations show that the axp flux is rising again, and thespectrum hardening. if the increase in the source intensity is indeed connectedwith the glitches and a possible bursting activity, we expect this source toenter in a bursting active phase around 2006-2007. second, we report on deep irobservations of 1rxs j170849-400910, taken with the vlt-naco adaptive optics,showing that there are many weak sources consistent with the axp position.neither star a or b, previously proposed by different authors, might yet beconclusively recognised as the ir counterpart of 1rxs j170849-400910. third,using monte carlo simulations, we re-address the calculation of thesignificance of the absorption line found in a phase-resolved spectrum of thissource by rea et al.

astro-ph;9409085	globular clusters in the magellanic clouds.ii: ir-array photometry for  12 globulars and contributions to the integrated cluster light	we report the results of the observations in the jhk bands of 12 globularclusters in the lmc, and present cmds down to k=16 for about 450 stars. wemerge the data with the bv ones presented in paper i and use the merged data tostudy the evolution of integrated magnitudes and colours of ssps. we find thatthe agb contributes about 60 percent of integrated clusters light in k, whilethe contribution from rgb is correlated with the age of the cluster. the age atwhich the first appearance of the rgb takes place depends on the models adoptedranging from about 600 myr in the "classical" models to about 1.5 gyr with the"overshooting" models. both models give the same fractional contribution of thergb to the cluster light, in agreement with the fuel consumption theorem. theoverall picture is consistent with the early conclusions of persson et al. 1983and frogel et al. 1990 that j-k colour is driven by agb stars, v-k iscontrolled by agb and rgb stars and b-v is partially influenced by the wholepopulation redder than the rgb clump, but is strongly dependent on the fadingand reddening of the to stars with age.
