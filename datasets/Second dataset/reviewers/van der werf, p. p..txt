0910.2821	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south	we present a sensitive 870 micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs) using laboca on the apex telescope. the laboca ecdfssubmillimetre survey (less) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ecdfsand has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mjy/beam. less is thus the largestcontiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. the noise propertiesof our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected byconfusion noise. we present a catalog of 126 smgs detected with a significancelevel above 3.7 sigma. the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative topreviously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies thatdominate the extragalactic background light (ebl). this is in line with theunderdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populationsin the ecdfs (bzks, drgs,optically bright agn and massive k-band selectedgalaxies). the differential source counts in the full field are well describedby a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from otherfields. we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across thefield. the integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count modelsaccount for &gt;65% of the estimated ebl from cobe measurements. we haveinvestigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two-pointcorrelation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales&lt;1'. assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typicalredshift distribution for the smgs we derive a spatial correlation length ofr_0=13+/-6 h^-1 mpc.

1003.1751	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey ii: warm molecular gas and star  formation in three field spiral galaxies	we present the results of large-area co j=3-2 emission mapping of threenearby field galaxies, ngc 628, ngc 3521, and ngc 3627, completed at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope as part of the nearby galaxies legacy survey. thesegalaxies all have moderate to strong co j=3-2 detections over large areas ofthe fields observed by the survey, showing resolved structure and dynamics intheir warm/dense molecular gas disks. all three galaxies were part of thespitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey sample, and as such have excellentpublished multi-wavelength ancillary data. these data sets allow us to examinethe star formation properties, gas content, and dynamics of these galaxies onsub-kiloparsec scales. we find that the global gas depletion times fordense/warm molecular gas in these galaxies is consistent with other results fornearby spiral galaxies, indicating this may be independent of galaxy propertiessuch as structures, gas compositions, and environments. similar to the resultsfrom the things hi survey, we do not see a correlation of the star formationefficiency with the gas surface density consistent with the schmidt-kennicuttlaw. finally, we find that the star formation efficiency of the dense moleculargas traced by co j=3-2 is potentially flat or slightly declining as a functionof molecular gas density, the co j=3-2/j=1-0 ratio (in contrast to thecorrelation found in a previous study into the starburst galaxy m83), and thefraction of total gas in molecular form.

1003.3222	molecular and atomic gas in the local group galaxy m33	we present high resolution large scale observations of the molecular andatomic gas in the local group galaxy m33. the observations were carried outusing the hera at the 30m iram telescope in the co(2-1) line achieving aresolution of 12"x2.6 km/s, enabling individual gmcs to be resolved. theobserved region mainly along the major axis out to a radius of 8.5 kpc, andcovers the strip observed with hifi/pacs spectrometers as part of the herm33esherschel key program. the achieved sensitivity in main beam temperature is20-50 mk at 2.6 km/s velocity resolution. the co(2-1) luminosity of theobserved region is 1.7\pm0.1x10^7 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to h2 masses of1.9x10^8 msun (including he), calculated with a nh2/ico twice the galacticvalue due to the half-solar metallicity of m33. hi 21 cm vla archiveobservations were reduced and the mosaic was imaged and cleaned using themulti-scale task in casa, yielding a series of datacubes with resolutionsranging from 5" to 25". the hi mass within a radius of 8.5 kpc is estimated tobe 1.4x10^9 msun. the azimuthally averaged co surface brightness decreasesexponentially with a scale length of 1.9\pm0.1 kpc whereas the atomic gassurface density is constant at sigma_hi=6\pm2 msun/pc^2 deprojected to face-on.the central kiloparsec h_2 surface density is sigma_h2=8.5\pm0.2 msun/pc^2. thestar formation rate per unit molecular gas (sf efficiency, the rate oftransformation of molecular gas into stars), as traced by the ratio of co tohalpha and fir brightness, is constant with radius. the sfe appears 2-4 timesgreater than of large spiral galaxies. a morphological comparison of molecularand atomic gas with tracers of star formation shows good agreement betweenthese maps both in terms of peaks and holes. a few exceptions are noted.several spectra, including those of a molecular cloud situated more than 8 kpcfrom the galaxy center, are presented.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1006.2137	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: a  photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies	[abridged] we derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-irphotometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) selected at 870um by laboca observations in the ecdfs. the medianphotometric redshift of identified smgs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile rangeis z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z&gt;3) smgs. we derive asimple redshift estimator for smgs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which isaccurate to delta_z~0.4 for smgs at z&lt;4. a statistical analysis of sourcesaround unidentified smgs identifies a population of likely counterparts with aredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% ofthe unidentified smgs. this confirms that the bulk of the undetected smgs arecoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-ir. we conclude that ~15% of allthe smgs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z&gt;3 and hence ~30%of all smgs have z&gt;3. we estimate that the full s_870um&gt;4mjy smg population hasa median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. in contrast to previous suggestions we find nosignificant correlation between s_870um and redshift. the median stellar massof the smgs derived from sed fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10msun and theinterquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10msun, although we caution that uncertaintyin the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in thesestellar masses. the median characteristic dust temperature of smgs is35.9\pm1.4k and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3k. the infrared luminosityfunction shows that smgs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-ir luminosities andluminosity density than those at z=1-2. this is mirrored in the evolution ofthe star-formation rate density (sfrd) for smgs which peaks at z~2. the maximumcontribution of bright smgs to the global sfrd (~5% for smgs with s_870um&gt;4mjy;~50% for smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy) also occurs at z~2.

1006.5006	excitation of the molecular gas in the nuclear region of m82	we present high resolution hifi spectroscopy of the nucleus of thearchetypical starburst galaxy m82. six 12co lines, 2 13co lines and 4fine-structure lines are detected. besides showing the effects of the overallvelocity structure of the nuclear region, the line profiles also indicate thepresence of multiple components with different optical depths, temperatures anddensities in the observing beam. the data have been interpreted using a grid ofpdr models. it is found that the majority of the molecular gas is in lowdensity (n=10^3.5 cm^-3) clouds, with column densities of n_h=10^21.5 cm^-2 anda relatively low uv radiation field (go = 10^2). the remaining gas ispredominantly found in clouds with higher densities (n=10^5 cm^-3) andradiation fields (go = 10^2.75), but somewhat lower column densities(n_h=10^21.2 cm^-2). the highest j co lines are dominated by a small (1%relative surface filling) component, with an even higher density (n=10^6 cm^-3)and uv field (go = 10^3.25). these results show the strength of multi-componentmodeling for the interpretation of the integrated properties of galaxies.

1007.1167	hifi spectroscopy of low-level water transitions in m82	we present observations of the rotational ortho-water ground transition, thetwo lowest para-water transitions, and the ground transition of ionisedortho-water in the archetypal starburst galaxy m82, performed with the hifiinstrument on the herschel space observatory. these observations are the firstdetections of the para-h2o(111-000) (1113\,ghz) and ortho-h2o+(111-000)(1115\,ghz) lines in an extragalactic source. all three water lines showdifferent spectral line profiles, underlining the need for high spectralresolution in interpreting line formation processes. using the line shape ofthe para-h2o(111-000) and ortho-h2o+(111-000) absorption profile in conjunctionwith high spatial resolution co observations, we show that the (ionised) waterabsorption arises from a ~2000 pc^2 region within the hifi beam located about~50 pc east of the dynamical centre of the galaxy. this region does notcoincide with any of the known line emission peaks that have been identified inother molecular tracers, with the exception of hco. our data suggest that waterand ionised water within this region have high (up to 75%) area-coveringfactors of the underlying continuum. this indicates that water is notassociated with small, dense cores within the ism of m82 but arises from a morewidespread diffuse gas component.

1111.2628	optical to near-infrared transit observations of super-earth gj1214b:  water-world or mini-neptune?	gj1214b is thought to be either a mini-neptune with a thick, hydrogen-richatmosphere, or a planet with a composition dominated by water. in the case of ahydrogen-rich atmosphere, molecular absorption and scattering processes mayresult in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength. the aim ofthis paper is to measure these variations. we have obtained observations of thetransit of gj1214b in the r- and i-band with the int, in the g, r, i and zbands with the 2.2 meter mpi/eso telescope, in the ks-band with the not, and inthe kc-band with the wht. by comparing the transit depth between the thedifferent bands, which is a measure for the planet-to-star size ratio, theatmosphere is investigated. we do not detect clearly significant variations inthe planet-to-star size ratio as function of wavelength. although the ratio atthe shortest measured wavelength, in g-band, is 2sigma larger than in the otherbands. the uncertainties in the ks and kc bands are large, due to systematicfeatures in the light curves. the tentative increase in the planet-to-star sizeratio at the shortest wavelength could be a sign of an increase in theeffective planet-size due to rayleigh scattering, which would require gj1214bto have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. if true, then the atmosphere has to haveboth clouds, to suppress planet-size variations at red optical wavelengths, aswell as a sub-solar metallicity, to suppress strong molecular features in thenear- and mid-infrared. however, star spots, which are known to be present onthe hoststar's surface, can (partly) cancel out the expected variations inplanet-to-star size ratio, due to the lower surface temperature of the spots .a hypothetical spot-fraction of 10% would be able to raise the infrared pointssufficiently with respect to the optical measurements to be inconsistent with awater-dominated atmosphere.

1111.4320	giant molecular clouds in the local group galaxy m33	we present an analysis of the systematic co(2-1) survey at 12" resolutioncovering most of the local group spiral m 33 which, at a distance of 840 kpc,is close enough that individual giant molecular clouds (gmcs) can beidentified. the goal of this work is to study the properties of the gmcs inthis subsolar metallicity galaxy. the cprops (cloud properties) algorithm(rosolowsky &amp; leroy 2006) was used to identify 337 gmcs in m 33, the largestsample to date in an external galaxy. the sample is used to study the gmcluminosity function, or mass spectrum under the assumption of a constantn(h2)/ico ratio. we find that n(l)dl = k*l^(-2.0\pm0.1) for the entire sample.however, when the sample is divided into inner and outer disk samples, theexponent changes from 1.6 \pm 0.2 for the centre 2 kpc to 2.3 \pm 0.2 forgalactocentric distances larger than 2 kpc. based on the emission in the fuv,halpha, 8mu, and 24mu bands, each cloud was classified in terms of its starforming activity - no star formation, embedded, or exposed star formation(visible in fuv and halpha). at least one sixth of the clouds had no (massive)star formation, suggesting that the average time required for star formation tostart is about one sixth of the total time for which the object is identifiableas a gmc. the clouds without star formation have significantly lower columinosities than those with star formation, whether embedded or exposed,presumably related to the lack of heating sources. taking the cloud sample as awhole, the main non-trivial correlation was the decrease in cloud co brightness(or luminosity) with galactocentric radius. the complete cloud catalog,including co and hi spectra and the co contours on the fuv, halpha, 8mu, and24mu images is presented in the appendix.

1201.3281	[feii] as a tracer supernova rate	supernovae play an integral role in the feedback of processed material intothe ismof galaxies and are responsible for most of the chemical enrichment ofthe universe. the rate of supernovae can also reveal the star formationhistories. supernova rate is usually measured through the non-thermal radiocontinuum luminosity, but in this paper we establish a quantitativerelationship between the [feii]1.26 luminosity and supernova rate in a sampleof 11 near-by starburst galaxies. sinfoni data cubes are used to perform apixel pixel analysis of this correlation. using br equivalent width andluminosity as the only observational inputs into starburst 99, the supernovarate is derived at each pixel and a map of supernova rate is created. this isthen compared morphologically and quantitatively to [feii]1.26 luminosity map.we find a strong linear and morphological correlation between supernova rateand [feii]1.26 on a pixel-pixel basis: log snrate yr-1 pc-2 = (1.01 \pm 0.2)\ast log[feii]1.26 ergs-1 pc-2 - 41.17 \pm 0.9 the starburst 99 derivedsupernova rates are also in good agreement with the radio derived supernovarates, which further demonstrates the strength of [feii] as a tracer ofsupernova rate. with the strong correlation found in this sample of galaxies,we now qualitatively use [feii]1.26 to derive supernova rate on either apixel-pixel or integrated galactic basis.

0711.1902	mid-infrared spectroscopy of lensed galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3: the nature of  sources near the mips confusion limit	we present spitzer/irs mid-infrared spectra for 15 gravitationally lensed, 24micron--selected galaxies, and combine the results with 4 additional very faintgalaxies with irs spectra in the literature. the median intrinsic 24 micronflux density of the sample is 130 microjy, enabling a systematic survey of thespectral properties of the very faint 24 micron sources that dominate thenumber counts of spitzer cosmological surveys. six of the 19 galaxy spectra(32%) show the strong mid-ir continuua expected of agn; x-ray detectionsconfirm the presence of agn in three of these cases, and reveal agns in twoother galaxies. these results suggest that nuclear accretion may contributemore flux to faint 24 micron--selected samples than previously assumed. almostall the spectra show some aromatic (pah) emission features; the measuredaromatic flux ratios do not show evolution from z=0. in particular, the highs/n mid-ir spectrum of smm j163554.2+661225 agrees remarkably well withlow--redshift, lower--luminosity templates. we compare the rest-frame 8 micronand total infrared luminosities of star--forming galaxies, and find that thebehavior of this ratio with total ir luminosity has evolved modestly from z=2to z=0. since the high aromatic--to--continuum flux ratios in these galaxiesrule out a dominant contribution by agn, this finding implies systematicevolution in the structure and/or metallicity of infrared sources withredshift. it also has implications for the estimates of star forming ratesinferred from 24 micron measurements, in the sense that at z ~2, a givenobserved frame 24 micron luminosity corresponds to a lower bolometricluminosity than would be inferred from low-redshift templates of similarluminosity at the corresponding rest wavelength.

1207.2174	discovery of "warm dust" galaxies in clusters at z~0.3: evidence for  stripping of cool dust in the dense environment?	using far-infrared imaging from the "herschel lensing survey", we derive dustproperties of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster member galaxies within twomassive systems at z~0.3: the merging bullet cluster and the more relaxedms2137.3-2353. most star-forming cluster sources (~90%) have characteristicdust temperatures similar to local field galaxies of comparable infrared (ir)luminosity (t_dust ~ 30k). several sub-lirg (l_ir &lt; 10^11 l_sun) bullet clustermembers are much warmer (t_dust &gt; 37k) with far-infrared spectral energydistribution (sed) shapes resembling lirg-type local templates. x-ray andmid-infrared data suggest that obscured active galactic nuclei do notcontribute significantly to the infrared flux of these "warm dust" galaxies.sources of comparable ir-luminosity and dust temperature are not observed inthe relaxed cluster ms2137, although the significance is too low to speculateon an origin involving recent cluster merging. "warm dust" galaxies are,however, statistically rarer in field samples (&gt; 3sigma), indicating that theresponsible mechanism may relate to the dense environment. the spatialdistribution of these sources is similar to the whole far-infrared brightpopulation, i.e. preferentially located in the cluster periphery, although thegalaxy hosts tend towards lower stellar masses (m_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun). we proposedust stripping and heating processes which could be responsible for theunusually warm characteristic dust temperatures. a normal star-forming galaxywould need 30-50% of its dust removed (preferentially stripped from the outerreaches, where dust is typically cooler) to recover a sed similar to a "warmdust" galaxy. these progenitors would not require a higher ir-luminosity ordust mass than the currently observed normal star-forming population.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1211.6659	evidence for co shock excitation in ngc 6240 from herschel spire  spectroscopy	we present herschel spire fts spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infraredgalaxy ngc 6240. in total 20 lines are detected, including co j=4-3 throughj=13-12, 6 h2o rotational lines, and [ci] and [nii] fine-structure lines. theco to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in ngc 6240 than mrk 231.although the co ladders of ngc 6240 and mrk 231 are very similar, uv and/orx-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gasin ngc 6240. we applied both c and j shock models to the h2 v=1-0 s(1) andv=2-1 s(1) lines and the co rotational ladder. the co ladder is best reproducedby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_h=5 *10^4 cm^-3. we find that the solution best fitting the h2 lines is degenerate:the shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1and n_h=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. the h2 lines thus need a much morepowerful shock than the co lines. we deduce that most of the gas is currentlymoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction(&lt; 1 percent) of the ism is exposed to the high velocity shocks. this impliesthat the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. we argue that ahigh co line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

1212.1567	the excitation of near-infrared h2 emission in ngc 253	because of its large angular size and proximity to the milky way, ngc 253, anarchetypal starburst galaxy, provides an excellent laboratory to study theintricacies of this intense episode of star formation. we aim to characterizethe excitation mechanisms driving the emission in ngc 253. specifically we aimto distinguish between shock excitation and uv excitation as the dominantdriving mechanism, using br\gamma, h_2 and [feii] as diagnostic emission linetracers. using sinfoni observations, we create linemaps of br\gamma,[feii]_{1.64}, and all detected h_2 transitions. by using symmetry arguments ofthe gas and stellar gas velocity field, we find a kinematic center in agreementwith previous determinations. the ratio of the 2-1 s(1) to 1-0 s(1) h_2transitions can be used as a diagnostic to discriminate between shock andfluorescent excitation. using the 1-0 s(1)/2-1 s(1) line ratio as well asseveral other h_2 line ratios and the morphological comparison between h_2 andbr\gamma and [feii], we find that excitation from uv photons is the dominantexcitation mechanisms throughout ngc 253. we employ a diagnostic energy leveldiagram to quantitatively differentiate between mechanisms. we compare theobserved energy level diagrams to pdr and shock models and find that in mostregions and over the galaxy as a whole, fluorescent excitation is the dominantmechanism exciting the h_2 gas. we also place an upper limit of the percentageof shock excited h_2 at 29%. we find that uv radiation is the dominantexcitation mechanism for the h_2 emission. the h_2 emission does not correlatewell with br\gamma but closely traces the pah emission, showing that not onlyis h_2 fluorescently excited, but it is predominately excited by slightly lowermass stars than o stars which excite br\gamma, such as b stars.

1401.4924	radiative and mechanical feedback into the molecular gas of ngc 253	starburst galaxies are undergoing intense periods of star formation.understanding the heating and cooling mechanisms in these galaxies can give usinsight to the driving mechanisms that fuel the starburst. molecular emissionlines play a crucial role in the cooling of the excited gas. with spire on theherschel space observatory we have observed the rich molecular spectrum towardsthe central region of ngc 253. co transitions from j=4-3 to 13-12 are observedand together with low-j line fluxes from ground based observations, these linestrace the excitation of co. by studying the co excitation ladder and comparingthe intensities to models, we investigate whether the gas is excited by uvradiation, x-rays, cosmic rays, or turbulent heating. comparing the $^{12}$coand $^{13}$co observations to large velocity gradient models and pdr models wefind three main ism phases. we estimate the density, temperature,and masses ofthese ism phases. by adding $^{13}$co, hcn, and hnc line intensities, we areable to constrain these degeneracies and determine the heating sources. thefirst ism phase responsible for the low-j co lines is excited by pdrs, but thesecond and third phases, responsible for the mid to high-j co transitions,require an additional heating source. we find three possible combinations ofmodels that can reproduce our observed molecular emission. although we cannotdetermine which of these are preferable, we can conclude that mechanicalheating is necessary to reproduce the observed molecular emission and cosmicray heating is a negligible heating source. we then estimate the mass of eachism phase; $6\times 10^7$ m$_\odot$ for phase 1 (low-j co lines), $3\times10^7$ m$_\odot$ for phase 2 (mid-j co lines), and $9\times 10^6$ m$_\odot$ forphase 3 (high-j co lines) for a total system mass of $1\times10^{8}$ m$_\odot$.

1412.0668	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: near-infrared morphologies and stellar sizes	we analyse hst wfc3/$h_{160}$-band observations of a sample of 48alma-detected submillimeter galaxies (smgs) in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth field, to study their stellar morphologies and sizes. we detect79$\pm$17% of the smgs in the $h_{160}$-band imaging with a median sensitivityof 27.8 mag, and most (80%) of the non-detections are smgs with 870$\mu$mfluxes of $s_{870} &lt; $3 mjy. with a surface brightness limit of $\mu_h \sim $26mag arcsec$^{-2}$, we find that 82$\pm$9% of the $h_{160}$-band detected smgsat $z =$ 1-3 appear to have disturbed morphologies, meaning they are visuallyclassified as either irregulars or interacting systems, or both. by determininga s\'ersic fit to the $h_{160}$ surface-brightness profiles we derive a medians\'ersic index of $n = $1.2$\pm$0.3 and a median half-light radius of $r_e =$4.4$^{+1.1}_{-0.5}$ kpc for our smgs at $z = $1-3. we also find significantdisplacements between the positions of the $h_{160}$-component and 870$\mu$memission in these systems, suggesting that the dusty star-burst regions andless-obscured stellar distribution are not co-located. we find significantdifferences in the sizes and the s\'ersic index between our $z = $2-3 smgs and$z \sim $2 quiescent galaxies, suggesting a major transformation of the stellarlight profile is needed in the quenching processes if smgs are progenitors ofthe red-and-dead $z\sim$2 galaxies. given the short-lived nature of smgs, wepostulate that the majority of the $z = $2-3 smgs with $s_{870} \gtrsim $2 mjyare early/mid-stage major mergers.

1501.02985	the herschel comprehensive (u)lirg emission survey (hercules): co  ladders, fine structure lines, and neutral gas cooling	(ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ((u)lirgs) are objects characterized bytheir extreme infrared (8-1000 $\mu$m) luminosities ($l_{lirg}&gt;10^{11}$l$_\odot$ and $l_{ulirg}&gt;10^{12}$ l$_\odot$). the herschel comprehensive ulirgemission survey (hercules; pi van der werf) presents a representativeflux-limited sample of 29 (u)lirgs that spans the full luminosity range ofthese objects (10$^{11}\leq l_\odot \geq10^{13}$). with the \emph{herschelspace observatory}, we observe [cii] 157 $\mu$m, [oi] 63 $\mu$m, and [oi] 145$\mu$m line emission with pacs, co j=4-3 through j=13-12, [ci] 370 $\mu$m, and[ci] 609 $\mu$m with spire, and low-j co transitions with ground-basedtelescopes. the co ladders of the sample are separated into three classes basedon their excitation level. in 13 of the galaxies, the [oi] 63 $\mu$m emissionline is self absorbed. comparing the co excitation to the iras 60/100 $\mu$mratio and to far infrared luminosity, we find that the co excitation is morecorrelated to the far infrared colors. we present cooling budgets for thegalaxies and find fine-structure line flux deficits in the [cii], [siii], [oi],and [ci] lines in the objects with the highest far ir fluxes, but do notobserve this for co $4\leq j_{upp}\leq13$. in order to study the heating of themolecular gas, we present a combination of three diagnostic quantities to helpdetermine the dominant heating source. using the co excitation, the co j=1-0linewidth, and the agn contribution, we conclude that galaxies with large colinewidths always have high-excitation co ladders, and often low agncontributions, suggesting that mechanical heating is important.

1505.04705	high-resolution imaging of the molecular outflows in two mergers:  iras17208-0014 and ngc1614	galaxy evolution scenarios predict that the feedback of star formation andnuclear activity (agn) can drive the transformation of gas-rich spiral mergersinto ulirgs, and, eventually, lead to the build-up of qso/elliptical hosts. westudy the role that star formation and agn feedback have in launching andmaintaining the molecular outflows in two starburst-dominated advanced mergers,ngc1614 and iras17208-0014, by analyzing the distribution and kinematics oftheir molecular gas reservoirs. we have used the pdbi array to image with highspatial resolution (0.5"-1.2") the co(1-0) and co(2-1) line emissions inngc1614 and iras17208-0014, respectively. the velocity fields of the gas areanalyzed and modeled to find the evidence of molecular outflows in thesesources and characterize the mass, momentum and energy of these components.while most (&gt;95%) of the co emission stems from spatially-resolved(~2-3kpc-diameter) rotating disks, we also detect in both mergers the emissionfrom high-velocity line wings that extend up to +-500-700km/s, well beyond theestimated virial range associated with rotation and turbulence. the kinematicmajor axis of the line wing emission is tilted by ~90deg in ngc1614 and by~180deg in iras17208-0014 relative to their respective rotating disk majoraxes. these results can be explained by the existence of non-coplanar molecularoutflows in both systems. in stark contrast with ngc1614, where star formationalone can drive its molecular outflow, the mass, energy and momentum budgetrequirements of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 can be best accountedfor by the existence of a so far undetected (hidden) agn of l_agn~7x10^11l_sun. the geometry of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 suggests thatthe outflow is launched by a non-coplanar disk that may be associated with aburied agn in the western nucleus.

(2002, paper i): eight of them were identifiedas stars, one is definitely an agn, a second seems likely to be an agn, too,while the remaining 22 appear to be normal spiral or starburst galaxies. usingmodel spectral energy distributions (seds) of similar galaxies, we comparemethods for estimating the star formation rates (sfrs) in these objects,finding that an estimator based on integrated (3-1000um) ir luminosityreproduces the model sfrs best. applying this estimator to model fits to theseds of our 22 spiral and starburst galaxies, we find that they are formingstars at rates of ~1-100 m_sol/yr, with a median value of ~40m_sol/yr, assumingan einstein - de sitter universe with a hubble constant of 50 km/s/mpc, andstar formation taking place according to a salpeter (1955) imf across the massrange 0.1-100m_sol. we split the redshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.6 into two equal-volumebins to compute raw estimates of the star formation rate density contributed bythese sources, assuming the same cosmology and imf as above and computingerrors based on estimated uncertainties in the sfrs of individual galaxies. wecompare these results with other estimates of the sfr density made with thesame assumptions, showing them to be consistent with the results of flores etal. (1999) from their iso survey of the cfrs 1415+52 field. however, therelatively small volume of our survey means that our sfr density estimatessuffer from a large sampling variance, implying that our results, bythemselves, do not place tight constraints on the global mean sfr density.

0812.1000	the mass of the black hole in centaurus a from sinfoni ao-assisted  integral-field observations of stellar kinematics	we present a determination of the mass of the supermassive black hole (bh)and the nuclear stellar orbital distribution of the elliptical galaxy centaurusa (ngc5128) using high-resolution integral-field observations of the stellarkinematics. the observations were obtained with sinfoni at the eso very largetelescope in the near-infrared (k-band), using adaptive optics to correct forthe blurring effect of the earth atmosphere. the data have a spatial resolutionof 0.17" fwhm and high s/n&gt;80 per spectral pixel so that the shape of thestellar line-of-sight velocity-distribution can be reliably extracted. wedetect clear low-level stellar rotation, which is counter-rotating with respectto the gas. we fit axisymmetric three-integral dynamical models to the data todetermine the best fitting values for the bh mass m_bh=(5.5+/-3.0)*10^7 msun(3sigma errors) and (m/l)_k=(0.65+/-0.15) in solar units. these values are inexcellent agreement with previous determinations from the gas kinematics, andin particular with our own published values, extracted from the same data. thisprovides one of the cleanest gas versus stars comparisons of bh determination,due to the use of integral-field data for both dynamical tracers and due to avery well resolved bh sphere of influence r_bh~0.70". we derive an accurateprofile of the orbital anisotropy and we carefully test its reliability usingspherical jeans models with radially varying anisotropy. we find an increase inthe tangential anisotropy close to the bh, but the spatial extent of thiseffect seems restricted to the size of r_bh instead of that r_b~3.9" of thecore in the surface brightness profile, contrary to detailed predictions ofcurrent simulations of the binary bh scouring mechanism. more realisticsimulations would be required to draw conclusions from this observation.

0812.3409	new co detections of lensed submillimeter galaxies in a2218: probing  molecular gas in the lirg regime at high redshift	context: submillimeter galaxies (smgs) are distant, dusty galaxies undergoingstar formation at prodigious rates. recently there has been major progress inunderstanding the nature of the bright smgs (i.e. s(850um)&gt;5mjy). the samplesfor the fainter smgs are small and are currently in a phase of being built upthrough identification studies. aims: we study the molecular gas content in twosmgs, smmj163555 and smmj163541, at z=1.034 and z=3.187 with unlensed submmfluxes of 0.4mjy and 6.0mjy. both smgs are gravitationally lensed by theforeground cluster a2218. methods: iram plateau de bure interferometryobservations at 3mm were obtained for the lines co(2-1) for smmj163555 andco(3-2) for smmj163541. additionally we obtained co(4-3) for the candidatez=4.048 smmj163556 with an unlensed submm flux of 2.7mjy. results: co(2-1) wasdetected for smmj163555 at z=1.0313 with an integrated line intensity of1.2+-0.2jy km/s and a line width of 410+-120 km/s. from this a gas mass of1.6x10^9 msun is derived and a star formation efficiency of 440lsun/msun isestimated. co(3-2) was detected for smmj163541 at z=3.1824, possibly with asecond component at z=3.1883, with an integrated line intensity of 1.0+-0.1 jykm/s and a line width of 280+-50 km/s. from this a gas mass of 2.2x10^10 msunis derived and a star formation efficiency of 1000 lsun/msun is estimated. forsmmj163556 the co(4-3) is undetected within the redshift range 4.035-4.082 downto a sensitivity of 0.15 jy km/s. conclusions: our co line observations confirmthe optical redshifts for smmj163555 and smmj163541. the co line luminosityl'_co for both galaxies is consistent with the l_fir-l'_co relation. smmj163555has the lowest fir luminosity of all smgs with a known redshift and is one ofthe few high redshift lirgs whose properties can be estimated prior to alma.
