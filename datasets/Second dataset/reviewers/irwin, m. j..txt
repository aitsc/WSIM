0901.0820	a keck/deimos spectroscopic survey of the faint m31 satellites and xv  and and xvi	we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discoveredm31 satellites and xv and and xvi, lying at projected distances from the centreof m31 of 93 and 130 kpc respectively. these satellites lie to the south ofm31, in regions of the stellar halo which wide field imaging has revealed asrelative voids (compared to the degree-scale coherent stream-like structures).using the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph mounted on the keck iitelescope, we have defined probable members of these satellites, for which wederive radial velocities as precise as ~6 km/s down to i~21.5. while thedistance to and xvi remains the same as previously reported (525pm50 kpc), wehave demonstrated that the brightest three stars previously used to define thetip of the red giant branch (trgb) in and xv are in fact galactic, and and xvis actually likely to be much more distant at 770pm70 kpc (compared to theprevious 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from mv -9.4 to mv~-9.8. the andxv velocity dispersion is resolved with vr =-339+7-6 km/s and sigma-v = 11+7-5km/s. the and xvi dispersion is not quite resolved at 1sigma with vr =-385+5-6km/s and sigma-v = 0+10-indef km/s. using the photometry of the confirmedmember stars, we find metallicities of and xv (median [fe/h]=-1.58, interquar-tile range +-0.08), and and xvi (median [fe/h]=-2.23, interquartile range+-0.12). stacking the spectra of the member stars, we find spectroscopic[fe/h]=-1.8 (-2.1) for and xv (and xvi), with a uncertainty of ~0.2 dex in bothcases. our measure- ments of and xv reasonably resolve its mass (~10^8 msun)and suggest a polar orbit, while the velocity of and xvi suggests it isapproaching the m31 escape velocity given its large m31-centric distance.

0903.0818	segue 2: a prototype of the population of satellites of satellites	we announce the discovery of a new milky way satellite segue 2 found in thedata of the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue).we followed this up with deeper imaging and spectroscopy on the multiple mirrortelescope. from this, we derive a luminosity of m_v = -2.5, a half-light radiusof 34 pc and a systemic velocity of -40$ km/s. our mmt data also providesevidence for a stream around segue 2 at a similar heliocentric velocity, andthe segue data show that it is also present in neighboring fields. we resolvethe velocity dispersion of segue 2 as 3.4 km/s and the possible stream as about7 km/s. this object shows points of comparison with other recent discoveries,segue 1, boo ii and coma. we speculate that all four objects may berepresentatives of a population of satellites of satellites -- survivors ofaccretion events that destroyed their larger but less dense parents. they arelikely to have formed at redshifts z &gt; 10 and are good candidates for fossilsof the reionization epoch.

0706.2687	the luminosity function of the milky way satellites	we quantify the detectability of stellar milky way satellites in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) data release 5. we show that the effective searchvolumes for the recently discovered sdss--satellites depend strongly on theirluminosity, with their maximum distance, $d_{max}$, substantially smaller thanthe milky way halo's virial radius. calculating the maximum accessible volume,$v_{max}$, for all faint detected satellites, allows the calculation of theluminosity function for milky way satellite galaxies, accounting quantitativelyfor their detectability. we find that the number density of satellite galaxiescontinues to rise towards low luminosities, but may flatten at $m_v \sim -5$;within the uncertainties, the luminosity function can be described by a singlepower law $dn/dm_{v}= 10 \times 10^{0.1 (m_v+5)}$, spanning luminosities from$m_v=-2$ all the way to the luminosity of the large magellanic cloud. comparingthese results to several semi-analytic galaxy formation models, we find thattheir predictions differ significantly from the data: either the shape of theluminosity function, or the surface brightness distributions of the models, donot match.

0903.3258	an hst/acs view of the inhomogeneous outer halo of m31	we present a high precision photometric view of the stellar populations inthe outer halo of m31, using data taken with the hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys (hst/acs). we analyse the field populationsadjacent to 11 luminous globular clusters which sample the galactocentricradial range 18 &lt; r &lt; 100 kpc and reach a photometric depth of ~2.5 magnitudesbelow the horizontal branch (m_f814w ~27 mag). the colour-magnitude diagrams(cmds) are well populated out to ~60 kpc and exhibit relatively metal-rich redgiant branches, with the densest fields also showing evidence for prominent redclumps. we use the dartmouth isochrones to construct metallicity distributionfunctions (mdfs) which confirm the presence of dominant populations with&lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -0.6 to -1.0 dex and considerable metallicity dispersions of 0.2 to0.3 dex (assuming a 10 gyr population and scaled-solar abundances). the averagemetallicity over the range 30 - 60 kpc is [fe/h] = -0.8 +/- 0.14 dex, with noevidence for a significant radial gradient. metal-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt;= -1.3)typically account for &lt; 10-20 % of the population in each field, irrespectiveof radius. assuming our fields are unbiased probes of the dominant stellarpopulations in these parts, we find that the m31 outer halo remainsconsiderably more metal-rich than that of the milky way out to at least 60 kpc.

0904.0530	blue straggler stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ii: sculptor and  fornax	the existence of blue straggler stars (bsss) in dwarf spheroidal galaxies(dsphs) is still an open question. in fact, many bss candidates have beenobserved in the local group dsphs, but it is unclear whether they are real bsssor young stars. shedding light on the nature of these bss candidates iscrucial, in order to understand the star formation history of dsphs. in thispaper, we consider bss candidates in sculptor and fornax. in fornax there arestrong hints that the bss population is contaminated by young stars, whereas insculptor there is no clear evidence of recent star formation. we derive theradial and luminosity distribution of bss candidates from wide field imagingdata extending beyond the nominal tidal radius of these galaxies. theobservations are compared with the radial distribution of bsss expected fromdynamical simulations. in sculptor the radial distribution of bss candidates isconsistent with that of red horizontal branch (rhb) stars and is in agreementwith theoretical expectations for bsss generated via mass transfer in binaries.on the contrary, in fornax the radial distribution of bss candidates is moreconcentrated than that of all the considered stellar populations. this resultsupports the hypothesis that most of bss candidates in fornax are young starsand is consistent with previous studies.

0904.1012	kinematics of sdss subdwarfs: structure and substructure of the milky  way halo	we construct a new sample of ~1700 solar neighbourhood halo subdwarfs fromthe sloan digital sky survey, selected using a reduced proper motion diagram.radial velocities come from the sdss spectra and proper motions from thelight-motion curve catalogue of bramich et al. (2008). using a photometricparallax relation to estimate distances gives us the full phase-spacecoordinates. typical velocity errors are in the range 30-50 km/s. this halosample is one of the largest constructed to-date and the disc contamination isat a level of &lt; 1 per cent. this enables us to calculate the halo velocitydispersion to excellent accuracy. we find that the velocity dispersion tensoris aligned in spherical polar coordinates and that (sigma_r, sigma_phi,sigma_theta) = (143 \pm 2, 82 \pm 2, 77 \pm 2) km/s. the stellar halo exhibitsno net rotation, although the distribution of v_phi shows tentative evidencefor asymmetry. the kinematics are consistent with a mildly flattened stellardensity falling with distance like r^{-3.75}. using the full phase-spacecoordinates, we look for signs of kinematic substructure in the stellar halo.we find evidence for four discrete overdensities localised in angular momentumand suggest that they may be possible accretion remnants. the most prominent isthe solar neighbourhood stream previously identified by helmi et al. (1999),but the remaining three are new. one of these overdensities is potentiallyassociated with a group of four globular clusters (ngc5466, ngc6934, m2 andm13) and raises the possibility that these could have been accreted as part ofa much larger progenitor.

0706.3311	blue straggler stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies	blue straggler star (bss) candidates have been observed in all old dwarfspheroidal galaxies (dsphs), however whether or not they are authentic bsss oryoung stars has been a point of debate. to both address this issue and obtain abetter understanding of the formation of bsss in different environments we haveanalysed a sample of bss candidates in two nearby galactic dsphs, draco andursa minor. we have determined their radial and luminosity distributions fromwide field multicolour imaging data extending beyond the tidal radii of bothgalaxies.  bss candidates are uniformly distributed through the host galaxy, whereas ayoung population is expected to show a more clumpy distribution. furthermore,the observed radial distribution of bsss, normalized to both red giant branch(rgb) and horizontal branch (hb) stars, is almost flat, with a slight decreasetowards the centre. such a distribution is at odds with the predictions for ayoung stellar population, which should be more concentrated. instead, it isconsistent with model predictions for bss formation by mass transfer inbinaries (mt-bsss). such results, although not decisive, suggest that thesecandidates are indeed bsss and that mt-bsss form in the same way in draco andursa minor as in globular clusters. this favours the conclusion that draco andursa minor are truly 'fossil' galaxies, where star formation ceased completelymore than 8 billion years ago.

0906.0498	substructure revealed by rr lyraes in sdss stripe 82	we present an analysis of the substructure revealed by 407 rr lyraes in sloandigital sky survey (sdss) stripe 82. period estimates are determined to highaccuracy using a string-length method. a subset of 178 rr lyraes withspectrally derived metallicities are employed to derivemetallicity-period-amplitude relations, which are then used to findmetallicities and distances for the entire sample. the rr lyraes lie between 5and 115 kpc from the galactic center. they are divided into subsets of 316 rrabtypes and 91 rrc types based on their period, colour and metallicity. thedensity distribution is not smooth, but dominated by clumps and substructure.samples of 55 and 237 rr lyraes associated with the sagittarius stream and thehercules-aquila cloud respectively are identified. hence, ~ 70 % of the rrlyraes in stripe 82 belong to known substructure. there is a sharp break in thedensity distribution at galactocentric radii of 40 kpc, reflecting the factthat the dominant substructure in stripe 82 - the hercules-aquila cloud and thesagittarius stream - lies within 40 kpc. in fact, almost 60 % of all the rrlyraes in stripe 82 are associated with the hercules-aquila cloud alone, whichemphasises its pre-eminence. additionally, evidence of a new and distantsubstructure - the pisces overdensity - is found, consisting of 28 faint rrlyraes centered on galactic coordinates (80 deg, -55 deg) and with distances of~ 80 kpc. the total stellar mass in the pisces overdensity is ~10000 solarmasses and its metallicity is [fe/h] ~ -1.5.

0909.1456	deep gemini/gmos imaging of an extremely isolated globular cluster in  the local group	we report on deep imaging of a remote m31 globular cluster, mgc1, obtainedwith gemini/gmos. our colour-magnitude diagram for this object extends ~5magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch and exhibits featuresconsistent with an ancient metal-poor stellar population, including a long,well-populated horizontal branch. the red giant branch locus suggests mgc1 hasa metal abundance [m/h] ~ -2.3. we measure the distance to mgc1 and find thatit lies ~160 kpc in front of m31 with a distance modulus of 23.95 +/- 0.06.combined with its large projected separation of 117 kpc from m31 this implies adeprojected radius of rgc = 200 +/- 20 kpc, rendering it the most isolatedknown globular cluster in the local group by some considerable margin. weconstruct a radial brightness profile for mgc1 and show that it is bothcentrally compact and rather luminous, with mv = -9.2. remarkably, the clusterprofile shows no evidence for a tidal limit and we are able to trace it to aradius of at least 450 pc, and possibly as far as ~900 pc. the profile exhibitsa power-law fall-off with exponent -2.5, breaking to -3.5 in its outermostparts. this core-halo structure is broadly consistent with expectations derivedfrom numerical models, and suggests that mgc1 has spent many gigayears inisolation.

0909.3857	the structure of the outer galactic disc as revealed by iphas early a  stars	this study is an investigation of the stellar density profile of the galacticdisc in the anticentre direction. we select over 40,000 early a stars fromiphas photometry in the galactic longitude range 160 &lt; l &lt; 200 close to theequatorial plane (-1 &lt; b &lt; +1). we then compare their observedreddening-corrected apparent magnitude distribution with simulated photometryobtained from parameterised models in order to set constraints on theanticentre stellar density profile. by selecting a stars, we are appraising theproperties of a population only ~100 myrs old. we find the stellar densityprofile of young stars is well fit to an exponential with length scale of (3020\pm 120_{statistical} \pm 180_{systematic}) pc, which is comparable to thatobtained in earlier studies, out to a galactocentric radius of r_t = (13.0 \pm0.5_{statistical} \pm 0.6_{systematic}) kpc. at larger radii the rate ofdecline appears to increase with the scale length dropping to (1200 \pm300_{statistical} \pm 70_{systematic}) pc. this result amounts to a refinementof the conclusions reached in previous studies that the stellar density profileis abruptly truncated. the iphas a star data are not compatible with modelsthat propose a sudden change in metallicity at r_g = 10 kpc.

0911.1365	a keck/deimos spectroscopic survey of the faint m31 satellites and ix,  and xi, and xii, and and xiii	we present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint m31 satellitegalaxies, andxi and andxiii, and a reanalysis of existing spectroscopic datafor two further faint companions, and ix and andxii. by combining data obtainedusing the deimos spectrograph mounted on the keck ii telescope with deepphotometry from the suprime-cam instrument on subaru, we have calculated globalproperties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicites andhalf-light radii.we find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([fe/h] -2 bothphotometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and assuch, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationshipestablished with brighter dwarfs. we are unable to resolve a dispersion for andxi due to small sample size and low s/n, but we set a one sigma upper limit ofsigma-v &lt;5 km/s. for and ix, and xii and and xiii we resolve velocitydispersions of v=4.5 (+3.4,-3.2), 2.6(+5.1,-2.6) and 9.7(+8.9,-4.5) km/s, andderive masses within the half light radii of 6.2(+5.3,-5.1)x10^6 msun, 2.4(+6.5,-2.4)x10^6 msun and 1.1(+1.4,-0.7)x10^7 msun respectively. we discusseach satellite in the context of the mateo relations for dwarf spheroidalgalaxies, and the universal halo profiles established for milky way dwarfs(walker et al. 2009). for both galaxies, this sees them fall below theuniversal halo profiles of walker et al. (2009). when combined with thefindings of mcconnachie &amp; irwin (2006a), which reveal that the m31 satellitesare twice as extended (in terms of both half-light and tidal radii) as theirmilky way counterparts, these results suggest that the satellite population ofthe andromeda system could inhabit halos that are significantly different fromthose of the milky way in terms of their central densities (abridged).

1103.2121	the scatter about the "universal" dwarf spheroidal mass profile: a  kinematic study of the m31 satellites, and v and and vi	while the satellites of the milky way (mw) have been shown to be largelyconsistent in terms of their mass contained within one half--light radius(m_{half}) with a "universal" mass profile, a number of m31 satellites arefound to be inconsistent with such relations, and seem kinematically colder intheir central regions than their mw cousins. in this work, we present newkinematic and updated structural properties for two m31 dsphs, and v and and viusing data from the keck low resolution imaging spectrograph (lris) and thedeep imaging multi-object spectrograph (deimos) instruments and the subarusuprime-cam imager. we measure systemic velocities of v_r=-393.1+/-4.2km/s and-344.8+/-2.5km/s, and dispersions of sigma_v=11.5{+5.3}{-4.4}km/s andsigma_v=9.4{+3.2}{-2.4}km/s for and v and and vi respectively, meaning thesetwo objects are consistent with the trends in sigma_v and r_{half} set by theirmw counterparts. we also investigate the nature of this scatter about the mwdsph mass profiles for the "classical" (i.e. m_v&lt;-8) mw and m31 dsphs. whencomparing both the "classical" mw and m31 dsphs to the best--fit mass profilesin the size--velocity dispersion plane, we find general scatter in both thepositive (i.e. hotter) and negative (i.e. colder) directions from theseprofiles. however, barring one exception (cvni) only the m31 dsphs are found toscatter towards a colder regime, and, excepting the and i dsph, only mw objectsscatter to hotter dispersions. we also note that the scatter for the combinedpopulation is greater than expected from measurement errors alone. we assessthis divide in the context of the differing disc-to-halo mass (i.e. stars andbaryons to total virial mass) ratios of the two hosts and argue that theunderlying mass profiles for dsphs differ from galaxy to galaxy, and aremodified by the baryonic component of the host.

1107.3206	a bayesian approach to locating the red giant branch tip magnitude (part  i)	we present a new approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch(trgb) which, as we show, works robustly even on sparsely populated targets.moreover, the approach is highly adaptable to the available data for thestellar population under study, with prior information readily incorporableinto the algorithm. the uncertainty in the derived distances is also madetangible and easily calculable from posterior probability distributions. weprovide an outline of the development of the algorithm and present the resultsof tests designed to characterize its capabilities and limitations. we thenapply the new algorithm to three m31 satellites: andromeda i, andromeda ii andthe fainter andromeda xxiii, using data from the pan-andromeda archaeologicalsurvey (pandas), and derive their distances as $731^{(+ 5) + 18}_{(- 4) - 17}$kpc, $634^{(+ 2) + 15}_{(- 2) - 14}$ kpc and $733^{(+ 13)+ 23}_{(- 11) - 22}$kpc respectively, where the errors appearing in parentheses are the componentsintrinsic to the method, while the larger values give the errors afteraccounting for additional sources of error. these results agree well with thebest distance determinations in the literature and provide the smallestuncertainties to date. this paper is an introduction to the workings andcapabilities of our new approach in its basic form, while a follow-up papershall make full use of the method's ability to incorporate priors and use theresulting algorithm to systematically obtain distances to all of m31'ssatellites identifiable in the pandas survey area.

1201.2408	the star formation &amp; chemical evolution history of the sculptor dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	we have combined deep photometry in the b,v and i bands from ctio/mosaic ofthe sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, going down to the oldest main sequenceturn-offs, with spectroscopic metallicity distributions of red giant branchstars. this allows us to obtain the most detailed and complete star formationhistory to date, as well as an accurate timescale for chemical enrichment. thestar formation history shows that sculptor is dominated by old ($&gt;$10 gyr),metal-poor stars, but that younger, more metal-rich populations are alsopresent. using star formation histories determined at different radii from thecentre we show that sculptor formed stars with an increasing centralconcentration with time. the old, metal-poor populations are present at allradii, while more metal-rich, younger stars are more centrally concentrated. wefind that within an elliptical radius of 1 degree, or 1.5 kpc from the centre,a total mass in stars of 7.8$\times10^{6}$ m$_{\odot}$ was formed, between 14and 7 gyr ago, with a peak at 13$-$14 gyr ago. we use the detailed starformation history to determine age estimates for individual red giant branchstars with high resolution spectroscopic abundances. thus, for the first time,we can directly determine detailed timescales for the evolution of individualchemical elements. we find that the trends in alpha-elements match what isexpected from an extended, relatively uninterrupted period of star formationcontinuing for 6$-$7 gyr. the knee in the alpha-element distribution occurs atan age of 10.9$\pm$1gyr, suggesting that sne ia enrichment began$\approx2\pm$1gyr after the start of star formation in sculptor.

1202.2100	the structure of star clusters in the outer halo of m31	we present a structural analysis of halo star clusters in m31 based on deephubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) imaging. theclusters in our sample span a range in galactocentric projected distance from13 to 100 kpc and thus reside in rather remote environments. ten of theclusters are classical globulars, while four are from the huxor et al. (2005,2008) population of extended, old clusters. for most clusters, contamination bym31 halo stars is slight, and so the profiles can be mapped reliably to largeradial distances from their centres. we find that the extended clusters arewell fit by analytic king (1962) profiles with ~20 parsec core radii and ~100parsec photometric tidal radii, or by sersic profiles of index ~1 (i.e.approximately exponential). most of the classical globulars also have largephotometric tidal radii in the range 50-100 parsec, however the king profile isa less good fit in some cases, particularly at small radii. we find 60% of theclassical globular clusters exhibit cuspy cores which are reasonably welldescribed by sersic profiles of index ~2-6. our analysis also reinforces thefinding that luminous classical globulars, with half-light radii &lt;10 parsec,are present out to radii of at least 100 kpc in m31, which is in contrast tothe situation in the milky way where such clusters (other than the unusualobject ngc 2419) are absent beyond 40 kpc.

1202.6333	initial data release of the kepler-int survey	this paper describes the first data release of the kepler-int survey (kis),that covers a 116 deg2 region of the cygnus and lyra constellations. the keplerfield is the target of the most intensive search for transiting planets todate. despite the fact that the kepler mission provides superior time seriesphotometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability, itsfield lacks optical photometry complete to the confusion limit of the keplerinstrument necessary for selecting various classes of targets. for this reason,we follow the observing strategy and data reduction method used in the iphasand uvex galactic plane surveys in order to produce a deep optical survey ofthe kepler field. this initial release concerns data taken between may andaugust 2011, using the isaac newton telescope on the island of la palma. fourbroadband filters were used, u, g, r, i, as well as one narrowband one, halpha,reaching down to a 10-sigma limit of around 20th mag in the vega system.observations covering around 50 deg2, thus about half of the field, passed ourquality control thresholds and constitute this first data release. we derive aglobal photometric calibration by placing the kis magnitudes as close aspossible to the kepler input catalog (kic) photometry. the initial data releasecatalogue containing around 6 million sources from all the good photometricfields is available for download from the kis webpage, as well as via mast.

1203.4491	manganese in dwarf spheroidal galaxies	we provide manganese abundances (corrected for the effect of the hyperfinestructure) for a large number of stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxiessculptor and fornax, and for a smaller number in the carina and sextans dsphgalaxies. abundances had already been determined for a number of other elementsin these galaxies, including alpha and iron-peak ones, which allowed us tobuild [mn/fe] and [mn/alpha] versus [fe/h] diagrams. the mn abundances implysub-solar [mn/fe] ratios for the stars in all four galaxies examined. insculptor, [mn/fe] stays roughly constant between [fe/h]\sim -1.8 and -1.4 anddecreases at higher iron abundance. in fornax, [mn/fe] does not vary in anysignificant way with [fe/h]. the relation between [mn/alpha] and [fe/h] for thedsph galaxies is clearly systematically offset from that for the milky way,which reflects the different star formation histories of the respectivegalaxies. the [mn/alpha] behavior can be interpreted as a result of themetal-dependent mn yields of type ii and type ia supernovae. we also computedchemical evolution models for star formation histories matching thosedetermined empirically for sculptor, fornax, and carina, and for the mn yieldsof sne ia, which were assumed to be either constant or variable withmetallicity. the observed [mn/fe] versus [fe/h] relation in sculptor, fornax,and carina can be reproduced only by the chemical evolution models that includea metallicity-dependent mn yield from the sne ia.

1205.3177	slicing the monoceros overdensity with suprime-cam	we derive distance, density and metallicity distribution of the stellarmonoceros overdensity (mo) in the outer milky way, based on deep imaging withthe subaru telescope. we applied cmd fitting techniques in three stripes atgalactic longitudes: l=130 deg, 150 deg, 170 deg; and galactic latitudes: +15 &lt;b [deg] &lt; +25 . the mo appears as a wall of stars at a heliocentric distance of~ 10.1\pm0.5 kpc across the observed longitude range with no distance change.the mo stars are more metal rich ([fe/h] ~ -1.0) than the nearby stars at thesame latitude. these data are used to test three different models for theorigin of the mo: a perturbed disc model, which predicts a significant drop indensity adjacent to the mo that is not seen; a basic flared disc model, whichcan give a good match to the density profile but the mo metallicity implies thedisc is too metal rich to source the mo stars; and a tidal stream model, whichbracket the distances and densities we derive for the mo, suggesting that amodel can be found that would fully fit the mo data. further data and modelingwill be required to confirm or rule out the mo feature as a stream or as aflaring of the disc.

1206.5730	dynamics in the satellite system of triangulum: is andxxii a dwarf  satellite of m33?	we present results from a spectroscopic survey of the dwarf spheroidal andxxii and the two extended clusters ec1 and ec2. these three objects arecandidate satellites of the triangulum galaxy, m33, which itself is likely asatellite of m31. we use the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph mounted onthe keck-ii telescope to derive radial velocities for candidate member stars ofthese objects and thereby identify the stars that are most likely actualmembers. eleven most probable stellar members (of 13 candidates) are found forandxxii. we obtain an upper limit of sigma_v &lt; 6.0 km s-1 for the velocitydispersion of andxxii, [fe/h] ~ -1.6 for its metallicity, and 255pc for theplummer radius of its projected density profile. we construct a colourmagnitude diagram for andxxii and identify both the red giant branch and thehorizontal branch. the position of the latter is used to derive a heliocentricdistance to and xxii of 853 pm 26 kpc. the combination of the radial velocity,distance, and angular position of andxxii indicates that it is a strongcandidate for being the first known satellite of m33 and one of the very fewexamples of a galactic satellite of a satellite. n-body simulations imply thatthis conclusion is unchanged even if m31 and m33 had a strong encounter in thepast few gyr. we test the hypothesis that the extended clusters highlighttidally stripped galaxies by searching for an excess cloud of halo-like starsin their vicinity. we find such a cloud for the case of ec1 but not ec2. thethree objects imply a dynamical mass for m33 that is consistent with previousestimates.

1301.7069	precession of the sagittarius stream	using a variety of stellar tracers -- blue horizontal branch stars,main-sequence turn-off stars and red giants -- we follow the path of thesagittarius (sgr) stream across the sky in sloan digital sky survey data. ourstudy presents new sgr debris detections, accurate distances and line-of-sightvelocities that together help to shed new light on the puzzle of the sgr tails.for both the leading and the trailing tail, we trace the points of theirmaximal extent, or apo-centric distances, and find that they lie at $r^l$ =47.8 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc and $r^t$ = 102.5 $\pm$ 2.5 kpc respectively. the angulardifference between the apo-centres is 93.2 $\pm$ 3.5 deg, which is smaller thanpredicted for logarithmic haloes. such differential orbital precession can bemade consistent with models of the milky way in which the dark matter densityfalls more quickly with radius. however, currently, no existing sgr disruptionsimulation can explain the entirety of the observational data. based on itsposition and radial velocity, we show that the unusually large globular clusterngc 2419 can be associated with the sgr trailing stream. we measure theprecession of the orbital plane of the sgr debris in the milky way potentialand show that, surprisingly, sgr debris in the primary (brighter) tails evolvesdifferently to the secondary (fainter) tails, both in the north and the south.

0801.2657	modelling the dynamical evolution of the bootes dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we investigate a wide range of possible evolutionary histories for therecently discovered bootes dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a milky way satellite. bymeans of n-body simulations we follow the evolution of possible progenitorgalaxies of bootes for a variety of orbits in the gravitational potential ofthe milky way. the progenitors considered cover the range from dark-matter-freestar clusters to massive, dark-matter dominated outcomes of cosmologicalsimulations. for each type of progenitor and orbit we compare the observableproperties of the remnant after 10 gyr with those of bootes observed today. ourstudy suggests that the progenitor of bootes must have been, and remains now,dark matter dominated. in general our models are unable to reproduce theobserved high velocity dispersion in bootes without dark matter. our models donot support time-dependent tidal effects as a mechanism able to inflatesignificantly the internal velocity dispersion. as none of our initiallyspherical models is able to reproduce the elongation of bootes, our resultssuggest that the progenitor of bootes may have had some intrinsic flattening.although the focus of the present paper is the bootes dwarf spheroidal, thesemodels may be of general relevance to understanding the structure, stabilityand dark matter content of all dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

1406.0186	the outer halo globular cluster system of m31 - ii. kinematics	we present a detailed kinematic analysis of the outer halo globular cluster(gc) system of m31. our basis for this is a set of new spectroscopicobservations for 78 clusters lying at projected distances between rproj ~20-140kpc from the m31 centre. these are largely drawn from the recent pandasglobular cluster catalogue; 63 of our targets have no previous velocity data.via a bayesian maximum likelihood analysis we find that gcs with rproj &gt; 30 kpcexhibit coherent rotation around the minor optical axis of m31, in the samedirection as more centrally- located gcs, but with a smaller amplitude of86+/-17 km s-1. there is also evidence that the velocity dispersion of theouter halo gc system decreases as a function of projected distance from the m31centre, and that this relation can be well described by a power law of index ~-0.5. the velocity dispersion profile of the outer halo gcs is quite similar tothat of the halo stars, at least out to the radius up to which there isavailable information on the stellar kinematics. we detect and discuss variousvelocity correlations amongst subgroups of gcs that lie on stellar debrisstreams in the m31 halo. many of these subgroups are dynamically cold,exhibiting internal velocity dispersions consistent with zero. simple montecarlo experiments imply that such configurations are unlikely to form bychance, adding weight to the notion that a significant fraction of the outerhalo gcs in m31 have been accreted alongside their parent dwarf galaxies. wealso estimate the m31 mass within 200 kpc via the tracer mass estimator,finding (1.2 - 1.6) +/- 0.2 10^{12}m_sun. this quantity is subject toadditional systematic effects due to various limitations of the data, andassumptions built in into the tme. finally, we discuss our results in thecontext of formation scenarios for the m31 halo.

1407.1510	the gaia-eso survey: stellar content and elemental abundances in the  massive cluster ngc 6705	chemically inhomogeneous populations are observed in most globular clusters,but not in open clusters. cluster mass seems to play a key role in theexistence of multiple populations.  studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters isnecessary to better understand the mechanism of their formation and determinethe mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple populations. here westudied ngc6705, that is a young and massive open cluster located towards theinner region of the milky way. this cluster is located inside the solar circle.this makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient. thisstudy makes use of bvi and ri photometry and comparisons with theoreticalisochrones to derive the age of ngc6705. we study the density profile of thecluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. based on abundances ofthe chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of thegaia-eso survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of thered clump stars. radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internalkinematics of the cluster.  the estimated ages range from 250 to 316myr, depending on the adopted stellarmodel. luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of masssegregation. we derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function andfrom the kinematics, finding values between 3700 m$_{\odot}$ and 11 000m$_{\odot}$. after selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities,we obtain a metallicity of [fe/h]=0.10$\pm$0.06 based on 21 candidate members.moreover, ngc6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations oranti-correlations between al, mg, si, and na, that are expected in multiplepopulations. this is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lowerthan the required mass limit proposed in literature to develop multiplepopulations.

1407.3801	combining dark energy survey science verification data with near  infrared data from the eso vista hemisphere survey	we present the combination of optical data from the science verificationphase of the dark energy survey (des) with near infrared data from the esovista hemisphere survey (vhs). the deep optical detections from des are used toextract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower vhs data. joint 7-band($grizyjk$) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg decamfield centred at 02h26m$-$04d36m where the availability of ancillarymulti-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the dataquality. dual photometry increases the number of des galaxies with measured vhsfluxes by a factor of $\sim$4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matchingand results in a $\sim$1.5 mag increase in the 80\% completeness limit of thenir data. almost 70\% of des sources have useful nir flux measurements in thisinitial catalogue. photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxieswith spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited bysmall number statistics, indicate that the vhs data can help reduce thephotometric redshift scatter at both $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1$. we present exampledes+vhs colour selection criteria for high redshift luminous red galaxies(lrgs) at $z\sim0.7$ as well as luminous quasars. using spectroscopicobservations in this field we show that the additional vhs fluxes enable acleaner selection of both populations with $&lt;$10\% contamination from galacticstars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and $&lt;0.5\%$contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmedlrgs. the combined des+vhs dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited fortarget selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

0803.2614	the nature and origin of substructure in the outskirts of m31. i.  surveying the stellar content with hst/acs	we present the largest and most detailed survey to date of the stellarpopulations in the outskirts of m31 based on the analysis of 14 deep hst/acspointings spanning the range 11.5-45.0 kpc. we conduct a quantitativecomparison of the resolved stellar populations in these fields and identifyseveral striking trends. the color-magnitude diagrams (cmds), which reach ~3magnitudes below the red clump, can be classified into two main categoriesbased on their morphologies. `stream-like' fields, so named for theirsimilarity to the cmd of the giant stellar stream, are characterized by a redclump that slants bluewards at fainter magnitudes and an extended horizontalbranch. on the other hand, `disk-like' fields exhibit rounder red clumps withsignificant luminosity width, lack an obvious horizontal branch and showevidence for recent star formation (~0.25 - 2.0 gyr ago). we compare thespatial and line-of-sight distribution of stream-like fields with a recentsimulation of the giant stream progenitor orbit and find an excellentagreement. these fields, found across the face of m31, attest to the highdegree of pollution caused by this event. disk-like material resides in theextended disk structure of m31 and is detected out to 44 kpc (projected); theuniform populations in these fields, including the ubiquitous presence of youngpopulations, and the strong rotation reported elsewhere are most consistentwith a scenario in which this structure has formed through heating anddisruption of the existing thin disk, perhaps due to the impact of the giantstream progenitor. our comparative analysis sheds new light on the likelycomposition of two of the ultra-deep pointings formerly presented as pure outerdisk and pure halo in the literature.

1408.2907	sailing under the magellanic clouds: a decam view of the carina dwarf	we present deep optical photometry from the decam imager on the 4m blancotelescope of over 12 deg$^2$ around the carina dwarf spheroidal, with completecoverage out to 1 degree and partial coverage extending out to 2.6 degrees.using a poisson-based matched filter analysis to identify stars from each ofthe three main stellar populations, old, intermediate, and young, we confirmthe previously identified radial age gradient, distance, tidal radius, stellarradial profiles, relative stellar population sizes, ellipticity, and positionangle. we find an angular offset between the three main elliptical populationsof carina, and find only tentative evidence for tidal debris, suggesting thatpast tidal interactions could not have significantly influenced the carinadwarf. we detect stars in the vicinity of, but distinct to, the carina dwarf,and measure their distance to be 46$\pm$2 kpc. we determine this population tobe part of the halo of the large magellanic cloud at an angular radius of over20 degrees. due to overlap in colour-magnitude space with magellanic stars,previously detected tidal features in the old population of carina are likelyweaker than previously thought.

1409.3229	the episodic star formation history of the carina dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	we present deep photometry of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the b,vfilters from ctio/mosaic, out to and beyond the tidal radius. the accuratelycalibrated photometry is combined with spectroscopic metallicity distributionsof red giant branch stars to determine the detailed star formation and chemicalevolution history. the star formation history confirms the episodic formationhistory of carina and quantifies the duration and strength of each episode ingreat detail, as a function radius from the centre. two main episodes of starformation occurred at old (&gt;8 gyr) and intermediate (2-8 gyr) ages, bothenriching stars starting from low metallicities ([fe/h]&lt;-2 dex). by dividingthe sfh into two components, we determine that 60pm9 percent of the totalnumber of stars formed within the intermediate age episode. furthermore, withinthe tidal radius (0.48 degrees or 888 pc) a total mass in stars of 1.07pm0.08x10^6 m_sun was formed, giving carina a stellar mass-to-light ratio of1.8pm0.8. combining the detailed star formation history with spectroscopicobservations of rgb stars, we are able to determine the detailedage-metallicity relation of each episode and the timescale of alpha-elementevolution of carina from individual stars. the oldest episode displays a tightage-metallicity relation over 6 gyr with steadily declining alpha-elementabundances and a possible alpha-element knee at [fe/h]~ -2.5 dex. theintermediate age sequence displays a more complex age-metallicity relationstarting from low metallicity and a sequence in alpha-element abundances with aslope much steeper than observed in the old episode, starting from [fe/h]=-1.8dex and [mg/fe]~0.4 dex and declining to mg-poor values ([mg/fe]&lt;-0.5 dex).this indicates clearly that both episodes of star formation formed from gaswith different abundance patterns, inconsistent with simple evolution in anisolated system.

1409.7065	a pandas view of m31 dwarf elliptical satellites: ngc147 and ngc185	we exploit data from the pan-andromeda archaeological survey (pandas) tostudy the extended structures of m31's dwarf elliptical companions, ngc147 andngc185. our wide-field, homogeneous photometry allows to construct deepcolour-magnitude diagrams (cmds) which reach down to $\sim3$ mag below the redgiant branch (rgb) tip. we trace the stellar components of the galaxies tosurface brightness of $\mu_g \sim 32$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and show they have muchlarger extents ($\sim5$ kpc radii) than previously recognised. while ngc185retains a regular shape in its peripheral regions, ngc147 exhibits pronouncedisophotal twisting due to the emergence of symmetric tidal tails. we fit singlesersic models to composite surface brightness profiles constructed from diffuselight and star counts and find that ngc147 has an effective radius almost 3times that of ngc185. in both cases, the effective radii that we calculate arelarger by a factor of $\sim2$ compared to most literature values. we alsocalculate revised total magnitudes of $m_g=-15.36\pm0.04$ for ngc185 and$m_g=-16.36\pm0.04$ for ngc147. using photometric metallicities computed forrgb stars, we find ngc185 to exhibit a metallicity gradient of[fe/h]$\sim-0.15$ dex/kpc over the radial range 0.125 to 0.5 deg. on the otherhand, ngc147 exhibits almost no metallicity gradient, $\sim-0.02$ dex/kpc from0.2 to 0.6 deg. the differences in the structure and stellar populations in theoutskirts of these systems suggest that tidal influences have played animportant role in governing the evolution of ngc147.

1502.05432	the vlt survey telescope atlas	the vlt survey telescope (vst) atlas is an optical ugriz survey aiming tocover ~4700deg^2 of the southern sky to similar depths as the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). from reduced images and object catalogues provided by thecambridge astronomical surveys unit we first find that the median seeing rangesfrom 0.8 arcsec fwhm in i to 1.0 arcsec in u, significantly better than the1.2-1.5 arcsec seeing for sdss. the 5 sigma magnitude limit for stellar sourcesis r_ab=22.7 and in all bands these limits are at least as faint as sdss. sdssand atlas are more equivalent for galaxy photometry except in the z band whereatlas has significantly higher throughput. we have improved the original esomagnitude zeropoints by comparing m&lt;16 star magnitudes with apass in gri, alsoextrapolating into u and z, resulting in zeropoints accurate to ~+-0.02 mag. wefinally compare star and galaxy number counts in a 250deg^2 area with sdss andother count data and find good agreement. atlas data products can be retrievedfrom the eso science archive, while support for survey science analyses isprovided by the omegacam science archive (osa), operated by the wide-fieldastronomy unit in edinburgh.

1511.04793	major substructure in the m31 outer halo: the east cloud	we present the first detailed analysis of the east cloud, a highly disrupteddiffuse stellar substructure in the outer halo of m31. the core of thesubstructure lies at a projected distance of $\sim100$ kpc from the centre ofm31 in the outer halo, with possible extensions reaching right into the innerhalo. using pan-andromeda archaeological survey photometry of red giant branchstars, we measure the distance, metallicity and brightness of the cloud. usinghubble space telescope data, we independently measure the distance andmetallicity to the two globular clusters coincident with the east cloud core,pa-57 and pa-58, and find their distances to be consistent with the cloud. fourfurther globular clusters coincident with the substructure extensions areidentified as potentially associated. combining the analyses, we determine adistance to the cloud of $814^{+20}_{-9}$ kpc, a metallicity of $[fe/h] =-1.2\pm0.1$, and a brightness of $m_v = -10.7\pm0.4$ mag. even allowing for theinclusion of the potential extensions, this accounts for less than $20$ percent of the progenitor luminosity implied by the luminosity-metallicityrelation. using the updated techniques developed for this analysis, we alsorefine our estimates of the distance and brightness of the south-west cloud, aseparate substructure analyzed in the previous work in this series.

astro-ph;0110691	sub-structure of the outer galactic halo from the 2 micron all sky  survey	a pole-count analysis of the infrared 2mass survey is presented, in order toidentify faint stream-like structures within the halo of the milky way.selecting stars with colours consistent with m-giant stars, we find a strongover-density of sources on a stream with pole (l=95,b=13), which corresponds tothe pole of the orbit of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. this great-circlefeature of width ~12 degrees, contains 5% of the late m-giants in the halo. noother stream-like structures are detected in m-giants in the 2mass secondincremental data release (2idr), and in particular, we find no evidence for astellar component to the magellanic stream. this suggests that the presentaccretion rate of low-mass satellites with a luminous component is very low,and the formation of the luminous component of the halo must have beenessentially complete before the accretion of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy, morethan 3gyr ago. we also search for great-circle streams using almost allhigh-latitude (|b|&gt;30) sources in the 2idr dataset. no narrow great-circlestreams of width 0.5-2 degrees were found, though we were only sensitive torelatively nearby (&lt;17kpc) remnants of massive (10^6 msun) globular clusters.if the galactic potential is close to being spherical, as some recentobservations suggest, the lack of observed great-circle streams is consistentwith the presence of dark matter substructures in the halo. althoughalternative explanations cannot be ruled out from our analysis of the 2idrdataset, future experiments with better statistics have the potential to revealthe heating effect of dark matter substructure on stellar streams.

astro-ph;0205026	the kinematics and metallicity of the m31 globular cluster system	with the ultimate aim of distinguishing between various models describing theformation of galaxy halos (e.g. radial or multi-phase collapse, randommergers), we have completed a spectroscopic study of the globular clustersystem of m31. we present the results of deep, intermediate-resolution,fibre-optic spectroscopy of several hundred of the m31 globular clusters usingthe wide field fibre optic spectrograph (wyffos) at the william herscheltelescope in la palma, canary islands. these observations have yielded preciseradial velocities (+/-12 km/s) and metallicities (+/-0.26 dex) for over 200members of the m31 globular cluster population out to a radius of 1.5 degreesfrom the galaxy center. many of these clusters have no previous publishedradial velocity or [fe/h] estimates, and the remainder typically representsignificant improvements over earlier determinations. we present analyses ofthe spatial, kinematic and metal abundance properties of the m31 globularclusters. we find that the abundance distribution of the cluster system isconsistent with a bimodal distribution with peaks at [fe/h] = -1.4 and -0.5.the metal-rich clusters demonstrate a centrally concentrated spatialdistribution with a high rotation amplitude, although this population does notappear significantly flattened and is consistent with a bulge population. themetal-poor clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated and are also foundto have a strong rotation signature.

0808.2441	extremely red stellar objects revealed by iphas	we present photometric analysis and follow-up spectroscopy for a populationof extremely red stellar objects extracted from the point-source catalogue ofthe int photometric h-alpha survey (iphas) of the northern galactic plane. thevast majority of these objects have no previous identification. analysis ofoptical, near- and mid-infrared photometry reveals that they are mostlyhighly-reddened asymptotic giant branch stars, with significant levels ofcircumstellar material. we show that the distribution of these objects tracesgalactic extinction, their highly reddened colours being a product of bothinterstellar and circumstellar reddening. this is the first time that such alarge sample of evolved low-mass stars has been detected in the visual andallows optical counterparts to be associated with sources from recent infraredsurveys.  follow-up spectroscopy on some of the most interesting objects in the samplehas found significant numbers of s-type stars which can be clearly separatedfrom oxygen-rich objects in the iphas colour-colour diagram. we show that thisis due to the positions of different molecular bands relative to thenarrow-band h-alpha filter used for iphas observations. the iphas (r' -h-alpha) colour offers a valuable diagnostic for identifying s-type stars. aselection method for identifying s-type stars in the galactic plane is brieflydiscussed and we estimate that over a thousand new objects of this type may bediscovered, potentially doubling the number of known objects in this short butimportant evolutionary phase.

astro-ph;0301067	one ring to encompass them all: a giant stellar structure that surrounds  the galaxy	we present evidence that the curious stellar population found by the sloandigital sky survey in the galactic anticentre direction extends to otherdistant fields that skirt the plane of the milky way. new data, taken with theint wide field camera show a similar population, narrowly aligned along theline of sight, but with a galactocentric distance that changes from ~15 kpc to\~20 kpc (over ~100 degrees on the sky). despite being narrowly concentratedalong the line of sight, the structure is fairly extended vertically out of theplane of the disk, with a vertical scale height of 0.75+/-0.04 kpc. thisfinding suggests that the outer rim of the galaxy ends in a low-surfacebrightness stellar ring. presently available data do not allow us to ascertainthe origin of the structure. one possibility is that it is the wraith of asatellite galaxy devoured long-ago by the milky way, though our favouredinterpretation is that it is a perturbation of the disk, possibly the result ofancient warps. assuming that the ring is smooth and axisymmetric, the totalstellar mass in the structure may amount to 2x10^8 up to 10^9 solar masses.

astro-ph;0311010	a dwarf galaxy remnant in canis major: the fossil of an in-plane  accretion onto the milky way	we present an analysis of the asymmetries in the population of galacticm-giant stars present in the 2mass all sky catalogue. several large-scaleasymmetries are detected, the most significant of which is a strongelliptical-shaped stellar over-density, close to the galactic plane at (l=240,b=-8), in the constellation of canis major. a small grouping of globularclusters (ngc 1851, ngc 1904, ngc 2298, and ngc 2808), coincident in positionand radial velocity, surround this structure, as do a number of open clusters.the population of m-giant stars in this over-density is similar in number tothat in the core of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. we argue that this object isthe likely dwarf galaxy progenitor of the ring-like structure that has recentlybeen found at the edge of the galactic disk. a numerical study of the tidaldisruption of an accreted dwarf galaxy is presented. the simulated debris fitswell the extant position, distance and velocity information on the ``galacticring'', as well as that of the m-giant over-densities, suggesting that allthese structures are the consequence of a single accretion event. the disrupteddwarf galaxy stream orbits close to the galactic plane, with a pericentre atapproximately the solar circle, an orbital eccentricity similar to that ofstars in the galactic thick disk, as well as a vertical scale height similar tothat of the thick disk. this finding strongly suggests that the canis majordwarf galaxy is a building block of the galactic thick disk, that the thickdisk is continually growing, even up to the present time, and that thick diskglobular clusters were accreted onto the milky way from dwarf galaxies inco-planar orbits.

astro-ph;0311119	detection of the canis major galaxy at (l;b)=(244;-8) and in the  background of galactic open clusters	we report on the detection of main sequence stars belonging to the recentlyidentified canis major galaxy in a field located at ~ 4.2 deg from the centerof the stellar system. with main sequence fitting we obtain a distance modulus(m-m)_0=14.5 +/- 0.3 to the dwarf, corresponding to a distance of d_{sun} = 8.0+/- 1.2 kpc, in full agreement with previous estimates based on the photometricparallax of m-giants. from the comparison with theoretical isochrones weconstrain the age of the main population of the canis major system in the range\~ 4-10 gyr. a blue plume of likely younger stars (age &lt; 1-2 gyr) is alsoidentified. the available colour magnitude diagrams of open clusters that maybe projected onto the main body of canis major are also briefly analyzed. theposition, distance and stellar population of the old open clusters am-2 andtombaugh 2 strongly suggest that they are physically associated with the canismajor galaxy. using our own photometry and data from 2mass and the gsc2.2surveys we demonstrate that the claim by momany et al. that the cma overdensityis entirely due to the galactic warp is not supported by the existingobservations, once all the available pieces of information are taken intoaccount. it is shown that the cma overdensity clearly emerges at a heliocentricdistance of ~ 8 kpc above any overdensity possibly produced by the galacticwarp.

astro-ph;0401453	determining the location of the tip of the red giant branch in old  stellar populations: m33, andromeda i &amp; ii	the absolute bolometric luminosity of the point of core helium ignition inold, metal poor, red-giant stars is of roughly constant magnitude, varying onlyvery slightly with mass or metallicity. it can thus be used as a standardcandle. here, we review the main difficulties in measuring this location in anyreal dataset and develop an empirical approach to optimise it for tip of thered giant branch (trgb) analysis. we go on to present a new algorithm for theidentification of the trgb in nearby metal poor stellar systems. our methoduses a least-squares fit of a data-adaptive slope to the luminosity function in1 magnitude windows. this finds the region of the luminosity function thatshows the most significant decline in star counts as we go to brightermagnitudes; the base of this decline is attributed as the location of the tip.this technique then allows for the determination of realistic uncertaintieswhich reflect the quality of the luminosity function used, but which aretypically ~0.02 mags rms + ~ 0.03 mags systematic, a significant improvementupon previous methods that have used the tip as a standard candle. finally, weapply our technique to the local group spiral galaxy m33 and the dwarf galaxiesand i &amp; ii, and derive distance modulii of 24.50 +/- 0.06 (794 +/- 23 kpc),24.33 +/- 0.07 (735 +/- 23 kpc) and 24.05 +/- 0.06 (645 +/- 19 kpc)respectively. the result for m33 is in excellent agreement with the cepheiddistances to this galaxy, and makes the possibility of a significant amount ofreddening in this object unlikely.

astro-ph;0407391	why the canis major overdensity is not due to the warp: analysis of its  radial profile and velocities	in response to criticism by momany et al. (2004), that therecently-identified canis major (cma) overdensity could be simply explained bythe galactic warp, we present proof of the existence of a stellar population inthe direction of cma that cannot be explained by known galactic components. byanalyzing the radial distribution of counts of m-giant stars in this direction,we show that the momany et al. (2004) warp model overestimates the number ofstars in the northern hemisphere, hence hiding the cma feature in the south.the use of a better model of the warp has little influence on the morphology ofthe overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a distanceof d=7.2\pm 0.3 kpc. to lend further support to the existence of a populationthat does not belong to the galactic disc, we present radial velocities ofm-giant stars in the centre of the cma structure that were obtained with the2df spectrograph at the aat. the extra population shows a radial velocity ofvr=109\pm4 km/s, which is significantly higher than the typical velocity of thedisc at the distance of cma. this population also has a low dispersion (13\pm4km/s). the canis major overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due tothe galactic warp, adding weight to the hypothesis that we are observing adisrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants. this leads to questions on what partof cma was previously identified as the warp and how to possibly disentanglethe two structures.

astro-ph;0411029	two distinct ancient components in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy:  first results from dart	we have found evidence for the presence of two distinct ancient stellarcomponents (both geq 10 gyr old) in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. weused the eso wide field imager (wfi) in conjunction with the vlt/flamesspectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population ofsculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. we find that two components arediscernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in ourimaging, and in the [fe/h] and v_hel distributions for our large sample ofspectroscopic measurements. they can be generally described as a ``metal-poor''component ([fe/h]&lt; -1.7) and a ``metal-rich'' component ([fe/h]&gt; -1.7). themetal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, andthey also appear to be kinematically distinct. these results provide animportant insight into the formation processes of small systems in the earlyuniverse and the conditions found there. even this simplest of galaxies appearsto have had a surprisingly complex early evolution.

astro-ph;0503703	correcting the influence of an asymmetric line spread function in  2-degree field spectrograph data	we investigate the role of asymmetries in the line spread function of the2-degree field spectrograph and the variations in these asymmetries with theccd, the plate, the time of observation and the fibre. a data-reductionpipeline is developed that takes these deformations into account for thecalibration and cross-correlation of the spectra. we show that, using theemission lines of calibration lamp observations, we can fit the line spreadfunction with the sum of two gaussian functions representing the theoreticalsignal and a perturbation of the system. this model is then used to calibratethe spectra and generate templates by downgrading high resolution spectra.thus, we can cross-correlate the observed spectra with templates degraded inthe same way. our reduction pipeline is tested on real observations andprovides a significant improvement in the accuracy of the radial velocitiesobtained. in particular, the systematic errors that were as high as ~20 km/swhen applying the aao reduction package 2dfdr are now reduced to ~5 km/s. eventhough the 2-degree field spectrograph is to be decommissioned at the end of2005, the analysis of archival data and previous studies could be improved bythe reduction procedure we propose here.

astro-ph;0607472	discovery and analysis of three faint dwarf galaxies and a globular  cluster in the outer halo of the andromeda galaxy	we present the discovery of three faint dwarf galaxies and a globular clusterin the halo of the andromeda galaxy (m31), found in our megacam survey thatspans the southern quadrant of m31, from a projected distance of ~50 kpc to\~150 kpc. though the survey covers 57 sq. degrees, the four satellites liewithin 2\deg of one another. we estimate that the globular cluster lies at atotal distance of 175+/-55 kpc from m31, making it the farthest m31 globularcluster known. it also shows the typical characteristics of a bright globularcluster, with a half-light radius of 2.3+/-0.2 pc and an absolute magnitude inthe v band of m_{v,0}=-8.5+/-0.3 and contains a very old population with ametallicity of [fe/h]~-1.3. the three dwarf galaxies are all very faint, withabsolute magnitudes in the range -7.3&lt;m_{v,0}&lt;-6.4, and show strikingly similarcharacteristics with metallicities of [fe/h]~-1.4 and half-light radii of\~120+/-45 pc, making these dwarf galaxies two to three times smaller than thesmallest previously known satellites of m31. we estimate them to be between 740and 955 kpc from the sun. extrapolating from the coverage of the survey, weestimate that up to 45+/-20 satellites brighter than m_v~-6.5 should beorbiting m31. hence faint dwarf galaxies cannot alone account for the missingsatellites that are predicted by $\lambda$cdm models, unless they reside indark matter mini-halos that are more massive than the typical masse of 10^7solar masses currently inferred from their central radial velocity dispersion.(abridged)

astro-ph;0611420	a new view of the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way from  vlt/flames: where are the very metal poor stars?	as part of the dwarf galaxies abundances and radial-velocities team (dart)program, we have measured the metallicities of a large sample of stars in fournearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsph's): sculptor, sextans, fornax, andcarina. the low mean metal abundances and the presence of very old stellarpopulations in these galaxies have supported the view that they are fossilsfrom the early universe. however, contrary to naive expectations, we find asignificant lack of stars with metallicities below [fe/h] ~ -3 dex in all foursystems. this suggests that the gas that made up the stars in these systems hadbeen uniformly enriched prior to their formation. furthermore, the metal-poortail of the dsph metallicity distribution is significantly different from thatof the galactic halo. these findings show that the progenitors of nearby dsph'sappear to have been fundamentally different from the building blocks of themilky way, even at the earliest epochs.

astro-ph;0612293	inside the whale: the structure and dynamics of the isolated cetus dwarf  spheroidal	this paper presents a study of the cetus dwarf, an isolated dwarf galaxywithin the local group. a matched-filter analysis of the int/wfc imaging ofthis system reveals no evidence for significant tidal debris that could havebeen torn from the galaxy, bolstering the hypothesis that cetus has neversignificantly interacted with either the milky way or m31. additionally,keck/deimos spectroscopic observations identify this galaxy as a distinctkinematic population possessing a systematic velocity of $-87\pm2{\rm km\s^{-1}}$ and with a velocity dispersion of $17\pm2{\rm km s^{-1}}$; whiletentative, these data also suggest that cetus possesses a moderate rotationalvelocity of $\sim8{\rm km s^{-1}}$. the population is confirmed to berelatively metal-poor, consistent with ${\rm [fe/h]\sim-1.9}$, and, assumingvirial equilibrium, implies that the cetus dwarf galaxy possesses a$m/l\sim70$. it appears, therefore, that cetus may represent a primordial dwarfgalaxy, retaining the kinematic and structural properties lost by other membersof the dwarf population of the local group in their interactions with the largegalaxies. an analysis of cetus's orbit through the local group indicates thatit is at apocentre; taken in conjunction with the general dwarf population,this shows the mass of the local group to be $\gta2\times10^{12}m_\odot$.

astro-ph;9508058	microlensing induced spectral variability in q2237+0305	several macrolensed systems exhibit photometric variability consistent withmicrolensing due to objects of stellar mass located in the lens. the degree ofmicrolensing amplification is dependent upon the size of the source, withsmaller sources being more amplified. in general, amplification of sourceslarger than an einstein radius projected onto the source plane is negligible.for the quasar q2237+0305, a quadrupole image lens (huchra et al., 1985), thisradius is 0.05 pc, larger than the predicted size of a continuum emittingaccretion disk, but substantially smaller than the broad line region (figure1). this scale difference implies that the continuum will be amplified whilethe broad line emission remains essentially unchanged during a microlensingevent (sanitt, 1971; kayser et al., 1986).  the broad line emitting region, as a whole, is too large to be microlensed,but substructure on small scales may be significantly amplified. although thetotal flux in the line is relatively unchanged, microlensing of substructurecan result in changes in the shape of the emission line profiles, and producemeasurable shifts in the central wavelength of the line (nemiroff, 1988;schneider and wambsganss, 1990).

0810.0401	a planetary nebula around nova v458 vul undergoing flash ionization	nova v458 vul erupted on 2007 august 8th and reached a visual magnitude of8.1 a few days later. h$\alpha$ images obtained six weeks before the outburstas part of the iphas galactic plane survey reveal an 18th magnitude progenitorsurrounded by an extended nebula. subsequent images and spectroscopy of thenebula reveal an inner nebular knot increasing rapidly in brightness due toflash ionization by the nova event. we derive a distance of 13 kpc based onlight travel time considerations, which is supported by two other distanceestimation methods. the nebula has an ionized mass of 0.2 m$_{\odot}$ and a lowexpansion velocity: this rules it out as ejecta from a previous nova eruption,and is consistent with it being a ~14,000 year old planetary nebula, probablythe product of a prior common envelope (ce) phase of evolution of the binarysystem. the large derived distance means that the mass of the erupting wdcomponent of the binary is high. we identify two possible evolutionaryscenarios, in at least one of which the system is massive enough to produce atype ia supernova on merging.

0706.0019	the discovery of two extremely low luminosity milky way globular  clusters	we report the discovery of two extremely low luminosity globular clusters inthe milky way halo. these objects were detected in the sloan digital sky surveydata release 5 and confirmed with deeper imaging at the calar alto observatory.the clusters, koposov 1 and koposov 2, are located at $\sim 40-50$ kpc andappear to have old stellar populations and luminosities of only $m_v \sim -1$mag. their observed sizes of $\sim 3$ pc are well within the expected tidallimit of $\sim$10 pc at that distance. together with palomar 1, am 4 andwhiting 1, these new clusters are the lowest luminosity globulars orbiting themilky way, with koposov 2 the most extreme. koposov 1 appears to lie close todistant branch of the sagittarius stream. the half-mass relaxation times ofkoposov 1 and 2 are only $\sim 70$ and $\sim 55$ myr respectively (2 orders ofmagnitude shorter than the age of the stellar populations), so it would seemthat they have undergone drastic mass segregation. since they do not appear tobe very concentrated, their evaporation timescales may be as low as $\sim 0.1t_{\rm hubble}$. these discoveries show that the structural parameter space ofglobular clusters in the milky way halo is not yet fully explored. they alsoadd, through their short remaining survival times, significant direct evidencefor a once much larger population of globular clusters.

0810.2547	high spatial resolution galactic 3d extinction mapping with iphas	we present an algorithm ({\scshape mead}, for `mapping extinction againstdistance') which will determine intrinsic ($r' - i'$) colour, extinction, anddistance for early-a to k4 stars extracted from the iphas $r'/i'/\halpha$photometric database. these data can be binned up to map extinction in threedimensions across the northern galactic plane. the large size of the iphasdatabase ($\sim 200$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digitalphotometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude ($r' \sim 20$) allowextinction to be mapped with fine angular ($ \sim 10 $ arcmin) and distance($\sim 0.1$ ~kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the solarcircle. high reddening within the solar circle on occasion brings this rangedown to $\sim 2$ kpc. the resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatlyexceeds that of previous empirical 3d extinction maps, enabling the structureof the galactic plane to be studied in increased detail. {\scshape mead}accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors,unresolved ism substructure, and binarity. the impact of metallicityvariations, within the range typical of the galactic disc is small. theaccuracy and reliability of {\scshape mead} are tested through the use ofsimulated photometry created with monte-carlo sampling techniques. the successof this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results arecompared to the literature.

0812.3081	the ukirt wide field camera zyjhk photometric system: calibration from  2mass	in this paper we describe the photometric calibration of data taken with thenear-infrared wide field camera (wfcam) on the united kingdom infraredtelescope (ukirt). the broadband zyjhk data are directly calibrated from 2masspoint sources which are abundant in every wfcam pointing. we perform ananalysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- andintra-detector and show that these are present at up to the 5 per cent level inwfcam. although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, amethod for their removal is developed and tested. following application of thecorrection procedure the photometric calibration of wfcam is found to beaccurate to approximately 1.5 per cent for the jhk bands and 2 per cent for thezy bands, meeting the survey requirements. we investigate the transformationsbetween the 2mass and wfcam systems and find that the z and y calibration issensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of e(b-v)',but that the jhk filters remain largely unaffected. we measure a smallcorrection to the wfcam y-band photometry required to place wfcam on a vegasystem, and investigate wfcam measurements of published standard stars from thelist of ukirt faint standards. finally we present empirically determinedthroughput measurements for wfcam.
