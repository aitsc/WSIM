0901.0198	the 2008 luminous optical transient in the nearby galaxy ngc 300	a luminous optical transient (ot) that appeared in ngc 300 in early 2008 hada maximum brightness, m_v ~ -12 to -13, intermediate between classical novaeand supernovae. we present ground-based photometric and spectroscopicmonitoring and adaptive-optics imaging of the ot, as well as pre- andpost-outburst space-based imaging with hst and spitzer. the optical spectrum atmaximum showed an f-type supergiant photosphere with superposed emission linesof hydrogen, ca ii, and [ca ii], similar to the spectra of low-luminosity typeiin "supernova impostors" like sn 2008s, as well as cool hypergiants like irc+10420. the emission lines have a complex, double structure, indicating abipolar outflow with velocities of ~75 km/s. the luminous energy released inthe eruption was ~10^47 ergs, most of it emitted in the first 2 months. byregistering new hst images with deep archival frames, we have precisely locatedthe ot site, and find no detectable optical progenitor brighter than broad-bandv magnitude 28.5. however, archival spitzer images reveal a bright,non-variable mid-ir pre-outburst source. we conclude that the ngc 300 ot was aheavily dust-enshrouded luminous star, of ~10-15 msun, which experienced aneruption that cleared the surrounding dust and initiated a bipolar wind. theprogenitor was likely an oh/ir source which had begun to evolve on a blue looptoward higher temperatures, but the precise cause of the outburst remainsuncertain.

0909.4281	astrometry with the hubble space telescope: trigonometric parallaxes of  planetary nebula nuclei: ngc 6853, ngc 7293, abell 31, and deht 5	we present absolute parallaxes and relative proper motions for the centralstars of the planetary nebulae ngc 6853 (the dumbbell), ngc 7293 (the helix),abell 31, and deht 5. this paper details our reduction and analysis using deht5 as an example. we obtain these planetary nebula nuclei (pnni) parallaxes withastrometric data from fine guidance sensors fgs 1r and fgs 3, white-lightinterferometers on the hubble space telescope (hst). proper motions, spectralclassifications and vjhkt_2m and ddo51 photometry of the stars comprising theastrometric reference frames provide spectrophotometric estimates of referencestar absolute parallaxes. introducing these into our model as observations witherror, we determine absolute parallaxes for each pnn. weighted averaging withprevious independent parallax measurements yields an average parallaxprecision, \sigma_{\pi}/\pi = 5 %. derived distances are: d_{ngc6853}=405^{+28}_{-25}pc, d_{ngc 7293}=216^{+14}_{-12} pc, d_{abell 31} =621^{+91}_{-70} pc, and d_{deht 5} = 345^{+19}_{-17} pc. these pnni distancesare all smaller than previously derived from spectroscopic analyses of thecentral stars. derived absolute magnitudes and previously measured effectivetemperatures permit estimates of pnni radii, through both the stefan-boltzmannrelation and eddington fluxes. comparing absolute magnitudes with post-agbmodels provides mass estimates. masses cluster around 0.57 m(sun), close to thepeak of the white dwarf mass distribution. adding a few more pnni withwell-determined distances and masses, we compare all the pnni with cooler whitedwarfs of similar mass, and confirm, as expected, that pnni have larger radiithan white dwarfs that have reached their final cooling tracks.

0910.0503	xmm-newton detection of a transient x-ray source in the vicinity of v838  monocerotis	we report the xmm-newton/epic detection in 2008 march of a luminous (l_x ~10^32-33 erg/s), variable x-ray source in the vicinity (within ~6") of theenigmatic star v838 mon, which underwent a spectacular outburst in early 2002.spectral modeling of the xmm-newton x-ray source indicates the presence of twoplasma components with characteristic temperatures of tx ~ 2x10^6k and~1.5x10^7k, attenuated by an absorbing column (n_h ~ 4 x 10^21cm^-2) that isconsistent with the visual extinction measured toward v838 mon (a_v ~ 2). nosuch luminous source was detected in the immediate vicinity of v838 mon inchandra/acis-s observations obtained about one year after outburst or, mostrecently, in 2010 january. the two xmm source spectral components appear to bemarginally spatially resolved, with the spatial centroid of the hard componentlying closer to (within ~2" of) the position of v838 mon than the broad-bandsource or the soft source component; however, if there are two sources at ornear v838 mon, the chandra nondetections would imply that both of them arevariable. an alternative is that there is a single variable source, and thatthe apparent spatial separation may actually be due to photon-countingstatistics or is perhaps instrumental in origin. we consider constraints placedby the x-ray detection and nondetections on a stellar merger model for the 2002v838 mon outburst, in which the spun-up merger product drives a powerfulmagnetic dynamo. alternatively, the transient behavior of the x-ray sourcecould indicate that the x-rays arose as a consequence of an interaction betweenv838 mon's ejecta and its early-type (b3 v) companion.

1008.0634	hubble space telescope imaging of lyman alpha emission at z=4.4	we present the highest redshift detections of resolved lyman alpha emission,using hubble space telescope/acs f658n narrowband-imaging data taken inparallel with the wide field camera 3 early release science program in thegoods cdf-s. we detect lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 4.4 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes), more than doubling thesample of laes with resolved lyman alpha emission. comparing the lightdistribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowbandimages, we investigate the escape of lyman alpha photons at high redshift.while our data do not support a positional offset between the lyman alpha andrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two outof the three galaxies are significantly larger in lyman alpha than in therest-frame uv continuum. this result is confirmed when comparing object sizesin a stack of all objects in both bands. additionally, the narrowband fluxdetected with hst is significantly less than observed in similar filters fromthe ground. these results together imply that the lyman alpha emission is notstrictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. rather, the lymanalpha emission is more extended, with the missing hst flux likely existing in adiffuse outer halo. this suggests that the radiative transfer of lyman alphaphotons in high-redshift laes is complicated, with the interstellar-mediumgeometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at theseredshifts.

1009.1919	the exotic eclipsing nucleus of the ring planetary nebula suwt2	suwt2 is a planetary nebula (pn) consisting of a bright ionized thin ringseen nearly edge-on. it has a bright (v=12) central star, too cool to ionizethe pn, which we discovered to be an eclipsing binary. a spectrum from iue didnot reveal a uv source. we present extensive ground-based photometry andspectroscopy of the central binary collected over the ensuing two decades,resulting in the determination that the orbital period of the eclipsing pair is4.9 d, and consists of two nearly identical a1 v stars, each of mass ~2.7m_sun. the physical parameters of the a stars, combined with evolutionarytracks, show that both are in the short-lived "blue-hook" evolutionary phasethat occurs between the main sequence and the hertzsprung gap, and that the ageof the system is about 520 myr. one puzzle is that the stars' rotationalvelocities are different from each other, and considerably slower thansynchronous with the orbital period. it is possible that the center-of-massvelocity of the eclipsing pair is varying with time, suggesting that there isan unseen third orbiting body in the system. we propose a scenario in which thesystem began as a hierarchical triple, consisting of a ~2.9 m_sun star orbitingthe close pair of a stars. upon reaching the agb stage, the primary engulfedthe pair into a common envelope, leading to a rapid contraction of the orbitand catastrophic ejection of the envelope into the orbital plane. in thispicture, the exposed core of the initial primary is now a white dwarf of ~0.7m_sun, orbiting the eclipsing pair, which has already cooled below thedetectability possible by iue at our derived distance of 2.3 kpc and areddening of e(b-v)=0.40. the suwt2 system may be destined to perish as a typeia supernova.

1011.5504	anatomy of a post-starburst minor merger: a multi-wavelength wfc3 study  of ngc 4150	(abridged) we present a spatially-resolved near-uv/optical study of ngc 4150,using the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on board the hubble space telescope.previous studies of this early-type galaxy (etg) indicate that it has a largereservoir of molecular gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (likelyindication of recent merging) and strong, central h_b absorption (indicative ofyoung stars). the core of ngc 4150 shows ubiquitous near-uv emission andremarkable dusty substructure. our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in thenear-uv green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow rangeof near-uv/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby e+a(post-starburst) galaxies. we parametrise the properties of the recent starformation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in thengc 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-uv/optical photometry to stellarmodels. the typical age of the recent star formation (rsf) is around 0.9 gyrs,consistent with the similarity of the near-uv colours to post-starburstsystems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports theproposed merger scenario. the rsf metallicity, representative of themetallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 zsun.assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly fromthe infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phasemetallicity (gpm) of the accreted satellite. comparison to the local mass-gpmrelation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around3x10^8 msun, making ngc 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. a summation of the pixel rsfmass fractions indicates that the rsf contributes about 2-3 percent of thestellar mass. this work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play asignificant role in the evolution of etgs at late epochs.

0709.1508	the bizarre spectral variability of central stars of planetary nebulae	a radial velocity (rv) survey to detect central stars in binary systems wascarried out between 2002 and 2004. de marco et al. (2004) reported that 10 outof 11 monitored stars exhibited strong rv variability, but periods were notdetected. since other mechanisms, such as wind variability, can cause apparentrv variations, we monitored 4 of the 10 rv-variable stars at echelleresolutions to determine the origin of the variability. although rv changes areconfirmed for all four stars, none of them can be ascribed to binarity at thistime. however, only for ic4593 is wind variability able to explain most (thoughnot all) spectral variability. for bd+332642, no wind and no pulsations appearto be the origin of the rv changes. finally, m1-77 and m2-54, both known to beirregular photometric variables, exhibit dramatic rv and line shape variabilityof the hydrogen and hei absorption lines, as well as large rv variability ofweaker lines, which do not change in shape. there is no satisfactoryexplanation of this variability, though a combination of wind variability andpulsations is still the best guess at what makes these stars so variable. wesuggest that luminous central stars are ill suited to detect spectroscopicbinaries, because winds (and possibly pulsations) are pervasive and would maskeven strong periodicities. it it likely that a sample of intrinsically faintcentral stars would more readily yield binary information.

1101.4521	detection of brown dwarf-like objects in the core of ngc3603	we use near-infrared data obtained with the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on thehubble space telescope to identify objects having the colors of brown dwarfs(bds) in the field of the massive galactic cluster ngc 3603. these areidentified through use of a combination of narrow and medium band filtersspanning the j and h bands, and which are particularly sensitive to thepresence of the 1.3-1.5{\mu}m h2o molecular band - unique to bds. we provide acalibration of the relationship between effective temperature and color forboth field stars and for bds. this photometric method provides effectivetemperatures for bds to an accuracy of {\pm}350k relative to spectroscopictechniques. this accuracy is shown to be not significantly affected by eitherstellar surface gravity or uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. weidentify nine objects having effective temperature between 1700 and 2200 k,typical of bds, observed j-band magnitudes in the range 19.5-21.5, and that arestrongly clustered towards the luminous core of ngc 3603. however, if these arelocated at the distance of the cluster, they are far too luminous to be normalbds. we argue that it is unlikely that these objects are either artifacts ofour dataset, normal field bds/m-type giants or extra-galactic contaminants and,therefore, might represent a new class of stars having the effectivetemperatures of bds but with luminosities of more massive stars. we explore theinteresting scenario in which these objects would be normal stars that haverecently tidally ingested a hot jupiter, the remnants of which are providing ashort-lived extended photosphere to the central star. in this case, we wouldexpect them to show the signature of fast rotation.

1103.4026	using h-alpha morphology and surface brightness fluctuations to age-date  star clusters in m83	we use new wfc3 observations of the nearby grand design spiral galaxy m83 todevelop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters.the first method uses the physical extent and morphology of halpha emission toestimate the ages of clusters younger than tau ~10 myr. it is based on thesimple premise that the gas in very young (tau &lt; few myr) clusters is largelycoincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structuresurrounding the stars in slightly older clusters (e.g., tau ~5 myr), and is ina larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ~5-10 myr). thesecond method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel fluxvariations within clusters and their ages. this method relies on the fact thatthe brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around10 myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., m_v &lt; -3.5) for ages olderthan about 100 myr. these two methods are the basis for a new morphologicalclassification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clustersbased on their appearance. we compare previous age estimates of clusters in m83determined from fitting ubvi halpha measurements using predictions from stellarevolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find goodagreement at the ~95% level. the scatter within categories is ~0.1 dex in logtau for young clusters (&lt;10 myr) and ~0.5 dex for older (&gt;10 myr) clusters. aby-product of this study is the identification of 22 "single-star" hii regionsin m83, with central stars having ages ~4 myr.

1206.3346	swift/uvot photometry of the planetary nebula webo 1: unmasking a faint  hot companion star	we present an analysis of over 150 ks of data on the planetary nebula webo 1(pn g135.6+01.0) obtained with the swift ultraviolet optical telescope (uvot).the central object of this nebula has previously been described as a late-typek giant barium star with a possible hot companion, most likely a youngpre-white dwarf. uvot photometry shows that while the optical photometry isconsistent with a large cool object, the near-ultraviolet (uv) photometry showsfar more uv flux than could be produced by any late-type object. using modelstellar atmospheres and a comparison to uvot photometry for the pre-white dwarfpg 1159-035, we find that the companion has a temperature of at least 40,000 kand a radius of, at most, 0.056 r_sun. while the temperature and radius areconsistent with a hot compact stellar remnant, they are lower and larger,respectively, than expected for a typical young pre-white dwarf. this likelyindicates a deficiency in the assumed uv extinction curve. we find that highertemperatures more consistent with expectations for a pre-white dwarf can bederived if the foreground dust has a strong "blue bump" at 2175 aa and a lowerr_v. our results demonstrate the ability of swift to both uncover andcharacterize hot hidden companion stars and to constrain the uv extinctionproperties of foreground dust based solely on uvot photometry.

0711.4059	planets in the galactic bulge: results from the sweeps project	the exoplanets discovered so far have been mostly around relatively nearbyand bright stars. as a result, the host stars are mostly (i) in the galacticdisk, (ii) relatively massive, and (iii) relatively metal rich. the aim of thesweeps project is to extend our knowledge to stars which (i) are in a differentpart of the galaxy, (ii) have lower masses, and (iii) have a large range ofmetallicities. to achieve this goal, we used the hubble space telescope tosearch for transiting planets around f, g, k, and m dwarfs in the galacticbulge. we photometrically monitored 180,000 stars in a dense bulge fieldcontinuously for 7 days. we discovered 16 candidate transiting extrasolarplanets with periods of 0.6 to 4.2 days, including a new class of ultra-shortperiod planets (uspps) with p &lt; 1.2 days. radial-velocity observations of thetwo brightest candidates support their planetary nature. these results suggestthat planets are as abundant in the galactic bulge as they are in the solarneighborhood, and they are equally abundant around low-mass stars (within afactor 2). the planet frequency increases with metallicity even for the starsin the galactic bulge. all the uspp hosts are low-mass stars, suggesting eitherthat close-in planets around higher-mass stars are irradiatively evaporated, orthat the planets can migrate to close-in orbits only around such old andlow-mass stars.

1303.3211	carbon in the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy	measurements of [c/fe], [ca/h], and [fe/h] have been derived from keck ilrisb spectra of 35 giants in the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the ironabundances are derived by a spectrum synthesis modeling of the wavelengthregion from 4850 to 5375 a, while calcium and carbon abundances are obtained byfitting the ca ii h and k lines and the ch g band respectively. a range inmetallicity of -2.9 &lt;= [fe/h]} &lt;= -1.6 is found within the giants sampled, witha good correlation between [fe/h] and [ca/h]. the great majority of stars inthe sample would be classified as having weak absorption in the lambda 3883 cnband, with only a small scatter in band strengths at a given luminosity on thered giant branch. in this sense the behavior of cn among the draco giants isconsistent with the predominantly weak cn bands found among red giants inglobular clusters of metallicity [fe/h] &lt; -1.8. over half of the giants in thedraco sample have [fe/h] &gt; -2.25, and among these there is a trend for the[c/fe] abundance to decrease with increasing luminosity on the red giantbranch. this is a phenomenon that is also seen among both field and globularcluster giants of the galactic halo, where it has been interpreted as aconsequence of deep mixing of material between the base of the convectiveenvelope and the outer limits of the hydrogen-burning shell. however, among thesix draco giants observed that turn out to have metallicities -2.65 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-2.25 there is no such trend seen in the carbon abundance. this may be due tosmall sample statistics or primordial inhomogeneities in carbon abundance amongthe most metal-poor draco stars. we identify a potential carbon-rich extremelymetal-poor star in our sample. this candidate will require follow upobservations for confirmation.

1305.0583	hubble space telescope imaging of the binary nucleus of the planetary  nebula egb 6	egb 6 is an ancient, low-surface-brightness planetary nebula. the centralstar, also cataloged as pg 0950+139, is a very hot daoz white dwarf (wd) withan apparent m dwarf companion, unresolved from the ground but detectedinitially through excesses in the jhk bands. its kinematics indicatesmembership in the galactic disk population. inside of egb 6 is an extremelydense emission knot -- completely unexpected since significant mass loss fromthe wd should have ceased ~10^5 y ago. the electron density of the compactnebula is very high (2.2x10^6 cm^-3), as indicated by collisional de-excitationof forbidden emission lines. hubble space telescope imaging and grismspectroscopy are reported here. these resolve the wd and apparent dm companion-- at a separation of 0."166, or a projected 96(+204,-45) au at the estimateddistance of 576(+1224, -271) pc (using the v magnitude). much to our surprise,we found that the compact emission nebula is superposed on the dm companion,far from the photoionizing radiation of the wd. moreover, a a strikingmid-infrared excess has recently been reported in spitzer/irac and mips bands,best fit with two dust shells. the derived ratio l_ir/l_wd = 2.7 x 10^-4 is thelargest yet found for any wd or planetary nucleus. the compact nebula hasmaintained its high density for over three decades. we discuss two possibleexplanations for the origin and confinement of the compact nebula, neither ofwhich is completely satisfactory. this leaves the genesis and confinement ofthe compact nebula an astrophysical puzzle, yet similar examples appear in theliterature.

1305.6563	evolution of the 1919 ejecta of v605 aquilae	new imaging of v605 aql, was obtained in 2009 with hst/wfpc2, which had anova-like outburst in 1919, and is located at the center of the planetarynebula (pn), abell 58. this event has long been ascribed to a final heliumshell flash, but it has been suggested recently that it may instead have beenan one nova. the new images provide an 18 year baseline for the expansion ofthe ejecta from the 1919 event. in addition, the central star has been directlydetected in the visible for the first time since 1923, when it faded from sightdue to obscuration by dust. the expansion of the ejecta has a velocity of ~200km/s, and an angular expansion rate of ~10 mas/yr, consistent with a 1919ejection. this implies a geometric distance of 4.6 kpc for v605 aql, consistentwith previous estimates. the gas mass in the central knot of ejecta waspreviously estimated to be 5 x 10^-5 m(sun). it is estimated that warm dustassociated with this gas has a mass of ~10^-5 m(sun). there is also evidencefor a significant amount, 10^-3 m(sun), of cold (75 k) dust, which may beassociated with its pn. the knot ejected in 1919 is asymmetrical and isapproximately aligned with the asymmetry of the surrounding pn. polarimetricimaging was obtained to investigate whether the 2001 spectrum of v605 aql wasobtained primarily in scattered light from dust in the central knot, but thesignal-to-noise in the data was insufficient to measure the level ofpolarization.

1307.0790	on the hubble space telescope trigonometric parallax of the dwarf nova  ss cygni	ss cygni is one of the brightest dwarf novae (dne), and one of thebest-studied prototypes of the cataclysmic variables. astrometric observationswith the fine guidance sensors (fgs) on the hubble space telescope (hst),published in 2004, gave an absolute trigonometric parallax of 6.06+/-0.44 mas.however, recent very-long-baseline interferometry (vlbi), obtained during radiooutbursts of ss cyg, has yielded a significantly larger absolute parallax of8.80+/-0.12 mas, as well as a large difference in the direction of the propermotion compared to the hst result. the vlbi distance reduces the impliedluminosity of ss cyg by about a factor of two, giving good agreement withpredictions based on accretion-disk theory in order to explain the observed dnoutburst behavior. this discrepancy raises the possibility of significantsystematic errors in fgs parallaxes and proper motions. we have reanalyzed thearchival hst/fgs data, including (1) a critical redetermination of theparallaxes of the background astrometric reference stars, (2) updated inputvalues of the reference-star proper motions, and (3) correction of the positionmeasurements for color-dependent shifts. our new analysis yields a propermotion of ss cyg that agrees well with the vlbi motion, and an absoluteparallax of 8.30+/-0.41 mas, also statistically concordant with the vlbi resultat the ~1.2 sigma level. our results suggest that hst/fgs parallaxes are freeof large systematic errors, when the data are reduced using high-quality inputvalues for the astrometry of the reference stars, and when instrumentalsignatures are properly removed.

1307.7123	binary cepheids: separations and mass ratios in $5\,m_\odot$ binaries	deriving the distribution of binary parameters for a particular class ofstars over the full range of orbital separations usually requires thecombination of results from many different observing techniques (radialvelocities, interferometry, astrometry, photometry, direct imaging), each withselection biases. however, cepheids---cool, evolved stars of $\sim$$5\,m_\odot$---are a special case because ultraviolet spectra will immediatelyreveal any companion star hotter than early type a, {\it regardless of theorbital separation}. we have used {\it international ultraviolet explorer}(\iue) uv spectra of a complete sample of all 76 cepheids brighter than v=8 tocreate a list of {\it all 18} cepheids with companions more massive than $2.0\,m_\odot$. orbital periods of many of these binaries are available fromradial-velocity studies, or can be estimated for longer-period systems fromdetected velocity variability. in an imaging survey with the {\it hubble spacetelescope} wide field camera 3, we resolved three of the companions (those of$\eta$ aql, s nor, and v659 cen), allowing us to make estimates of the periodsout to the long-period end of the distribution. combining these separationswith orbital data in the literature, we derive an unbiased distribution ofbinary separations, orbital periods, and mass ratios. the distribution oforbital periods shows that the $5\, m_\odot$ binaries have systematicallyshorter periods than do $1\, m_\odot$ stars. our data also suggest that thedistribution of mass ratios depends both on binary separation and systemmultiplicity. the distribution of mass ratios as a function of orbitalseparation, however, does not depend on whether a system is a binary or atriple.

1401.0239	microlensing events by proxima centauri in 2014 and 2016: opportunities  for mass determination and possible planet detection	we have found that proxima centauri, the star closest to our sun, will passclose to a pair of faint background stars in the next few years. using hubblespace telescope (hst) images obtained in 2012 october, we determine that thepassage close to a mag 20 star will occur in 2014 october (impact parameter1.6"), and to a mag 19.5 star in 2016 february (impact parameter 0.5"). asproxima passes in front of these stars, the relativistic deflection of lightwill cause shifts in the positions of the background stars by ~0.5 and 1.5 mas,respectively, readily detectable by hst imaging, and possibly by gaia andground-based facilities such as vlt. measurement of these astrometric shiftsoffers a unique and direct method to measure the mass of proxima. moreover, ifproxima has a planetary system, the planets may be detectable through theiradditional microlensing signals, although the probability of such detections issmall. with astrometric accuracies of 0.03 mas (achievable with hst spatialscanning), centroid shifts caused by jovian planets are detectable atseparations of up to 2.0" (corresponding to 2.6 au at the distance of proxima),and centroid shifts by earth-mass planets are detectable within a small band of8 mas (corresponding to 0.01 au) around the source trajectories. jovian planetswithin a band of about 28 mas (corresponding to 0.036 au) around the sourcetrajectories would produce a brightening of the source by &gt;0.01 mag and couldhence be detectable. estimated timescales of the astrometric and photometricmicrolensing events due to a planet range from a few hours to a few days, andboth methods would provide direct measurements of the planetary mass.

0806.4904	direct detection of the close companion of polaris with the hubble space  telescope	polaris, the nearest and brightest classical cepheid, is a single-linedspectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 30 years. using the highresolution channel of the advanced camera for surveys onboard the hubble spacetelescope (hst) at a wavelength of ~2255\aa, we have directly detected thefaint companion at a separation of 0\farcs17. a second hst observation 1.04 yrlater confirms orbital motion in a retrograde direction. by combining our twomeasures with the spectroscopic orbit of kamper and an analysis of thehipparcos and fk5 proper motions by wielen et al., we find a mass for polarisaa of 4.5^{+2.2}_{-1.4} m_\odot--the first purely dynamical mass determined forany cepheid. for the faint companion polaris ab we find a dynamical mass of1.26^{+0.14}_{-0.07} m_\odot, consistent with an inferred spectral type of f6 vand with the flux difference of 5.4 mag observed at 2255\aa. the magnitudedifference at the v band is estimated to be 7.2 mag. continued hst observationswill significantly reduce the mass errors, which are presently still too largeto provide critical constraints on the roles of convective overshoot, massloss, rotation, and opacities in the evolution of intermediate-mass stars.  our astrometry, combined with two centuries of archival measurements, alsoconfirms that the well-known, more distant (18") visual companion, polaris b,has a nearly common proper motion with that of the aa,ab pair. this isconsistent with orbital motion in a long-period bound system. the ultravioletbrightness of polaris b is in accordance with its known f3 v spectral type ifit has the same distance as polaris aa,ab.

astro-ph;0007190	hubble space telescope observations of the planetary nebula k648 in the  globular cluster m15	we have obtained observations of the planetary nebula k648 in the galacticglobular cluster m15 with the hubble space telescope's wfpc2 camera, coveringan interval of 7 days. the frames provide both time-sampled broad-bandphotometry of the central star and high-resolution images of the nebula in thelight of h-alpha, [oiii], and [nii]. in the deep narrow-band images, k648 is afairly typical double-shelled elliptical, but with a bright arc at one end ofthe major axis that is especially prominent in [nii]; this feature is probablya collection of fliers. the nebula is surrounded by a faint, smooth ellipticalhalo, which appears undisturbed by any interaction with the interstellarmedium. adopting teff = 40,000 +- 3,000 k based upon published spectral-lineanalyses, and employing our new broad-band optical flux data along with theknown cluster distance, we find log l/l_sun = 3.78 +- 0.08 for the k648 centralstar. theoretical post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolutionary tracks imply a massof 0.60 +- 0.02 m_sun for this luminosity, which is significantly higher thanthe mean mass of white dwarfs in globular clusters and the halo field (0.50 +-0.02). the k648 central star exhibits no significant photometric variability inour data; thus we find no direct evidence of a close binary companion. wesuggest that the progenitor of k648 experienced mass augmentation in aclose-binary merger, allowing it to evolve to a remnant of higher mass thanthose of the single stars in the cluster.

astro-ph;0104096	post-agb stars in globular clusters and galactic halos	we discuss three aspects of post-agb (pagb) stars in old populations. (1) hstphotometry of the nucleus of the planetary nebula (pn) k 648 in the globularcluster (gc) m15 implies a mass of 0.60 msun, in contrast to the mean masses ofwhite dwarfs in gcs of ~0.5 msun. this suggests that k 648 is descended from amerged binary, and we infer that single pop ii stars do not produce visiblepne. (2) yellow pagb stars are the visually brightest stars in old populations(mv ~ -3.3) and are easily recognizable because of their large balmer jumps;thus they show great promise as a pop ii standard candle. two yellow pagb starsin the gc ngc 5986 have the same v magnitudes to within +/-0.05 mag, supportingan expected narrow luminosity function. (3) using ccd photometry and a u filterlying below the balmer jump, we have detected yellow pagb stars in the halo ofm31 and in its dwarf elliptical companion ngc 205. with the milky way zeropoint, we reproduce the cepheid distance to m31, and find that ngc 205 is ~100kpc further away than m31. the star counts imply a yellow pagb lifetime ofabout 25,000 yr, and their luminosities imply masses near 0.53 msun.

astro-ph;0106400	detection of coronal mass ejections in v471 tauri with the hubble space  telescope	v471 tauri, an eclipsing system consisting of a hot da white dwarf (wd) and adk2 companion in a 12.5-hour orbit, is the prototype of the pre-cataclysmicbinaries. the late-type component is magnetically active, due to its beingconstrained to rotate synchronously with the short orbital period. during aprogram of uv spectroscopy of v471 tau, carried out with the goddard highresolution spectrograph (ghrs) onboard the hubble space telescope, weserendipitously detected two episodes in which transient absorptions in the siiii 1206 a resonance line appeared suddenly, on a timescale of &lt;2 min. theobservations were taken in a narrow spectral region around ly-alpha, and wereall obtained near the two quadratures of the binary orbit, i.e., at maximumprojected separation (~3.3 rsun) of the wd and k star.  we suggest that these transient features arise when coronal mass ejections(cme's) from the k2 dwarf pass across the line of sight to the wd. estimates ofthe velocities, densities, and masses of the events in v471 tau are generallyconsistent with the properties of solar cme's. given our detection of 2 eventsduring 6.8 hr of ghrs observing, along with a consideration of the restrictedrange of latitudes and longitudes on the k star's surface that can give rise totrajectories passing in front of the wd as seen from earth, we estimate thatthe active v471 tau dk star emits some 100-500 cme's per day, as compared to1-3 per day for the sun. the k dwarf's mass-loss rate associated with cme's isat least (5-25) x 10^{-14} msun/yr, but it may well be orders of magnitudehigher if most of the silicon is in ionization states other than si iii.

astro-ph;0108386	hubble space telescope spectroscopy of v471 tauri: oversized k star,  paradoxical white dwarf	we have used the ghrs onboard the hst to obtain lyman-alpha spectra of thehot white-dwarf (wd) component of the short-period eclipsing da+dk2pre-cataclysmic binary v471 tauri, a member of the hyades star cluster. radialvelocities of the wd, combined with ground-based measurements of the dkvelocities, eclipse timings, and a determination of the dk star's rotationalvelocity, yield dynamical masses for the components of m(wd)=0.84 andm(dk)=0.93 msun. model-atmosphere fitting of the ly-alpha profile provides theeffective temperature (34,500 k) and surface gravity (log g=8.3) of the wd. theradius of the dk component is 18% larger than that of a normal hyades dwarf ofthe same mass. this expansion is attributed to the extensive coverage of thesurface by starspots, causing the star to expand in response. the wd radius,determined from a radiometric analysis and from eclipse ingress timings, is0.0107 rsun. the position of the star in the m-r plane is in full accord withtheory for a degenerate co wd. the high temperature and mass of the wd presentan evolutionary paradox: the wd is the most massive known in the hyades, butalso the hottest and youngest. we suggest that the explanation is that the wdis indeed very young, and is descended from a triple consisting of a bluestraggler and a more-distant dk companion. we estimate that the common-envelopeefficiency parameter, alpha_ce, was of order 0.3-1.0, in good agreement withrecent hydrodynamical simulations.

astro-ph;0303513	an energetic stellar outburst accompanied by circumstellar light echoes	some classes of stars, including supernovae and novae, undergo explosiveoutbursts that eject stellar material into space. in 2002, the previouslyunknown variable star v838 monocerotis brightened suddenly by a factor of about10^4. unlike a supernova or nova, v838 mon did not explosively eject its outerlayers; rather, it simply expanded to become a cool supergiant with amoderate-velocity stellar wind. superluminal light echoes were discovered aslight from the outburst propagated into surrounding, pre-existing circumstellardust. here we report high-resolution imaging and polarimetry of the lightechoes, which allow us to set direct geometric distance limits to the object.at a distance of &gt;6 kpc, v838 mon at its maximum brightness was temporarily thebrightest star in the milky way. the presence of the circumstellar dust impliesthat previous eruptions have occurred, and spectra show it to be a binarysystem. when combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behavior,these characteristics indicate that v838 mon represents a hitherto unknown typeof stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physicalexplanation.

astro-ph;0610793	a young stellar cluster surrounding the peculiar eruptive variable v838  monocerotis	the unusual variable star v838 monocerotis underwent an eruption in 2002. itcontinues to illuminate a spectacular series of light echoes, as the outburstlight is scattered from circumstellar dust. v838 mon has an unresolved b3 vcompanion star.  we serendipitously discovered that a neighboring 16th-mag star is also oftype b. we then carried out a survey of other stars in the vicinity, revealingtwo more b-type stars within 45" of v838 mon. we have determined the distanceto this sparse, young cluster, based on spectral classification and photometricmain-sequence fitting of the three b stars. the cluster distance is found to be6.2+-1.2 kpc, in excellent agreement with the geometric distance to v838 mon of5.9 kpc obtained from hubble space telescope polarimetry of the light echoes.  using our distance determination, we show that the b3 v companion of v838 monis sufficient to account for the entire luminosity of the star measured onsurvey photographs before its outburst. the b3 star is currently, however,about 1 mag fainter than before the eruption, suggesting that it is nowsuffering extinction due to dust ejected from v838 mon. considerations of thepre-outburst luminosity and cluster age appear to leave stellar-collision or-merger scenarios as one of the remaining viable explanations for the outburstof v838 mon.

astro-ph;9507109	hubble space telescope observations of white dwarfs in the globular  cluster m4	with the wide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2) on the hubble space telescope,we have discovered in m4 (ngc 6121, c 1620-264) the first extensive sequence ofcooling white dwarfs seen in a globular cluster. adopting a distance modulus of(m-m)_v = 12.65 and a reddening of e(b-v) = 0.37, we show that the sequence,which extends over 9 &lt; m_u &lt; 13, is comprised of white dwarfs of mass \sim 0.5m_{\odot}. the total mass loss from the present turnoff to the white dwarfsequence is 0.31 m_{\odot} and the intrinsic dispersion in the mean massappears to be &lt; 0.05 m_{\odot}. both the location of the white dwarf coolingsequence in the cluster color-magnitude diagram and the cumulative luminosityfunction attest to the basic correctness and completeness of the physics intheoretical models for the upper three magnitudes of the observed white dwarfcooling sequence. to test the theory in globular clusters at cooling agesbeyond \sim 3 \times 10^8 years will require deeper and more complete data.

astro-ph;9601072	age gradient and the second parameter problem in the galactic halo	we establish a framework for determing absolute ages of galactic globularclusters and then use these ages to investigate the age-metallicity andage-galactocentric distance relations for the 36 clusters with the mostreliable age data. the clusters span galactocentric distances from 4 through100 kpc and cover a metallicity range from $[fe/h] = -0.6$ to $-2.3$. adoptingcurrently plausible choices for the relation between cluster metallicity andhorizontal-branch luminosity, and alpha-enhancement ratios, we find that themajority of the globular clusters form an age distribution with a dispersion$\sigma(t)$ about $10^9$ years, and a total age spread smaller than 4 gyr.clusters in the lowest metallicity group ($[fe/h] &lt; -1.8$) appear to be thesame age to well within 1 gyr at all locations in the milky way halo,suggesting that star formation began throughout the halo nearly simultaneouslyin its earliest stages. we find no statistically significant correlationbetween mean cluster age and galactocentric distance (no age gradient) from 4to 100 kpc. the correlation between cluster age and horizontal-branch typesuggests that causes in addition to metallicity and age are required tounderstand the distribution of stars along the horizontal branches in globularcluster color-magnitude diagrams.

astro-ph;9702008	post-agb stars as standard extragalactic candles	stars evolving off the asymptotic giant branch and passing through spectraltypes f and a are excellent candidates for a new extragalactic candle. thesepost-agb (pagb) stars are the brightest members of population ii systems. theyshould have a narrow luminosity function, bounded from above by the shortertransition times of more massive and more luminous remnants, and from below bythe core mass corresponding to the lowest-mass stars that are leaving the mainsequence. moreover, pagb a-f supergiants are easily recognized because of theirenormous balmer jumps, and should lie both in ellipticals and the halos ofspirals. i describe a photometric system that combines gunn u with the standardbvi bandpasses, and report a successful search for pagb stars in the halo ofm31 using this ubvi system. the zero-point calibration will come from pagb aand f stars in galactic globular clusters. four are presently known, and have amean mv = -3.4 with a scatter of only 0.2 mag. with this mv we exactlyreproduce the accepted m31 distance from its halo pagb stars. future plansinclude a ubvi survey of milky way globular clusters and local group galaxiesin order to strengthen the zero-point calibration. ultimately we can reach thevirgo cluster through a distance ladder with only three rungs: subdwarfparallaxes, milky way globular clusters, and then directly to virgo (with hst).

astro-ph;9702169	white dwarfs in globular clusters: hst observations of m4	using wfpc2 on the hubble space telescope, we have isolated a sample of 258white dwarfs (wds) in the galactic globular cluster m4. fields at three radialdistances from the cluster center were observed and sizeable wd populationswere found in all three. the location of these wds in the color-magnitudediagram, their mean mass of 0.51($ \pm 0.03$)m$_{\odot}$, and their luminosityfunction confirm basic tenets of stellar evolution theory and support theresults from current wd cooling theory. the wds are used to extend the clustermain-sequence mass function upward to stars that have already completed theirnuclear evolution. the wd/red dwarf binary frequency in m4 is investigated andfound to be at most a few percent of all the main-sequence stars. the mostancient wds found are about 9 gyr old, a level which is set solely by thephotometric limits of our data. even though this is less than the age of m4, wediscuss how these cooling wds can eventually be used to check the turnoff agesof globular clusters and hence constrain the age of the universe.

astro-ph;9809176	ages for globular clusters in the outer galactic halo: the second  parameter clusters palomar~3, palomar~4 and eridanus	we have used the wfpc2 camera on the hubble space telescope to obtainphotometry of the outer-halo globular clusters palomar 3, palomar 4, anderidanus. these three are classic examples of the "second parameter" anomalybecause of their red horizontal-branch morphologies in combination with theirlow-to-intermediate metallicities. our color-magnitude diagrams in (v, v-i)reach $v_{lim} \simeq 27.0$, clearly delineating the subgiant and turnoffregions and about three magnitudes of the unevolved main sequences. the slopesand dereddened colors of the giant branches are consistent with published[fe/h] estimates that rank the clusters (pal 3, eridanus, pal 4) in order ofincreasing metallicity, with all three falling near or between the abundancevalues of the classic nearby halo clusters m3 and m5. differential fits oftheir color-magnitude diagrams are made to each other and to m3 and m5 forrelative age determinations. we find that the three outer-halo cluster cmdsdiffer from the nearby clusters in a way that is consistent with their beingyounger by $\sim 1.5 - 2 $gyr, if we have correctly estimated the clusters'chemical-abundance ratios. conversely, the inferred age difference could besmaller ($\ltsim 1 $gyr) if either [fe/h] or [$\alpha$/fe] for the outer-haloclusters is significantly lower than we have assumed. possible age spreads oforder 1$ $gyr among both the nearby and outer-halo clusters may also bepresent.

astro-ph;9904043	a hubble space telescope survey for resolved companions of  planetary-nebula nuclei	we report results of an hst "snapshot" survey aimed at finding resolvedbinary companions of the central stars of galactic planetary nebulae (pne).using wf/pc and wfpc2, we searched the fields of 113 pne for stars whose closeproximity to the central star suggests a physical association. we find 10binary nuclei that are very likely to be physically associated, and another sixthat are possible binary associations. by correcting for interstellarextinction and placing the central stars' companions on the main sequence, wederive distances to the objects, and thereby significantly increase the numberof pne with reliable distances.  comparison of our derived distances with those obtained from variousstatistical methods shows that all of the latter have systematicallyoverestimated the distances, by factors ranging up to a factor of two or more.we show that this error is most likely due to the fact that the properties ofour pne with binary nuclei are systematically different from those of pne usedheretofore to calibrate statistical methods. specifically, our pne tend to havelower surface brightnesses at the same physical radius than the traditionalcalibration objects. this difference may arise from a selection effect: the pnein our survey are typically nearby, old nebulae, whereas most of the objectsthat calibrate statistical techniques are low-latitude,high-surface-brightness, and more distant nebulae. as a result, the statisticalmethods that seem to work well with samples of distant pne, e.g., those in thegalactic bulge or external galaxies, may not be applicable to the more diversepopulation of local pne.

0811.2943	comments on "the long-period galactic cepheid rs puppis. i. a geometric  distance from its light echoes"	the luminous galactic cepheid rs puppis is unique in being surrounded by adust nebula illuminated by the variable light of the cepheid. in a recent paperin this journal, kervella et al. (2008) report a very precise geometricdistance to rs pup, based on measured phase lags of the light variations ofindividual knots in the reflection nebula. in this commentary, we examine thevalidity of the distance measurement, as well as the reality of the spatialstructure of the nebula determined by feast (2008) based upon the phase lags ofthe knots. {kervella et al. assumed that the illuminated dust knots lie, onaverage, in the plane of the sky (otherwise it is not possible to derive ageometric distance from direct imaging of light echoes). we consider thebiasing introduced by the high efficiency of forward scattering. we concludethat most of the knots are in fact likely to lie in front of the plane of thesky, thus invalidating the kervella et al. result. we also show that the flatequatorial disk structure determined by feast is unlikely; instead, themorphology of the nebula is more probably bipolar, with a significant tilt ofits axis with respect to the plane of the sky. although the kervella et al.distance result is invalidated, we show that high-resolution polarimetricimaging has the potential to yield a valid geometric distance to this importantcepheid.

0812.0023	the wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program: a first look at resolved  stellar population tools	[abridged] when wfc3 is installed on hst, the community will have powerfulnew tools for investigating resolved stellar populations. the wfc3 galacticbulge treasury program will obtain deep imaging on 4 low-extinction fields.these non-proprietary data will enable a variety of science investigations notpossible with previous data sets. to aid in planning for the use of these dataand for future proposals, we provide an introduction to the program, itsphotometric system, and the associated calibration effort.  the observing strategy is based upon a new 5-band photometric system spanningthe uv, optical, and near-infrared. with these broad bands, one can constructreddening-free indices of teff and [fe/h]. besides the 4 bulge fields, theprogram will target 6 fields in well-studied star clusters, spanning a widerange of [fe/h]. the cluster data serve to calibrate the indices, providepopulation templates, and correct the transformation of isochrones into thewfc3 photometric system. the bulge data will shed light on the bulge formationhistory, and will also serve as population templates for other studies. one ofthe fields includes 12 candidate hosts of extrasolar planets.  cmds are the most popular tool for analyzing resolved stellar populations.however, due to degeneracies among teff, [fe/h], and reddening in traditionalcmds, it can be difficult to draw robust conclusions from the data. the 5-bandsystem used for the bulge treasury observations will provide indices that areroughly orthogonal in teff and [fe/h], and we argue that model fitting in anindex-index diagram will make better use of the information than fittingseparate cmds. we provide simulations to show the expected data quality and thepotential for differentiating between different star-formation histories.
