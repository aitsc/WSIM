84928891072	Development and application of dualistic model the Haihe river basin	In order to completely resolve the "natural-artificial" dualistic characteristics of water cycle in the Haihe River Basin, which are caused by high intensity of human activities on water resources and water environment of the basin, the dualistic model is developed. The dualistic model is established by coupling a distributed hydrological and water quality model (WEP-L), a water resources allocation model (ROWAS) and a multi-objective decision-making analysis model (DAMOS). In the simulation and calculation of the model, two-hierarchy coupling and mutual feedback is adopted for the three models to simulate the "natural-artificial" dualistic water cycle process affected by intensity human activities in Haihe River Basin. In the process, the Haihe river basin is subdivided into 11752 hydrological simulation units and 125 planning and management units, and debugging and simulations of 50 years from 1956 to 2005 are carried out. The result shows that the simulation accuracy of established dualistic model is acceptable. Based on the acceptable accuracy, 9 scenarios are analyzed and simulated in the dualistic model, and the paper gives the results of the basin-level seven total amount control index including controls of withdraw on surface water and underground water, controls of water use for national economy and ecological environment, controls of pollution outlet, controls of evapotranspiration (ET) and water into the sea, and so on.

23044476690	Distributed hydrologic modeling in a partially urbanized agricultural watershed using water and energy transfer process model	The water and energy transfer process (WEP) model, which has been successfully applied to urbanized watersheds, is improved for hydrologic modeling in an agricultural watershed by developing a paddy model. The new model is used to simulate the Yata watershed at 100 m grid size and variable time step. A 4 year 3 month simulation is performed for model calibration and verification. Model results are compared to measured values of river discharges, groundwater levels, and soil moisture contents. Sensitivity of annual water budgets and hourly river discharges to rainfall estimation error is also analyzed. The verified model is applied to simulate the long-term variation of water budgets and flood-retarding effects of paddy fields in the watershed. Study results indicate that: (1) the WEP model is applicable to agricultural watersheds in addition to urbanized ones; (2) annual weather variations give more obvious impact on water budgets than urbanization in the agricultural watershed; and (3) paddy fields play important roles both in reducing flood peaks and in conserving low river flow in the watershed.

33745304274	Distributed model of hydrological cycle system in Heihe River basin. I. Model development and Verification	The GIS technique is applied as a data processing plateform to develop a distributed model for simulating the hydrological cycle system in the Heihe River basin, namely WEP-HeiHe. The physical mechanism of hydrological cycle and the artificial system of water utilization in the basin are considered. The structure of the model is introduced. The simulation consists of two aspects: hydrological cycle and energy cycle. The hydrological process components include evapotranspiration, infiltration, runoff, movement of ground water, interaction between groundwater and river water, overland flow, river flow and artificial cycle process of water utilization. The parameters of the model are calibrated by 5 years runoff data obtained from the Yingluoxia Hydrological station. The validity of the model is verified by the simulation calculation of runoff variation process in 1981 to 2002. It shows that the proposed model can be applied to forecast the evolution of river basin water resources under the conditions of changing environment.

Based on the concept of value, a new definition of soil water resources is suggested and the importance of assessing the soil water resources is expounded. The soil water resources are defined as the regional suspended water, which can be directly utilized for producing and living of mankind. The index system for assessment is established. It includes four indexes: the amount of water which can be absorbed by the plants, the maximum utilizable amount of water, the amount of water which can be used for developing national economy and the amount of water for maintaining and recovering the eco-environment. The methods for calculating these indexes are proposed.

33646728190	Method for delineation and codification of a large basin based on DEM and surveyed river network	This paper presents a method to subdivide and code a large river basin with the aid of GIS techniques. By overlapping the surveyed watercourses on the DEM, the elevation values of some convex cells in rivers are modified to remove the large-size falsely-closed depressions. Then a river network consistent with the surveyed river network is extracted from the modified DEM. The extracted river network is coded prior to subdivision and codification of the river basin. This paper also brings forward the improvement to the Pfafstetter coding rule because the area sizes of sub-basins at the lowest level may be quite uneven if the rule is directly adopted. The river network and the basin are coded according to the improved Pfafstetter coding rule. All tasks of codification are automatically accomplished by using a program developed in this study. The suggested method is applied to the Yellow River basin and the whole drainage basin is divided into 8255 sub-basins, of which each is assigned with a Pfafstetter code.

33747465058	Distributed model of hydrological cycle system in Heihe river basin II. Applications	The water budgets and spatial-temporal variations of hydrological cycle components in the Heihe river basin are studied by using the distributed hydrological model developed by the authors. The river flows including the monthly runoff in a year and the flow in dry season and flood season are forecasted. Furthermore, the model is also utilized to forecast the discharges of small rivers in front of mountains and lateral infiltration of groundwater from mountains, and predict the possible changes of the water budgets in the basin when the underlying conditions are changed. The results show that the model can systematically describe the water budgets and their spatial-temporal variations in the basin and precisely forecast river flows in dry season. The predicted water budgets for changed underlying conditions by using this model show that in spite of the forest for water conservation may cause the slight increase of interception evaporation but it reduces the evaporation of soil, so that the total evapotranspiration will not significantly increase. The forest for water conservation makes the runoff outcome from mountains slightly decreased but the storage of soil water and groundwater will increase. The countermeasure of changing the cultivated farmland into grassland is effective in increasing the river flow and decreasing the deficit of groundwater storage caused by over exploitation in the middle reaches area of the basin.

33750692699	Development of the WEP-L distributed hydrological model and dynamic assessment of water resources in the Yellow River basin	Dynamic assessment of water resources becomes desirable to reflect water resources variations in the basins under strong human impacts. A physically based distributed hydrological model, WEP-L, which couples simulations of natural hydrological processes and water use processes, is developed for the purpose. Concepts of special water resources (i.e., surface water resources and groundwater resources) and general water resources (i.e., the special water resources plus the precipitation directly utilized by ecosystem) are proposed, and an approach for dynamic assessment of water resources is suggested. Basin subdivision, classification of land covers, and deduction of water use spatial/temporal distributions in the Yellow River basin are carried out with the aid of remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The basin is subdivided into 8485 sub-watersheds and 38,720 contour bands, and the WEP-L model is verified by comparing simulated and observed discharges at main gage stations. Lastly, continuous simulations of 45 years (1956-2000) in variable time steps (from 1 h to 1 day) are performed for various land cover and water use conditions, and water resources assessment results under present condition of land cover and water use are compared with those under historical condition of land cover and water use. The study results reveal that: (1) the surface water resources reduced, but the groundwater resources non-overlapped with the surface water resources increased under the impact of human activities in the Yellow River basin; and (2) the special water resources reduced, but the general water resources increased accompanied with increase of the precipitation directly utilized by ecosystem in the basin. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The application results illustrate that the suggested model and approach are capable of assessing runoffs-typed water resources and rainfalls-typed water resources utilized by ecosystems, and analyzing the obvious changes of general water resources and various components in the basin under the impacts of strong human activities. The contrast of the assessment results under the land cover conditions of 1985 and 2000 reveals that land cover condition changes caused by water and soil conservation, cultivated land construction and water taking activities make the special water resources in the basin decreased(surface water resources deceased but the non-overlapped groundwater resources increased) and the total general water resources increased, and the high-efficiently utilized rainfalls increased much more than the decreased runoffs-typed water resources. Last, the paper discusses the hints of the research results to water safety strategy in the Yellow River basin and sustainable and efficient development of water resources in China.

Eight cases are described: Case I, the precipitation data in 1956-1979, the underlying surface data in 2000 and the zero water use; case 2, the precipitation data in 1980-2000, the underlying surface data in 2000 and the zero water use; case 3, the precipitation data in 1956-2000, the underlying surface data in 2000 and the zero water use; case 4, the precipitation data in 1956-2000, the underlying surface data in 2000 and the real water use; case 5, the precipitation data in 1956-2000, the underlying surface data in 1956-2000 and the zero water use; case 6, the precipitation data in 1956-2000, the underlying surface data in 2000 and the zero water use; case 7, the precipitation data in 1956-1979, the underlying surface data in 1956-1979 and the zero water use; and Case 8, the precipitation data in 1980-2000, the underlying surface data in 2000 and the real water use. The comparison of case 1 and case 2 show that 4.5% reduction of precipitation causes the decrease in water resources in all forms: 18.4% surface water resources and groundwater resources, 15.8% not overlapped with surface water resources, 18.3% special water resources, 2.1% precipitation effective utilization and 4.6% general water resources. In case 4, the surface water resources reduce by 4.6% but the not-overlapped groundwater resources and surface water increase by 113.5%, and the special water resources decrease by 0.4% but the general water resources increase by 0.7%, and 0.9% increase of the precipitation effective utilization compared with that in case 4. Comparing with the water resources in case 5, the special water resources decrease by 4.3% with 4.3% and 2.8% decrease of not-overlapped surface water resources and groundwater resources, while the general water resources increase by 5.3% with 7.1% increase of the precipitation effective utilization in case 6. In case 8, the general water resources decrease by 25.8% with 30.6% decrease of surface water and 114.5% increase of not-overlapped the groundwater and surface water, and the precipitation effective utilization and the general water resources increase by 7.1 % and 5.3% compared with that in case 7.

40349089485	Study on consumption efficiency of soil water resources in the Yellow River Basin based on regional ET structure	Based on the regional water resources character, the concept of soil water resources is first redefined, and then associated with their transfer relationship in the hydrological cycle, Evapotranspiration (ET)-based consumption structure and consumption efficiency of soil water resources are analyzed. According to ET's function in productivity, the consumption efficiency of soil water resources is divided into three classes: high efficient consumption from vegetation transpiration, low efficient consumption from soil evaporation among plants with high vegetation coverage and inefficient consumption from soil evaporation among plants with low vegetation coverage and bare soil evaporation. The high efficient and low efficient consumption were further classified as productive consumption. The inefficient consumption is considered non-productive consumption because it is significant in the whole hydrological cycle process. Finally, according to these categories, and employing a WEP-L distributed hydrological model, this paper analyzes the consumption efficiency of soil water resources in the Yellow River Basin. The results show that there are 2078.89 × 10

84861656102	Fingerprint-based attribution study of climatic changes in the Hai River Basin of china	Many observational facts and studies have shown that the climatic conditions in the Hai River Basin, which is the political and cultural centre of China, changed significantly over last half of the 20th century. This study attempts to evaluate the variability of climatic elements such as precipitation and temperature in the basin based on observed meteorological data, and the temporal variations and sudden changes of precipitation and temperature during past 40 years (1961-2000) are analyzed combining moving-average and linear regression with Mann-Kendall method. In addition, the observed climatic changes are attributed to different factors including natural variability and anthropogenic forcing using the fingerprint-based attribution method. The results indicate that: 1) during 1961-2000, the precipitation slightly decreased and the estimated sudden change time was 1965, the temperature significantly increased and the estimated sudden change time was 1964; 2) natural climate variability may be the factors responsible for the observed precipitation changes during the past 40 years in the basin, while anthropogenic forcing may be the main factors responsible for the observed temperature changes during the past 40 years in the basin. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84887508343	Parameter optimization of distributed hydrological model with a modified dynamically dimensioned search algorithm	A modified version of the dynamically dimensioned search (MDDS) is introduced for automatic calibration of watershed simulation models. The distinguishing feature of the MDDS is that the algorithm makes full use of sensitivity information in the optimization procedure. The Latin hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) technique is used to calculate the sensitivity information of every parameter in the model. The performance of the MDDS is compared to that of the dynamically dimensioned search (DDS), the DDS identifying only the most sensitive parameters, and the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) method, respectively, for calibration of the easy distributed hydrological model (EasyDHM). The comparisons range from 500 to 5000 model evaluations per optimization trial. The results show the following: the MDDS algorithm outperforms the DDS algorithm, the DDS algorithm identifying the most sensitive parameters, and the SCE algorithm within a specified maximum number of function evaluations (fewer than 5000); the MDDS algorithm shows robustness compared with the DDS algorithm when the maximum number of model evaluations is less than 2500; the advantages of the MDDS algorithm are more obvious for a high-dimensional distributed hydrological model, such as the EasyDHM model; and the optimization results from the MDDS algorithm are not very sensitive to either the variance (between 0.3 and 1) for randn' used in the MDDS algorithm or the number of strata used in the Latin hypercube (LH) sampling. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

43249106265	Impact of climate change on runoff process in headwater area of the Yellow River	The impact of temperature and precipitation changes on annual and monthly runoff process in headwater area of the Yellow River was analyzed by using WEP-L model. The model was calibrated and verified by the 45 years observed meteorological data obtained from the Tannaihai Hydrological Station. On this basis, the simulation of 8-climate change scenarios was carried out. The results indicate that the increase of atmospheric temperature causes the decrease of annual runoff, the runoff significantly reduced from May to October due to the increase of evaporation but it will increase from November to April of next year because of the melting of snow and the change of infiltration characteristics caused by frozen. The variation of precipitation may directly affect the change of runoff, but the variation rate of runoff is larger than the change rate of precipitation.

43849083849	Integrated modeling and assessment of water resources and water environment in the Yellow River Basin	An integrated model is established to simulate both hydrological processes and accompanied pollutant transfer processes in the Yellow River Basin. The model couples distributed hydrological model WEP-L (Water and Energy transfer Processes in Large river basins) and a newly developed water quality module which includes simulation functions of soil erosion and sediment transport, and non-point and point sources transfer to rivers. To overcome the defects of traditional water quality assessment, two aspects of improvement are conducted. One is the improvement of the traditional characteristic channel length approach, i.e., the product of multiplying channel length by lateral section area is selected as a new assessment criterion to reflect the different contributions of small channels and big ones, thus making the assessment results more objective. The other is the suggestion of integrated assessment approach for both water at channel lateral sections and water generated in sub-basins. The assessment results in the Yellow River Basin illustrate: (1) the improved characteristic channel length approach shows rivers of water quality worse than Class III account for 75% whilst the traditional approach give a result of 45%, implying that the actual status of water quality is worse than the traditional understanding; (2) the quality of water generated in sub-basins is much better than the quality of water at channel lateral sections. The assessment results describe the status of water resources quantity and quality from different points of view and thus provide valuable information for the water resources development and management in the basin. © 2007 International Association for Hydraulic Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.

62949219885	Impacts of climate change on hydrological processes and water resources in the headwater area of the Yellow River	The headwater area upstream of the Tang-Nai-Hai hydrological gauge station is one of the main runoff generation areas of the Yellow River Basin. Climate change is one of the main reasons for water resources decrease and ecological deterioration in the headwater area in recent years, and analysing of future further change impact is important for water resources planning and management in the basin. In this article, we simulated the changes of both annual and monthly runoffs in the headstream of the Yellow River under air temperature and precipitation change by using the WEP model. WEP is a physically-based distributed model and can reflect the impact of air temperature change on water resources through evapotranspiration change, snow storage and melting change and infiltration capability change in the frozen soil layer. The model was validated using the observed daily discharge data from 1956 to 2000 at the Tang-Nai-Hai station. After validating the model, we assumed eight different schemes with temperature change of ±1, ±2°C and precipitation change by ±10%, ±20% on the basis of historical observed meteorological data. The results indicated that air temperature change had different impacts on annual and monthly runoffs. The temperature increase causes an annual runoff decrease, with an obvious decrease of monthly runoff from May to October because of the evapotranspiration increase, and an increase from November to the following April because of snow storage and melting, and frozen soil infiltration capability changes. The maximum increase is 63.7% in March, 1989, when assuming the air temperature increase of 2°C. Precipitation increase or decrease causes runoff increase or decrease to different extents, and the runoff has a larger change rate than precipitation. Copyright © 2008 IAHS Press.

It was divided into 320 parts in all streams of the middle and lower reaches of Weihe River in Shanxi Province, China. Through the calculations of hydrological model of ground water and hydrological model of surface flow with dynamic coupling, it would be altogether solved with 3 equations of ground water flow, river flow and slope flow for every part of the river. And they are interdependent for each other in the border conditions and source/sink. Thus a distributed hydrological model was constructed in the watershed water cycle. Data of a hydrological year from the middle and lower reaches of Weihe River were selected and examined with the distributed hydrological model. The results of the model examination showed that it had better representation for the parameters gained from the model simulation. River running value from the model simulation was well corresponded with determination value in the site monitoring. Good simulation precision in the river running simulation which used the model was gained. And relative err of the runoff of Weihe River part in the Hua County from the model calculation and practice monitoring was 7.6% only. The regulation and trend of ground water flow were better reflected in the ground water flow fitting. And then calculation simulated was conducted based on it, then determined that main recharge and discharge of ground water in the middle and lower reaches of Weihe River was rainfall recharge and man - made discharge, calculated resource amount from natural recharge, exploiting potential from shallow ground water, and river water amount was captured by water source exploited from riparian wetland areas in actually conditions. Also, the results showed that distributive hydrological model constructed was simplicity, credibility, and provided better methods and available way for water resource assessment and wetland restoration and protection in middle and lower reaches of Weihe River.

Results indicate that it is important for the ET-based modern water resources management strategy to alleviate water resources scarcity because it may not only avoid unused water wasting but also improve water use efficiency. Therefore, an ET-based modern water resources management scheme is a good complement to the traditional water resources demand management system. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

70350733831	Impacts of climate change on water resources in china and corresponding countermeasures	Climate change is a global problem of great importance for all countries in the world. Because of the limitations on understandings and analysis tools, assessments on impacts of climate change in regions are not completely clear. However, according to investigations by researchers, climate change has affected China remarkably in natural and socioeconomic fields. The paper mainly focuses on impacts of climate change on water resources in China and corresponding respondences to deal with those problems. In the first part, the current and future impacts of climate change on water resources in China are introduced. Climate change has caused the change of distribution of water resources in China, which is already proved by the trends of decreasing runoffs of many rivers in China, especially in the Yellow River, Haihe River and Huaihe River. In the future, water resources may further decrease in northern part of China, while increase in southern regions, which may rise the opportunity of droughts and floods. Water shortage will also be a serious problem in Ningxia and Gansu provinces. Because of impacts of climate change, there are big challenges for the development and protection of water resources in China. To deal with these problems, two aspects of treatments are provided, including mitigation of greenhouse gases outlet and adaption to the climate change. Meanwhile, several detailed measures are also listed in the paper. Climate change is a problem of environment, and it's also a problem of development. Understandings and responses of its impacts on water resources in China must be based on sustainable development.

The optimized scenario is obtained and proposed. Building upon the result of scenario simulations, the future water resources management in the HRB is discussed in the context of controlling of ET, groundwater overexploitation, and flow discharge into the sea. The result shows that in spite of having future water supply from the SNWTP, the measures of strict control of water usages and the consumptions are still essential and necessary in order to gradually reduce the groundwater overexploitation and increase the flow discharge into the Bohai Sea, which will ensure the harmonious development of economy and eco-environment in the HRB.

77957608061	Subject system of modern hydrology and water resources and research frontiers and hot issues	On the basis of identifying water problems at home and abroad, this paper analyses the evolution pattern of the natural-artificial dualistic water cycle, clarifies the interactions among hydrological processes, and associated hydrochemistry, water ecology and flow-sediment processes, as well as preliminarily describes the subject system constitution of modern hydrology and water resources. Based on describing the development trend of international hydrology and water resources and hot issues and frontier problems, and combining with research status of hydrology and water resources and practical demands on solving water problems in China, we discuss the subject system of hydrology and water resources in China, and analyze the important research directions. Under the influences of environmental change and strong human activities, water cycle shows obviously the natural-artificial characters on all aspects of dynamics, structure and parameters. Modern hydrology and water resources research is changing from traditional methodology of decomposition and refinement to present emphasis on integration and crossover, and from single-hydrological-variable oriented research to integrated hydrological processes oriented research. Prototype observation and numerical simulation become a critical study method in these fields. Hydrology and water resources research needs further strengthening on the basic research of mechanism identification and quantitative simulation of the water cycle and associated processes, improving on the application basic research of assessment, allocation and regulation of water resources, water right distribution, and water pricing theory and technology, to serve water-saving society establishment, water environmental protection and ecological construction, integrated water resources management, disaster prevention and mitigation and emergency treatment, drinking water safety, hydraulic engineering construction, and other practical needs.

78349313861	An experimental study on dynamic processes of ephemeral gully erosion in loess landscapes	Ephemeral gully erosion is widespread on the Loess Plateau of China. To provide theoretical support for constructing numerical models and soil-water conservation planning, the hydrodynamic characteristics of ephemeral gully flows were studied by laboratory experiments with a physical model. We firstly concluded that, with the influence of "step-slope-pool" (or "step-pool") terrain on the bottom of gully channels, no obvious or consistent pattern changes were evident in the hydrodynamic parameters along the flow direction. Secondly the change of hydrodynamic parameters during erosion could be classified into an initially fast changing interval followed by a stable period, and the initial adjustment period would become shorter with increasing slope and rainfall intensity. Thirdly ephemeral gully erosion flows were turbulent and changed frequently in space and time between supercritical and subcritical flows. Throughout the experiment, the Reynolds number fluctuated and increased with time. With increasing rainfall intensity and gully slope, the frequency of larger Reynolds numbers increased. In addition, the Froude number also fluctuated, but decreased with time, and the mean Froude number eventually stabilized at ~. 0.5 at different slope angles and rainfall intensities. Fourthly the distribution of erosional energy was influenced mainly by topography in loess slopes. In the case of 20° slopes, the inverse ratios of dissipation as soil erosion, sediment transport, and flow kinetic energy were relatively stable in time and space during ephemeral gully erosion. Moreover, flow velocity, shear stress, the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, and the Manning coefficient were influenced by rainfall intensity to a lesser degree during erosion. In the stable interval, for 15° and 25° slopes, shear stress, the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor and Manning coefficient of ephemeral gully flow both increased with increasing rainfall intensity. Flow velocity on the 15° slope decreased initially then increased with increasing rainfall intensity, but flow velocity on the 25° slope decreased with increasing rainfall intensity. Finally the regularity seen in hydrodynamic parameters of ephemeral gully flows occurred despite disturbance from lateral confluences, gravity erosion of the channel bank, and changes in terrain. The sediment transport capacity of ephemeral gully flows increased with USP by a linear function (r = 0.64, n = 99, P < 0.01). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78751651588	An NDVI-based precipitation interpolation to improve hydrology simulation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River	Spatially interpolated rainfall estimates from raingauges are widely used as input to hydrological models, but there is no universally suitable interpolation method. In southwest China there are very few rain-gauges. Therefore, geographical information related to rainfall needs to be used in spatial interpolation methods. Among elevation, longitude, latitude, slope, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), NDVI is found to be the most optimum geographical information indicator for precipitation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in China, after carefully analysis. Accordingly, a gradient plus reverse distance squared method based on NDVI was developed and applied in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from 1956 to 2000. The interpolation result was compared with the result of Countrywide Water Resources Planning. The difference was not too much and the result of the interpolation showed a reasonable precipitation distribution in the mountainous areas, which was greatly improved compared to the direct use of the inverse-distance weighted method (IDW). And then the interpolation result was input to the Water and Energy transfer Process (WEP) model to simulate the hydrological cycle of the basin. The simulation of the hydrologicalprocesses show that water quantity balance errors are less than 5% and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is above 0.7, which prove that the interpolation method presented in this paper is credible. copyright © 2009 IAHS press.

79960428125	The necessity of inter-basin water transfer analyzed based on the status of Huang-Huai-Hai basin	The Huang-Huai-Hai basin is the major grain producing areas of China, and most of China's energy and chemical industry base are in this area. In the past twenty years, the Yellow River Valley provide water resources with Haihe River Valley and Huaihe River Valley, that support the development of the last two valleys. Now, Huang-Huai-Hai basin is faced with serious water shortage. The middle and east route of south-to-north water transfer project would relieve the shortage of water resources situation of the Haihe River Valley and Huaihe River Valley. But the Yellow River Valley still urgently required more water from other valleys. © 2011 ASCE.

80051617620	Study on impact of east route project of the South-to-North Water Diversion in China	Due to uneven rainfall patterns, water scarcity is plaguing China especially in North China. The South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) project is the biggest hydraulic project ever designed worldwide. The East Route's (ER) mission is to withdraw water from Jiangdu at downstream section of Yangtze River. Under the Sino-Italy cooperation framework in the field of environmental protection, the SWIMER project - the Sustainable Water Integrated Management of the East Route of SNWD was implemented from 2004 to 2006. This paper briefly introduces the general technical framework of the SWIMER project and focuses on the tasks of ROWAS model - Rules-based Objected-oriented Water Allocation Simulation Model. The core work of SWIMER is to develop an integrated water management tool for the water supply area of the East Route by coupling water allocation model, socio-economic model and climate change model. Through iterate application of the ROWAS model, various allocation scenarios of diverted water are provided to the socio-economic model for optimization. The coupling approach is innovative and successfully applied in the study. The major conclusions are: 1) the implementation of the SNWD East Route project will largely contribute to reduce water stress in the area; 2) the water shortages will diminish and water savings will be realised from the exploitation of the groundwater resources; 3) the optimized allocation of the diverted water resources is compatible with the structural and operational constrains of the water diversion network under average and extreme drought conditions; and 4) an integrated management of the East Route project needs a centralised instrument capable of controlling the diverted water resources, that could be built on the basis of the models developed under the SWIMER project. © 2007 ASCE.

80052056512	Predicting inflows to Tangjiashan barrier lake based on WEP model and TRMM precipitation data	In order to solve the problem of simulating and predicting inflows to barrier lakes in ungauged region, this study took Tangjiashan barrier lake as the research object which caused by Wenchuan earthquake on May 12th, 2008. The distributed hydrological Model WEP and the TRMM-based precipitation estimates were combined together and 3 precipitation input scenarios were considered. The average daily inflow to the lake during the forming period of barrier (May 12th-June 9th) was simulated and predicted. The result was compared with the observed inflow during the monitoring period (May 29th-June 9th). It shows that the modified precipitation data (i.e. modified TRMM_PR data by the gauge data, mode 3) can generate more accurate results than the other two modes (i.e. gauge data and TRMM_PR data that directly input to the model). It may conclude that by connecting the distributed model with TRMM_PR data the problems caused by the scarcity of gauge stations can be solved. The modification of TRMM_PR by gauge data can improve the precipitation input of the model and generate more precise simulated results.

81755182767	Variability, change and prediction of hydro-climatic elements in the Hai River basin, China	Many observational facts and studies have shown that the hydro-climatic conditions in the Hai River basin, which is the political and cultural centre of China, changed significantly over last half of the 20th century. This study attempts to evaluate the variability and change of hydro-climatic elements in the basin including precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration and runoff, based on observations and a hydrological model, as well to predict the trends of these elements under a changing environment. Specifically, the temporal variations and sudden changes of precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration and runoff during the last 50 years (1956-2005) in the basin are analysed using the moving-average method, linear regression method and Mann-Kendall method. For future conditions, the precipitation and temperature data are obtained from the average data set of 20 global climate models using the REA (reliability ensemble averaging) method, together with future land-use data based on national land-use planning documents, and evapotranspiration and runoff data obtained through hydrological model simulations. Thus, the prediction of the elements under a changing environment can be given. The results indicate that: (1) during 1956-2005, the temperature significantly increased and the estimated sudden change time was 1964, while the precipitation and evapotranspiration significantly decreased and the estimated sudden change time was 1961, the surface runoff also significantly decreased and the estimated sudden change time was 1963; (2) during 2021-2050, evapotranspiration will increase by 7.1%, surface runoff will decrease by 9.8% and the variation within a year may increase; runoff in flood seasons especially July and August may increase, but decrease in the remaining months. This study may provide decision support for integrated management and planning of water resources in the highly water-stressed basin. © 2011 IAHS Press.

84855250003	Coupling crop growth and hydrologic models to predict crop yield with spatial analysis technologies	This paper analyzes climate change impact on crop yield of winter wheat, a main crop in the water-stressed Haihe River Basin in North China. An integrated analysis was carried out by coupling the World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop growth model and the distributed hydrological model describing the water and energy transfer processes in large river basins (WEP-L). Various spatial analysis technologies, including remote sensing and geographical information system, were woven together to support model calibration and validation. The WOFOST model was calibrated and validated using the winter wheat data collected in two successive years. Effort was then extended to calibrate and validate the WEP-L distributed hydrologic model for the whole basin. Such an effort was collectively supported by using the remote sensing evapotranspiration and biomass data, the in situ river flow data, and the wheat yield statistical data. With this integration, the wheat yield from 2010 to 2030 can be predicted under the given climate change impact corresponding to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios. Given the prescribed climate change scenarios, at the basin-scale, the winter wheat yield may increase in terms of the annual average; however, the long-term trend is geared toward a decreasing yield with significant fluctuations. The colder hilly areas with current lower yield may significantly increase due to possible future temperature rise while the warmer plain areas with current higher yield may slightly increase or decrease. Despite the data collected thus far, it is evident that further studies are needed to reduce the uncertainties of these predictions of climate change effect on winter wheat grain yield. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84860562301	Assessment of water quality under changing climate conditions in the Haihe River Basin, China	For the purpose of underpinning the technical requirements of saving energy and reducing emissions, this study attempts to construct a model, which aims to demonstrate the process of "pollutant production-discharge into nvers-transformation-discharge into seas" by choosing regular pollution indices as a research objective on a macroscale for a long period. This study focuses on the construction, calibration and verification of an integrated simulation model on water quantity and water quality for the Haihe River Basin, China, which has serious water shortages and pollution. The basin is divided into smaller units, including 3067 sub-basins and 11 752 contours, and in each unit pollutant loads are evaluated. The model has sufficiently high precision that it can be used to support water resources protection and water environment management. The study reported herein produced initial outcomes of the water pollution equilibrium status and made a preliminary exploration into integrated management of water resources and pollutant balance. The results indicated that the water quality has been degrading since the 1980s and is projected to continue to degrade in the context of climate change. The underlying reason behind the current situation is the continued pollutant discharge into the river, particularly during dry seasons when the low flow is insufficient to dilute the pollution. Concurrent with the river water quality degradation, groundwater and soil pollution further deteriorated. Therefore, it is advisable for the relevant departments (soil or land management and groundwater) to focus on controlling pollutant sources and remediation of contaminated areas.

84860564761	Eco-hydrological simulation and prediction in the Haihe River basin by coupling the BIOME-BGC model with the WEP-L model	A distributed eco-hydrological model was developed to simulate and predict hydrological processes and vegetation production by coupling the vegetation model BIOME-BGC with the distributed hydrological model WEP-L. BIOME-BGC updates the vegetation parameters of WEP-L in a daily time step, and WEP-L provides hydro-meteorological data to BIOME-BGC. The coupled model was applied in the Haihe River basin of China, which is well known for its water scarcity. In the modelling validation, results show good agreement with the field observation data or literature values of LAI, Net Primary Production (NPP) and river discharge. Under future climate change scenarios in 2021-2050, meteorological data predicted by the global climate models after downscaling were used for eco-hydrological simulation to predict future eco-hydrological response in the Haihe River basin. Results show that under the global warming impact, river runoff may decrease, and NPP may increase. This means a big challenge to the water and land management in the basin and mitigation/adaption measures of climate change are desired. Copyright © 2011 IAHS Press.

84861108852	Real-time flood forecast using a Support Vector Machine	An accurate real-time flood forecast is crucial for water resource planning and management, and reservoir and river regulation. The traditional flood prediction methods need to estimate the initial state of the model employed and related parameters. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is based on a structural risk minimization (SRM) principle, and has good generalization capability. In this paper, a method of SVM is exploited for real-time flood prediction, and the Xinanjiang model is also conducted to evaluate the performance. The proposed method is examined with data in the upper area of Nangao Reservoir, located in the Luo River, Guangdong Province, China, for a 10 year period, 1994-2003. The available data from four hydrological control stations is covered by daily rainfall, streamflow and evaporation. Runoff discharge predicted by the presented approach within different time spans across 2 days, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days are appraised with RMSE, and the simulations demonstrate that a moderate time span reaches the trade-off between the prediction ability and correction one.

84861150225	Temperature prediction in the SiB2 model based on EnKF assimilation method	The Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a sequential data assimilation method, which applies an ensemble of model states to represent the error statistics of the model estimation and to predict the error statistics continuously updated in time. It has been proved to be an efficient approach to handle strong nonlinear dynamics and large state spaces. Firstly, we simulate the temperature at each layer through the thermal model, which is a sub-model of the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB2) with field observation data. Furthermore, we modify the real value by data assimilation based on EnKF and obtain another temperature curve. Finally, the real value, open loop and EnKF assimilation of the temperature at each layer are compared and analysed. The results indicate that the EnKF method is practical and efficient for dealing with soil temperature when the external condition is relatively, stable whereas it is inaccurate in a changing external environment; for instance, the assimilation cannot reflect the trend of canopy temperature.

84862278256	The economic impact of water tax charges in China: A static computable general equilibrium analysis	This paper presents a static computable general equilibrium model of the Chinese economy with water as an explicit factor of production. This model is used to assess the broad economic impact of a policy based on water demand management, using water tax charges as a policy-setting tool. It suggests that imposing water taxes can redistribute sectoral water use and lead to shifts in production, consumption, value added, and trade patterns. Another important finding is that water taxes imposed on the agricultural sector drive most of the effects. © 2012 Copyright 2012 International Water Resources Association.

84863139439	Attribution of water resources evolution in the highly water-stressed Hai River Basin of China	Many observations and studies have shown that water resources amount in the Hai River Basin decreased significantly over the last half of the twentieth century. This study attempts to attribute the observed changes in the water resources amount in the basin over a 40 year period (1961-2000) to different factors, including natural climate variability, climate change induced by anthropogenic forcing of greenhouse gas emissions (referred to as anthropogenic forcing hereafter), and local human activity. First, the temporal variation of the annual water resources amount in the basin during the past 40 years is analyzed by employing the moving-average method, the linear regression method, and the Mann-Kendall method. Second, through setting different scenarios, the effects on the water resources amount due to different factors, including natural climate variability, anthropogenic forcing, and local human activity, are obtained using the parallel climate model, the distributed hydrological model water and energy transfer processes in large river basins, and the statistical downscaling model. Third, the fingerprint-based attribution method is used to obtain the signal strengths of observed changes in water resources amount during 1961-2000 and changes in the water resources amount under different scenarios. Finally, by comparing the signal strengths, the observed changes in water resources amount in the basin can be attributed to different factors. The results indicate that natural climate variability and local human activity may be two factors responsible for the observed changes in the water resources amount during the past 40 years in the basin, with local human activity being the main factor and accounting for about 60% of the changes.

84863162221	The eco-hydrologcial evolution law of natural vegetation in Haihe River Basin	The Haihe River Basin is one of the most water scarce regions in china, in which natural vegetation plays an important role in the eco-hydrologcial process. In this study, the historical eco-hydrological evolution law of natural vegetation was studied in Haihe River Basin. Distributed hydrological model WEP and ecological model BIOME-BGC were applied to calculate changes of net primary product (NPP) and evaportranspiration (ET) of the basin in the last decades. The analysis demonstrated that the annual NPP increased slightly from 1980 to 2005 in the basin, mountain area and plain area, and the main impacting factor is the climate situation rather than land use change. The ET of forest, grass and wetland all decreased from 1956 to 2005 in the basin, mountain area and plain area. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84869425584	Towards better water governance through implementing IWRM in the Li River Basin, China	Environmental degradation and unsustainable use of water resources has become an obstacle to further economic development and the well-being of the population in the Li River basin. This paper explores the concept and principles of integrated water resources management (IWRM) in relation to their applicability to the Li River basin. The assessment on its physical and socioeconomic characteristics and its current institutional systems in the Li River Basin provides an appreciation of the whole river basin. Sectoral fragmentation and the absence of coordination mechanism (or body) are identified as the institutional factors in this study that caused water related issues. In order to overcome shortfalls of the current fragmented management system, formation of Watershed Management Committee is highly recommended as the core of reforming efforts, which is expected to coordinate effective planning and implementation of equitable, efficient and sustainable use of natural resources in the basin with a view to improving the sustainability of its economic development. Several other reform recommendations are also provided and expected to be a departure point towards better water governance in the Li River basin through the implementation of IWRM. Lastly we explore to what extent the proposed recommendations would be supported by the current national policy framework. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

In order to improve the water resources assessment in Hun River Basin, a dualistic, distributed and physically based hydrological model for large basin, WEP-L was successfully developed. According to the assessment results of Hun River Basin, sharp decrease in surface water resources occurred during 1980-2000, resulted in the sharp decrease in special water resources (traditional water resources) in the same period. Additionally, water demand makes more ecosystem water utilised by farmland, but less by forest and grassland because of irrigation. Finally, artificial water consumption did not make water use more efficient.

84872663103	The streamflow estimation using the Xinanjiang rainfall runoff model and dual state-parameter estimation method	To accurately estimate floods with hydrological models, the model parameters and the initial state variables must be known. Good estimations of parameters and initial state variables are required to enable the models to make accurate estimations. The Xinanjiang rainfall-runoff (RR) model has been widely used in humid and semi-humid regions in China. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of the Xinanjiang RR model parameters and the correlation between the state variables and the output streamflow. In order to reduce the impact of streamflow data error, model structural error and parameter uncertainty, the Xinanjiang RR model is coupled with intelligent optimization algorithms and a data assimilation method to estimate the streamflow in the Luo River in China that was first considered as gauged, and then as ungauged for parameter calibration. Model parameters are estimated in batch using a particle swarm optimization algorithm and three variations of ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation (the state variable assimilation, parameter assimilation and the dual assimilation at the same time) for the Luo River, and the ungauged basin. In this case, the model parameters are set equal to median values. The results show that when parameter values are determined by an optimization algorithm using 10. years of data, the dual ensemble Kalman Filter notably improves the simulated results. When the parameters adopt the median, the state variable assimilation has little effect on the estimation results, but the parameter assimilation positively affects the simulated results. The dual ensemble Kalman Filter also notably improves the simulated results. The time scale of assimilation has little effect on simulation results for the dual assimilation, but it has a large effect on the state variable assimilation and the parameter assimilation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Downscaling is usually employed to decrease the impact of heterogeneity which is a function of scale, for example, discretization in hydrological model. However, it is a problem to confirm the smallest scale and how does it impact the results for scale changing. Perfect solutions to the problems above have not yet been found so far. The evapotranspiration and its spatial heterogeneity, distribution patterns were analyzed based on land use data in 2000 in Nenjiang River basin at various grid sizes (5km×5km, 10km× 10km and 20km×20km). The results show that there is a similar tendency of spatial heterogeneity in land use type and evapotranspiration at different scales, and a smaller influence of scale change on the evapotranspiration, by which the center of distribution patterns moving to the type of land use with larger area.

84876427282	Assessing climate change impacts on the ecohydrology of the Jinghe River basin in the Loess Plateau, China	Quantifying the impacts of climate change on the hydrology and ecosystem is important in the study of the Loess Plateau, China, which is well known for its high erosion rates and ecosystem sensitivity to global change. A distributed ecohydrological model was developed and applied in the Jinghe River basin of the Loess Plateau. This model couples the vegetation model, BIOME BioGeochemicalCycles (BIOME-BGC) and the distributed hydrological model, Water and Energy transfer Process in Large river basins (WEP-L). The WEP-L model provided hydro-meteorological data to BIOME-BGC, and the vegetation parameters of WEP-L were updated at a daily time step by BIOME-BGC. The model validation results show good agreement with field observation data and literature values of leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP) and river discharge. Average climate projections of 23 global climate models (GCMs), based on three emissions scenarios, were used in simulations to assess future ecohydrological responses in the Jinghe River basin. The results show that global warming impacts would decrease annual discharge and flood season discharge, increase annual NPP and decrease annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Increasing evapotranspiration (ET) due to air temperature increase, as well as increases in precipitation and LAI, are the main reasons for the decreasing discharge. The increase in annual NPP is caused by a greater increase in gross primary productivity (GPP) than in plant respiration, whilst the decrease in NEP is caused by a larger increase in heterotrophic respiration than in NPP. Both the air temperature increase and the precipitation increase may affect the changes in NPP and NEP. These results present a serious challenge for water and land management in the basin, where mitigation/adaption measures for climate change are desired. Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz; Associate editor D.

84883448423	Integrated simulation of the dualistic water cycle and its associated processes in the Haihe River Basin	Water resource shortages, water environmental deterioration, and water ecological degradation are becoming increasingly prominent in the Haihe River Basin under the effects of global climate change and intense human activity. Finding ways to solve these problems reasonably is an urgent task in basin water resources management. The water cycle describes the formation and transformation of every water drop, while it interacts with associated water ecology and water environment processes. Therefore, to fundamentally solve the above problems, the three processes must be combined and the evolutionary trends of the ecology and water environment driven by the water cycle must be determined. To comprehensively diagnose and solve the problems of water resources, ecology and water environment in the basin, an integrated simulation platform of the dualistic water cycle and its associated processes in the Haihe River Basin was established by fully analyzing the "natural-social" dualistic characteristics of the evolution of the basin water cycle in this study. Accordingly, it is a supporting tool to evaluate the future trends of water resources, ecology and the water environment by setting scenarios based on the predictions of a climate mode and water control conditions. The results show that with climate change, the water consumption, groundwater overexploitation, and the amount of water flowing to the sea could develop soundly and satisfy the requirements of national economic growth in the future planning year 2030 through the implementation of water consumption control management and the South-North Water Diversion Project. Meanwhile, associated water environmental deterioration can be alleviated, and a growing trend for production capacities of the natural ecosystem and agro-ecosystem is seen. The above results provide a foundation for implementing basin water resources regulation and the most strict water resources management. © 2013 The Author(s).

84886243621	Effect of gravel-sand mulch on soil water and temperature in the semiarid loess region of Northwest China	In the semiarid loess region of northwest China, the use of gravel andsand as a surface-mulching material has been an indigenous farming technique for crop production for over 300 years. A field and modeling study was carried out to quantify the effect of a gravel-sand mulch material on soil water and soil temperature in the semiarid loess region of northwest China. The field experiment (April 4, 2001-July 12, 2001) consisted of two treatments: (1) no surface mulching as a control, and (2) gravel-sand surface-mulching. The numerical model HYDRUS-1D was used in the research reported in this paper. The results showed that compared with the nonmulched condition the gravelsand mulched field had a more favorable soil-water and temperature environment for plant growth. In the initial stage of watermelon growth, there was larger soil-water storage (3.8 cm versus 1.9 cm) and soil temperature(10.8°C versus 6.2°C) in the 0-20 cm soil layer with the gravelsand mulch. The mulch provided very beneficial water and temperature conditions for the germination of watermelon. The gravel-sand mulch improved soil-water conditions because it was effective in reducing evaporation and enhancing transpiration. The gravel-sand mulch also improved infiltration of rainwater. For the 0-20 cm soil layers the average temperature in the gravel-sand mulch field was 1.0-5.3°C larger than that in the no-mulch field. In the 20-40 cm soil layer, the average temperature in the gravel-sand mulch was 0.3-3.7°C larger than that in the no-mulch field. In the early stages of plant growth, plant roots primarily centralized in the 0-40 cm soil layer, and the temperatures under the mulch were conducive to plant growth and development. The field and model results consistently showed the value of a gravel-sand mulch to provide warm, moist conditions for watermelon production in the semiarid loess region of northwest China. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84887118510	Assessing the economic impact of North China's water scarcity mitigation strategy: A multi-region, water-extended computable general equilibrium analysis	This paper describes a multi-region computable general equilibrium model for analyzing the effectiveness of measures and policies for mitigating North China's water scarcity with respect to three different groups of scenarios. The findings suggest that a reduction in groundwater use would negatively affect economic growth and household incomes. A planned water-transfer project would improve economic development and reduce the over-exploitation of local water resources, while water demand management policies would improve water-use efficiency through reallocating water to those sectors having a higher marginal product value. Several important policy implications are drawn from these findings. © 2013 International Water Resources Association.

84890334057	A rule for delineation and codification of sub-watersheds based on stem-branch topological relationship of DEM digital river network	A new rule for sub-watershed codification is put forward to realize sub-watershed division and multi-confluence codification and to split a non-bifurcated river into small parts. This rule, which is called stem-branch topological codification (SBTC), is developed based on the stem-branch topological relationship of drainage networks. The SBTC codes the drainage networks from the river mouth to the source, and uses the hierarchical inheritance rule to reflect the upstream and downstream topological relationship. The application of the rule to the Weihe Basin shows that the SBTC is competent for the coding of anomaly-simulated dendritic drainage networks, which have one-way, two-way, and multi-way confluence situations.

84891669086	Modeling infiltration-runoff under multi-layered soil during rainfall	The generalized Green-Ampt models, based on the Green-Ampt approach, is suitable for simulating infiltration into layered soils during unsteady rainfall, however, there are still some problems with using this approach. The objective of this paper is to improve the generalized Green-Ampt model, and then evaluate the performance of the generalized Green-Ampt model in modeling the infiltration-runoff into multi-layered soil during rain. Firstly, based on the generalized Green-Ampt model, we propose and improvement to the generalized Green-Ampt model to overcome deficiencies in it. Then, one-dimensional infiltration-runoff experiments during rainfall were performed in multi-layered soil columns, and the runoff rate, cumulative infiltration and wetting front distance from soil surface were calculated with the modified generalized Green-Ampt model, and compared with the observed data in the experiments. The results indicate that the modified generalized Green-Ampt model predicts the multi-layered soil infiltration-runoff process well. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84891710325	An analysis of water consumption and pollution with the input-output model in the Haihe River Basin, China	It is widely believed that the economic success in China is achieved at the expense of natural resources and has resulted in severe pollution of the environment, especially water resources. This study applies a hybrid input-output (IO) model linking economic and ecological systems in order to analyze water consumption and wastewater discharge in the Haihe River Basin. Within the environmental IO framework, a series of assessment indicators is calculated to assist in tracking both direct and indirect effects of freshwater consumption and wastewater discharge in the economic sector, as well as to distinguish the economic sectors that have greatest influence on water demand and pollution. Assessment results indicate that water consumption and pollution can be reduced by readjusting the structure of production, consumption and trade in the Haihe River Basin. It is concluded that in order to achieve sustainable development in the Haihe River Basin with its very poor water endowment, not only the direct but also the indirect effects on water demand and pollution should be considered when production, consumption and trade policies are formulated. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84892444612	A stem-branch topological codification for watershed subdivision and identification to support distributed hydrological modelling at large river basins	Watershed subdivision is a useful discretization method for distributed hydrological models at large river basins. A subwatershed codification method, which is able to identify the subwatershed uniquely and reflect the topological relationship is desired. According to the previous literatures, there are two types of coding methods suitable for the subwatershed codification: the Pfafstetter-group rules and the modified binary tree codification method. But, both of them have some shortcomings in theory and application. A new coding method named stem-branch topological codification is developed to overcome these shortcomings, which is based on the stem-branch topological structure of the drainage networks and capable of reflecting the river hierarchy. The basic coding elements of the method are river reaches in the drainage networks, which are not only generated by the tributary junctions, but also by the splitting points of hydrological factors (e.g. hydrological gauge stations and reservoirs). Also, the method could handle complex confluences (e.g. river reaches with more than two upstream inflows), which are rare under natural conditions, but more frequent in the digital elevation model extracted or artificial drainage networks (e.g. sewage systems or irrigation drainage networks). With the stem-branch topological codification codes, it is easy to identify the upstream (or downstream) relationship between any two subwatersheds and to calculate the directly connected subwatershed codes. Also, if some changes have occurred in the drainage network, there is no need to recode the whole watershed, but by modifying the existed codes to form the new ones. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84896816507	Estimating the contribution of groundwater to rootzone soil moisture	In the Huaibei Plain basin, China, soybean is a main crop. During the soybean growth period, rainfall can vary largely and depth to watertable can also vary largely. The amount of water supplied to the soybean rootzone by groundwater affects soybean growth and yield. Accurate simulation of groundwater contributions to soybean rootzone soil moisture (groundwater contribution) can be important for determining irrigation to and drainage from soybean fields. Based on field observations and local weather data of 2005, HYDRUS-1D was validated by comparing simulated and measured rootzone soil water contents. The validated model was used to estimate the daily groundwater contributions for three different soybean hydrological growing seasons, i.e., an average year (1997), a wet year (2005), and a dry year (2004) with soybean growth at its optimal state. The main results were: (1) seasonal groundwater contribution was 157 mm in the experimental field, and the estimated groundwater contributions were 158, 222, and 387 mm in the wet, average, and dry seasons, respectively; (2) the groundwater contribution was about 63% of the total seasonal transpiration in the experimental field, and those were about 142, 80, and 66% of the total seasonal transpiration in dry, average, and wet seasons, respectively. © IWA Publishing 2013.

84902799482	Research on the regulation of water function reaches pollution load in freezeup period of Songhuajiang River Basin	The paper proposes a concept of the ratio of water function reaches under regulation of pollution load, which means the quantitative proportion of water function reach in which the total amount of pollution is less than its pollution capacity, for assistant the strictest water resources management system. According to the high water environment risk of cold area in freezeup period, which caused by declining self-purification capacity and high pollutant concentration of treated sewage, the paper build a calculation model of water function reach pollution capacity in freezeup period based on distributed hydrological model. Apply the concept and model to the Songhuajiang River basin, the paper do a research of united regulation of water quantity and quality in freezeup period. The result shows that under the optimal water quantity regulation proposal of intensive water-saving and water conservancy projects regulation, for achieve the aim of 90% of the ratio of water function reaches under regulation of pollution load, all of the wastewater treatment plants in the Songhuajiang River basin should reach the discharge standard IB in freezeup period in the year of 2020, and the industrial waste water should reach the discharge standard II.

84904185280	The impacts of the basin scale hydrological cycle to water budget of wetlands in Nenjiang River basin	The relationship between the water budget of wetlands and the water cycle process in local river basin is bidirectional. The recovery and function performance of the wetland are based on this relationship. Hydrological models are the effective tool to detecting this link. The distributed hydrologic model was the key supports in this study and was used to quantitative identify the change of water budget of the wetlands which was impacted by the water cycle evolution in Nenjiang River basin in Northeast China. The results indicated that precipitation, runoff and evapotranspiration both in the basin and wetlands present similar declining trend. The precipitation is the major recharge source, and the evapotranspiration is the primary output of wetlands. The value of mean change in storage of the wetlands is negative which is caused by the decrease of the area of wetlands. The results of land use pattern evolution change surface inflow in the wetlands in the basin scenarios simulation indicated. These results suggested that water budget of wetlands is influenced by water cycle in basin. And some reasonable measures for wetlands management should not only base on its features, but also pay attention to hydrological regime in basin. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84904207367	Research on driving mechanism of socio-economic factors for water cycle	The paper selects water price as a potentially effective socio-economic factor for the mitigation of conflict between socio-economic development and regional water resources in the Weihe River basin on basis of the driving mechanism research of socio-economic factors for water cycle, and evaluates the variation of socio-economic and hydrological variables by comprehensive simulation of economic system and water resources system by coupling of economic model CGE, water allocation model ROWAS and distributed water cycle model WEP. The results indicate that raising water price would bring down socio-economic development and regional water demand to some extent, but regional water resources tensions just reduce so slightly that corresponding schemes turn out to be not sufficient to deal with water crisis in the Weihe River basin. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84904088043	Impacts of water consumption structure adjustment on social-economic development and water cycle	Water consumption structure adjustment is considered to be effective to alleviate regional water crisis for sustainable socio-economic development and rational water resources utilization. The paper studies mechanism of interactions between socio-economic system and water resources system by coupling of economic model CGE, water allocation model ROWAS and distributed water cycle model WEP to discover the impacts of water consumption structure adjustment on regional socio-economic development and water cycle in the Weihe River basin of China. The results indicate that water consumption structure adjustment transferring water consumption from agriculture to industry and services would distinctly promote economic growth and resident welfare with surface water flow increasing and groundwater level declining. As a result, water supply structure adjustment and integrated regulation of surface water and groundwater would be essential for regional harmonious development. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84904391162	A new method to quantitatively separate the effects of multi-factors on the water cycle evolution	In order to separate the impacts of the climate change and human activities, it needs to separate the impacts of the multi-factors. When using the traditional methods to calculate the contribution of multi-factors, the sum of each factor' s contribution is not always equal to the comprehensive changes because of the interrelation between each factor. Thus, most of the traditional methods focus on the two factors contribution analyses. A new method, which is based on the simulation of the distributed hydrological model, is promoted to solve this problem. The new method could handle the interrelation between different factors, and assure that the sum of each factor's contribution just equals to the total changes, which is proved theoretically and practically in this paper. Contrasting to the traditional methods, the new method could partition the contribution of more than two factors, and it is flexible to select the base period and impacted period. Moreover, the new method could be used in study of atmosphere, environment, ecology, and so on, as well as water cycle, combining with the physically based simulation models.

84904785933	Truth concealed behind "zero Increase of Total Water Use" and coordination approach of socio-economic and eco-environmental water uses in the Weihe River Basin, China	The water resources situation in the water-stressed Weihe River Basin, China, is more serious now than ever before because of a decrease in water resources and socio-economic development. A "Zero increase of socio-economic water use" in recent years gives people a wrong understanding and conceals the water crisis in the basin because the socio-economic water consumption has actually increased. Water use for the hydro-ecological system has been greatly reduced by a decrease in water resources and socio-economic water consumption increase. New concepts of hierarchical water uses for every sector and water consumption control are suggested for coordinating water uses of the socio-economy and ecosystems in the water-stressed basin. The traditional water resources allocation and regulation in China usually set up a priority sequence for water use sectors. Generally speaking, domestic water use has the highest priority and a highest guarantee rate, followed by industrial water use, irrigation and lastly ecological water use. The concept of hierarchical water use for every sector is to distinguish the water use of every sector into minimum part, appropriate part, and expected extra part with different guarantee rates, and the minimum parts of all sectors should be first guaranteed. By applying a water allocation model, we compared the water allocation results of the traditional approach and the newly suggested approach. Although further study is desired, the results are believed to be of an important referential value to sustainable development in the basin. Copyright © 2014 IAHS Press.
