0902.3461	on the spin-orbit misalignment of the xo-3 exoplanetary system	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 feb. 2transit of the exoplanet xo-3b. the new data show that the planetary orbitalaxis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned, as reported earlier by hebrardand coworkers. we find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes tobe 37.3 +/- 3.7 deg, as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15deg. the significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there areindications of systematic effects. xo-3b is the first exoplanet known to have ahighly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star, andas such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration ofmassive planets into close-in orbits. we revisit the statistical analysis ofspin-orbit alignment in hot-jupiter systems. assuming the stellar obliquitiesto be drawn from a single rayleigh distribution, we find the mode of thedistribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg. however, it remains the case that a modelrepresenting two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawnfrom a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropicdistribution--is favored over a single rayleigh distribution.

0907.5205	the transit ingress and the tilted orbit of the extraordinarily  eccentric exoplanet hd 80606b	we present the results of a transcontinental campaign to observe the 2009june 5 transit of the exoplanet hd 80606b. we report the first detection of thetransit ingress, revealing the transit duration to be 11.64 +/- 0.25 hr andallowing more robust determinations of the system parameters. keck spectraobtained at midtransit exhibit an anomalous blueshift, giving definitiveevidence that the stellar spin axis and planetary orbital axis are misaligned.the keck data show that the projected spin-orbit angle is between 32-87 degwith 68.3% confidence and between 14-142 deg with 99.73% confidence. thus theorbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e=0.93), but is also tiltedaway from the equatorial plane of its parent star. a large tilt had beenpredicted, based on the idea that the planet's eccentric orbit was caused bythe kozai mechanism. independently of the theory, it is noteworthy that all 3exoplanetary systems with known spin-orbit misalignments have massive planetson eccentric orbits, suggesting that those systems migrate differently thanlower-mass planets on circular orbits.

[caii] emission is probably tied to adusty pre-outburst environment, and not the outburst mechanism. sn2009ip andu2773-ot may provide a critical link between historical lbv eruptions, whileu2773-ot may provide a link between lbvs and sn2008s and n300-ot. futuresearches will uncover more examples of precursor lbv variability of this kind,providing key clues that may help unravel the instability driving lbvs.

1005.3084	giant planet occurrence in the stellar mass-metallicity plane	correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanetscan be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts andprovide valuable clues about the planet formation process. we analyze a sampleof 1194 stars drawn from the california planet survey targets to determine theempirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giantplanet as a function of its mass and metallicity. our stellar sample rangesfrom m dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 msun to intermediate-mass subgiantswith masses as high as 1.9 msun. in agreement with previous studies, our sampleexhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fractionof stars that harbor giant planets scales as f \propto 10^{1.2 [fe/h]}. we canrule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98%confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets arenot likely due to convective envelope "pollution." our data also rule out aconstant planet occurrence rate for [fe/h]&lt; 0, indicating that giant planetscontinue to become rarer at sub-solar metallicities. we also find that planetoccurrence increases with stellar mass (f \propto mstar), characterized by arise from 3.5% around m dwarfs (0.5 msun) to 14% around a stars (2 msun), atsolar metallicity. we argue that the correlation between stellar properties andgiant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretionmodel of planet formation.

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.2189	characterizing the cool kois iii. koi-961: a small star with large  proper motion and three small planets	we present the characterization of the star koi 961, an m dwarf with transitsignals indicative of three short-period exoplanets, originally discovered bythe kepler mission. we proceed by comparing koi 961 to barnard's star, anearby, well-characterized mid-m dwarf. by comparing colors, optical andnear-infrared spectra, we find remarkable agreement between the two, implyingsimilar effective temperatures and metallicities. both are metal-poor comparedto the solar neighborhood, have low projected rotational velocity, highabsolute radial velocity, large proper motion and no quiescent h-alphaemission--all of which is consistent with being old m dwarfs. we combineempirical measurements of barnard's star and expectations from evolutionaryisochrones to estimate koi 961's mass (0.13 +/- 0.05 msun), radius (0.17 +/-0.04 rsun) and luminosity (2.40 x 10^(-3.0 +/- 0.3) lsun). we calculate koi961's distance (38.7 +/- 6.3 pc) and space motions, which, like barnard's star,are consistent with a high scale-height population in the milky way. we performan independent multi-transit fit to the public kepler light curve andsignificantly revise the transit parameters for the three planets. we calculatethe false-positive probability for each planet-candidate, and find a less than1% chance that any one of the transiting signals is due to a background orhierarchical eclipsing binary, validating the planetary nature of the transits.the best-fitting radii for all three planets are less than 1 rearth, with koi961.03 being mars-sized (rp = 0.57 +/- 0.18 rearth), and they represent some ofthe smallest exoplanets detected to date.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1206.1510	the ptf orion project: a possible planet transiting a t-tauri star	we report observations of a possible young transiting planet orbiting apreviously known weak-lined t-tauri star in the 7-10 myr old orion-ob1a/25-oriregion. the candidate was found as part of the palomar transient factory (ptf)orion project. it has a photometric transit period of 0.448413 +- 0.000040days, and appears in both 2009 and 2010 ptf data. follow-up low-precisionradial velocity (rv) observations and adaptive optics imaging suggest that thestar is not an eclipsing binary, and that it is unlikely that a backgroundsource is blended with the target and mimicking the observed transit. rvobservations with the hobby-eberly and keck telescopes yield an rv that has thesame period as the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transitcenter by approximately -0.22 periods. the amplitude (half range) of the rvvariations is 2.4 km/s and is comparable with the expected rv amplitude thatstellar spots could induce. the rv curve is likely dominated by stellar spotmodulation and provides an upper limit to the projected companion mass of m_psin i_orb &lt; 4.8 +- 1.2 m_jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, iorb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit light curve, we findan upper limit on the mass of the planetary candidate of m_p &lt; 5.5 +- 1.4m_jup. this limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside,its roche limiting orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active massloss and evaporation.

1206.5579	the photoeccentric effect and proto-hot jupiters ii. koi-1474.01, a  candidate eccentric planet perturbed by an unseen companion	the exoplanets known as hot jupiters---jupiter-sized planets with periodsless than 10 days---likely are relics of dynamical processes that shape allplanetary system architectures. socrates et al. (2012) argued that higheccentricity migration (hem) mechanisms proposed for situating these close-inplanets should produce an observable population of highly eccentric proto-hotjupiters that have not yet tidally circularized. hem should also createfailed-hot jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fastcircularization. using the technique we previously presented for measuringeccentricities from photometry (the "photoeccentric effect"), we are distillinga collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot jupiters from the keplerobjects of interest (koi). here we present the first, koi-1474.01, which has along orbital period (69.7340 days) and a large eccentricity e =0.81+0.10/-0.07, skirting the proto-hot jupiter boundary. combining keplerphotometry, ground-based spectroscopy, and stellar evolution models, wecharacterize host koi-1474 as a rapidly-rotating f-star. statistical argumentsreveal that the transiting candidate has a low false-positive probability of3.1%. koi-1474.01 also exhibits transit timing variations of order an hour. weexplore characteristics of the third-body perturber, which is possibly the"smoking-gun" cause of koi-1474.01's large eccentricity. using the host-star'srotation period, radius, and projected rotational velocity, we findkoi-1474.01's orbit is marginally consistent with aligned with the stellar spinaxis, although a reanalysis is warranted with future additional data. finally,we discuss how the number and existence of proto-hot jupiters will not onlydemonstrate that hot jupiters migrate via hem, but also shed light on thetypical timescale for the mechanism.

1207.5804	alignment of the stellar spin with the orbits of a three-planet system	the sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, whichis presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseousdisk. for exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is notguaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may bemisaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magneticinteractions or torques from neighbouring stars. indeed, isolated 'hotjupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. here we report ananalysis of transits of planets over starspots on the sun-like star kepler-30,and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellarequator. furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a fewdegrees. this configuration is similar to that of our solar system, andcontrasts with the isolated hot jupiters. the orderly alignment seen in thekepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems thatexperienced disruptive dynamical interactions. should this be corroborated byobservations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-diskmisalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities ofhot jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin ofhot jupiters.

(2011) that includes the effects of macroturbulence,instrumental broadening, and convective blueshift to accurately model theanomaly in the net rv caused by the planet eclipsing part of the rotating star.obliquity measurements are an important tool for testing theories of planetformation and migration. to date, the measured obliquities of ~50 jovianplanets span the full range, from prograde to retrograde, with planets orbitingcool stars preferentially showing alignment of stellar spins and planetaryorbits. our results are consistent with this pattern emerging from tidalinteractions in the convective envelopes of cool stars and close-in planets. inaddition, our 1.8 years of new rvs for this system show that the orbit of theouter planet is more poorly constrained than previously thought, with anorbital period now in the range of 10-36 years.

1302.4443	low stellar obliquities in compact multiplanet systems	we measure the sky-projected stellar obliquities (\lambda) in themultiple-transiting planetary systems koi-94 and kepler-25, using therossiter-mclaughlin effect. in both cases the host stars are well-aligned withthe orbital planes of the planets. for koi-94 we find \lambda=-11+-11 deg,confirming a recent result by hirano and coworkers. kepler-25 was a morechallenging case because the transit depth is unusually small (0.13 %). toobtain the obliquity it was necessary to use prior knowledge of the star'sprojected rotation rate, and apply two different analysis methods toindependent wavelength regions of the spectra. the two methods gave consistentresults, \lambda=7+-8 deg and -0.5+-5.7 deg.  there are now a total of five obliquity measurements for host stars ofsystems of multiple transiting planets, all of which are consistent withspin-orbit alignment. this alignment is unlikely to be the result of tidalinteractions, because of the relatively large orbital distances and lowplanetary masses in the systems. in this respect the multiplanet host starsdiffer from hot-jupiter host stars, which commonly have large spin-orbitmisalignments whenever tidal interactions are weak. in particular the weak-tidesubset of hot-jupiter hosts have obliquities consistent with an isotropicdistribution (p=0.6), but the multiplanet hosts are incompatible with such adistribution (p~10^-6). this suggests that high obliquities are confined tohot-jupiter systems, and provides further evidence that hot jupiter formationinvolves processes that tilt the planetary orbit.

1303.2150	the mass of koi-94d and a relation for planet radius, mass, and incident  flux	we measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, koi-94d. we wishto determine whether this planet, which is in a 22-day orbit and receives 2700times as much incident flux as jupiter, is as dense as jupiter or rarefied likeinflated hot jupiters. koi-94 also hosts 3 smaller transiting planets, all ofwhich were detected by the kepler mission. with 26 radial velocities of koi-94from the w. m. keck observatory and a simultaneous fit to the kepler lightcurve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is notinflated. support for the planetary interpretation of the other threecandidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timingvariations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against falsepositives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within thephotometric aperture. the radial velocity analyses of koi-94b and koi-94e offermarginal (&gt;2\sigma) mass detections, whereas the observations of koi-94c offeronly an upper limit to its mass. using the koi-94 system and other planets withpublished values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35with m &lt; 150 earth masses), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanetsthat relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few earth masses up toten jupiter masses. these equations can be used to predict the radius or massof a planet.

1304.0460	a plateau in the planet population below twice the size of earth	we carry out an independent search of kepler photometry for small transitingplanets with sizes 0.5--8.0 times that of earth and orbital periods between 5and 50 days, with the goal of measuring the fraction of stars harboring suchplanets. we use a new transit search algorithm, terra, optimized to detectsmall planets. we restrict our stellar sample to include the 12,000 starshaving the lowest photometric noise in the kepler survey. we report 129 planetcandidates having radii less than 6 earth-radii found in 3 years of keplerphotometry. forty-seven of these candidates are not in batalha et al. (2012).we gather keck hires spectra for the majority of these targets leading toprecise stellar radii and hence precise planet radii. we inject syntheticdimmings from mock transiting planets into the actual kepler photometry andanalyze that photometry with terra to assess detection completeness. we computethe occurrence of planets as a function of planet radius and period, correctingfor the detection completeness. the resulting distribution of planet sizesexhibits a power law rise in occurrence from 5.7 earth-radii down to 2earth-radii, as found in howard et al. (2012). that rise clearly ends at 2earth-radii. the occurrence of planets is consistent with constant from 2earth-radii toward 1 earth-radius. this unexpected plateau in planet occurrenceat 2 earth-radii suggests distinct planet formation processes for planets aboveand below 2 earth-radii. we find 15.1% of solar type stars---roughly one insix---has a 1--2 earth-radii planet with p = 5--50 days.

1305.3228	an understanding of the shoulder of giants: jovian planets around late k  dwarf stars and the trend with stellar mass	analyses of exoplanet statistics suggest a trend of giant planet occurrencewith host star mass, a clue to how planets like jupiter form. one missing pieceof the puzzle is the occurrence around late k dwarf stars (masses of0.5-0.75msun and effective temperatures of 3900-4800k). we analyzed four yearsof doppler radial velocities data of 110 late k dwarfs, one of which hosts twopreviously reported giant planets. we estimate that 4.0+/-2.3% of these starshave saturn-mass or larger planets with orbital periods &lt;245d, depending on theplanet mass distribution and rv variability of stars without giant planets. wealso estimate that 0.7+/-0.5% of similar stars observed by kepler have giantplanets. this kepler rate is significantly (99% confidence) lower than thatderived from our doppler survey, but the difference vanishes if only the singledoppler system (hip 57274) with completely resolved orbits is considered. thedifference could also be explained by the exclusion of close binaries (withoutgiant planets) from the doppler but not kepler surveys, the effect oflong-period companions and stellar noise on the doppler data, or an intrinsicdifference between the two populations. our estimates for late k dwarfs bridgethose for solar-type stars and m dwarfs and support a positive trend withstellar mass. small sample size precludes statements about finer structure,e.g. a "shoulder" in the distribution of giant planets with stellar mass.future surveys such as the next generation transit survey and the transitingexoplanet satellite survey will ameliorate this deficiency.

1307.5849	the trends high-contrast imaging survey. iv. the occurrence rate of  giant planets around m-dwarfs	doppler-based planet surveys have discovered numerous giant planets but areincomplete beyond several au. at larger star-planet separations, direct planetdetection through high-contrast imaging has proven successful, but thistechnique is sensitive only to young planets and characterization relies upontheoretical evolution models. here we demonstrate that radial velocitymeasurements and high-contrast imaging can be combined to overcome theseissues. the presence of widely separated companions can be deduced byidentifying an acceleration (long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star.by obtaining high spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we ruleout scenarios in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binarycompanions with high statistical confidence. we report results from an analysisof doppler measurements of a sample of 111 m-dwarf stars with a median of 29radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr. bytargeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration ("trend") withadaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5% +/- 3.0% of m-dwarf stars hostone or more massive companions with 1 &lt; m/m_jupiter &lt; 13 and 0 &lt; a &lt; 20 au.these results are lower than analyses of the planet occurrence rate aroundhigher-mass stars. we find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by adouble power law in stellar mass m and metallicity f = [fe/h] such that f(m,f)= 0.039(+0.056,-0.028) m^(0.8(+1.1,-0.9)) 10^((3.8 +/- 1.2)f). our results areconsistent with gravitational microlensing measurements of the planetoccurrence rate; this study represents the first model-independent comparisonwith microlensing observations.

1307.8128	kepler-63b: a giant planet in a polar orbit around a young sun-like star	we present the discovery and characterization of a giant planet orbiting theyoung sun-like star kepler-63 (koi-63, $m_{\rm kp} = 11.6$, $t_{\rm eff} =5576$ k, $m_\star = 0.98\, m_\odot$). the planet transits every 9.43 days, withapparent depth variations and brightening anomalies caused by large starspots.the planet's radius is $6.1 \pm 0.2 r_{\earth}$, based on the transit lightcurve and the estimated stellar parameters. the planet's mass could not bemeasured with the existing radial-velocity data, due to the high level ofstellar activity, but if we assume a circular orbit we can place a rough upperbound of $120 m_{\earth}$ (3$\sigma$). the host star has a high obliquity($\psi$ = $104^{\circ}$), based on the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and ananalysis of starspot-crossing events. this result is valuable because almostall previous obliquity measurements are for stars with more massive planets andshorter-period orbits. in addition, the polar orbit of the planet combined withan analysis of spot-crossing events reveals a large and persistent polarstarspot. such spots have previously been inferred using doppler tomography,and predicted in simulations of magnetic activity of young sun-like stars.

1310.7152	radial velocity variations of photometrically quiet, chromospherically  inactive kepler stars: a link between rv jitter and photometric flicker	we compare stellar photometric variability, as measured from kepler lightcurves by basri et al. (2011), with measurements of radial velocity (rv)root-mean-square (rms) variations of all california planet search overlapstars. we newly derive rotation periods from the kepler light curves for all ofthe stars in our study sample. the rv variations reported herein range fromless than 4 m/s to 135 m/s, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometricvariability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the rv program forchromospherically "quiet" stars. despite the small size of our sample, we findwith high statistical significance that the rv rms manifests strongly in thefourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in rv have agreater number of frequency components in the light curve. we also find thatspot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict theobserved rv variations by factors of ~2--1000, likely because the low levelphotometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included insimple spot models. the stars best fit by these models tend to have simplerlight curves, dominated by a single relatively high amplitude component ofvariability. finally, we demonstrate that the rv rms behavior of our sample canbe explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagramintroduced by bastien et al. (2013). we use this diagram to derive the surfacegravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved offthe main-sequence. more generally, we find that the stars with the largest rvrms are those that have evolved onto the "flicker floor" sequence in thatdiagram, characterized by relatively low amplitude but highly complexphotometric variations which grow as the stars evolve to become subgiants.

1402.6343	the 55 cancri planetary system: fully self-consistent n-body constraints  and a dynamical analysis	we present an updated study of the planets known to orbit 55 cancri a using1,418 high-precision radial velocity observations from four observatories(lick, keck, hobby-eberly telescope, harlan j. smith telescope) and transittime/durations for the inner-most planet, 55 cancri "e" (winn et al. 2011). weprovide the first posterior sample for the masses and orbital parameters basedon self-consistent n-body orbital solutions for the 55 cancri planets, all ofwhich are dynamically stable (for at least $10^8$ years). we apply a gpuversion of radial velocity using n-body differential evolution markov chainmonte carlo (run dmc; b. nelson et al. 2014) to perform a bayesian analysis ofthe radial velocity and transit observations. each of the planets in thisremarkable system has unique characteristics. our investigation of high-cadenceradial velocities and priors based on space-based photometry yields an updatedmass estimate for planet "e" ($8.09\pm0.26$ m$_\oplus$), which affects itsdensity ($5.51\pm^{1.32}_{1.00}$ g cm$^{-3}$) and inferred bulk composition.dynamical stability dictates that the orbital plane of planet "e" must bealigned to within $60^o$ of the orbital plane of the outer planets (which weassume to be coplanar). the mutual interactions between the planets "b" and "c"may develop an apsidal lock about $180^o$. we find 36-45% of all our modelsystems librate about the anti-aligned configuration with an amplitude of$51^o\pm^{6^o}_{10^o}$. other cases showed short-term perturbations in thelibration of $\varpi_b-\varpi_c$, circulation, and nodding, but we find theplanets are not in a 3:1 mean-motion resonance. a revised orbital period andeccentricity for planet "d" pushes it further toward the closest known jupiteranalog in the exoplanet population.

1403.1879	multiwavelength observations of the candidate disintegrating sub-mercury  kic 12557548b	we present multiwavelength photometry, high angular resolution imaging, andradial velocities, of the unique and confounding disintegrating low-mass planetcandidate kic 12557548b. our high angular resolution imaging, which includesspacebased hst/wfc3 observations in the optical, and groundbased keck/nirc2observations in k'-band, allow us to rule-out background and foregroundcandidates at angular separations greater than 0.2 arcsec that are brightenough to be responsible for the transits we associate with kic 12557548. ourradial velocity limit from keck/hires allows us to rule-out bound, low-massstellar companions to kic 12557548 on orbits less than 10 years, as well asplacing an upper-limit on the mass of the candidate planet of 1.2 jupitermasses; therefore, the combination of our radial velocities, highangular-resolution imaging, and photometry are able to rule-out most falsepositive interpretations of the transits. our precise multiwavelengthphotometry includes two simultaneous detections of the transit of kic 12557548busing cfht/wircam at 2.15 microns and the kepler space telescope at 0.6microns, as well as simultaneous null-detections of the transit by kepler andhst/wfc3 at 1.4 microns. our simultaneous hst/wfc3 and kepler null-detections,provide no evidence for radically different transit depths at thesewavelengths. our simultaneous cfht/wircam detections in the near-infrared andwith kepler in the optical reveal very similar transit depths (the averageratio of the transit depths at ~2.15 microns compared to ~0.6 microns is: 1.02+/- 0.20). this suggests that if the transits we observe are due to scatteringfrom single-size particles streaming from the planet in a comet-like tail, thenthe particles must be ~0.5 microns in radius or larger, which would favor thatkic 12557548b is a sub-mercury, rather than super-mercury, mass planet.

1403.4602	hubble space telescope near-ir transmission spectroscopy of the  super-earth hd 97658b	recent results from the kepler mission indicate that super-earths (planetswith masses between 1-10 times that of the earth) are the most common kind ofplanet around nearby sun-like stars. these planets have no direct solar systemanalogue, and are currently one of the least well-understood classes ofextrasolar planets. many super-earths have average densities that areconsistent with a broad range of bulk compositions, including bothwater-dominated worlds and rocky planets covered by a thick hydrogen and heliumatmosphere. measurements of the transmission spectra of these planets offer theopportunity to resolve this degeneracy by directly constraining the scaleheights and corresponding mean molecular weights of their atmospheres. wepresent hubble space telescope near-infrared spectroscopy of two transits ofthe newly discovered transiting super-earth hd 97658b. we use the wide fieldcamera 3's scanning mode to measure the wavelength-dependent transit depth inthirty individual bandpasses. our averaged differential transmission spectrumhas a median 1 sigma uncertainty of 23 ppm in individual bins, making this themost precise observation of an exoplanetary transmission spectrum obtained withwfc3 to date. our data are inconsistent with a cloud-free solar metallicityatmosphere at the 10 sigma level. they are consistent at the 0.4 sigma levelwith a flat line model, as well as effectively flat models corresponding to ametal-rich atmosphere or a solar metallicity atmosphere with a cloud or hazelayer located at pressures of 10 mbar or higher.

1403.6831	atmospheric characterization of the hot jupiter kepler-13ab	kepler-13ab (= koi-13.01) is a unique transiting hot jupiter. it is one ofvery few known short-period planets orbiting a hot a-type star, making it oneof the hottest planets currently known. the availability of kepler data allowsus to measure the planet's occultation (secondary eclipse) and phase curve inthe optical, which we combine with occultations observed by warm spitzer at 4.5mic and 3.6 mic and a ground-based occultation observation in the ks band (2.1mic). we derive a day-side hemisphere temperature of 2,750 +- 160 k as theeffective temperature of a black body showing the same occultation depths.comparing the occultation depths with one-dimensional planetary atmospheremodels suggests the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion. ouranalysis shows evidence for a relatively high geometric albedo, ag= 0.33 +0.04-0.06. while measured with a simplistic method, a high ag is supported also bythe fact that the one-dimensional atmosphere models underestimate theoccultation depth in the optical. we use stellar spectra to determine thedilution, in the four wide bands where occultation was measured, due to thevisual stellar binary companion 1.15 +- 0.05" away. the revised stellarparameters measured using these spectra are combined with other measurementsleading to revised planetary mass and radius estimates of mp = 4.94 - 8.09 mjupand rp = 1.406 +- 0.038 rjup. finally, we measure a kepler mid-occultation timethat is 34.0 +- 6.9 s earlier than expected based on the mid-transit time andthe delay due to light travel time, and discuss possible scenarios.

1404.2960	occurrence and core-envelope structure of 1--4x earth-size planets  around sun-like stars	small planets, 1-4x the size of earth, are extremely common around sun-likestars, and surprisingly so, as they are missing in our solar system. recentdetections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets tobegin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, andinternal structures. the kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be mostcommon, as 26% of sun-like stars have small, 1-2 r_e planets with orbitalperiods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 r_e planets that receive 1-4x theincident stellar flux that warms our earth. these earth-size planets aresprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 au, andprobably beyond. mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 r_e showthat the smallest of them, r &lt; 1.5 r_e, have the density expected for rockyplanets. their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused bygravitational compression. including solar system planets yields a relation:rho = 2.32 + 3.19 r/r_e [g/cc]. larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0r_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasingamounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core,befitting the appellation "mini-neptunes." planets of ~1.5 r_e have the highestdensities, averaging near 10 g/cc. the gas giant planets occur preferentiallyaround stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur aroundstars having a range of heavy element abundances. one explanation is that thefast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary disks enriched in heavyelements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes,forming giant planets. but models of the formation of 1-4 r_e planets remainuncertain. defining habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit ofeither detections of life elsewhere or an understanding of life's biochemicalorigins.

1504.04066	a comprehensive characterization of the 70 virginis planetary system	an on-going effort in the characterization of exoplanetary systems is theaccurate determination of host star properties. this effort extends to therelatively bright host stars of planets discovered with the radial velocitymethod. the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey (terms) isaiding in these efforts as part of its observational campaign for exoplanethost stars. one of the first known systems is that of 70 virginis, whichharbors a jovian planet in an eccentric orbit. here we present a completecharacterization of this system with a compilation of terms photometry,spectroscopy, and interferometry. we provide fundamental properties of the hoststar through direct interferometric measurements of the radius (1.5\%uncertainty) and through spectroscopic analysis. we combined 59 new keck hiresradial velocity measurements with the 169 previously published from the elodie,hamilton, and hires spectrographs, to calculate a refined orbital solution andconstruct a transit ephemeris for the planet. these newly determined systemcharacteristics are used to describe the habitable zone of the system with adiscussion of possible additional planets and related stability simulations.finally, we present 19 years of precision robotic photometry that constrainstellar activity and rule out central planetary transits for a jupiter-radiusplanet at the 5$\sigma$ level, with reduced significance down to an impactparameter of $b = 0.95$.

1505.03158	3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m phase curves of the highly-irradiated eccentric hot  jupiter wasp-14b	we present full-orbit phase curve observations of the eccentric ($e\sim0.08$) transiting hot jupiter wasp-14b obtained in the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m bandsusing the \textit{spitzer space telescope}. we use two different methods forremoving the intrapixel sensitivity effect and compare their efficacy indecoupling the instrumental noise. our measured secondary eclipse depths of$0.1882\%\pm 0.0048\%$ and $0.2247\%\pm 0.0086\%$ at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m,respectively, are both consistent with a blackbody temperature of $2402\pm 35$k. we place a $2\sigma$ upper limit on the nightside flux at 3.6 $\mu$m andfind it to be $9\%\pm 1\%$ of the dayside flux, corresponding to a brightnesstemperature of 1079 k. at 4.5 $\mu$m, the minimum planet flux is $30\%\pm 5\%$of the maximum flux, corresponding to a brightness temperature of $1380\pm 65$k. we compare our measured phase curves to the predictions of one-dimensionalradiative transfer and three-dimensional general circulation models. we findthat wasp-14b's measured dayside emission is consistent with a model atmospherewith equilibrium chemistry and a moderate temperature inversion. these samemodels tend to over-predict the nightside emission at 3.6 $\mu$m, whileunder-predicting the nightside emission at 4.5 $\mu$m. we propose that thisdiscrepancy might be explained by an enhanced global c/o ratio. in addition, wefind that the phase curves of wasp-14b ($7.8 m_{\mathrm{jup}}$) are consistentwith a much lower albedo than those of other jovian mass planets with thermalphase curve measurements, suggesting that it may be emitting detectable heatfrom the deep atmosphere or interior processes.

1508.00902	spitzer secondary eclipse observations of five cool gas giant planets  and empirical trends in cool planet emission spectra	in this work we present spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron secondary eclipseobservations of five new cool (&lt;1200 k) transiting gas giant planets:hat-p-19b, wasp-6b, wasp-10b, wasp-39b, and wasp-67b. we compare our measuredeclipse depths to the predictions of a suite of atmosphere models and toeclipse depths for planets with previously published observations in order toconstrain the temperature- and mass-dependent properties of gas giant planetatmospheres. we find that the dayside emission spectra of planets less massivethan jupiter require models with efficient circulation of energy to the nightside and/or increased albedos, while those with masses greater than that ofjupiter are consistently best-matched by models with inefficient circulationand low albedos. at these relatively low temperatures we expect the atmosphericmethane to co ratio to vary as a function of metallicity, and we therefore useour observations of these planets to constrain their atmospheric metallicities.we find that the most massive planets have dayside emission spectra that arebest-matched by solar metallicity atmosphere models, but we are not able toplace strong constraints on metallicities of the smaller planets in our sample.interestingly, we find that the ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron brightnesstemperatures for these cool transiting planets is independent of planettemperature, and instead exhibits a tentative correlation with planet mass. ifthis trend can be confirmed, it would suggest that the shape of these planets'emission spectra depends primarily on their masses, consistent with thehypothesis that lower-mass planets are more likely to have metal-richatmospheres.

1512.03428	orbital architectures of planet-hosting binaries: i. forming five small  planets in the truncated disk of kepler-444a	we present the first results from our keck program investigating the orbitalarchitectures of planet-hosting multiple star systems. kepler-444 is ametal-poor triple star system that hosts five sub-earth-sized planets orbitingthe primary star (kepler-444a), as well as a spatially unresolved pair of mdwarfs (kepler-444bc) at a projected distance of 1.8" (66 au). we combine ourkeck/nirc2 adaptive optics astrometry with multi-epoch keck/hires rvs of allthree stars to determine a precise orbit for the bc pair around a, given theirempirically constrained masses. we measure minimal astrometric motion($1.0\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, or $0.17\pm0.10$ km s$^{-1}$), but our rvs revealsignificant orbital velocity ($1.7\pm0.2$ km s$^{-1}$) and acceleration($7.8\pm0.5$ m s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$). we determine a highly eccentric stellarorbit ($e=0.864\pm0.023$) that brings the tight m dwarf pair within$5.0^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ au of the planetary system. we validate that the system isdynamically stable in its present configuration via n-body simulations. we findthat the a$-$bc orbit and planetary orbits are likely aligned (98%) given thatthey both have edge-on orbits and misalignment induces precession of theplanets out of transit. we conclude that the stars were likely on their currentorbits during the epoch of planet formation, truncating the protoplanetary diskat $\approx$2 au. this truncated disk would have been severely depleted ofsolid material from which to form the total $\approx$1.5 $m_{\rm earth}$ ofplanets. we thereby strongly constrain the efficiency of the conversion of dustinto planets and suggest that the kepler-444 system is consistent with modelsthat explain the formation of more typical close-in kepler planets in normal,not truncated, disks.
