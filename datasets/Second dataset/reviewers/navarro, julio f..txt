0902.2477	galaxy-induced transformation of dark matter halos	we use n-body/gasdynamical lambdacdm cosmological simulations to examine theeffect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of itsdark halo. two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only theevolution of the dark matter component and a second one where a baryoniccomponent is added. these simulations include radiative cooling but neglectstar formation and feedback, leading most baryons to collect at the halo centerin a disk which is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral.this unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effectthat galaxies may have in transforming their dark halos. we find that the shapeof the halo becomes more axisymmetric: halos are transformed from triaxial intoessentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughlyconstant flattening (c/a ~ 0.85). halos always contract as a result of galaxyassembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the"adiabatic contraction" hypothesis. the reduced contraction helps to reconcilelambdacdm halos with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solarcircle and should alleviate the long-standing difficulty of matchingsimultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy disks and the luminosityfunction. the halo contraction is also less pronounced than found in earliersimulations, a disagreement that suggests that halo contraction is not solely afunction of the initial and final distribution of baryons. not only how muchbaryonic mass has been deposited at the center of a halo matters, but also themode of its deposition. it might prove impossible to predict the halo responsewithout a detailed understanding of a galaxy's assembly history.

0706.2919	the statistics of lcdm halo concentrations	we use the millennium simulation (ms) to study the statistics of lcdm haloconcentrations at z = 0. our results confirm that the average haloconcentration declines monotonically with mass; a power-law fits well theconcentration-mass relation for over 3 decades in mass, up to the most massiveobjects to form in a lcdm universe (~ 10^15 h^-1 msol). this is in cleardisagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by bullock et al. forthese rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of navarro,frenk, &amp; white. the large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedentednumerical resolution of the ms, allow us to estimate with confidence thedistribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems withunusual properties. about one in a hundred cluster haloes (m200 &gt;~ 3x10^14 h^-1msol) have concentrations exceeding c200 = 7.5, a result that may be used tointerpret the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, suchas abell 1689, in the lcdm cosmogony. a similar fraction (1 in 100) ofgalaxy-sized haloes (m200 ~ 10^12 h^-1 msol) have c200 &lt; 4.5, an importantconstraint on models that attempt to reconcile the rotation curves of lowsurface-brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly lowconcentration. we find that halo concentrations are independent of spin oncehaloes manifestly out of equilibrium are removed from the sample. compared totheir relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend tobe lower and to have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher...(continue)

0905.3554	the origin of extended disk galaxies at z=2	galaxy formation models typically assume that the size and rotation speed ofgalaxy disks are largely dictated by the mass, concentration, and spin of theirsurrounding dark matter haloes. equally important, however, are the fraction ofbaryons in the halo that collect into the central galaxy, as well as the netangular momentum that they are able to retain during its assembly process. weexplore the latter using a set of four large cosmological n-body/gasdynamicalsimulations drawn from the owls (overwhelmingly large simulations) project.these runs differ only in their implementation of feedback from supernovae. wefind that, when expressed as fractions of their virial values, galaxy mass andnet angular momentum are tightly correlated. galaxy mass fractions,m_d=m_gal/m_vir, depend strongly on feedback, but only weakly on halo mass orspin over the halo mass range explored here (m_vir&gt;1e11 h^{-1}m_sun). theangular momentum of a galaxy, j_d=j_gal/j_vir, correlates with m_d in a mannerthat is insensitive to feedback and that deviates strongly from the simple j_d= m_d assumption often adopted in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. them_d-j_d correlation implies that, in a given halo, galaxy disk size is maximalwhen the central galaxy makes up a substantial fraction (~20%-30%) of allbaryons within the virial radius. at z=2, such systems may host gaseous diskswith radial scale lengths as large as those reported for star-forming disks bythe sins survey, even in moderately massive haloes of average spin. extendeddisks at z=2 may thus signal the presence of systems where galaxy formation hasbeen particularly efficient, rather than the existence of haloes with unusuallyhigh spin parameter.

0905.3555	disk galaxies at z=2 in owls	we use the owls (overwhelmingly large simulations) set of cosmologicalnbody/gasdynamical simulations to study the properties of simulated galaxies atz=2. we focus on the effect of supernova feedback from evolving stars on thebaryonic mass and angular momentum content of galaxies that assemble at thecenter of 1e11-3e12 h^{-1}m_\odot halos. our main finding is that the mass andangular momentum of such galaxies are strongly coupled, in a way that isapproximately independent of feedback: varying the feedback implementationleads, in a given halo, to large variations in galaxy mass but leaves thegalaxy mass-angular momentum correlation largely unaltered. in particular, theratio between the angular momentum of a galaxy and that of its surrounding halo(j_d=j_gal/j_vir) correlates closely with the galaxy mass (expressed in unitsof the virial mass of the halo; m_d=m_gal/m_vir). this correlation differssubstantially from the m_d=j_d assumption commonly adopted in semianalyticmodels of galaxy formation. we use these results to infer the sizes of diskgalaxies at z=2 expected in the lcdm scenario and to interpret recentobservations of extended disks at z~2 by the sins collaboration

0909.0398	the remnants of galaxy formation from a panoramic survey of the region  around m31	in hierarchical cosmological models, galaxies grow in mass through thecontinual accretion of smaller ones. the tidal disruption of these systems isexpected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distancesthat reach $10 - 100$ times the radius of the central disk. the number,luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significantclues to galaxy formation history, but obtaining a comprehensive survey ofthese components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vastextent. here we report a panoramic survey of the andromeda galaxy (m31). wedetect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants ofdwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of m31. an improved census of theirsurviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of m31's satellites brighterthan $m_v &lt; -6$ await discovery. the brightest companion, triangulum (m33), issurrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for arecent encounter with m31. this panorama of galaxy structure directly confirmsthe basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals theshared history of m31 and m33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies.

1001.2310	secondary infall and the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of cold  dark matter halos	we use n-body simulations to investigate the radial dependence of the densityand velocity dispersion in cold dark matter (cdm) halos. in particular, weexplore how closely q rho/sigma^3, a surrogate measure of the phase-spacedensity, follows a power-law in radius. our study extends earlier work byconsidering, in addition to spherically-averaged profiles, local q-estimatesfor individual particles, q_i; profiles based on the ellipsoidal radiusdictated by the triaxial structure of the halo, q_i(r'); and by carefullyremoving substructures in order to focus on the profile of the smooth halo,q^s. the resulting q_i^s(r') profiles follow closely a power law near thecenter, but show a clear upturn from this trend near the virial radius,r_{200}. the location and magnitude of the deviations are in excellentagreement with the predictions from bertschinger's spherical secondary-infallsimilarity solution. in this model, q \propto r^{-1.875} in the inner,virialized regions, but departures from a power-law occur near r_{200} becauseof the proximity of this radius to the location of the first shell crossing -the shock radius in the case of a collisional fluid. particles there have notyet fully virialized, and so q departs from the inner power-law profile. ourresults imply that the power-law nature of $q$ profiles only applies to theinner regions and cannot be used to predict accurately the structure of cdmhalos beyond their characteristic scale radius.

1004.5386	feedback and the structure of simulated galaxies at redshift z=2	we study the properties of simulated high-redshift galaxies usingcosmological n-body/gasdynamical runs from the overwhelmingly large simulations(owls) project. the runs contrast several feedback implementations of varyingeffectiveness: from no-feedback, to supernova-driven winds to powerfulagn-driven outflows. these different feedback models result in large variationsin the abundance and structural properties of bright galaxies at z=2. we findthat feedback affects the baryonic mass of a galaxy much more severely than itsspin, which is on average roughly half that of its surrounding dark matter haloin our runs. feedback induces strong correlations between angular momentumcontent and galaxy mass that leave their imprint on galaxy scaling relationsand morphologies. encouragingly, we find that galaxy disks are common inmoderate-feedback runs, making up typically ~50% of all galaxies at the centersof haloes with virial mass exceeding 1e11 m_sun. the size, stellar masses, andcircular speeds of simulated galaxies formed in such runs have properties thatstraddle those of large star-forming disks and of compact early-type galaxiesat z=2. once the detailed abundance and structural properties of these rareobjects are well established it may be possible to use them to gauge theoverall efficacy of feedback in the formation of high redshift galaxies.

1006.0537	the sphericalization of dark matter halos by galaxy disks	cosmological simulations indicate that cold dark matter (cdm) halos should betriaxial. verifying observationally this theoretical prediction is, however,less than straightforward because the assembly of galaxies is expected tomodify the halo shapes and to render them more axisymmetric. we use a suite ofn-body simulations to investigate quantitatively the effect of the growth of acentral disk galaxy on the shape of triaxial dark matter halos. as expected,the halo responds to the presence of the disk by becoming more spherical. thenet effect depends only weakly on the orientation of the disk relative to thehalo principal axes or the timescale of disk assembly, but strongly on theoverall gravitational importance of the disk. our results show that exponentialdisks whose contribution peaks at less than ~50% of their circular velocity areunable to modify noticeably the shape of the gravitational potential of theirsurrounding halos. many dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies are expectedto be in this regime, and therefore their detailed kinematics could be used toprobe halo triaxiality, one of the basic predictions of the cdm paradigm. weargue that the complex disk kinematics of the dwarf galaxy ngc 2976 might bethe reflection of a triaxial halo. such signatures of halo triaxiality shouldbe common in galaxies where the luminous component is subdominant.

0708.3087	the tidal evolution of local group dwarf spheroidals	(abridged) we use n-body simulations to study the evolution of dwarfspheroidal galaxies (dsphs) driven by galactic tides. we adopt acosmologically-motivated model where dsphs are approximated by a king modelembedded within an nfw halo. we find that these nfw-embedded king models areextraordinarily resilient to tides; the stellar density profile still resemblesa king model even after losing more than 99% of the stars. as tides strip thegalaxy, the stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, central surfacebrightness, and core radius decrease monotonically. remarkably, we find thatthe evolution of these parameters is solely controlled by the total amount ofmass lost from within the luminous radius. of all parameters, the core radiusis the least affected: after losing 99% of the stars, r_c decreases by just afactor of ~2. interestingly, tides tend to make dsphs more dark-matterdominated because the tightly bound central dark matter ``cusp'' is moreresilient to disruption than the ``cored'' king profile. we examine whether theextremely large m/l ratios of the newly-discovered ultra-faint dsphs might havebeen caused by tidal stripping of once brighter systems. although dsph tidalevolutionary tracks parallel the observed scaling relations in theluminosity-radius plane, they predict too steep a change in velocity dispersioncompared with the observational estimates hitherto reported in the literature.the ultra-faint dwarfs are thus unlikely to be the tidal remnants of systemslike fornax, draco, or sagittarius. despite spanning four decades inluminosity, dsphs appear to inhabit halos of comparable peak circular velocity,lending support to scenarios that envision dwarf spheroidals as able to formonly in halos above a certain mass threshold.

1009.0020	through thick and thin: kinematic and chemical components in the solar  neighbourhood	we search for the existence of chemically-distinct stellar components in thesolar neighbourhood using published data. extending earlier work, we show thatwhen the abundances of fe, alpha elements, and the r-process element eu areconsidered, stars separate neatly into two groups that delineate thetraditional thin and thick disk of the milky way. the group akin to the thindisk is traced by stars with [fe/h]&gt;-0.7 and alpha/fe&lt;0.2. the thick disk-likegroup overlaps the thin disk in [fe/h] but has higher abundances of alphaelements and eu. stars in the range -1.5&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.7 with low [alpha/fe]ratios, however, seem to belong to a separate, dynamically-cold, non-rotatingcomponent that we associate with tidal debris. the kinematically-hot stellarhalo dominates the sample for [fe/h]&lt;-1.5. these results suggest that it may bepossible to define the main dynamical components of the solar neighbourhoodusing only their chemistry, an approach with a number of interestingconsequences. the kinematics of thin disk stars is then independent ofmetallicity: their average rotation speed remains roughly constant in the range-0.7&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.4, a result that argues against radial migration having played asubstantial role in the evolution of the thin disk. the velocity dispersion ofstars assigned to the thin disk is also independent of [fe/h], implying thatthe familiar increase in velocity dispersion with decreasing metallicity is theresult of the increased prevalence of the thick disk at lower metallicities,rather than of the sustained operation of a dynamical heating mechanism. thesubstantial overlap in [fe/h] and, probably, stellar age, of the variouscomponents might affect other reported trends in the properties of stars in thesolar neighbourhood.

1012.2127	the dawning of the stream of aquarius in rave	we identify a new, nearby (0.5 &lt; d &lt; 10 kpc) stream in data from the radialvelocity experiment (rave). as the majority of stars in the stream lie in theconstellation of aquarius we name it the aquarius stream. we identify 15members of the stream lying between 30 &lt; l &lt; 75 and -70&lt; b &lt;-50, withheliocentric line-of-sight velocities v_los~-200 km/s. the members are outliersin the radial velocity distribution, and the overdensity is statisticallysignificant when compared to mock samples created with both the besan\c{c}ongalaxy model and newly-developed code galaxia. the metallicity distributionfunction and isochrone fit in the log g - t_eff plane suggest the streamconsists of a 10 gyr old population with [m/h]~-1.0. we explore relations toother streams and substructures, finding the stream cannot be identified withknown structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the galaxy's halo. usinga simple dynamical model of a dissolving satellite galaxy we account for thelocalization of the stream. we find that the stream is dynamically young andtherefore likely the debris of a recently disrupted dwarf galaxy or globularcluster. the aquarius stream is thus a specimen of ongoing hierarchical galaxyformation, rare for being right in the solar suburb.

1102.0002	the density and pseudo-phase-space density profiles of cdm halos	cosmological n-body simulations indicate that the spherically-averageddensity profiles of cold dark matter halos are accurately described by einastoprofiles, where the logarithmic slope is a power-law of adjustable exponent,\gamma =dln\rho /dlnr ~ r^\alpha $. the pseudo-phase-space density (ppsd)profiles of cdm halos also show remarkable regularity, and are wellapproximated by simple power laws, q(r)=\rho /\sigma ^3 ~ r^-\chi . we showthat this is expected from dynamical equilibrium considerations, since jeans'equations predict that the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of einasto halosshould resemble power laws over a wide range of radii. for the values of \alphatypical of cdm halos, the inner q profiles of equilibrium halos deviatesignificantly from a power law only very close to the center, and simulationsof extremely high-resolution would be needed to detect such deviationsunambiguously. we use an ensemble of halos drawn from the millennium-iisimulation to study which of these two alternatives describe best the massprofile of cdm halos. our analysis indicates that at the resolution of the bestavailable simulations, both einasto and power-law ppsd profiles (withadjustable exponents \alpha and \chi, respectively) provide equally acceptablefits to the simulations. a full account of the structure of cdm halos requiresunderstanding how the shape parameters that characterize departures fromself-similarity, like \alpha or \chi, are determined by evolutionary history,environment or initial conditions.

1102.3501	density variations in the nw star stream of m31	the pan andromeda archeological survey (pandas) cfht megaprime survey of them31-m33 system has found a star stream which extends about 120 kpc nw from thecenter of m31. the great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it doesnot significantly intersect the disk of m31, means that it is unusually wellsuited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a testfor the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. the main result of thispaper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about threetimes the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. the probability thatthe variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.as a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the samelocation in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [fe/h]=[0, -0.5] andfind no variations above the expected shot noise. the lumpiness of the streamis not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,nor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible m31satellite galaxies. the stream's density variations appear to be consistentwith the effects of a large population of steep mass function dark mattersub-halos, such as found in lcdm simulations, acting on an approximately 10gyrold star stream. the effects of a single set of halo substructure realizationsare shown for illustration, reserving a statistical comparison for anotherstudy.

1102.4463	a sagittarius-induced origin for the monoceros ring	the monoceros ring is a collection of stars in nearly-circular orbits atroughly 18 kpc from the galactic center. it may have originated (i) as theresponse of the disc to perturbations excited by satellite companions or (ii)from the tidal debris of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. the metallicity of monocerosstars differs from that of disc stars at comparable galactocentric distances,an observation that disfavours the first scenario. on the other hand, circularorbits are difficult to accommodate in the tidal-disruption scenario, since itrequires a satellite which at the time of disruption was itself in a nearlycircular orbit. such satellite could not have formed at the location of thering and, given its low mass, dynamical friction is unlikely to have played amajor role in its orbital evolution. we search cosmological simulations forlow-mass satellites in nearly-circular orbits and find that they result, almostinvariably, from orbital changes induced by collisions with more massivesatellites: the radius of the circular orbit thus traces the galactocentricdistance of the collision. interestingly, the sagittarius dwarf, one of themost luminous satellites of the milky way, is in a polar orbit that crosses thegalactic plane at roughly the same galactocentric distance as monoceros. we useidealized simulations to demonstrate that an encounter with sagittarius mightwell have led to the circularization and subsequent tidal demise of theprogenitor of the monoceros ring.

1103.0024	the population of milky way satellites in the lambdacdm cosmology	we present a model for the satellites of the milky way in which galaxyformation is followed using semi-analytic techniques applied to the sixhigh-resolution n-body simulations of galactic halos of the aquarius project.the model, calculated using the galform code, incorporates improved treatmentsof the relevant physics in the lambdacdm cosmogony, particularly aself-consistent calculation of reionization by uv photons emitted by theforming galaxy population, including the progenitors of the central galaxy.along the merger tree of each halo, the model calculates gas cooling (bycompton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons, molecular hydrogenand atomic processes), gas heating (from hydrogen photoionization and supernovaenergy), star formation and evolution. the evolution of the intergalacticmedium is followed simultaneously with that of the galaxies. star formation inthe more massive progenitor subhalos is suppressed primarily by supernovafeedback, while for smaller subhalos it is suppressed primarily byphotoionization due to external and internal sources. the model is constrainedto match a wide range of properties of the present day galaxy population as awhole, but at high redshift it requires an escape fraction of uv photons nearunity in order completely to reionize the universe by redshift z ~ 8. in themost successful model the local sources photoionize the pre-galactic regioncompletely by z ~ 10. in addition to the luminosity function of milky waysatellites, the model matches their observed luminosity-metallicity relation,their radial distribution and the inferred values of the mass within 300 pc,which in the models increase slowly but significantly with luminosity. there isa large variation in satellite properties from halo to halo, with theluminosity function, for example, varying by a factor of ~ 2 among the sixsimulations.

1104.1566	the shape of dark matter haloes in the aquarius simulations: evolution  and memory	we use the high resolution cosmological n-body simulations from the aquariusproject to investigate in detail the mechanisms that determine the shape ofmilky way-type dark matter haloes. we find that, when measured at theinstantaneous virial radius, the shape of individual haloes changes with time,evolving from a typically prolate configuration at early stages to a moretriaxial/oblate geometry at the present day. this evolution in halo shapecorrelates well with the distribution of the infalling material: prolateconfigurations arise when haloes are fed through narrow filaments, whichcharacterizes the early epochs of halo assembly, whereas triaxial/oblateconfigurations result as the accretion turns more isotropic at later times.interestingly, at redshift z=0, clear imprints of the past history of each haloare recorded in their shapes at different radii, which also exhibit a variationfrom prolate in the inner regions to triaxial/oblate in the outskirts. providedthat the aquarius haloes are fair representatives of milky way-like 10^12 msunobjects, we conclude that the shape of such dark matter haloes is a complex,time-dependent property, with each radial shell retaining memory of theconditions at the time of collapse.

1105.0425	clues to the "magellanic galaxy" from cosmological simulations	we use cosmological simulations from the aquarius project to study theorbital history of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) and its potentialassociation with other satellites of the milky way (mw). we search fordynamical analogs to the lmc and find a subhalo that matches the lmc positionand velocity at either of its two most recent pericentric passages. thissuggests that the lmc is not necessarily on its first approach to the mw,provided that the virial mass of the milky way is m_200 ~1.8e12 m_sun. thesimulation results yield specific predictions for the position and velocity ofsystems associated with the lmc prior to infall. if on first approach, mostshould lie close to the lmc because the galactic tidal field has not yet hadenough time to disperse them. if on second approach, the list of potentialassociates increases substantially. interestingly, our analysis rules out anlmc association for draco and ursa minor, two of the dwarf spheroidalssuggested by lynden-bell &amp; lynden-bell to form part of the "magellanic ghostlystream". our results also indicate that the direction of the orbital angularmomentum is a powerful test of lmc association. this test, however, requiresprecise proper motions, which are unavailable for most mw satellites. of the 4satellites with published proper motions, only the small magellanic cloud isclearly associated with the lmc. taken at face value, the proper motions ofcarina, fornax and sculptor rule them out as potential associates, but thisconclusion should be revisited when better data become available. the dearth ofsatellites clearly associated with the clouds might be solved by wide-fieldimaging surveys that target its surroundings, a region that may prove a fertilehunting ground for faint, previously unnoticed mw satellites.

1105.3691	observational properties of the metal-poor thick disk of the milky way  galaxy and insights into its origins	we have undertaken the study of the elemental abundances and kinematicproperties of a metal-poor sample of candidate thick-disk stars selected fromthe rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to differentiate among thepresent scenarios of the formation of the thick disk. in this paper, we reporton a sample of 214 red giant branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74main-sequence/sub-giant branch metal-poor stars, which serves to augment ourprevious sample of only giant stars. we find that the thick disk [alpha/fe]ratios are enhanced, and have little variation (&lt;0.1 dex), in agreement withour previous study. the augmented sample further allows, for the first time,investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients, &lt;0.03 +/- 0.02dex/kpc, in alpha-enhancement, while we find a +0.01 +/- 0.04 dex/kpc radialgradient and a -0.09 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc vertical gradient in iron abundance. inaddition, we show that the peak of the distribution of orbital eccentricitiesfor our sample agrees better with models in which the stars that comprise thethick disk were formed primarily in the galaxy, with direct accretion of starscontributing little. our results thus disfavor direct accretion of stars fromdwarf galaxies into the thick disk as a major contributor to the thick diskpopulation, but cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thickdisk, such as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of apre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial migrationof stars.

1111.6609	the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies: a challenge for the lcdm  paradigm?	the cold dark matter halo mass function is much steeper than the galaxystellar mass function on galactic and subgalactic scales. this difference isusually reconciled by assuming that the galaxy formation efficiency dropssharply with decreasing halo mass, so that virtually no dwarf galaxies form inhalos less massive than ~ 10^10 m_sun. in turn, this implies that, at any givenradius, the dark mass enclosed by a galaxy must exceed a certain minimum. weuse rotation curves of dwarf galaxies compiled from the literature to explorewhether their enclosed mass is consistent with these constraints. we find thatalmost one half of the dwarfs in our sample with stellar mass between 10^6-10^7m_sun are at odds with this restriction: either they live in halos with massessubstantially below 10^10 m_sun or there is a mechanism capable of reducing thedark mass enclosed by some of the faintest dwarfs. neither possibility iseasily accommodated within the standard lcdm scenario. extending galaxyformation to halos well below 10^10 m_sun would lead to large numbers of dwarfgalaxies in excess of current estimates; at the same time, the extremely lowstellar mass of the systems involved makes it unlikely that baryonic effectscan reduce their dark matter content. resolving this challenge seems to requirenew insights into dwarf galaxy formation, or perhaps a radical revision of theprevailing paradigm.

1112.2220	the origin of disks and spheroids in simulated galaxies	in the simplest scenario, disk galaxies form predominantly in halos with highangular momentum and quiet recent assembly history, whereas spheroids are theslowly-rotating remnants of repeated merging events. we explore theseassumptions using one hundred systems with halo masses similar to that of themilky way, identified in a series of cosmological gasdynamical simulationsgimic. at z=0, the simulated galaxies exhibit a wide variety of morphologies,from dispersion-dominated spheroids to pure disk galaxies. surprisingly, thesemorphological features are very poorly correlated with their halo properties:disks form in halos with high and low net spin, and mergers play a negligiblerole in the formation of spheroid stars, most of which form in-situ. moreimportant to morphology is the coherent alignment of the angular momentum ofbaryons that accrete over time to form a galaxy. spheroids tend to form whenthe spin of newly-accreted gas is misaligned with that of the extant galaxy,leading to the episodic formation of stars with different kinematics thatcancel out the net rotation of the system. disks, on the other hand, form outof gas that flows in with similar angular momentum to that of earlier-accretedmaterial. gas accretion from a hot corona thus favours disk formation, whereasgas that flows "cold", often along separate, misaligned filaments, favours theformation of spheroids. in this scenario, most spheroids consist ofsuperpositions of stellar components with distinct kinematics, age, andmetallicity, an arrangement that might survive to the present day given thepaucity of major mergers. since angular momentum is acquired largely atturnaround, morphology is imprinted early by the interplay of the tidal fieldand the shape of the material destined to form the galaxy.

1203.4097	the missing massive satellites of the milky way	recent studies suggest that only three of the twelve brightest satellites ofthe milky way (mw) inhabit dark matter halos with maximum circular velocity,v_max, exceeding 30km/s. this is in apparent contradiction with the lcdmsimulations of the aquarius project, which suggest that mw-sized halos shouldhave at least 8 subhalos with v_max&gt;30km/s. the absence of luminous satellitesin such massive subhalos is thus puzzling and may present a challenge to thelcdm paradigm. we note, however, that the number of massive subhalos dependssensitively on the (poorly-known) virial mass of the milky way, and that theirscarcity makes estimates of their abundance from a small simulation set likeaquarius uncertain. we use the millennium simulation series and the invarianceof the scaled subhalo velocity function (i.e., the number of subhalos as afunction of \nu, the ratio of subhalo v_max to host halo virial velocity,v_200) to secure improved estimates of the abundance of rare massivesubsystems. in the range 0.1&lt;\nu&lt;0.5, n_sub(&gt;\nu) is approximatelypoisson-distributed about an average given by &lt;n_sub&gt;=10.2x(\nu/0.15)^(-3.11).this is slightly lower than in aquarius halos, but consistent with recentresults from the phoenix project. the probability that a lcdm halo has 3 orfewer subhalos with v_max above some threshold value, v_th, is thenstraightforward to compute. it decreases steeply both with decreasing v_th andwith increasing halo mass. for v_th=30km/s, ~40% of m_halo=10^12 m_sun halospass the test; fewer than 5% do so for m_halo&gt;= 2x10^12 m_sun; and theprobability effectively vanishes for m_halo&gt;= 3x 10^12 m_sun. rather than afailure of lcdm, the absence of massive subhalos might simply indicate that themilky way is less massive than is commonly thought.

0711.0746	the redshift dependence of the structure of massive lcdm halos	(abridged) we use two very large cosmological simulations to study how thedensity profiles of relaxed lcdm dark halos depend on redshift and on halomass. we confirm that these profiles deviate slightly but systematically fromthe nfw form and are better approximated by the empirical formula, $d\log\rho/d\log r \propto r^{\alpha}$, first used by einasto to fit star counts inthe milky way. the best-fit value of the additional shape parameter, $\alpha$,increases gradually with mass, from alpha ~ 0.16 for present-day galaxy halosto alpha~ 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. halo concentrationsdepend only weakly on mass at z=0, and this dependence weakens further atearlier times. at z ~3 the average concentration of relaxed halos does not varyappreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations (m &gt;=3e11msun).furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the mostmassive}, relaxed halos is constant at c200 ~3.5 to 4 for 0&lt;=z&lt;= 3. theseresults have important implications for currently planned surveys of distantclusters.

1206.0020	the satellites of the milky way - insights from semi-analytic modelling  in a lambdacdm cosmology	we combine the six high-resolution aquarius dark matter simulations with asemi-analytic galaxy formation model to investigate the properties of thesatellites of milky way-like galaxies. we find good correspondence with theobserved luminosity function, luminosity-metallicity relation and radialdistribution of the milky way satellites. the star formation histories of thedwarf galaxies in our model vary widely, in accordance with what is seenobservationally. ram-pressure stripping of hot gas from the satellites leaves aclear imprint of the environment on the characteristics of a dwarf galaxy. wefind that the fraction of satellites dominated by old populations of starsmatches observations well. however, the internal metallicity distributions ofthe model satellites appear to be narrower than observed. this may indicatelimitations in our treatment of chemical enrichment, which is based on theinstantaneous recycling approximation. our model works best if the dark matterhalo of the milky way has a mass of ~8 x 10^11 msun, in agreement with thelower estimates from observations. the galaxy that resembles the milky way themost also has the best matching satellite luminosity function, although it doesnot contain an object as bright as the smc or lmc. compared to othersemi-analytic models and abundance matching relations we find that centralgalaxies reside in less massive haloes, but the halo mass-stellar mass relationin our model is consistent both with hydrodynamical simulations and with recentobservations.

1206.1049	the dynamical state and mass-concentration relation of galaxy clusters	we use the millennium simulation series to study how the dynamical state ofdark matter halos affects the relation between mass and concentration. we findthat a large fraction of massive systems are identified when they aresubstantially out of equilibrium and in a particular phase of their dynamicalevolution: the more massive the halo, the more likely it is found at atransient stage of high concentration. this state reflects the recent assemblyof massive halos and corresponds to the first pericentric passage ofrecently-accreted material when, before virialization, the kinetic andpotential energies reach maximum and minimum values, respectively. this resultexplains the puzzling upturn in the mass-concentration relation reported inrecent work for massive halos; indeed, the upturn disappears when onlydynamically-relaxed systems are considered in the analysis. our results warnagainst applying simple equilibrium models to describe the structure of rare,massive galaxy clusters and urges caution when extrapolating scaling lawscalibrated on lower-mass systems, where such deviations from equilibrium areless common. the evolving dynamical state of galaxy clusters ought to becarefully taken into account if cluster studies are to provide precisecosmological constraints.

1208.1579	from the cmd of omega centauri and (super-)agb stellar models to a  galactic plane passage gas purging chemical evolution scenario	[abbreviated] we have investigated the color-magnitude diagram of omegacentauri and find that the blue main sequence (bms) can be reproduced only bymodels that have a of helium abundance in the range y=0.35-$0.40. to explainthe faint subgiant branch of the reddest stars ("ms-a/rg-a" sequence),isochrones for the observed metallicity ([fe/h]\approx0.7) appear to requireboth a high age (~13gyr) and enhanced cno abundances ([cno/fe]\approx0.9$).y~0.35 must also be assumed in order to counteract the effects of high cno onturnoff colors, and thereby to obtain a good fit to the relatively blue turnoffof this stellar population. this suggest a short chemical evolution period oftime (&lt;1gyr) for omega cen. our intermediate-mass (super-)agb models are ableto reproduce the high helium abundances, along with [n/fe]~2 and substantial odepletions if uncertainties in the treatment of convection are fully taken intoaccount. these abundance features distinguish the bms stars from the dominant[fe/h] $\approx1.7$ population. the most massive super-agb stellar models(m_zams&gt;=6.8m_sun, m_he,core&gt;=1.245m_sun) predict too large n-enhancements,which limits their role in contributing to the extreme populations. we showquantitatively that highly he- and n-enriched agb ejecta have particularlyefficient cooling properties. based on these results and on the reconstructionof the orbit of omega cen with respect to the milky way we propose the galacticplane passage gas purging scenario for the chemical evolution of this cluster.our model addresses the formation and properties of the bms population(including their central location in the cluster). we follow our modeldescriptively through four passage events, which could explain not only somekey properties of the bms, but also of the ms-a/rgb-a and the s-enriched stars.

1208.2027	satellites and haloes of dwarf galaxies	we study the abundance of satellite galaxies as a function of primary stellarmass using the sdss/dr7 spectroscopic catalogue. in contrast with previousstudies, which focussed mainly on bright primaries, our central galaxies span awide range of stellar mass, 10^7.5 &lt; m_*^pri/m_sun &lt; 10^11, from dwarfs tocentral cluster galaxies. our analysis confirms that the average number ofsatellites around bright primaries, when expressed in terms ofsatellite-to-primary stellar mass ratio (m_*^sat/m_*^pri), is a strong functionof m_*^pri. on the other hand, satellite abundance is largely independent ofprimary mass for dwarf primaries (m_*^pri&lt;10^10 m_sun). these results areconsistent with galaxy formation models in the lcdm scenario. we find excellentagreement between sdss data and semi-analytic mock galaxy cataloguesconstructed from the millennium-ii simulation. satellite galaxies trace darkmatter substructure in lcdm, so satellite abundance reflects the dependence onhalo mass, m_200, of both substructure and galaxy stellar mass (m_*). sincedark matter substructure is almost scale-free, the dependence of satelliteabundance on primary mass results solely from the well-defined characteristicmass in the galaxy mass-halo mass relation. on dwarf galaxy scales, wheremodels predict a power-law scaling, m_* \propto m_200^2.5, similarity ispreserved and satellite abundance is independent of primary mass. for primariesbrighter than the characteristic mass of the m_*-m_200 relation, satelliteabundance increases strongly with primary mass. our results provide strongsupport for the steep, approximately power-law dependence of dwarf galaxy masson halo mass envisioned in lcdm galaxy formation models.

1211.0536	dwarf galaxies and the cosmic web	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group ofgalaxies to identify a mechanism that enables the removal of baryons fromlow-mass halos without appealing to feedback or reionization. as the localgroup forms, matter bound to it develops a network of filaments and pancakes.this moving web of gas and dark matter drifts and sweeps a large volume,overtaking many halos in the process. the dark matter content of these halos isunaffected but their gas can be efficiently removed by ram-pressure. the lossof gas is especially pronounced in low-mass halos due to their lower bindingenergy and has a dramatic effect on the star formation history of affectedsystems. this "cosmic web stripping" may help to explain the scarcity of dwarfgalaxies compared with the numerous low-mass halos expected in \lambda cdm andthe large diversity of star formation histories and morphologies characteristicof faint galaxies. although our results are based on a single high-resolutionsimulation, it is likely that the hydrodynamical interaction of dwarf galaxieswith the cosmic web is a crucial ingredient so far missing from galaxyformation models.

1211.3161	galaxy pairs in the local group	current models of galaxy formation predict that galaxy pairs of comparablemagnitudes should become increasingly rare with decreasing luminosity. thisseems at odds with the relatively high frequency of pairings among dwarfgalaxies in the local group. we use literature data to show that ~30% of allsatellites of the milky way and andromeda galaxies brighter than m_v=-8 arefound in likely physical pairs of comparable luminosity. besides the previouslyrecognised pairings of the magellanic clouds and of ngc 147/ngc 185, othercandidate pairs include the ursa minor and draco dwarf spheroidals, as well asthe and i/and iii satellites of m31. these pairs are much closer than expectedby chance if the radial and angular distributions of satellites wereuncorrelated; in addition, they have very similar line-of-sight velocities andluminosities that differ by less than three magnitudes. in contrast, the samecriteria pair fewer than 4% of satellites in n-body/semi-analytic models thatmatch the radial distribution and luminosity function of local groupsatellites. if confirmed in studies of larger samples, the high frequency ofdwarf galaxy pairings may provide interesting clues to the formation of faintgalaxies in the current cosmological paradigm.

1302.0288	the mass profile and accretion history of cold dark matter halos	we use the millennium simulation series to study the relation between theaccretion history (mah) and mass profile of cold dark matter halos. we findthat the mean density within the scale radius, r_{-2} (where the halo densityprofile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical densityof the universe at the time when the main progenitor's virial mass equals themass enclosed within r_{-2}. scaled to these characteristic values of mass anddensity, the mean mah, expressed in terms of the critical density of theuniverse, m(\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,m(&lt;\rho &gt;), at z=0. both follow closely the nfw profile, suggesting that thesimilarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halomahs. support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whoseaccretion histories deviate from the nfw shape; their mass profiles showcorrelated deviations from nfw and are better approximated by einasto profiles.fitting both m(&lt;\rho &gt;) and m(\rho_{crit}) with either nfw or einasto profilesyield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming andextending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretionhistory. these correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive toinitial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly fromthe nfw shape show noticeable deviations from nfw in their mass profiles. as aresult, the nfw profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,which do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other thancdm. our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of massprofile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strongsupport for the link between accretion history and halo structure we proposehere.

0801.1127	the unorthodox orbits of substructure halos	(abridged) we use cosmological n-body simulations to study the properties ofsubstructure halos in galaxy-sized dark matter halos. we extend prior work onthe subject by considering the whole population of subhalos physicallyassociated with the main system. these are defined as subhalos that have atsome time in the past been within the virial radius of the halo's mainprogenitor and that have survived as self-bound entities to $z=0$. we find thatthis population extends beyond {\it three times} the virial radius, andcontains objects on extreme orbits. we trace the origin of these unorthodoxorbits to the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos, which results inthe ejection of some subhalos along tidal streams. ejected subhalos areprimarily low-mass systems, leading to mass-dependent biases in their spatialdistribution and kinematics: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, theless centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendantpopulation. the bias is strongest amongst the most massive subhalos, butdisappears at the low-mass end. our findings imply that subhalos identifiedwithin the virial radius represent an incomplete census of the substructurephysically related to a halo: only about {\it one half} of all associatedsubhalos are found today within the virial radius of a halo. these results mayexplain the age dependence of the clustering of low-mass halos, and hasimplications for (i) the interpretation of the structural parameters andassembly histories of halos neighboring massive systems; (ii) the existence oflow-mass dynamical outliers in the local group; and (iii) the presence ofevidence for evolutionary effects well outside the traditional virial boundaryof a galaxy system.

1307.0008	streams in the aquarius stellar haloes	we use the very high resolution, fully cosmological simulations from theaquarius project, coupled to a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, tostudy the phase-space distribution of halo stars in "solar neighbourhood"-likevolumes. we find that this distribution is very rich in substructure in theform of stellar streams for all five stellar haloes we have analysed. thesestreams can be easily identified in velocity space, as well as in spaces ofpseudo-conserved quantities such as e vs. lz. in our best-resolved localvolumes, the number of identified streams ranges from ~ 300 to 600, in verygood agreement with previous analytical predictions, even in the presence ofchaotic mixing. the fraction of particles linked to (massive) stellar streamsin these volumes can be as large as 84%. the number of identified streams isfound to decrease as a power-law with galactocentric radius. we show that thestrongest limitation to the quantification of substructure in ourpoorest-resolved local volumes is particle resolution rather than strongdiffusion due to chaotic mixing.

1311.1215	counterrotating stars in simulated galaxy disks	counterrotating stars in disk galaxies are a puzzling dynamical feature whoseorigin has been ascribed to either satellite accretion events or to diskinstabilities triggered by deviations from axisymmetry. we use a cosmologicalsimulation of the formation of a disk galaxy to show that counterrotatingstellar disk components may arise naturally in hierarchically-clusteringscenarios even in the absence of merging. the simulated disk galaxy consists oftwo coplanar, overlapping stellar components with opposite spins: an innercounterrotating bar-like structure made up mostly of old stars surrounded by anextended, rotationally-supported disk of younger stars. the opposite-spincomponents originate from material accreted from two distinct filamentarystructures which at turn around, when their net spin is acquired, intersectdelineating a "v"-like structure. each filament torques the other in oppositedirections; the filament that first drains into the galaxy forms the innercounterrotating bar, while material accreted from the other filament forms theouter disk. mergers do not play a substantial role and most stars in the galaxyare formed in situ; only 9% of all stars are contributed by accretion events.the formation scenario we describe here implies a significant age differencebetween the co- and counterrotating components, which may be used todiscriminate between competing scenarios for the origin of counterrotatingstars in disk galaxies.

1312.0945	the mass-concentration-redshift relation of cold dark matter halos	we use the millennium simulation series to investigate the mass and redshiftdependence of the concentration of equilibrium cold dark matter (cdm) halos. weextend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assemblyhistories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations forhalos of all masses and at any redshift. our results clarify the link betweenconcentration and the ``collapse redshift'' of a halo as well as whyconcentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless``peak height'' mass parameter, $\nu(m,z)=\delta_{\rm crit}(z)/\sigma(m,z)$. wecombine these results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the$c(m,z)$ relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through directsimulation. our model predicts that, at given $z$, $c(m)$ should deviatesystematically from a simple power law at high masses, where concentrationsapproach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations aresubstantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits.this correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor fromsubstructure by about one order of magnitude. the model also reproduces the$c(m,z)$ dependence on cosmological parameters reported in earlier work, andthus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology andthe mass-concentration-redshift relation of cdm halos.

1402.0903	the shape of dark matter subhalos in the aquarius simulations	we analyze the aquarius simulations to characterize the shape of dark matterhalos with peak circular velocity in the range 8&lt;vmax&lt;200 km/s, and perform aconvergence study using the various aquarius resolution levels. for theconverged objects, we determine the principal axis (a&lt;b&lt;c) of the normalizedinertia tensor as a function of radius. we find that the triaxiality of fieldhalos is an increasing function of halo mass, so that the smallest halos in oursample are ~40-50% rounder than milky way-like objects at the radius where thecircular velocity peaks, rmax. we find that the distribution of subhalo axisratios is consistent with that of field halos of comparable vmax. inner andouter contours within each object are well aligned, with the major axispreferentially pointing in the radial direction for subhalos closest to thecenter of their host halo. we also analyze the dynamical structure of subhaloslikely to host luminous satellites comparable to the classical dwarfspheroidals in the local group. these halos have axis ratios that increase withradius, and which are mildly triaxial with &lt;b/a&gt;~0.75 and &lt;c/a&gt;~0.60 at r~1kpc. their velocity ellipsoid become strongly tangentially biased in theoutskirts as a consequence of tidal stripping.

1403.4945	the pandas field of streams: stellar structures in the milky way halo  toward andromeda and triangulum	we reveal the highly structured nature of the milky way stellar halo withinthe footprint of the pandas photometric survey from blue main sequence and mainsequence turn-off stars. we map no fewer than five stellar structures within aheliocentric range of ~5 to 30 kpc. some of these are known (the monocerosring, the pisces/triangulum globular cluster stream), but we also uncover threewell-defined stellar structures that could be, at least partly, responsible forthe so-called triangulum/andromeda and triangulum/andromeda 2 features. inparticular, we trace a new faint stellar stream located at a heliocentricdistance of ~17 kpc. with a surface brightness of \sigma_v ~ 32-32.5mag/arcsec^2, it follows an orbit that is almost parallel to the galactic planenorth of m31 and has so far eluded surveys of the milky way halo as these tendto steer away from regions dominated by the galactic disk. investigating ourfollow-up spectroscopic observations of pandas, we serendipitously uncover aradial velocity signature from stars that have colors and magnitudes compatiblewith the stream. from the velocity of eight likely member stars, we show thatthis stellar structure is dynamically cold, with an unresolved velocitydispersion that is lower than 7.1 km/s at the 90-percent confidence level.along with the width of the stream (300-650 pc), its dynamics points to adwarf-galaxy-accretion origin. the numerous stellar structures we can map inthe milky way stellar halo between 5 and 30 kpc and their varying morphology isa testament to the complex nature of the stellar halo at these intermediatedistances.

1404.3724	bent by baryons: the low mass galaxy-halo relation	the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos is of vital importancefor evaluating theoretical predictions of structure formation and galaxyformation physics. we show that the widely used method of abundance matchingbased on dark matter only simulations fails at the low mass end because two ofits underlying assumptions are broken: only a small fraction of low mass (below10^9.5 solar masses) halos host a visible galaxy, and halos grow at a lowerrate due to the effect of baryons. in this regime, reliance on dark matter onlysimulations for abundance matching is neither accurate nor self-consistent. wefind that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halomasses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching doesnot point to a failure of lcdm, but simply to a failure to account for baryoniceffects. our results also imply that the local group contains only a fewhundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs thatabundance matching would suggest. we show how relations derived from abundancematching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently tocalibrate models of galaxy formation.

1405.4870	comparing m31 and milky way satellites: the extended star formation  histories of andromeda ii and andromeda xvi	we present the first comparison between the lifetime star formation histories(sfhs) of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites. using the advanced camera forsurveys aboard the hubble space telescope, we obtained deep optical imaging ofandromeda ii (m$_{v} = -$12.0; log(m$_{\star}$/m$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 6.7) andandromeda xvi (m$_{v} = -$7.5; log(m$_{\star}$/m$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 4.9)yielding color-magnitude diagrams that extend at least 1 magnitude below theoldest main sequence turnoff, and are similar in quality to those available forthe mw companions. and ii and and xvi show strikingly similar sfhs: both formed50-70% of their total stellar mass between 12.5 and 5 gyr ago (z$\sim$5-0.5)and both were abruptly quenched $\sim$ 5 gyr ago (z$\sim$0.5). the predominanceof intermediate age populations in and xvi makes it qualitatively differentfrom faint companions of the mw and clearly not a pre-reionization fossil.neither and ii nor and xvi appears to have a clear analog among mw companions,and the degree of similarity in the sfhs of and ii and and xvi is not seenamong comparably faint-luminous pairs of mw satellites. these findings providehints that satellite galaxy evolution may vary substantially among hosts ofsimilar stellar mass. although comparably deep observations of more m31satellites are needed to further explore this hypothesis, our results underlinethe need for caution when interpreting satellite galaxies of an individualsystem in a broader cosmological context.

1405.5540	the imprint of reionization on the star formation histories of dwarf  galaxies	we explore the impact of cosmic reionization on nearby isolated dwarfgalaxies using a compilation of sfhs estimated from deep hst data and acosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the local group. the nearby dwarfsshow a wide diversity of star formation histories; from ancient systems thathave largely completed their star formation $\sim 10$ gyr ago to young dwarfsthat have formed the majority of their stars in the past $\sim 5$ gyr totwo-component systems characterized by the overlap of comparable numbers of oldand young stars. taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips tolower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4&lt;t$/gyr $&lt;8$), a feature thatwe trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. reionizationheats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low masshalos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that correspondsto a virial temperature of $\sim 2 \times 10^4 $ $\mathrm{k}$ at $z_{\rmreion}$.  the loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity ofearly-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early starformation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single oldstellar component prevails. in halos below the threshold at $z_{\rm reion}$,reionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lastsuntil the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cooland form stars. young stellar components therefore dominate in dwarfs whosehalos assemble late and thus form few stars before reionization. two-componentsystems may be traced to late mergers of individual examples of the twoaforementioned cases. the relative dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearbydwarfs might thus be the clearest signature yet identified of the imprint ofcosmic reionization on the star formation history of dwarf galaxies.

1406.6362	the chosen few: the low mass halos that host faint galaxies	since reionization prevents star formation in most halos below 3 x 10^9 solarmasses, dwarf galaxies only populate a fraction of existing dark matter halos.we use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the local group to study thediscriminating factors for galaxy formation in the early universe and connectthem to the present-day properties of galaxies and halos. a combination ofselection effects related to reionization, and the subsequent evolution ofhalos in different environments, introduces strong biases between thepopulation of halos that host dwarf galaxies, and the total halo population.halos that host galaxies formed earlier and are more concentrated. in addition,halos more affected by tidal stripping are more likely to host a galaxy for agiven mass or maximum circular velocity, vmax, today. consequently, satellitehalos are populated more frequently than field halos, and satellite halos of10^8 - 10^9 solar masses or vmax of 12 - 20 km/s, similar to the local groupdwarf spheroidals, have experienced a greater than average reduction in bothmass and vmax after infall. they are on closer, more radial orbits with higherinfall velocities and earlier infall times. together, these effects make dwarfgalaxies highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution.

1407.7040	the eagle project: simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and  their environments	we introduce the virgo consortium's eagle project, a suite of hydrodynamicalsimulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes inrepresentative volumes. we discuss the limitations of such simulations in lightof their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and howthese affect their predictive power. one major improvement is our treatment offeedback from massive stars and agn in which thermal energy is injected intothe gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowingwinds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. becausethe feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, wecalibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of thegalaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.the observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over thefull mass range, $10^8 &lt; m_*/m_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreementclose to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented forhydrodynamical simulations. we compare our results to a representative set oflow-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find goodagreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passivefractions, tully-fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxyclusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic civ and ovi. whilethe mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent withobservations for $m_* \gtrsim 10^9 m_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep atlower masses. the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters ofgalaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting ahigher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for agn feedback. eagleconstitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

1407.7867	elemental abundances in milky way-like galaxies from a hierarchical  galaxy formation model	we develop a new method to account for the finite lifetimes of stars andtrace individual abundances within a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.at variance with previous methods, based on the storage of the (binned) paststar formation history of model galaxies, our method projects the informationabout the metals produced by each simple stellar population (ssp) in thefuture. using this approach, an accurate accounting of the timings andproperties of the individual ssps composing model galaxies is possible. weanalyse the dependence of our chemical model on various ingredients, and applyit to six simulated haloes of roughly milky way mass and with no massive closeneighbour at z=0. for all models considered, the [fe/h] distributions of thestars in the disc component are in good agreement with milky way data, whilefor the spheroid component (whose formation we model only through mergers)these are offset low with respect to observational measurements for the milkyway bulge. this is a consequence of narrow star formation histories, withrelatively low rates of star formation. the slow recycling of gas and energyfrom supernovae in our chemical model has important consequences on thepredicted star formation rates, which are systematically lower than thecorresponding rates in the same physical model but with an instantaneousrecycling approximation. the halo that resembles most our galaxy in terms ofits global properties also reproduces the observed relation between the averagemetallicity and luminosity of the milky way satellites, albeit with a slightlysteeper slope.

1410.6161	galactic tides and the shape and orientation of dwarf galaxy satellites	we use cosmological n-body simulations from the aquarius project to study thetidal effects of a dark matter halo on the shape and orientation of itssubstructure. although tides are often assumed to enhance asphericity and tostretch subhaloes tangentially, these effects are short lived: as in earlierwork, we find that subhaloes affected by tides become substantially morespherical and show a strong radial alignment toward the centre of the hosthalo. these results, combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,may be used to assess the effect of galactic tides on the observed populationof dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellites of the milky way and andromeda galaxies.if, as the model suggests, the relatively low dark matter content of luminousdsphs such as fornax and leo i is due to tidal stripping, then theirgravitational potential must be substantially more spherical than that of moreheavily dark matter-dominated systems such as draco or carina. the model alsopredicts a tidally-induced statistical excess of satellites whose major axisaligns with the direction to the central galaxy. we find tantalizing evidenceof this in the m31 satellite population, which suggests that tides may haveplayed an important role in its evolution.

1504.01437	the unexpected diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves	we examine the circular velocity profiles of galaxies in {\lambda}cdmcosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the eagle and local groupsprojects and compare them with a compilation of observed rotation curves ofgalaxies spanning a wide range in mass. the shape of the circular velocityprofiles of simulated galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxymass, but shows remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity.this is especially true for low-mass dark matter-dominated systems, reflectingthe expected similarity of the underlying cold dark matter haloes. this is atodds with observed dwarf galaxies, which show a large diversity of rotationcurve shapes, even at fixed maximum rotation speed. some dwarfs have rotationcurves that agree well with simulations, others do not. the latter are systemswhere the inferred mass enclosed in the inner regions is much lower thanexpected for cold dark matter haloes and include many galaxies where previouswork claims the presence of a constant density "core". the "cusp vs core" issueis thus better characterized as an "inner mass deficit" problem than as adensity slope mismatch. for several galaxies the magnitude of this inner massdeficit is well in excess of that reported in recent simulations where coresresult from baryon-induced fluctuations in the gravitational potential. weconclude that one or more of the following statements must be true: (i) thedark matter is more complex than envisaged by any current model; (ii) currentsimulations fail to reproduce the effects of baryons on the inner regions ofdwarf galaxies; and/or (iii) the mass profiles of "inner mass deficit" galaxiesinferred from kinematic data are incorrect.

1507.03643	the apostle project: local group kinematic mass constraints and  simulation candidate selection	we use a large sample of isolated dark matter halo pairs drawn fromcosmological n-body simulations to identify candidate systems whose kinematicsmatch that of the local group of galaxies (lg). we find, in agreement with the"timing argument" and earlier work, that the separation and approach velocityof the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) galaxies favour a total mass for thepair of ~ 5*10^12 m_sun. a mass this large, however, is difficult to reconcilewith the small relative tangential velocity of the pair, as well as with thesmall deceleration from the hubble flow observed for the most distant lgmembers. halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses afactor of ~2 times smaller than suggested by the timing argument, but withlarge dispersion, spanning more than a decade in mass. guided by these results,we have selected 12 halo pairs with total mass in the range 1.6-3.6 *10^12m_sun for the apostle project (a project of simulations of the localenvironment), a suite of resimulations at various numerical resolution levels(reaching up to ~10^4 m_sun per gas particle) that use the hydrodynamical codeand subgrid physics developed for the eagle project. these simulationsreproduce, by construction, the main kinematics of the mw-m31 pair, and producesatellite populations whose overall number, luminosities, and kinematics are ingood agreement with observations of the mw and m31 companions. thesediagnostics are sensitive to the total mass assumed for the mw-m31 pair;indeed, the lg satellite population would be quite difficult to reproduce forpair masses as high as indicated by the timing argument. the apostle candidatesystems thus provide an excellent testbed to confront directly many of thepredictions of the lambda-cdm cosmology with observations of our localuniverse.

1509.02166	dark matter annihilation radiation in hydrodynamic simulations of milky  way haloes	we obtain predictions for the properties of cold dark matter annihilationradiation using high resolution hydrodynamic zoom-in cosmological simulationsof milky way-like galaxies (apostle project) carried out as part of the"evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle) programme.galactic halos in the simulation have significantly different properties fromthose assumed in the "standard halo model" often used in dark matter detectionstudies. the formation of the galaxy causes a contraction of the dark matterhalo, whose density profile develops a steeper slope than thenavarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile between $r\approx1.5$ kpc and $r\approx10$kpc. at smaller radii, $r\lesssim1.5$ kpc, the halos develop a flatter than nfwslope. this unexpected feature may be specific to our particular choice ofsubgrid physics model but nevertheless the dark matter density profiles agreewithin 30% as the mass resolution is increased by a factor 150. the innerregions of the halos are almost perfectly spherical (axis ratios $b/a &gt; 0.97$within $r=1$ kpc) and there is no offset larger than 45 pc between the centreof the stellar distribution and the centre of the dark halo. the morphology ofthe predicted dark matter annihilation radiation signal is in broad agreementwith $\gamma$-ray observations at large galactic latitudes ($b\gtrsim3^\circ$).at smaller angles, the inferred signal in one of our four galaxies is similarto that which is observed but it is significantly weaker in the other three.

1511.01098	the apostle simulations: solutions to the local group's cosmic puzzles	the local group of galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests ofmodels of cosmic structure formation. for example, observations of the milkyway (mw) and andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement withn-body simulations of the "lambda cold dark matter" ({\lambda}cdm) model: thereare far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos(the "missing satellites" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the mostmassive substructures (the "too-big-to-fail" problem); and the brightestsatellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes ofsatellites" problem). here we present results from apostle (a project ofsimulating the local environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the localgroup (lg) members. applying the eagle code to the lg environment, we find thatour simulations match the observed abundance of lg galaxies, including thesatellite galaxies of the mw and andromeda. due to changes to the structure ofhalos and the evolution in the lg environment, the simulations reproduce theobserved relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individualdwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in theirdark matter profiles. satellite systems form with a range of spatialanisotropies, including one similar to that of the mw, confirming that such aconfiguration is not unexpected in {\lambda}cdm. finally, based on the observedvelocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of themaximum circular velocity for the halos of nine mw dwarf spheroidals.

1511.06188	mergers and the outside-in formation of dwarf spheroidals	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group toexplore the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidalgalaxies. we find that a number of simulated dwarfs form "outside-in", with anold, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentratedmetal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like sculptor orsextans. we focus on a few examples where stars form in two populationsdistinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. thespatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; theold stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young populationforms largely in situ. the older component results from a first episode of starformation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects ofstellar feedback and reionization. the younger component forms when a lateaccretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. the effect of mergers isto disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasingtheir central density relative to the young population. we argue thatdwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systemswith multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of ageand metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.

astro-ph;0001003	dark halo and disk galaxy scaling laws in hierarchical universes	we use cosmological n-body/gasdynamical simulations that include starformation and feedback to examine the proposal that scaling laws between thetotal luminosity, rotation speed, and angular momentum of disk galaxies reflectanalogous correlations between the structural parameters of their surroundingdark matter halos. the numerical experiments follow the formation ofgalaxy-sized halos in two cold dark matter dominated universes: the standardomega=1 cdm scenario and the currently popular lcdm model. we find that theslope and scatter of the i-band tully-fisher relation are well reproduced inthe simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of thecosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: largesystematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxiesand in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in ournumerical experiments. the tully-fisher slope and scatter are recovered in thismodel as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assemblyof the luminous component of the galaxy. we conclude that models that neglectthe self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of thehalo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope ofthe tully-fisher relation. our models fail, however, to match the zero-point ofthe tully-fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking diskrotation speed and angular momentum. these failures can be traced,respectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed inthe cold dark matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxydisks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events.

astro-ph;0004078	the origin of star formation gradients in rich galaxy clusters	we examine the origin of clustercentric gradients in the star formation ratesand colors of rich cluster galaxies within the context of a simple model whereclusters are built through the ongoing accretion of field galaxies. the modelassumes that after galaxies enter the cluster their star formation ratesdecline on a timescale of a few gyrs, the typical gas consumption timescale ofdisk galaxies in the field. such behaviour might be expected if tides and rampressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation inspirals over a hubble time. combining these timescales with mass accretionhistories derived from n-body simulations of cluster formation in a lambda-cdmuniverse, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the colordistribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppressionof star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentricradius. the simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxiesbeyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body ofthe cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation inthe outskirts of clusters (and as far out as two virial radii) issystematically suppressed relative to the field. the agreement with the databeyond the cluster virial radius is also improved if we assume that strippinghappens within lower mass systems, before the galaxy is accreted into the mainbody of the cluster. we conclude that the star formation rates of clustergalaxies depend primarily on the time elapsed since their accretion ontomassive virialized systems, and that the cessation of star formation may havetaken place gradually over a few gyrs.

astro-ph;0012334	dark halo and disk galaxy scaling laws	i highlight recent progress in our understanding of the origin of disk galaxyscaling laws in a hierarchically clustering universe. numerical simulations ofgalaxy formation in cold dark matter (cdm) dominated universes indicate thatthe slope and scatter of the i-band tully-fisher (tf) relation are wellreproduced in this model, although not, as proposed in recent work, because ofthe cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity, butrather as a result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of theluminous component of the galaxy. the zero-point of the tf relation isdetermined mainly by the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($\upsilon_i$) as well asby the concentration ($c$) of the dark halo. for $c \sim 10$, as is typical ofhalos formed in the ``concordance'' $\lambda$cdm model, we find that thisrequires $\upsilon_i \sim 1.5$, in reasonable agreement with the mass-to-lightratios expected of stellar populations with colors similar to those of tfgalaxies. this conclusion supersedes that of navarro &amp; steinmetz (2000a,b), whoclaimed the $\lambda$cdm halos were too concentrated to be consistent with theobserved tf relation. the disagreement can be traced to inconsistencies in thenormalization of the power spectrum used in that work. our new results showthat simulated disk galaxies in the $\lambda$cdm scenario are not clearlyinconsistent with the observed i-band tully-fisher relation. on the otherhand,their angular momenta is much lower than observed. accountingsimultaneously for the spin, size and luminosity of disk galaxies remains achallenge for hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0104002	the phase-space density profiles of cold dark matter halos	we examine the coarse-grained phase-space density profiles of a set ofrecent, high-resolution simulations of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (cdm)halos. over two and a half decades in radius the phase-space density closelyfollows a power-law, $\rho/\sigma^3 \propto r^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha =1.875$. this behaviour matches the self-similar solution obtained bybertschinger for secondary infall in a uniformly expanding universe. on theother hand, the density profile corresponding to bertschinger's solution (apower-law of slope $r^{2\alpha-6}$) differs significantly from the densityprofiles of cdm halos. we show that isotropic mass distributions with power-lawphase-space density profiles form a one-parameter family of structurescontrolled by $\kappa$, the ratio of the velocity dispersion to the peakcircular velocity. for $\kappa=\alpha=1.875$ one recovers the power-lawsolution $\rho \propto r^{2\alpha-6}$. for $\kappa$ larger than some criticalvalue, $\kappa_{cr}$, solutions become non-physical, leading to negativedensities near the center. the critical solution, $\kappa =\kappa_{cr}$, hasthe narrowest phase-space density distribution compatible with the power-lawphase-space density stratification constraint. over three decades in radius thecritical solution is indistinguishable from an nfw profile. our results thussuggest that the nfw profile is the result of a hierarchical assembly processthat preserves the phase-space stratification of bertschinger's infall modelbut which ``mixes'' the system maximally, perhaps as a result of repeatedmerging.

astro-ph;0110680	the inner structure of cold dark matter halos	i report on recent progress in our understanding of the structure of cdmhalos, and in particular of the inner mass profile of galaxy-sized systems.numerical simulations have consistently shown that the density profiles of cdmhalos steepen monotonically from the center outwards, with slopes shallowerthan isothermal near the center and steeper than isothermal near the virialradius. ongoing debate centers on the precise radial dependence of thelogarithmic slope, as well as on whether it approaches a well definedasymptotic central value. the latest high-resolution simulations suggest thatthe circular velocity profile is well approximated by the model proposed bynavarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw). on the other hand, the radial dependence of theslope of the density profile differs modestly, but significantly, from themodel proposed by nfw. as a result, nfw fits tend to underestimate the densityat radii just inside the scale radius. rather than implying a very steep (-1.5)inner divergent slope, i argue that the data is actually best represented by amodel where the density profile becomes increasingly shallow with radius, withlittle sign of approach to a well-defined asymptotic value. a model where the{\it phase-space density profile} is a power law accounts well for theseresults and suggests that the innermost slope may be as shallow as -0.75. theseconclusions are supported by a thorough numerical convergence study thatelucidates the effect of numerical parameters such as the timestep,gravitational softening, and particle number, on the mass profile of simulateddark matter halos.

astro-ph;0202466	the hierarchical origin of galaxy morphologies	we report first results from a series of n-body/gasdynamical simulationsdesigned to study the origin of galaxy morphologies in a cold darkmatter-dominated universe. the simulations include star formation and feedbackand have numerical resolution sufficiently high to allow for a directinvestigation of the morphology of simulated galaxies. we find, in agreementwith previous theoretical work, that the presence of the main morphologicalcomponents of galaxies--disks, spheroids, bars--is regulated by the mode of gasaccretion and intimately linked to discrete accretion events. in the case wepresent, disks arise from the smooth deposition of cooled gas at the center ofdark halos, spheroids result from the stirring of preexisting disks duringmergers, and bars are triggered by tides generated by satellites. thisdemonstrates that morphology is a transient phenomenon within the lifetime of agalaxy and that the hubble sequence reflects the varied accretion histories ofgalaxies in hierarchical formation scenarios. in particular, we demonstratedirectly that disk/bulge systems can be built and rebuilt by the smoothaccretion of gas onto the remnant of a major merger and that the present-dayremnants of late dissipative mergers between disks are spheroidal stellarsystems with structure resembling that of field ellipticals. the perplexingvariety of galaxy morphologies is thus highly suggestive of--and may actuallyeven demand--a universe where structures have evolved hierarchically.

astro-ph;0203004	the structural evolution of substructure	we investigate the evolution of substructure in cold dark matter halos usingn-body simulations of tidal stripping of substructure halos (subhalos) within astatic host potential. we find that halos modeled following the navarro, frenk&amp; white (nfw) mass profile lose mass continuously due to tides from the massivehost, leading to the total disruption of satellite halos with small tidalradii. the structure of stripped nfw halos depends mainly on the fraction ofmass lost, and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the originalnfw profile. we apply these results to substructure in the milky way, andconclude that the dark matter halos surrounding its dwarf spheroidal (dsph)satellites have circular velocity curves that peak well beyond the luminousradius at velocities significantly higher than expected from the stellarvelocity dispersion. our modeling suggests that the true tidal radii of dsphslie well beyond the putative tidal cutoff observed in the surface brightnessprofile, suggesting that the latter are not really tidal in origin but ratherfeatures in the light profile of limited dynamical relevance. for draco, inparticular, our modeling implies that its tidal radius is much larger thanderived by irwin &amp; hatzidimitriou (1995), lending support to the interpretationof recent sloan survey data by odenkirchen et al. (2001). similarly, our modelsuggests that carina's halo has a peak circular velocity of ~55 km/s, which mayhelp explain how this small galaxy has managed to retain enough gas to undergoseveral bursts of star formation. our results imply a close correspondencebetween the most massive subhalos expected in a cdm universe and the knownsatellites of the milky way, and suggest that only subhalos with peak circularvelocities below 35 km/s lack readily detectable luminous counterparts.

astro-ph;0211331	simulations of galaxy formation in a lambda cdm universe i: dynamical  and photometric properties of a simulated disk galaxy	we analyze the properties of a disk galaxy simulated with unprecedentednumerical resolution in the lambda cdm cosmogony. the galaxy is assembledthrough a number of high-redshift mergers followed by a period of quiescentaccretion after z~1 which lead to the formation of two distinct dynamicalcomponents: a spheroid and a disk. the surface brightness profile is very wellapproximated by the superposition of an r^{1/4} spheroid and an exponentialdisk. the surface brightness profile is remarkably similar to that of sabgalaxy ugc615, but the simulated galaxy rotates significantly faster and has adeclining rotation curve dominated by the spheroid near the center. the declinein circular velocity is at odds with observation and results from the highconcentration of the dark matter and baryonic components, as well as from therelatively high mass-to-light ratio of the stars in the simulation. thesimulated galaxy lies ~ 1 mag off the i-band tully-fisher relation of late-typespirals, but seems to be in reasonable agreement with tully-fisher data on s0galaxies. the angular momentum of the luminous component is an order ofmagnitude lower than that of late-type spirals of similar rotation speed. thisreflects the dominance of the slowly-rotating, dense spheroidal component. thedisk component, on the other hand, has properties rather similar to those oflate-type spirals. this suggests that a different form of feedback than adoptedin this simulation is required to inhibit the efficient collapse and cooling ofgas at high redshift that leads to the formation of the spheroid. reconcilingthe properties of disk galaxies with the early collapse and high merging ratescharacteristic of hierarchical scenarios such as lambda cdm remains achallenging, yet so far elusive, proposition.

astro-ph;0212282	simulations of galaxy formation in a lambda cdm universe ii: the fine  structure of simulated galactic disks	we present a detailed analysis of the dynamical properties of a simulateddisk galaxy assembled hierarchically in the lambda cdm cosmogony. at z=0, twodistinct dynamical components are identified on the basis of the orbitalparameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating, centrally concentratedspheroid and a disk-like component largely supported by rotation. thesecomponents are also recognized in the surface brightness profile of the galaxy,which can be very well approximated by the superposition of an r^{1/4} spheroidand an exponential disk. however, neither does the dynamically-identifiedspheroid follow de vaucouleurs' law nor is the disk purely exponential, aresultwhich calls for caution when estimating the importance of the disk fromtraditional photometric decomposition techniques. the disk may be furtherdecomposed into a thin, dynamically cold component with stars on nearlycircularorbits and a hotter, thicker component with orbital parameterstransitional between the thin disk and the spheroid. the spheroid is old, andhas essentiallyno stars younger than the time elapsed since the last majoraccretion event ~8 gyr ago. the majority of thin disk stars, form after themerging activity is over, although a significant fraction ~15% of thin-diskstars are old enough to predate the last major merger event. this unexpectedpopulation of old disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satelliteswhose orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits werecircularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. our resultshighlight the role of satellite accretion events in shaping the disk and thespheroidal component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly process of agalaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar populations.

astro-ph;0301224	simulations of galaxy formation in a lambda cdm universe iii: the  dissipative formation of an elliptical galaxy	we examine in detail the dynamical structure of an elliptical galaxysimulated in the lambda cdm scenario. the morphology of the galaxy evolvesdramatically over time in response to the mode and timing of mass accretion;smooth deposition of cooled gas leads to the formation of centrifugallysupported disks, whilst major mergers disperse stellar disks into spheroids.these two modes of accretion alternate successively until z~0.6, when thegalaxy undergoes one last major (1:2) merger that consumes much of theremaining gas into stars. little gas cools and accretes subsequently and, as aresult, most stars at z=0 are in a spheroidal component that resemblespresent-day elliptical galaxies. dynamically, the galaxy is well approximatedby an e4 oblate rotator. boxy isophotes are obtained when the galaxy is seenface-on and vrot/sigma&lt;&lt;1. on the other hand, disky isophotes are found forinclinations which maximize vrot/sigma. the line-of-sight velocity distributionis nearly gaussian at all radii. the sign of the gauss-hermite skewnessparameter h3 is anti-correlated with the apparent sense of rotation, inagreement with observed trends. the simulated galaxy has much higher effectivesurface brightness than normal ellipticals of similar luminosity, in a wayreminiscent of the less common type of compact ellipticals. our simulationshows that repeated episodes of dissipational collapse, followed by mergerevents, lead to stellar spheroids that are only mildly triaxial and ofrelatively simple kinematic structure. this is in better agreement withobservation than earlier models based on dissipationless mergers of stellardisks, and a positive step towards reconciling the observed structure ofellipticals with the hierarchical merging scenario.

astro-ph;0303305	on the nature of the ring-like structure in the outer galactic disk	we examine the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies in a cosmologicalsimulation of the formation of a disk galaxy in the $\lambda$cdm scenario. wefind that the disruption of satellite galaxies in orbits roughly coplanar withthe disk leads naturally to the formation of ring-like stellar structuressimilar to that recently discovered in the outer disk of the milky way. twointerpretations appear plausible in this context. one is that the ring is atransitory, localized radial density enhancement reflecting the apocenter ofparticles stripped from a satellite during a recent pericentric passage (a``tidal arc'' reminiscent of the tidal arms seen in disk galaxy mergers). inthe second scenario, the ring is analogous to the ``shells'' found around someelliptical galaxies, and would result from a minor merger that took placeseveral gyr ago. the two interpretations differ in several ways. tidal arcs areexpected to span a limited longitude range; may carry a substantial fraction ofthe original mass of the satellite; should exhibit a significant velocitygradient with galactic longitude; and are in all likelihood asymmetric aboveand below the plane of the disk. shells, on the other hand, may comprise atmost a small fraction of the original mass of the satellite and, due to theirmore relaxed state, ought to be symmetric above and below the plane, with nodiscernible velocity gradients across the structure. if confirmed as a tidalfeature, the ring discovered by sdss in the outer galactic disk wouldstrengthen the view--supported by numerical simulations--that minor mergershave played a significant role building up not only the stellar halo, but alsothe disk components of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0306238	the signature of substructure on gravitational lensing in the lcdm  cosmological model	we present a study of the lens properties of quadruply imaged systems, lensedby numerically simulated galaxies. we investigate a simulated elliptical anddisc galaxy drawn from high resolution simulations of galaxy formation in aconcordance $\lambda$cdm universe. the simulations include the effects of gasdynamics, star formation and feedback processes. flux-ratio anomalies observedin strong gravitational lensing potentially provide an indicator for thepresence of mass substructure in lens galaxies as predicted from cdmsimulations. we particularly concentrate on the prediction that, for an idealcusp caustic, the sum of the signed magnifications of the three highlymagnified images should vanish when the source approaches the cusp. strongviolation of this cusp relation indicates the presence of substructure,regardless of the global, smooth mass model of the lens galaxy. we draw thefollowing conclusions: (1) the level of substructure present in simulationsproduces violations of the cusp relation comparable to those observed, (2)higher-order catastrophes (e.g. swallowtails) can also cause changes of theorder of 0.6 in the cusp relation as predicted by a smooth model, (3) the fluxanomaly distribution depends on the image parity and flux and both thebrightest minimum and saddle-point images are more affected by substructurethan the fainter images. in addition, the brightest saddle point is demagnifiedw.r.t. the brightest minimum. our results are fully numerical and properlyinclude all mass scales, without making semi-analytic assumptions. they areultimately limited by the mass resolution of single particles in the simulationdetermined by current computational limits, however show that our results arenot affected by shot-noise due to the finite number of particles.

astro-ph;0311107	the extragalactic origin of the arcturus group	we reanalyze the group of stars associated kinematically with arcturus (eggen1971), and confirm that they constitute a peculiar grouping of metal-poor starswith similar apocentric radius, common angular momentum, and distinct metalabundance patterns. these properties are consistent with those expected for agroup of stars originating from the debris of a disrupted satellite. thearcturus group stands out clearly in the catalog of beers et al. (2000) as wellas in other compilations of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood. itsangular momentum appears too low to arise from dynamical perturbations inducedby the galactic bar, and coincides with that of the kinematically-peculiarpopulation of stars identified above and below the galactic plane by gilmore,wyse &amp; norris (2002): the arcturus group is in all likelihood the solarneighborhood extension of such population. further analysis is needed toconfirm our proposal that arcturus, together with some of the brightest starsin the night sky, may have formed beyond the confines of the galaxy. however,validating the extragalactic origin of the arcturus group would lend support tothe prevalence of accretion events envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxyformation, and would suggest that early mergers may have contributed asubstantial fraction of the old and metal-deficient stars in the galactic disk.

astro-ph;0311231	the inner structure of lambdacdm halos iii: universality and asymptotic  slopes	we investigate the mass profile of lambdacdm halos using a suite of numericalsimulations spanning five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to richgalaxy clusters. our analysis confirms the proposal of navarro, frenk &amp; white(nfw) that the shape of lambdacdm halo mass profiles differs strongly from apower law and depends little on mass. the logarithmic slope of thespherically-averaged density profile, as measured by beta=-dln(rho)/dln(r),decreases monotonically towards the center and becomes shallower thanisothermal (beta&lt;2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}. although thefitting formula proposed by nfw provides a reasonably good approximation to thedensity and circular velocity profiles of individual halos, systematicdeviations from the best nfw fits are also noticeable. inside r_{-2}, theprofile of simulated halos gets shallower with radius more gradually thanpredicted and, as a result, nfw fits tend to underestimate the dark matterdensity in these regions. this discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating asteeply divergent cusp, but our results suggest a different interpretation. weuse the density and enclosed mass at our innermost resolved radii to placestrong constraints on beta_{0}: density cusps as steep as r^{-1.5} areinconsistent with most of our simulations, although beta_{0}=1 is stillconsistent with our data. our density profiles show no sign of converging to awell-defined asymptotic inner power law. we propose a simple formula thatreproduces the radial dependence of the slope better than the nfw profile, andso may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yetreliably probed by numerical simulations.

astro-ph;0311361	the inner density cusp of cold dark matter halos	i report recent results of numerical simulations designed to study the innerstructure of cold dark matter (cdm) halos. this work confirms the proposal ofnavarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) that the shape of lambdacdm halo mass profilesdiffers strongly from a power law and is approximately independent of mass. thelogarithmic slope of the spherically-averaged density profile, as measured bybeta=-dln(rho)/dlnr, decreases monotonically towards the center, becomesshallower than isothermal (beta&lt;2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}, andshows no evidence for convergence to a well-defined asymptotic value (beta_0)at the center. the dark mass contained within the innermost radius resolved bythe simulations places strong constraints on beta_0; cusps as steep as r^{-1.5}are clearly ruled out in our highest resolution simulations. a profile wherethe radial dependence of the slope is a simple power law, beta(r)\proptor^{\alpha}, approximates the structure of halos better than the nfw profile andso may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yetreliably probed by numerical simulations. we compare the spherically-averagedcircular velocity (v_c) profiles to the rotation curves of low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies in the samples of de blok et al and swaters et al.the v_c profiles of simulated cdm halos are generally consistent with therotation curves of lsb galaxies, but there are also some clearly discrepantcases. this disagreement has been interpreted as excluding the presence ofcusps, but it may also just reflect the difference between circular velocityand rotation speed likely to arise in gaseous disks embedded within realistictriaxial halos.

astro-ph;0405429	tidal torques and the orientation of nearby disk galaxies	we use numerical simulations to investigate the orientation of the angularmomentum axis of disk galaxies relative to their surrounding large scalestructure. we find that this is closely related to the spatial configuration atturnaround of the material destined to form the galaxy, which is often part ofa coherent two-dimensional slab criss-crossed by filaments. the rotation axisis found to align very well with the intermediate principal axis of the inertiamomentum tensor at this time. this orientation is approximately preservedduring the ensuing collapse, so that the rotation axis of the resulting diskends up lying on the plane traced by the protogalactic material at turnaround.this suggests a tendency for disks to align themselves so that their rotationaxis is perpendicular to the minor axis of the structure defined by surroundingmatter. one example of this trend is provided by our own galaxy, where thegalactic plane is almost at right angles with the supergalactic plane (sgp)drawn by nearby galaxies; indeed, the sgp latitude of the north galactic poleis just 6 degrees. we have searched for a similar signature in catalogs ofnearby disk galaxies, and find a significant excess of edge-on spirals (forwhich the orientation of the disk rotation axis may be determinedunambiguously) highly inclined relative to the sgp. this result supports theview that disk galaxies acquire their angular momentum as a consequence ofearly tidal torques acting during the expansion phase of the protogalacticmaterial.

astro-ph;0408567	accretion relicts in the solar neighbourhood: debris from omegacen's  parent galaxy	we use numerical simulations to investigate the orbital characteristics oftidal debris from satellites whose orbits are dragged into the plane ofgalactic disks by dynamical friction before disruption. we find that thesesatellites may deposit a significant fraction of their stars into the diskcomponents of a galaxy, and use our results to motivate the search foraccretion relicts in samples of metal-poor disk stars in the vicinity of thesun. satellites disrupted on very eccentric orbits coplanar with the disk areexpected to shed stars in "trails" of distinct orbital energy and angularmomentum during each pericentric passage. to an observer located between thepericenter and apocenter of such orbits, these trails would show as distinctgroupings of stars with low vertical velocity and a broad, symmetric, oftendouble-peaked distribution of galactocentric radial velocities. one group ofstars with these characteristics stands out in available compilations of nearbymetal-poor stars. these stars have specific angular momenta similar to that ofthe globular cluster omegacen, long hypothesized to be the nucleus of a dwarfgalaxy disrupted by the milky way tidal field. in addition to their kindredkinematics, stars in the omegacen group share distinct chemical abundancecharacteristics, and trace a well-defined track in the [alpha/fe] versus [fe/h]plane, consistent with simple closed-box enrichment models and a protractedstar formation history. the dynamical and chemical coherence of this groupsuggests that it consists of stars that once belonged to the dwarf that broughtomegacen into the galaxy. the presence of this and other "tidal relicts" in thesolar neighbourhood suggest an extra-galactic origin for the presence of nearbystars with odd kinematics and chemistry.

astro-ph;0506659	stars beyond galaxies: the origin of extended luminous halos around  galaxies	(abridged) we use numerical simulations to investigate the origin andstructure of the luminous halos that surround isolated galaxies. these stellarstructures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist ofstars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events thatcharacterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. such origin suggests thatouter luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess oflight over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditionalluminous radius. the mass profile of the accreted stellar component is wellapproximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically withradius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near thevirial radius of the system. such spatial distribution is consistent with thatof galactic and m31 globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globularswere brought in by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classicsearle-zinn scenario. the outer stellar spheroid is supported by a velocitydispersion tensor with a substantial and radially increasing radial anisotropy.these properties distinguish the stellar halo from the dark matter component,which is more isotropic in velocity space, as well as from some tracers of theouter spheroid such as satellite galaxies. most stars in the outer halo formedin progenitors that have since merged with the central galaxy; very few starsin the halo are contributed by satellites that survive as self-bound entitiesat the present. these features are in reasonable agreement with recentobservations of the outer halo of the mw, of m31, and of other isolatedspirals, and suggest that all of these systems underwent an early period ofactive merging, as envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

0809.0894	a blueprint for detecting supersymmetric dark matter in the galactic  halo	dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the universe, but its nature isunknown. it is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightestsupersymmetric partner of known particle species. in this case, annihilation ofdark matter in the halo of the milky way should produce gamma-rays at a levelwhich may soon be observable. previous work has argued that the annihilationsignal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps (perhaps smallereven than the earth) which would be most easily detected where they clustertogether in the dark matter halos of dwarf satellite galaxies. here we show,using the largest ever simulation of the formation of a galactic halo, thatsuch small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on darkmatter detectability. rather, the dominant and likely most easily detectablesignal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the milkyway. if the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumpsshould also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a keyprediction of the cold dark matter (cdm) model.

astro-ph;0608376	hiding cusps in cores: kinematics of disk galaxies in triaxial dark  matter halos	we study the kinematics of gaseous disks in triaxial dark matter halos usingthe closed-loop orbit solutions in non-axisymmetric potentials. the orbits arein general non-circular and, for given triaxiality, their ellipticity dependson the ratio of escape to circular velocities, v_esc^2/v_c^2. this ratioincreases steeply towards the center for cold dark matter (cdm) halo densityprofiles, implying that even minor deviations from spherical symmetry mayinduce large deviations from circular orbits in the velocity field of a gaseousdisk, especially near the center. this result suggests that caution should beexercised when interpreting constraints on the presence of density cusps in thedark halo derived from the innermost velocity profile. simulated long-slitrotation curves vary greatly in shape, depending primarily on the viewing angleof the disk and on its orientation relative to the principal axes of thepotential. "solid-body" rotation curves - typically interpreted as a signatureof a constant density core in the dark matter distribution - are often obtainedwhen the slit samples velocities near the major axis of the closed loop orbits.triaxial potentials imprint specific symmetries in 2d velocity fields,generally inducing "twists" in the isovelocity contours and anti-symmetricpatterns in opposite quadrants. we suggest that triaxial halos may beresponsible for the variety of shapes of long-slit rotation curves of lowsurface brightness (lsb) galaxies, as well as for the complex centralkinematics of lsbs, which are sometimes ascribed to the presence of "radialmotions" in the gas. we argue that lsb rotation curves might be reconciled withthe structure of cdm halos once the effects of halo triaxiality on the dynamicsof gaseous disks are properly taken into account.

astro-ph;0608687	multiple dynamical components in local group dwarf spheroidals	the dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellites of the local group have long beenthought to be simple spheroids of stars embedded within extended dark matterhalos. recently, however, evidence for the presence of spatially andkinematically distinct stellar populations has been accumulating. here, weexamine the influence of such components on dynamical models of dwarf galaxiesembedded in cold dark matter halos. we begin by constructing a model ofandromeda ii, a dsph satellite of m31 which shows evidence for spatiallydistinct stellar components. we find that the two-component model predicts anoverall velocity dispersion profile that remains approximately constant at$\sim 10 - 11$ km s$^{-1}$ out to $\sim 1$ kpc from the center; this is despitewide kinematic and spatial differences between the two individual components.the presence of two components may also help to explain oddities in thevelocity dispersion profiles of other dsphs; we show that velocity dispersionprofiles which appear to rise from the center outwards before levelingoff--such as those of leo i, draco, and fornax--can result from the gradualtransition from a dynamically cold, concentrated component to a second, hotter,and more spatially extended one, both in equilibrium within the same dark halo.dwarf galaxies with two stellar components generally have a leptokurticline-of-sight velocity distribution which is well described by a doublemaxwellian. interestingly, we find that multiple equilibrium components couldalso provide a potential alternative origin for ``extra-tidal'' stars (normallyascribed to tidal effects) in situations where corroborating evidence for tidesmay be lacking.

astro-ph;0610602	the baryon fraction of lambdacdm haloes	we investigate the baryon fraction in dark matter haloes formed innon-radiative gas-dynamical simulations of the lambdacdm cosmogony. bycombining a realisation of the millennium simulation (springel et al.) with asimulation of a smaller volume focussing on dwarf haloes, our study spans fivedecades in halo mass, from 10^10 msun/h to 10^15 msun/h. we find that thebaryon fraction within the halo virial radius is typically 90% of the cosmicmean, with an rms scatter of 6%, independently of redshift and of halo massdown to the smallest resolved haloes. our results show that, contrary to theproposal of mo et al. (2005), pre-virialisation gravitational heating is unableto prevent the collapse of gas within galactic and proto-galactic haloes, andconfirm the need for non-gravitational feedback in order to reduce theefficiency of gas cooling and star formation in dwarf galaxy haloes.simulations including a simple photoheating model (where a gas temperaturefloor of t_{floor} = 2x10^4 k is imposed from z=11) confirm earlier suggestionsthat photoheating can only prevent the collapse of baryons in systems withvirial temperatures t_{200} &lt; ~2.2 t_{floor} ~ 4.4x10^4 k (corresponding to avirial mass of m_{200} ~ 10^10 msun/h and a circular velocity of v_{200} ~ 35km/s). photoheating may thus help regulate the formation of dwarf spheroidalsand other galaxies at the extreme faint-end of the luminosity function, but itcannot, on its own, reconcile the abundance of sub-l* galaxies with the vastnumber of dwarf haloes expected in the lambdacdm cosmogony. the lack ofevolution or mass dependence seen in the baryon fraction augurs well for x-raycluster studies that assume a universal and non-evolving baryon fraction toplace constraints on cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0701780	the cold dark matter halos of local group dwarf spheroidals	we examine the dynamics of stellar systems embedded within cold dark matter(cdm) halos in order to assess observational constraints on the dark mattercontent of local group dwarf spheroidals (dsphs). our analysis shows that thetotal mass within the luminous radius is reasonably well constrained andapproximately independent of the luminosity of the dwarf, highlighting the poorcorrespondence between luminosity and halo mass. this result implies that theaverage density of dark matter is substantially higher in physically smallsystems such as draco and sculptor than in larger systems such as fornax. forexample, our results imply that draco formed in a halo 5 times more massivethan fornax's despite being roughly 70 times fainter. stellar velocitydispersion profiles, sigma_p(r), provide further constraints; flat sigma_p(r)profiles imply that stars are deeply embedded within their cold dark matterhalos and so quite resilient to tidal disruption. we estimate that halos wouldneed to lose more than 90% of their original mass before tides begin affectingthe kinematics of stars.  we estimate that v_max is about 3 times higher than the central velocitydispersion of the stars, which alleviates significantly the cdm ``substructurecrisis''.  we use these results to interpret the size differences between the m31 andmilky way (mw) dsph population. our modeling indicates that this differenceshould be reflected in their kinematics, and predicts that m31 dwarfs shouldhave velocity dispersions up to a factor of ~ 2 higher than their mwcounterparts. this cdm-motivated prediction may be verified with presentobservational capabilities.

astro-ph;0703195	do mergers spin up dark matter halos?	we use a large cosmological n-body simulation to study the origin of possiblecorrelations between the merging history and spin of cold dark matter halos. inparticular, we examine claims that remnants of major mergers tend to havehigher-than-average spins, and find that the effect is driven largely byunrelaxed systems: equilibrium dark matter halos show no significantcorrelation between spin and merger history. out-of-equilibrium halos have, onaverage, higher spins than relaxed systems, suggesting that the virializationprocess leads to a net decrease in the value of the spin parameter. we findthat this decrease is driven by the internal redistribution of mass and angularmomentum that occurs during virialization, a process that is especiallyefficient during major mergers, when high angular momentum material is pushedbeyond the virial radius of the remnant. since such redistribution likelyaffects the angular momentum of baryons and dark matter unevenly, our findingsquestion the common practice of identifying the specific angular momentumcontent of a halo with that of its embedded luminous component. further work isneeded to elucidate the true relation between the angular momentum content ofbaryons and dark matter in galaxy systems assembled hierarchically.

astro-ph;9408065	galaxy formation in a variety of hierarchical models	we predict the observable properties of the galaxy population in popularhierarchical models of galaxy formation. we employ a detailed semianalyticprocedure which incorporates the formation and merging of dark matter halos,the shock heating and radiative cooling of gas, self-regulated star formation,the merging of galaxies within dark matter halos, and the spectral evolution ofthe stellar populations. we contrast the standard cdm cosmogony with variantsof the cdm model having either a low value of h_0, or a low value of omega withor without a cosmological constant. in addition, we compare galaxy formation inthese cdm universes with a chdm model. we find that although the models havesome success in remedying the shortcomings of the standard cdm cosmogony, noneof these new models produce broad agreement with the whole range ofobservations. although the low-omega and omega+lambda=1 cdm models reduce thediscrepancy between the predicted and observed tully-fisher relations (the mainweakness of galaxy formation in standard cdm), these models predict an invertedcolour-magnitude relation and do not produce an exponential cut-off at thebright end of the galaxy luminosity function. all of our models predict recentstar formation and exhibit galaxy colours bluer than observed, but this problemis far more severe in the chdm model which produces colours about twomagnitudes too blue in b-k. unlike in the variants of the cdm model in the chdmcase this result is not dependent on our model of stellar feedback, but isinstead directly caused by the late epoch of structure formation in this model.

astro-ph;9408067	the assembly of galaxies in a hierarchically clustering universe	we study the formation of galaxies by using $n$-body/hydrodynamicssimulations to investigate how baryons collect at the centre of dark matterhalos. we treat the dark matter as a collisionless fluid and the baryons as anideal gas. we include the effects of gravity, pressure gradients,hydrodynamical shocks, and radiative energy losses, but we neglect starformation. our initial conditions assume a flat universe dominated by cold darkmatter with a mean baryon abundance of 10\% by mass. typical halos form throughthe merging of a few smaller systems which had themselves formed in a similarmanner at higher redshift. the gas collects at the bottom of dark matterpotential wells as soon as these are properly resolved by our simulations.there it settles into cold, tightly bound disks, and it remains cold duringsubsequent evolution. as their halos coalesce, these disks merge on a timescalethat is consistent with dynamical friction estimates based on their {\it total}(gas + surrounding dark matter) mass. both the merger rates of the disks andtheir mass spectrum are in remarkably good agreement with recent analyticmodels that describe the evolution of {\it dark halos} in a hierarchicaluniverse. this very simple model of galaxy formation suffers from seriousshortcomings. it predicts that most baryons should be locked up in galaxies,whereas in the real universe most baryons are thought to lie outside visiblegalaxies. in addition, it predicts the specific angular momentum of a disk tobe only about 20\% that of its surrounding halo, corresponding to a radiussmaller than that of observed spiral galaxy disks.

astro-ph;9508025	the structure of cold dark matter halos	we use n-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in thestandard cold dark matter cosmogony. halos are excised from simulations ofcosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at highresolution. we study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxyhalos to those of rich galaxy clusters. the spherically averaged densityprofiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling asimple ``universal'' profile. the characteristic overdensity of a halo, orequivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a waywhich reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. haloprofiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but aresignificantly shallower than $r^{-2}$ near the center and steeper than $r^{-2}$near the virial radius. matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxiesrequires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity.further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly ongalaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than thedisk rotation speed. this may explain why luminosity and dynamics areuncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiralsystems. for galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with thepresence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intraclustermedium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates ofcluster core radii found by previous authors. our results also highlight twoshortcomings of the cdm model. cdm halos are too concentrated to be consistentwith the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predictedabundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.

astro-ph;9602091	cluster correlation functions in n-body simulations	the correlation function of galaxy clusters has often been used as a test ofcosmological models. a number of assumptions are implicit in the comparison oftheoretical expectations to data. here we use an ensemble of ten large n-bodysimulations of the standard cold dark matter cosmology to investigate howcluster selection criteria and other uncertain factors influence the clustercorrelation function. we consider the effects of varying the definition of acluster, the mean number density (or equivalently the richness) in a catalogue,and the assumed normalisation of the model; we also examine the importance ofredshift space distortions. we implement five different group-findingalgorithms and construct cluster catalogues defined by mass, velocitydispersion or a measure of x-ray luminosity. we find that different clustercatalogues yield correlation functions which can differ by substantially morethan the statistical errors in any one determination. for a given clusterselection criteria, the correlation length typically varies by $\sim 20\%$ incatalogues spanning the range of intercluster separations covered by the apmand abell (richness class $\gsim 1$) catalogues. distortions produced bypeculiar velocities in redshift space enhance the correlation function at largeseparations and lead to a larger clustering length in redshift space than inreal space. the sensitivity of the cluster correlation function to variousuncertain model assumptions substantially weakens previous conclusions based onthe comparison of model predictions with real data. detailed modelling ofcluster selection procedures including the effects of selecting from projectedgalaxy catalogues is required before the cluster correlation function can beregarded as a high precision constraint on cosmological models.

astro-ph;9610188	cosmological constraints from rotation curves of disk galaxies	high-resolution n--body simulations show a remarkable similarity in thestructure of dark matter halos formed through dissipationless hierarchicalclustering. independent of halo mass, power spectrum, and cosmologicalparameters, the density profiles of dark halos can be accurately fit by scalinga simple two-parameter profile. the two parameters of the fit, which can beexpressed as the mass and characteristic density of each halo, are stronglycorrelated. the characteristic density is directly proportional to the meandensity of the universe at the time of assembly of each halo. low mass haloshave higher characteristic densities, reflecting their higher collapseredshift. using this halo structure to fit the rotation curves of a largesample of disk galaxies, we show that halos formed in the standard cold darkmatter (cdm) scenario are too centrally concentrated to be consistent with therotation curves of low-surface brightness galaxies. less concentrated halos,such as those formed in a low-density, flat cdm universe ($\omega_0=0.3$,$\lambda=0.7$), are favored by these observations. our fits also indicate thatthe dark halo is important at all radii, and that its total mass is stronglycorrelated with the luminosity of the galaxy. this model provides a naturalexplanation for the disk-halo conspiracy and for the lack of dependence of thetully-fisher relation on galaxy surface brightness.

astro-ph;9908114	the core density of dark matter halos: a critical challenge to the  lambda-cdm paradigm?	we compare the central mass concentration of cold dark matter halos found incosmological n-body simulations with constraints derived from the milky waydisk dynamics and from the tully-fisher relation. for currently favored valuesof the cosmological parameters ($\omega_0 \sim 0.3$; $\lambda_0=1-\omega_0 \sim0.7$; $h \sim 0.7$; cobe- and cluster abundance-normalized $\sigma_8$; big-bangnucleosynthesis $\omega_b$), we find that halos with circular velocitiescomparable to the rotation speed of the galaxy have typically {\it three times}more dark matter inside the solar circle than inferred from observations ofgalactic dynamics. such high central concentrations of dark matter on the scaleof galaxy disks also imply that stellar mass-to-light ratios much lower thanexpected from population synthesis models must be assumed in order to reproducethe zero-point of the tully-fisher relation. indeed, even under the extremeassumption that {\it all} baryons in a dark halo are turned into stars, diskswith conventional $i$-band stellar mass-to-light ratios ($m/l_i \sim 2 \pm 1(m/l_i)_{\odot}$) are about two magnitudes fainter than observed at a givenrotation speed. we examine several modifications to the $\lambda$cdm model thatmay account for these discrepancies and conclude that agreement can only beaccomplished at the expense of renouncing other major successes of the model.reproducing the observed properties of disk galaxies thus appears to demandsubstantial revision to the currently most successful model of structureformation.

astro-ph;9910573	the cosmological origin of disk galaxy scaling laws	we discuss possible origins of scaling laws relating structural properties ofdisk galaxies within the context of hierarchically clustering theories ofgalaxy formation. using gasdynamical simulations that incorporate the effectsof star formation we illustrate these global trends and highlight thedifficulties faced by models that envision disk galaxies as the final outcomeof a hierarchical sequence of merger events. in particular, we focus on thecosmological origin of the tully-fisher relation, and argue that thiscorrelation between the total luminosity and rotation speed of disk galaxies isa natural result of the approximately scale free formation process of themassive halos they inhabit. although the slope and scatter of the tully-fisherrelation can be readily reproduced in hierarchical formation scenarios, theobserved zero-point of the relation is inconsistent with simulations of galaxyformation in cold dark matter universes, a difficulty that can be traced to thehigh central mass concentration of dark halos formed in this cosmogony. thisresult indicates that substantial revision to the new ``standard'' model ofstructure formation ($\lambda$cdm) may be needed in order to accommodateobservations on the scale of individual disk galaxies.

0810.1429	an alternative origin for hypervelocity stars	halo stars with unusually high radial velocity ("hypervelocity" stars, orhvs) are thought to be stars unbound to the milky way that originate from thegravitational interaction of stellar systems with the supermassive black holeat the galactic center. we examine the latest hvs compilation and findpeculiarities that are unexpected in this black hole-ejection scenario. forexample, a large fraction of hvs cluster around the constellation of leo andshare a common travel time of $\sim 100$-200 myr. furthermore, their velocitiesare not really extreme if, as suggested by recent galaxy formation models, themilky way is embedded within a $2.5\times 10^{12} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ dark halowith virial velocity of $\sim 220$ km/s. in this case, the escape velocity at$\sim 50$ kpc would be $\sim 600$ km/s and very few hvs would be truly unbound.we use numerical simulations to show that disrupting dwarf galaxies maycontribute halo stars with velocities up to and sometimes exceeding the nominalescape speed of the system. these stars are arranged in a thinly-collimatedoutgoing ``tidal tail'' stripped from the dwarf during its latest pericentricpassage. we speculate that some hvs may therefore be tidal debris from a dwarfrecently disrupted near the center of the galaxy. in this interpretation, theangular clustering of hvs results because from our perspective the tail is seennearly ``end on'', whereas the common travel time simply reflects the fact thatthese stars were stripped simultaneously from the dwarf during a singlepericentric passage. this proposal is eminently falsifiable, since it makes anumber of predictions that are distinct from the black-hole ejection mechanismand that should be testable with improved hvs datasets.

0810.1522	the diversity and similarity of simulated cold dark matter halos	we study the mass, velocity dispersion, and anisotropy profiles of$\lambda$cdm halos using a suite of n-body simulations of unprecedentednumerical resolution (the {\it aquarius project}). our analysis confirms anumber of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues whereconflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. thespherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwardsand, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is $\gamma \equiv-$d$\ln\rho/$d$\ln r \simlt 1$. asymptotic inner slopes as steep as therecently claimed $\rho \propto r^{-1.2}$ are clearly ruled out. the radialdependence of $\gamma$ is well approximated by a power-law, $\gamma \proptor^{\alpha}$ (the einasto profile). the shape parameter, $\alpha$, variesslightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profilesof $\lambda$cdm halos are not strictly universal: different halos cannot, ingeneral, be rescaled to look identical. departures from similarity are alsoseen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in densityprofiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averagedpseudo-phase-space density, $\rho/\sigma^3\propto r^{-1.875}$. our conclusionsare reliable down to radii below 0.4% of the virial radius, providingwell-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects areneglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which themodifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can bejudged.

0811.1579	the signature of galactic tides in local group dwarf spheroidals	(abridged) we use n-body simulations to explore the effects of tidalstripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). we model dsphsas king spheres embedded in nfw dark halos that orbit the galactic potential oneccentric orbits. we find that episodes of stellar mass loss remove the initialcutoff of the bound stellar core. once equilibrium has been re-established theouter mass profile approaches a power-law in projection that is well describedby a simple plummer model. tides also result in transient features in the outerdensity profile. as the system re-equilibrates, an outward-moving "excess" ofstars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsedsince pericenter. if the orbit is known, these results provide a simple way toassess whether "breaks" and "bumps" in the profile of dsphs are actually tidalin origin. we apply this to the sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identifytwo features in the profile that may be traced to its two last pericentricpassages. applied to leo i, we find that any tidal break would locate beyondthe area surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of thedetection of tidal debris around this galaxy. for carina, the tidal breakshould occur at a radius twice farther than observed, suggesting that the outerexcess of stars is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. a similarcomment applies to sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for galactictides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of draco, nonethelessfollows closely a plummer-law. fornax and leo ii show no sign of a power-lawouter profile, suggesting that they have not suffered stellar tidal stripping.published profiles for other, fainter milky way dsph companions do not extendsufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment.

0812.0362	phase-space structure in the local dark matter distribution and its  signature in direct detection experiments	we study predictions for dark matter phase-space structure near the sun basedon high-resolution simulations of six galaxy halos taken from the aquariusproject. the local dm density distribution is predicted to be remarkablysmooth; the density at the sun differs from the mean over a best-fitellipsoidal equidensity contour by less than 15% at the 99.9% confidence level.the local velocity distribution is also very smooth, but it differssystematically from a (multivariate) gaussian distribution. this is not due tothe presence of individual clumps or streams, but to broad features in thevelocity modulus and energy distributions that are stable both in space andtime and reflect the detailed assembly history of each halo. these featureshave a significant impact on the signals predicted for wimp and axion searches.for example, wimp recoil rates can deviate by ~10% from those expected from thebest-fit multivariate gaussian models. the axion spectra in our simulationstypically peak at lower frequencies than in the case of multivariate gaussianvelocity distributions. also in this case, the spectra show significantimprints of the formation of the halo. this implies that once direct dmdetection has become routine, features in the detector signal will allow us tostudy the dark matter assembly history of the milky way. a new field, "darkmatter astronomy", will then emerge.
