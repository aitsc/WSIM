1001.3162	the large scale bias of dark matter halos: numerical calibration and  model tests	we measure the clustering of dark matter halos in a large set ofcollisionless cosmological simulations of the flat lcdm cosmology. halos areidentified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the massaround isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is deltatimes the background. we calibrate fitting functions for the large scale biasthat are adaptable to any value of delta we examine. we find a ~6% scatterabout our best fit bias relation. our fitting functions couple to the halo massfunctions of tinker et. al. (2008) such that bias of all dark matter isnormalized to unity. we demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos ishigher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of sheth,mo, &amp; tormen (2001), and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapsemodel for the rarest halos. halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halosidentified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos withthe canonical delta=200 overdensity by ~10%. in contrast to our previousresults on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolvesvery weakly with redshift, if at all. we use our numerical results, both forthe mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background splitmodel for halo bias. we find that the peak-background split achieves areasonable agreement with the numerical results, but ~20% residuals remain,both at high and low masses.

1005.1289	galaxies in lcdm with halo abundance matching: luminosity-velocity  relation, baryonic mass-velocity relation, velocity function and clustering	it has long been regarded as difficult for a cosmological model to accountsimultaneously for the galaxy luminosity, mass, and velocity distributions. werevisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along withthe best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter. we findthat the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundancematching (ham) and simple dynamical corrections, fits all basic statistics ofgalaxies with circular velocities vcirc &gt; 80 km/s. our observational constraintis the luminosity-velocity relation which allows all types of galaxies to beincluded. we have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarfirregulars to giant ellipticals. the data present a clear monotonicluminosity-velocity relation from 50 km/s to 500 km/s, with a bend below 80km/s and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. forcomparison to theory, we employ our lcdm "bolshoi" simulation of dark matter,which has unprecedented mass and force resolution. we use halo abundancematching to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the dark matter halos.the resulting predictions for the luminosity-velocity relation are in excellentagreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies forthe luminosity range from mr = -14-22. we also compare our predictions for the"cold" baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function ofcircular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very goodagreement. the predicted circular velocity function is in agreement with thegalaxy velocity function for 80-400 km/s. however, we find that the dark matterhalos with vcirc &lt; 80 km/s are much more abundant than observed galaxies withthe same vcirc . we find that the two-point correlation function of galaxies inour model matches very well the results from the sdss.

0708.2348	properties of voids in the local volume	current explanation of the overabundance of dark matter subhalos in the localgroup (lg) indicates that there maybe a limit on mass of a halo, which can hosta galaxy. this idea can be tested using voids in the distribution of galaxies:at some level small voids should not contain any (even dwarf) galaxies. we useobservational samples complete to m_b=-12 with distances less than 8 mpc toconstruct the void function (vf): the distribution of sizes of voids empty ofany galaxies. there are ~ 30 voids with sizes ranging from 1 to 5 mpc. we alsostudy the distribution of dark matter halos in very high resolution simulationsof the lcdm model. the theoretical vf matches the observations remarkably wellonly if we use halos with circular velocities larger than 45 +/- 10 km/s. thisagrees with the local group predictions. small voids look quite similar to heirgiant cousins: the density has a minimum at the center of a void and itincreases as we get closer to the border. thus, both the local group data andthe nearby voids indicate that isolated halos below 45 +/- 10 km/s must nothost galaxies and that small (few mpc) voids are truly dark.

1011.2203	the mass distribution and assembly of the milky way from the properties  of the magellanic clouds	we present a new measurement of the mass of the milky way (mw) based onobserved properties of its largest satellite galaxies, the magellanic clouds(mcs), and an assumed prior of a {\lambda}cdm universe. the large,high-resolution bolshoi cosmological simulation of this universe provides ameans to statistically sample the dynamical properties of bright satellitegalaxies in a large population of dark matter halos. the observed properties ofthe mcs, including their circular velocity, distance from the center of the mw,and velocity within the mw halo, are used to evaluate the likelihood that agiven halo would have each or all of these properties; the posterior pdf forany property of the mw system can thus be constructed. this method provides aconstraint on the mw virial mass, 1.2 +0.7 -0.3(stat.) +0.3 -0.4 (sys.) x 10^12m\odot (68% confidence), which is consistent with recent determinations thatinvolve very different assumptions. in addition, we calculate the posterior pdffor the density profile of the mw and its satellite accretion history. althoughtypical satellites of 10^12 m\odot halos are accreted over a wide range ofepochs over the last 10 gyr, we find a \sim72% probability that the magellanicclouds were accreted within the last gyr, and a 50% probability that they wereaccreted together.

1104.0949	haloes gone mad: the halo-finder comparison project	[abridged] we present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter haloproperties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. thesecodes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (fof),spherical-overdensity (so) and phase-space based algorithms. we furtherintroduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allowshalo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against thosepresented here. this set includes mock haloes containing various levels anddistributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as acosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. all thehalo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location ofour mock haloes. they further returned lists of particles (potentially)belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of thecircular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. all the findersbased in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was locatedclose to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the massrecovered varies from finder to finder. those finders based in phase spacecould resolve central substructure although they found difficulties inaccurately recovering its properties. via a resolution study we found that mostof the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than30-40 particles. however, also here the phase space finders excelled byresolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. by comparing the halo findersusing a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkablywell on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass,position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).

0710.1297	the fossil phase in the life of a galaxy group	we investigate the origin and evolution of fossil groups in a concordancelcdm cosmological simulation. we consider haloes with masses between$(1-5)\times10^{13} \hmsun$ and study the physical mechanisms that lead to theformation of the large gap in magnitude between the brightest and the secondmost bright group member, which is typical for these fossil systems. fossilgroups are found to have high dark matter concentrations, which we can relateto their early formation time. the large magnitude-gaps arise after the groupshave build up half of their final mass, due to merging of massive groupmembers. we show that the existence of fossil systems is primarily driven bythe relatively early infall of massive satellites, and that we do not find astrong environmental dependence for these systems. in addition, we findtentative evidence for fossil group satellites falling in on orbits withtypically lower angular momentum, which might lead to a more efficient mergeronto the host. we find a population of groups at higher redshifts that gothrough a ``fossil phase'': a stage where they show a large magnitude-gap,which is terminated by renewed infall from their environment.

1109.0003	the multidark database: release of the bolshoi and multidark  cosmological simulations	we present the online multidark database -- a virtual observatory-oriented,relational database for hosting various cosmological simulations. the data isaccessible via an sql (structured query language) query interface, which alsoallows users to directly pose scientific questions, as shown in a number ofexamples in this paper. further examples for the usage of the database aregiven in its extensive online documentation (www.multidark.org). the databaseis based on the same technology as the millennium database, a fact that willgreatly facilitate the usage of both suites of cosmological simulations. thefirst release of the multidark database hosts two 8.6 billion particlecosmological n-body simulations: the bolshoi (250/h mpc simulation box, 1/h kpcresolution) and multidark run1 simulation (mdr1, or bigbolshoi, 1000/h mpcsimulation box, 7/h kpc resolution). the extraction methods for halos/subhalosfrom the raw simulation data, and how this data is structured in the databaseare explained in this paper. with the first data release, users get full accessto halo/subhalo catalogs, various profiles of the halos at redshifts z=0-15,and raw dark matter data for one time-step of the bolshoi and four time-stepsof the multidark simulation. later releases will also include galaxy mockcatalogs and additional merging trees for both simulations as well as new largevolume simulations with high resolution. this project is further proof of theviability to store and present complex data using relational databasetechnology. we encourage other simulators to publish their results in a similarmanner.

1202.6057	the clustering of galaxies at z~0.5 in the sdss-iii data release 9  boss-cmass sample: a test for the lcdm cosmology	we present results on the clustering of 282,068 galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) sample of massive galaxies withredshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii project.our results cover a large range of scales from ~0.5 to ~90 mpc/h. we comparethese estimates with the expectations of the flat lcdm cosmological model withparameters compatible with wmap7 data. we use the multidark cosmologicalsimulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, toestimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloesand galaxy biases. we find that the lcdm model gives a reasonable descriptionto the observed correlation functions at z~0.5, which is a remarkably goodagreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance ofboss galaxies, does not have any free parameters. however, we find a deviation(&gt;~10%) in the correlation functions for scales less than ~1 mpc/h and ~10-40mpc/h. a more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics fromupcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. we also estimatethat about 12% of the "galaxies" in the abundance-matched sample are satellitesinhabiting central haloes with mass m&gt;~1e14 m_sun/h. using the multidarksimulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched cataloguefinding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtainedusing the measured boss projected correlation function. furthermore, the linearlarge-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matchedsample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/mpc)^3). extrapolating these resultsto bao scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signalproduced by non-linear evolution that leads to ~2-4% dips at ~3 sigma level forwavenumbers k&gt;~0.1 h/mpc in the linear large-scale bias.

1210.4559	the velocity shear tensor: tracer of halo alignment	the alignment of dm halos and the surrounding large scale structure (lss) isexamined in the context of the cosmic web. halo spin, shape and the orbitalangular momentum of subhaloes is investigated relative to the lss using theeigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1mpc/h, deep within the non-linear regime. knots, filaments, sheets and voidsare associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principaldirections simultaneously. each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e.knot halo, filament halo, etc) according to the nature of the collapse at thehalo's position. the full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to besubstantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that theobserved velocity shear is significantly biased. we find that larger masshaloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansionor collapse is more spherical. a correlation is found between the halo's shapeand the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis ofthe halo's shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsingeigenvector. this correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocityshear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. a similar result is foundfor the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. it has been shown that highmass haloes exhibit a spin flip with respect to the lss: we find the mass atwhich this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggestedpreviously. although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit analignment with the lss, providing a possible insight into the highly correlatedco-rotation of the milky way's satellite system. the present study suggeststhat the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studyingthe directional properties of the non-linear lss and of halos and galaxies.

1212.6651	effects of baryon removal on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies	dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs) are extremely gas-poor, darkmatter-dominated galaxies, which make them ideal to test the predictions of thecold dark matter (cdm) model. we argue that the removal of the baryoniccomponent from gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies, the progenitors of dsphs, cansubstantially reduce their central density. thus, it may play an important rolein alleviating one of the problems of the cdm model related to the structure ofrelatively massive satellite galaxies of the milky way (mw). traditionally,collisionless cosmological n-body simulations are used when confrontingtheoretical predictions with observations. however, these simulations assumethat the baryon fraction everywhere in the universe is equal to the cosmicmean, which can be incorrect for dsphs. we find that the combination of (i) thelower baryon fraction in dsphs compared to the cosmic mean and (ii) theconcentration of baryons in the inner part of the mw halo can go a long waytowards explaining the observed circular velocity profiles of dsphs. we findthat the blowing away of baryons by ram pressure, when the dwarfs fall intolarger galaxies, decreases the circular velocity profile of the satellite andreduces the density in the central ~200-500 pc by a factor of (1 - f_b)^4 ~0.5, where f_b is the cosmological fraction of baryons. additionally, theenhanced baryonic mass in the central regions of the parent galaxy generatestidal forces, which are larger than those experienced by subhaloes intraditional n-body simulations. increased tidal forces substantially altercircular velocity profiles for satellites with pericentres less than 50 kpc. weshow that these two effects are strong enough to bring the predictions ofsubhaloes from cdm simulations into agreement with the observed structure of mwdsphs, regardless of the details of the baryonic processes.

0712.3285	the role of stellar feedback in the formation of galaxies	we develop a new realistic prescription for modeling the stellar feedback,which minimizes any ad hoc assumptions about sub-grid physics. we start withdeveloping high resolution models of the ism and formulate the conditionsrequired for its realistic functionality: formation of multi-phase medium withhot chimneys, super-bubbles, cold molecular phase, and very slow consumption ofgas. another important ingredient is the runaway stars. they greatly facilitatethe feedback. once these effects are implemented into cosmological simulations,we do not have the overcooling problem and the angular momentum problem(resulting in a too massive bulge) is also reduced substantially: the rotationcurves are nearly flat. just as it is often observed in qso absorption lines,our models produce substantial outflows from forming and active galaxies. athigh redshifts we routinely find gas with few hundred km/s and occasionally1000-2000 km/s. the density profile of dark matter is still consistent with acuspy profile. the simulations reproduce this picture only if the resolution isvery high: better than 50 pc, which is much better than the typical resolutionin previous cosmological simulations. our simulations of galaxy formation reachthe resolution of 35 pc.

1303.2056	orbital anisotropy in cosmological haloes revisited	the velocity anisotropy of particles inside dark matter (dm) haloes is animportant physical quantity, which is required for the accurate modelling ofmass profiles of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. it is typically measuredusing the ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions at a givendistance from the halo centre. however, this measure is insufficient todescribe the dynamics of realistic haloes, which are typically quite elongated.studying the velocity distribution in massive dm haloes in cosmologicalsimulations, we find that in the inner parts of the haloes the local velocityellipsoids are strongly aligned with the major axis of the halo, the alignmentbeing stronger for more relaxed haloes. in the outer regions of the haloes, thealignment becomes gradually weaker and the orientation is more random. thesetwo distinct regions of different degree of the alignment coincide with twocharacteristic regimes of the dm density profile: shallower and steeper than\rho r^{-2}. this alignment of the local velocity ellipsoids requiresreinterpretation of features found in measurements based on the sphericallyaveraged ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions. in particular,we show that the velocity distribution in the central halo regions is highlyanisotropic. for cluster-size haloes with mass 10^{14}-10^{15} h^-1 msun, thevelocity anisotropy along the major axis is nearly independent of radius and isequal to \beta=1-\sigma^2_{perp}/\sigma^2_{radial}=0.4, which is significantlylarger than the previously estimated spherically averaged velocity anisotropy.the alignment of density and velocity anisotropies, and the radial trends mayalso have some implications for the mass modelling based on kinematical data ofsuch objects as galaxy clusters or dwarf spheroidals, where the orbitalanisotropy is a key element in an unbiased mass inference.

1304.0585	structure finding in cosmological simulations: the state of affairs	the ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations ofcosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for theiranalysis. during the past decade, the art of object finding in thesesimulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. amultitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques havebeen spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will providethe same (physical) information about the structures of interest. here wesummarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": weinvestigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders.to this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods,clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties.we observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objectsleading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and vmax function,but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by allfinders differ. the strength of the variation, however, depends on the propertystudied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak valueof the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derivedquantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. our study indicatesthat the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codesstems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent --the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles isimplemented. we close with a discussion of the relevance and implications ofthe scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.

1307.0943	radiative feedback and the low efficiency of galaxy formation in  low-mass haloes at high redshift	any successful model of galaxy formation needs to explain the low rate ofstar formation in the small progenitors of today's galaxies. this inefficiencyis necessary for reproducing the low stellar-to-virial mass fractions,suggested by current abundance matching models. a possible driver of this lowefficiency is the radiation pressure exerted by ionizing photons from massivestars. the effect of radiation pressure in cosmological, zoom-in galaxyformation simulations is modeled as a non-thermal pressure that acts only indense and optically thick star-forming regions. we also include photoionizationand photoheating by massive stars. the full photoionization of hydrogen reducesthe radiative cooling in the $10^{4-4.5}$ k regime. the main effect ofradiation pressure is to regulate and limit the high values of gas density andthe amount of gas available for star formation. this maintains a low starformation rate of $\sim 1 \ {\rm m_\odot} \ {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in halos with massesabout $10^{11} \ {m_\odot}$ at $z\simeq3$. infrared trapping andphotoionization/photoheating processes are secondary effects in this massrange. the galaxies residing in these low-mass halos contain only $\sim0.6\%$of the total virial mass in stars, roughly consistent with abundance matching.radiative feedback maintains an extended galaxy with a rising circular velocityprofile.

1308.3515	constraints on wimp annihilation for contracted dark matter in the inner  galaxy with the fermi-lat	we derive constraints on parameters of generic dark matter candidates bycomparing theoretical predictions with the gamma-ray emission observed by thefermi-lat from the region around the galactic center. our analysis isconservative since it simply requires that the expected dark matter signal doesnot exceed the observed emission. the constraints obtained in the likely casethat the collapse of baryons to the galactic center is accompanied by thecontraction of the dark matter are strong. in particular, we find that for bband \tau+\tau- or w+w- dark matter annihilation channels, the upper limits onthe annihilation cross section imply that the thermal cross section is excludedfor a weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) mass smaller than about 700and 500 gev, respectively. for the \mu+ \mu- channel, where the effect of theinverse compton scattering is important, depending on models of the galacticmagnetic field the exclusion of the thermal cross-section is for a wimp masssmaller than about 150 to 400 gev. the upper limits on the annihilation crosssection of dark matter particles obtained are two orders of magnitude strongerthan without contraction. in the latter case our results are compatible withthe upper limits from the galactic halo analysis reported by the fermi-latcollaboration for the case in which the same conservative approach withoutmodeling of the astrophysical background is employed.

1310.2239	mergers and mass accretion for infalling halos both end well outside  cluster virial radii	we find that infalling dark matter halos (i.e., the progenitors of satellitehalos) begin losing mass well outside the virial radius of their eventual hosthalos. the peak mass occurs at a range of clustercentric distances, with medianand 68th percentile range of 1.8 +2.3/-1.0 r_(vir,host) for progenitors of z=0satellites. the peak circular velocity for infalling halos occurs atsignificantly larger distances (3.7 +3.3/-2.2 r_(vir,host) at z=0). thisdifference arises because different physical processes set peak circularvelocity (typically, ~1:5 and larger mergers which cause transient circularvelocity spikes) and peak mass (typically, smooth accretion) for infallinghalos. we find that infalling halos also stop having significant mergers wellbefore they enter the virial radius of their eventual hosts. mergers largerthan a 1:40 ratio in halo mass end for infalling halos at similarclustercentric distances (~ 1.9 r_(vir,host)) as the end of overall massaccretion. however, mergers larger than 1:3 typically end for infalling halosat more than 4 virial radial away from their eventual hosts. this limits theability of mergers to affect quenching and morphology changes in clusters. wealso note that the transient spikes which set peak circular velocity may leadto issues with abundance matching on that parameter, including unphysicalgalaxy stellar mass growth profiles near clusters; we propose a simpleobservational test to check if a better halo proxy for galaxy stellar massexists.

1310.3740	halo abundance matching: accuracy and conditions for numerical  convergence	accurate predictions of the abundance and clustering of dark matter haloesplay a key role in testing the standard cosmological model. here, weinvestigate the accuracy of one of the leading methods of connecting thesimulated dark matter haloes with observed galaxies -- the halo abundancematching (ham) technique. we show how to choose the optimal values of the massand force resolution in large-volume n-body simulations so that they provideaccurate estimates for correlation functions and circular velocities for haloesand their subhaloes -- crucial ingredients of the ham method. at the 10%accuracy, results converge for 50 particles for haloes and 150 particles forprogenitors subhaloes. in order to achieve this level of accuracy a number ofconditions should be satisfied. the force resolution for the smallest resolved(sub)haloes should be in the range (0.1-0.3)rs, where rs is the scale radius of(sub)haloes. the number of particles for progenitors of subhaloes should be150. we also demonstrate that the two-body scattering plays a minor role forthe accuracy of n-body simulations thanks to the relatively small number ofcrossing-times of dark matter in haloes, and the limited force resolution ofcosmological simulations.

1311.2910	low-mass galaxy assembly in simulations: regulation of early star  formation by radiation from massive stars	despite recent success in forming realistic present-day galaxies, simulationsstill form the bulk of their stars earlier than observations indicate. weinvestigate the process of stellar mass assembly in low-mass field galaxies, adwarf and a typical spiral, focusing on the effects of radiation from youngstellar clusters on the star formation (sf) histories. we implement a novelmodel of sf with a deterministic low efficiency per free-fall time, as observedin molecular clouds. stellar feedback is based on observations of star-formingregions, and includes radiation pressure from massive stars, photoheating in hii regions, supernovae and stellar winds. we find that stellar radiation has astrong effect on the formation of low-mass galaxies, especially at z &gt; 1, whereit efficiently suppresses sf by dispersing cold and dense gas, preventingrunaway growth of the stellar component. this behaviour is evident in a varietyof observations but had so far eluded analytical and numerical models withoutradiation feedback. compared to supernovae alone, radiation feedback reducesthe sf rate by a factor of ~100 at z &lt; 2, yielding rising sf histories whichreproduce recent observations of local group dwarfs. stellar radiation alsoproduces bulgeless spiral galaxies and may be responsible for excess thickeningof the stellar disc. the galaxies also feature rotation curves and baryonfractions in excellent agreement with current data. lastly, the dwarf galaxyshows a very slow reduction of the central dark matter density caused byradiation feedback over the last ~7 gyr of cosmic evolution.

0802.0429	the distribution function of dark matter in massive haloes	we study the distribution function (df) of dark matter particles in haloes ofmass range 10^{14}--10^{15}\msun. in the numerical part of this work we measurethe df for a sample of relaxed haloes formed in the simulation of a standard\lambdacdm model. the df is expressed as a function of energy e and theabsolute value of the angular momentum l, a form suitable for comparison withtheoretical models. by proper scaling we obtain the results that do not dependon the virial mass of the haloes. we demonstrate that the df can be separatedinto energy and angular momentum components and propose a phenomenologicalmodel of the df in the formf_{e}(e)[1+l^{2}/(2l_{0}^{2})]^{-\beta_{\infty}+\beta_{0}}l^{-2\beta_{0}}. thisformulation involves three parameters describing the anisotropy profile interms of its asymptotic values (\beta_{0} and \beta_{\infty}) and the scale oftransition between them (l_{0}). the energy part f_{e}(e) is obtained viainversion of the integral for spatial density. we provide a straightforwardnumerical scheme for this procedure as well as a simple analyticalapproximation for a typical halo formed in the simulation. the df model isextensively compared with the simulations: using the model parameters obtainedfrom fitting the anisotropy profile, we recover the df from the simulation aswell as the profiles of the dispersion and kurtosis of radial and tangentialvelocities. finally, we show that our df model reproduces the power-lawbehaviour of phase space density q=\rho(r)/\sigma^{3}(r).

0803.2706	toward a halo mass function for precision cosmology: the limits of  universality	we measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set ofcollisionless cosmological simulations of flat lcdm cosmology and investigateits evolution at z&lt;~2. halos are identified as isolated density peaks, andtheir masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specificoverdensities. we argue that these spherical overdensity masses are moredirectly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using thefriends-of-friends algorithm (fof), and are therefore preferable for accurateforecasts of halo abundances. our simulation set allows us to calibrate themass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10^{11} msol/h &lt; m &lt;10^{15} msol/h, to &lt;~ 5%. we derive fitting functions for the halo massfunction in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 andearlier epochs. in addition to these formulae, which improve on previousapproximations by 10-20%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot berepresented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. theamplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by ~20-50%,depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. we also find evidence forredshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.

1409.0914	direct insights into observational absorption line analysis methods of  the circumgalactic medium using cosmological simulations	we study the circumgalactic medium (cgm) of a z=0.54 simulated dwarf galaxyusing hydroart simulations. we present our analysis methods, which emulateobservations, including objective absorption line detection, apparent opticaldepth (aod) measurements, voigt profile (vp) decomposition, and ionizationmodeling. by comparing the inferred cgm gas properties from the absorptionlines directly to the gas selected by low ionization hi and mgii, and by higherionization civ and ovi absorption, we examine how well observational analysismethods recover the "true" properties of cgm gas. in this dwarf galaxy, lowionization gas arises in sub-kiloparsec "cloud" structures, but high ionizationgas arises in multiple extended structures spread over 100 kpc; due to complexvelocity fields, highly separated structures give rise to absorption at similarvelocities. we show that aod and vp analysis fails to accurately characterizethe spatial, kinematic, and thermal conditions of high ionization gas. we findthat hi absorption selected gas and ovi absorption gas arise in totallydistinct physical gas structures, calling into question current observationaltechniques employed to infer metallicities and the total mass of "warm-hot" cgmgas. we present a method to determine whether civ and ovi absorbing gas isphoto or collisionally ionized and whether the assumption of ionizationequilibrium is sound. as we discuss, these and additional findings have strongimplications for how accurately currently employed observational absorptionline methods recover the true gas properties, and ultimately, our ability tounderstand the cgm and its role in galaxy evolution.

0803.4343	the art of cosmological simulations	we describe the basic ideas of mpi parallelization of the n-body adaptiverefinement tree (art) code. the code uses self-adaptive domain decompositionwhere boundaries of the domains (parallelepipeds) constantly move -- with manydegrees of freedom -- in the search of the minimum of cpu time. the actual cputime spent by each mpi task on previous time-step is used to adjust boundariesfor the next time-step. for a typical decomposition of 5^3 domains, the numberof possible changes in boundaries is 3^{84}. we describe two algorithms offinding minimum of cpu time for configurations with a large number of domains.each mpi task in our code solves the n-body problem where the large-scaledistribution of matter outside of the boundaries of a domain is represented byrelatively few temporary large particles created by other domains. at thebeginning of a zero-level time-step, domains create and exchange largeparticles. then each domain advances all its particles for many smalltime-steps. at the end of the large step, the domains decide where to place newboundaries and re-distribute particles. the scheme requires littlecommunications between processors and is very efficient for large cosmologicalsimulations.

1505.07861	redshift-space clustering of sdss galaxies --- luminosity dependence,  halo occupation distribution, and velocity bias	we present the measurements and modelling of the small-to-intermediate scale(0.1--25 mpc/h) projected and three-dimensional (3d) redshift-space two-pointcorrelation functions (2pcfs) of local galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release 7. we find a clear dependence of galaxy clustering onluminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger formore luminous samples. the measurements are successfully interpreted within thehalo occupation distribution (hod) framework with central and satellitevelocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and tomodel redshift-space distortion (rsd) effects. in agreement with previousstudies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes.including the redshift-space 2pcfs helps tighten the hod constraints. moreover,we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres,with the velocity dispersion about 30% that of the dark matter. such a relativemotion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find thatcentral galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect totheir host haloes. the motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples isconsistent with their following that of the dark matter. for faint samples,satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloesabout 85% that of the dark matter. we discuss possible applications of thevelocity bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. in theappendix, we characterize the distribution of galaxy redshift measurementerrors, which is well described by a gaussian-convolved double exponentialdistribution.

astro-ph;0005503	numerical simulations in cosmology ii: spatial and velocity biases	we give a summary of recent results on spatial and velocity biases incosmological models. progress in numerical techniques made it possible tosimulate halos in large volumes with a such accuracy that halos survive indense environments of groups and clusters of galaxies. halos in simulationslook like real galaxies, and, thus, can be used to study the biases --differences between galaxies and the dark matter. the biases depend on scale,redshift, and circular velocities of selected halos. two processes seem todefine the evolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias and (2) mergerbias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces thenumber of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter).there are two kinds of velocity bias. the pair-wise velocity bias isb_12=0.6-0.8 at r&lt; 5mpc/h, z=0. this bias mostly reflects the spatial bias andprovides almost no information on the relative velocities of the galaxies andthe dark matter. one-point velocity bias is a better measure of the velocities.inside clusters the galaxies should move slightly faster (b_v =1.1-1.3) thanthe dark matter. qualitatively this result can be understood using the jeansequations of the stellar dynamics. for the standard lcdm model we find that thecorrelation function and the power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 areantibiased on scales r&lt;5mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/mpc.

astro-ph;0005504	numerical simulations in cosmology iii: dark matter halos	properties of dark matter halos are reviewed. taken from differentpublications, we present results on (1) the mass and velocity functions, (2)density and velocity profiles, and (3) concentration of halos. in the range ofradii r=(0.005-1)rvir the density profile for a quiet isolated halo is veryaccurately approximated by a fit suggested by moore etal (1997):rho=1/x^1.5(1+x^1.5), where x=r/rs and rs is a characteristic radius. the fitsuggested by navarro et al (1995) rho= 1/x(1+x)^2, also gives a verysatisfactory approximation with relative errors of about 10% for radii notsmaller than 1% of the virial radius. the mass function of z=0 halos with massbelow 10^{13}msun/h is approximated by a power law with slope alpha =-1.85. theslope increases with the redshift. the velocity function of halos with vmax&lt;500km/s is also a power law with the slope beta= -3.8-4. the power-law extendsto halos at least down to 10km/s. it is also valid for halos inside largervirialized halos. the concentration of halos depends on mass (more massivehalos are less concentrated) and environment, with isolated halos being lessconcentrated than halos of the same mass inside clusters. halos have intrinsicscatter of concentration: at 1sigma level halos with the same mass havedelta(log{c_vir})=0.18 or, equivalently, deltavmax/vmax =0.12. velocityanisotropy for both subhalos and the dark matter is approximated by beta(r)=0.15+2x/[x^2+4], where x is radius in units of the virial radius.

astro-ph;0006343	resolving the structure of cold dark matter halos ii	we study the effects of mass and force resolution on the density profiles ofgalaxy-size cold dark matter (cdm) halos in a flat, low-density cosmologicalmodel with vacuum energy. we show thatalthough increasing the mass and forceresolution allows us to probe deeper into the inner halo regions, it does notlead to steeper inner density profiles. instead, the halo profiles converge atscales larger than four times the formal resolution or the radius containingmore than 200 particles, whichever is larger. in the simulations presented inthis paper, we are able to probe density profile of a relaxed isolatedgalaxy-size halo at scales r=(0.005-1)r_vir. we find that the densitydistribution can be well approximated by the profile suggested by moore etal(1998): rho= x^{-1.5}(1+x^{1.5})^-1, where x=r/r_s and r_s is thecharacteristic radius. the analytical profile proposed by navarro et al. (1996)rho= x^{-1}(1+x)^-2, also provides a good fit, with the same relative errors ofabout 10% for radii larger than 1% of the virial radius. both analyticalprofiles fit equally well because for high-concentration galaxy-size halos thedifferences between these profiles become significant only at scales well below0.01r_vir. we also find that halos of similar mass may have somewhat differentparameters (characteristic radius, maximum rotation velocity, etc.) and shapesof their density profiles. we associate this scatter in properties withdifferences in halo merger histories and the amount of substructure present inthe analyzed halos.

astro-ph;0107104	constrained simulations of the real universe: the local supercluster	we present cosmological simulations which closely mimic the real universewithin 100mpc of the local group. the simulations, called constrainedsimulations, reproduce the large-scale density field with major nearbystructures, including the local group, the coma and virgo clusters, the greatattractor, the perseus-pices, and the local supercluster, in approximatelycorrect locations. the mark iii survey of peculiar velocities of the observedstructures inside 80mpc/h sphere is used to constrain the initial conditions.fourier modes on scales larger then 5mpc/h are dominated by the constraints,while small scale waves are random. the main aim of this paper is the structureof the local supercluster (lsc; 30mpc/h around the virgo cluster) and the localgroup environment. we find that at the current epoch most of the mass(7.5e14msun/h) of the lsc is located in a filament roughly centered on thevirgo cluster and extending over 40mpc/h. the simulated local group (lg) islocated in an adjacent smaller filament, which is not a part of the main bodyof the lsc, and has a peculiar velocity of 250kms toward the virgo cluster. thepeculiar velocity field in the lsc region is complicated and is drasticallydifferent from the field assumed in the virgocentric infall models. thepeculiar velocity flow in the vicinity of the lg in the simulation is ``cold'':the peculiar line-of-sight velocity dispersion within 7mpc/h of the lg is lessthan 60km/s, comparable to the observed velocity dispersion of nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;0110390	lcdm-based models for the milky way and m31 i: dynamical models	we apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction withincuspy halo models predicted by the standard lcdm cosmology. the resultingmodels score remarkably well when confronted with the broad range ofobservational data available for the milky way and m31 galaxies, giving a milkyway virial mass of 1-2x10^12msun and concentration c=12-17. we consider twotypes of models, in which: (a) baryons conserve angular momentum and (b) someof the angular momentum of the baryons is transferred to the dark matter.type-a models produce good agreement with observed rotation curves and obeyconstraints in the solar neighborhood, but may have too much dark matter in thecenter to allow a fast rotating bar. the type-b models with angular momentumtransport have a slightly more massive disk and less dark matter in the centralpart, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. both classes of models probablyhave sufficient baryonic mass in the central 3.5kpc to reproduce recentobservational values of the optical depth to microlensing events towards thegalactic center. all models require that about 1/2 of all baryons expectedinside the virial radius must not be in the disk or bulge. we investigatewhether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models iscompatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function, and find arange of parameter space that is allowed by this constraint. we conclude thatrotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' high surface brightnessspiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard lcdm.

astro-ph;0203148	spatial distribution of galactic halos and their merger histories	we use a novel statistical tool, the mark correlation functions (mcfs), tostudy clustering of galaxy-size halos as a function of their properties andenvironment in a high-resolution numerical simulation of the lambdacdmcosmology. we applied mcfs using several types of continuous and discretemarks: maximum circular velocity of halos, merger mark indicating whether halosexperienced or not a major merger in their evolution history, and a strippingmark indicating whether the halo underwent a tidal stripping. we find thathalos which experienced a relatively early (z&gt;1) major merger or mass loss (dueto tidal stripping) in their evolution histories are over-abundant in halopairs with separations &lt; 3 mpc/h. this result can be interpreted as spatialsegregation of halos with different merger histories, qualitatively similar tothe morphological segregation in the observed galaxy distribution. the analysispresented in this paper demonstrate that mcfs provide powerful, yetalgorithmically simple, quantitative measures of segregation in the spatialdistribution of objects with respect to their various properties (marks).

astro-ph;0204028	secular bar formation in galaxies with significant amount of dark matter	using high resolution n-body simulations of stellar disks embedded incosmologically motivated dark matter halos, we study the evolution of bars andthe transfer of angular momentum between halos and bars. we find that dynamicalfriction results in some transfer of angular momentum to the halo, but theeffect is much smaller than previously found in low resolution simulations andis incompatible with early analytical estimates. in simulations with millionsof particles reaching a resolution of 20-40 pc, the pattern speed may notchange over billions of years. our high resolution models produce bars whichare fast rotators, where the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar majorsemi-axis lies in the range r =1.2-1.7, marginally compatible withobservational results. in contrast to many previous simulations, we find thatbars are relatively short. as in many observed cases, the bar major semi-axisis close to the exponential length of the disk. the transfer of angularmomentum between inner and outer parts of the disk plays a very important rolein the secular evolution of the disk and the bar. the bar formation increasesthe exponential length of the disk by a factor of 1.2 -1.5. the transfersubstantially increases the stellar mass in the centre of the galaxy anddecreases the dark matter-to-baryons ratio. as the result, the central 2 kpcregion is always strongly dominated by the baryonic component. at intermediate3-10kpc scales the disk is sub-dominant. in summary, realistic models producebar structure in striking agreement with observational results.

astro-ph;0301360	observing the dark matter density profile of isolated galaxies	using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we probe the halo massdistribution by studying the velocities of satellites orbiting isolatedgalaxies. in a subsample that covers 2500 sq. degrees on the sky, we detectabout 3000 satellites with absolute blue magnitudes going down to m_b = -14;most of the satellites have m_b=-16 to -18, comparable to the magnitudes of m32and the magellanic clouds. after a careful, model-independent removal ofinterlopers, we find that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of satellitesdeclines with distance to the primary. for an l* galaxy the r.m.s.line-of-sight velocity changes from ~120 km/s at 20 kpc to ~60 km/s at 350 kpc.this decline agrees remarkably well with theoretical expectations, as allmodern cosmological models predict that the density of dark matter in theperipheral parts of galaxies declines as rho_dm propto r^{-3}. thus, for thefirst time we find direct observational evidence of the density declinepredicted by cosmological models; we also note that this result contradictsalternative theories of gravity such as mond. we also find that the velocitydispersion of satellites within 100 kpc scales with the absolute magnitude ofthe central galaxy as sigma propto l^{0.3}; this is very close to thetully-fisher relation for normal spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0305393	the structure of voids	using high resolution n-body simulations we address the problem of emptinessof giant 20 mpc/h diameter voids found in the distribution of bright galaxies.are the voids filled by dwarf galaxies? do cosmological models predict too manysmall dark matter haloes inside the voids? can the problems of cosmologicalmodels on small scales be addressed by studying the abundance of dwarf galaxiesinside voids? we find that voids in the distribution of 10^12 msun/h haloes(expected galactic magnitudes ~ m_*) are almost the same as the voids in 10^11msun/h haloes. yet, much smaller haloes with masses 10^9 msun/h and circularvelocities v_circ about 20 km/s readily fill the voids: there should be almost1000 of these haloes in a 20 mpc/h void. a typical void of diameter 20 mpc/hcontains about 50 haloes with v_circ &gt; 50 km/s. the haloes are arranged in apattern, which looks like a miniature universe: it has the same structuralelements as the large-scale structure of the galactic distribution of theuniverse. there are filaments and voids; larger haloes are at the intersectionsof filaments. the only difference is that all masses are four orders ofmagnitude smaller. there is severe (anti)bias in the distribution of haloes,which depends on halo mass and on the distance from the centre of the void.large haloes are more antibiased and have a tendency to form close to voidboundaries. the mass function of haloes in voids is different from the``normal'' mass function. it is much steeper for high masses resulting in veryfew m33-type galaxies (v_circ about 100 km/s). we present an analyticalapproximation for the mass function of haloes in voids.

astro-ph;0311020	the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies: a problem for cold dark matter?	we address the issue of accuracy in recovering density profiles fromobservations of rotation curves of galaxies. we ``observe'' and analyze ourmodels in much the same way as observers do the real galaxies. we find that thetilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotationalvelocity. in some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flatcore, while in reality it does not. we identify three effects, which explainthe systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) bar. thepresence of even a small non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotationvelocity. in the case of a disk with a bar, the underestimate of the circularvelocity is larger due to a combination of non-circular motions and randomvelocities. signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surfacebrightness profiles of the model galaxies. the variation of inclination angleand isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of barpresence than the surface brightness profiles. the systematic biases in thecentral ~ 1 kpc of galaxies are not large. each effect separately givestypically a few kms error, but the effects add up. in some cases the error incircular velocity was a factor of two, but typically we get about 20 percent.the result is the false inference that the density profile of the halo flattensin the central parts. our observations of real galaxies show that for a largefraction of galaxies the velocity of gas rotation (as measured by emissionlines) is very close to the rotation of stellar component (as measured byabsorption lines). this implies that the systematic effects discussed in thispaper are also applicable both for the stars and emission-line gas.

astro-ph;0503710	the role of resonances in barred galaxies	the dynamics of the inner disk of many galaxies is dominated by bars. as aresult, resonances between the bar and the disk become an important factor. inorder to detect resonances, we measure angular and radial frequencies ofindividual orbits in n-body models of barred galaxies. in our simulations withseveral million particles, stellar disks are immersed in live halos of darkmatter. a bar forms spontaneously and interacts with the disk throughresonances. we detect 9 of them. the corotation (cr) and the inner lindbladresonance (ilr) are the most significant. the spatial distributions ofparticles trapped at these resonances show that ilr is not localized at a givenradius. particles trapped at ilr lie along the bar spanning a wide range ofradii. on the other hand, particles at the corotation resonance form a ringaround the corotation radius. we study how orbits evolve near corotation andhow they are trapped. when an orbit is getting trapped, it evolves strongly,but after that there is little evolution. those trapped orbits circulate alongthe corotation ring or librate around a stable lagragian point. the sametechnique is applied to study resonances in the halo. the bar interactsstrongly with the halo particles that stay close to the disk. we find thecorotation resonance and the inner lindblad resonance for halo particles.

astro-ph;0506668	statistics of voids in the 2df galaxy redshift survey	we present a statistical analysis of voids in the 2df galaxy redshift survey(2dfgrs). in order to detect the voids, we have developed two robustalgorithms. we define voids as non-overlapping maximal spheres empty of halosor galaxies with mass or luminosity above a given one. we search for voids incosmological $n$-body simulations to test the performance of our void finders.we obtain and analyze the void statistics for several volume-limited samplesfor the north galactic strip (ngp) and the south galactic strip (sgp)constructed from the 2dfgrs full data release. we find that the resultsobtained from the ngp and the sgp are statistically compatible. from theresults of several statistical tests we conclude that voids are essentiallyuncorrelated, with at most a mild anticorrelation and that there is adependence of the void number density on redshift at least at the 99.5%confidence level. we develop a technique to correct the distortion caused bythe fact that we use the redshift as the radial coordinate. we calibrate thistechnique with mock catalogues and find that the correction might be of somerelevance to carry out accurate inferences from void statistics. we study thestatistics of the galaxies inside nine nearby voids. we find that galaxies invoids are not randomly distributed: they form structures like filaments. wealso obtain the galaxy number density profile in voids. this profile follow asimilar but steeper trend to that follow by halos in voids.

astro-ph;0509644	is there evidence for flat cores in the halos of dwarf galaxies?: the  case of ngc 3109 and ngc 6822	two well studied dwarf galaxies -- ngc 3109 and ngc 6822 -- present some ofthe strongest observational support for a flat core at the center of galacticdark matter (dm) halos. we use detailed cosmologically motivated numericalmodels to investigate the systematics and the accuracy of recovering parametersof the galaxies. some of our models match the observed structure of the twogalaxies remarkably well. our analysis shows that the rotation curves of thesetwo galaxies are instead quite compatible with their dm halos having steepcuspy density profiles. the rotation curves in our models are measured usingstandard observational techniques. the models reproduce the rotation curves ofboth galaxies, the disk surface brightness profiles as well as the profile ofisophotal ellipticity and position angle. the models are centrally dominated bybaryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. the simulateddisk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio inagreement with the observed colors. we show that non-circular motions combinedwith gas pressure support and projection effects results in a largeunderestimation of the circular velocity in the central $\sim 1$ kpc region,creating the illusion of a constant density core. although the systematiceffects mentioned above are stronger in barred systems, they are also presentin axisymetric disks. our results strongly suggest that there is nocontradiction between the observed rotation curves in dwarf galaxies and thecuspy central dark matter density profiles predicted by cold dark mattermodels.

astro-ph;0605703	the properties of galaxies in voids	we present a comparison of the properties of galaxies in the most underdenseregions of the universe, where the galaxy number density is less than 10% ofthe mean density, with galaxies from more typical regions. we have compiled asample of galaxies in 46 large nearby voids that were identified using thesloan digital sky survey dr4, which provides the largest coverage of the sky.we study the u-r color distribution, morphology, specific star formation rate,and radial number density profiles for a total of 495 galaxies fainter thanm_r=-20.4 +5logh located inside the voids and compare these properties with acontrol sample of field galaxies. we show that there is an excess of bluegalaxies inside the voids. however, inspecting the properties of blue and redgalaxies separately, we find that galaxy properties such as color distribution,bulge-to-total ratios, and concentrations are remarkably similar between thevoid and overall sample. the void galaxies also show the same specific starformation rate at fixed color as the control galaxies. we compare our resultswith the predictions of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation using themillennium run semi-analytic galaxy catalog. we show that the properties of thesimulated galaxies in large voids are in reasonably good agreement with thosefound in similar environments in the real universe. to summarize, in spite ofthe fact that galaxies in voids live in the least dense large-scaleenvironment, this environment makes very little impact on properties ofgalaxies.

astro-ph;0607204	evolution in the halo masses of isolated galaxies between z~1 and z~0:  from deep2 to sdss	we measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio (m_{200}/l_b) andvirial-to-stellar mass ratio (m_{200}/m_\ast) for isolated ~ l* galaxiesbetween z~1 and z~0 by combining data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey andthe sloan digital sky survey. utilizing the motions of satellite galaxiesaround isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions andderive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. at both epochsthe velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,\sigma\propto m_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocitydispersion and host galaxy b-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from\sigma\propto l_b^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto l_b^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.the evolution in m_200/m_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar ashost galaxies with stellar mass below m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h maintain aconstant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)while host galaxies above m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. this result can be easilyunderstood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form starswhile star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the darkmatter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordancewith lcdm cosmological simulations. host galaxies that are red in u-b colorhave larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massivehalos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. the redshift and host galaxystellar mass dependence of m_200/m_\ast agrees qualitatively with themillennium run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0703544	resonances in barred galaxies	the inner parts of many spiral galaxies are dominated by bars. these arestrong non-axisymmetric features which significantly affect orbits of stars anddark matter particles. one of the main effects is the dynamical resonancesbetween galactic material and the bar. we detect and characterize theseresonances in n-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radialfrequencies of individual orbits. we found narrow peaks in the distribution oforbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. wefound five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.the corotation resonance and the inner and outer lindblad resonances are themost populated. the spatial distributions of particles near resonances arewide. for example, the inner lindblad resonance is not localized at a givenradius. particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar andspan a wide range of radii. on the other hand, particles near the corotationresonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable lagrangepoints. the distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.resonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. our analysisof orbits in both n-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicatesthat resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trappedmaterial. only if the bar evolves as a whole, resonances drift through thephase space. in this case particles anchored near resonant orbits track theresonance shift and evolve. the criteria to ensure a correct resonant behaviordiscussed in weinberg &amp; katz (2007a) can be achieved with few millionsparticles because the regions of trapped orbits near resonances are large andevolving.

astro-ph;9405003	damped lyman alpha systems vs. cold + hot dark matter	although the cold + hot dark matter (chdm) cosmology provides perhaps thebest fit of any model to all the available data at the current epoch, chdmproduces structure at relatively low redshifts and thus could be ruled out ifthere were evidence for formation of massive objects at high redshifts. dampedly$\alpha$ systems are abundant in quasar absorption spectra and thus providepossibly the most significant evidence for early structure formation, and thusperhaps the most stringent constraint on chdm. using the numbers of halos inn-body simulations to normalize press-schechter estimates of the numberdensities of protogalaxies as a function of redshift, we find that chdm with$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is compatible with the dampedly$\alpha$ data at $\le 2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with thelimited $z&gt;3$ damped ly$\alpha$ data. the situation is uncertain because thereis very little data for $z&gt;3$, and also it is unclear whether all dampedly$\alpha$ systems are associated with collapsed protogalaxies. the predictionsof chdm are quite sensitive to the hot (neutrino) fraction, and we find that$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.675/0.25/0.075$ is compatible even with the$z&gt;3$ data. this corresponds to lowering the neutrino mass from 6.8 to 5.7 ev,for $h_0=50\kmsmpc$. in chdm, the higher redshift damped ly$\alpha$ systems arepredicted to have lower masses, which can be checked by measuring the velocitywidths of the associated metal line systems.

astro-ph;9409091	the evolution of x-ray clusters in a cold plus hot dark matter universe	we present the first self-consistently computed results on the evolution ofx-ray properties of galaxy clusters in a cold + hot dark matter (chdm) model.we have performed a hydrodynamic plus n-body simulation for the cobe-compatiblechdm model with standard mass components: omega(hot) = 0.3, omega(cold) = 0.6and omega(baryon) = 0.1 (h = 0.5). in contrast with the cdm model, which failsto reproduce the observed temperature distribution function dn/dt (bryan et al.1994b), the chdm model fits the observational dn/dt quite well. our results onx-ray luminosity are less firm but even more intriguing. we find that theresulting x-ray luminosity functions at redshifts z = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7 arewell fit by observations, where they overlap. the fact that both temperaturesand luminosities provide a reasonable fit to the available observational dataindicates that, unless we are missing some essential physics, there is neitherroom nor need for a large fraction of gas in rich clusters: 10% (or less) inbaryons is sufficient to explain their x-ray properties. we also see a tightcorrelation between x-ray luminosity and gas temperature.

astro-ph;9410022	damped lyman alpha systems vs. cold + hot dark matter	damped ly$\alpha$ systems provide possibly the most significant evidence forearly structure formation, and thus a stringent constraint on the cold + hotdark matter (chdm) cosmology. using the numbers of halos in n-body simulationsto normalize press-schechter (ps) estimates of the number densities ofprotogalaxies as a function of redshift, we find that chdm with$\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is compatible with the dampedly$\alpha$ data only at $z&lt;2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with dataat $z&gt;3$. the predictions of chdm are quite sensitive to the neutrino fraction.we find that $\omega_c/\omega_\nu/\omega_b = 0.725/0.20/0.075$ is compatiblewith the $z&gt;3$ data. with one massive neutrino species, this corresponds tolowering the neutrino mass from 7.0 to 4.7 ev, for $h_0=50\kmsmpc$ and$t=2.726$ k. by analysing our numerical simulations with different resolutionsand box sizes as well as those of ma \&amp; bertchinger (1994), we show that forthe chdm models with $\omega_\nu$=0.2--0.3 the ps approximation should be usedwith gaussian filter with $\delta_c=1.3-1.4$ if one tries to recover the totalmass of a collapsed halo and to include nonlinear effects, due to waves bothlonger and shorter than those within the simulation box.

astro-ph;9507074	evolution of clusters in cold plus hot dark matter models	we use n-body simulations to study evolution of galaxy clusters over theredshift interval 0 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.5 in cosmological models with a mixture of coldand hot dark matter (chdm). four different techniques are utilized: thecluster-cluster correlation function, axial ratios and quadrupoles of the darkmatter distribution in individual clusters, and virial properties. we find thatthe correlation function for clusters of the same mass limit was larger andsteeper at high redshifts. the slope increases from 1.8 at z=0 to 2.1 at z=0.5.comoving correlation length r_c scales with the mass limit m within comovingradius 1.5 h^-1 mpc and the redshift z as r_c ~= 20(1+z)(m/m_*)^1/3, where m_*= 3*10^14 h^-1 m_sun. when the correlation length is normalized to the meancluster separation d_c, it remains almost constant: r_c~=(0.45-0.5) d_c. forsmall masses (m_clust &lt;2*10^14 h^-1 m_sun) there is an indication that r_c goesslightly above the relation with the constant of proportionality being ~=0.55-0.6. anisotropy of density distribution in a cluster shows no change overredshift with axial ratios remaining constant around 1.2. in other words,clusters at present are as elongated as they were at the epoch of their firstappearance. while the anisotropy of clusters does not change with time, thedensity profile shows visible evolution: the slope of density profile changesfrom gamma ~= -3.5 at z=0.5 to gamma ~= -2.5 at the present. we find that thecore of a cluster remains essentially the same over time, but the density ofthe outlying regions increases noticeably. the virial relation m ~ v^2 is agood approximation, but there is a large fraction of clusters with peculiarvelocities greater than given by this relation, and clusters with the same rmsvelocities have smaller masses in the past, a factor of 2 at z=0.5.

astro-ph;9509145	mixed dark matter model in halos of clusters	we discuss the structure of clusters in a class of flat cosmological modelswith the fraction of mass \omega_{cdm} ~0.8 in cold dark matter, and the restin hot dark matter in the form of massive neutrinos. we consider such cold+hotdark matter (chdm) models with one, two or three massive neutrinos, with totalmass ~4.6ev. neutrinos of such low mass cannot constitute halos of galaxies andgroups, but only of clusters of galaxies. the limit on the density of neutrinosin the central parts of galaxy clusters is estimated from the phase space den-sity constraints. the ratio of the neutrino density to that of cdm through thecluster is found analytically. it appears that the density of neutrinos issuppressed within the abell radius. however, neutrinos contribute ~20% of themass density to the cluster halo.  our numerical simulations match analytical results. the simulations indicatethat the cluster halo dark matter density profile has the power-law slope ~-2.5which is close to that in the model with cosmological constant. we also foundthat in the chdm models the velocity dispersion is almost constant across thecluster. this is quite different from the model with cosmological constant orthe open model where the velocity dispersion falls in the cluster outskirts.  we discuss x-ray emission and weak gravitational lensing by clusters in themodel. we input the found spherically symmetrical fit to the chdm mass densityprofile and the x-ray surface brightness for the cluster a2256 into simpleequation of hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. x-ray temperature derivedthis way departures from both the data and actual prediction of the model,which give almost constant temperature. we found also that the problem of highbaryonic fraction in clusters is not resolved in the chdm models.

astro-ph;9510042	small-scale power spectrum and correlations in lcdm	cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant and $\omega_0&lt;1$have a number of attractive features. a larger hubble constant, which can becompatible with the recent hst estimate, and a large fraction of baryon densityin galaxy clusters make them current favorites. early galaxy formation also isconsidered as a welcome feature of these models but early galaxy formationimplies that fluctuations on few megaparsec scales spent more time in thenonlinearregime, as compared with standard cold dark matter (cdm) or cold+hotdark matter models. this results in excessive clustering on small scales. weshow that a typical lcdm model with $h_0=70$ km/s/mpc, $\omega_0=0.3$normalized to cobe on large scales and compatible with the number-density ofgalaxy clusters, predicts a power spectrum of galaxy clustering in real spacewhich is too high: {\it at least} twice larger than cfa estimates (park \etal1994) and 3 times larger than apm estimates (baugh \&amp; efstathiou 1994) forwavenumbers $k=(0.4-1)h/{\rm mpc}$. this conclusion holds if we assume eitherthat galaxies trace the dark matter ($\sigma_8\approx 1.1$ for this model) orjust that a region with higher density produces more galaxies than a regionwith lower density. the only way to reconcile the model with the observed powerspectrum is to assume that regions with high dark matter density produce fewergalaxies than regions with low density. theoretically this is possible, but itseems very unlikely: x-ray emission from groups and clusters indicates thatplaces with a large density of dark matter produce a large number of galaxies.since it follows that the low- $\omega$ lcdm models are in serious trouble, wediscuss which lcdm models have the best hope of surviving the confrontationwith available observational data.

astro-ph;9607061	dark matter and cosmology: cdm with a cosmological constant  ($\lambda$cdm) vs. cdm with hot dark matter (chdm)	here we discuss what are perhaps the two most popular variants of cdm thatmight agree with the data: \lcdm\ and chdm. while the predictions ofcobe-normalized \lcdm\ and chdm both agree well with the available data onscales of $\sim 10$ to $100 \hmpc$, each has potential virtues and defects.\lcdm\ with $\omega_0 \sim 0.3$ has the possible virtue of allowing a higherexpansion rate $h_0$ for a given cosmic age $t_0$, but the defect of predictingtoo much fluctuation power on small scales. chdm has less power on smallscales, so its predictions appear to be in good agreement with data on thegalaxy distribution, but it remains to be seen whether it predicts early enoughgalaxy formation to be compatible with the latest high-redshift data. also, twovery recent observational results favor high cosmic density, and thus favor$\omega=1$ models such as chdm over \lcdm\ --- (1) the positive decelerationparameter $q_0&gt;0$ measured using high-redshift type ia supernovae, and (2) thelow primordial deuterium/hydrogen ratio measured in two different quasarabsorption spectra. we try to identify ``best'' variants of both \lcdm\ andchdm, and discuss critical observational tests for both models.

astro-ph;9609179	filament and shape statistics: a quantitative comparison of cold + hot  and cold dark matter cosmologies vs. cfa1 data	a new class of geometric statistics for analyzing galaxy catalogs ispresented. filament statistics quantify filamentarity and planarity in largescale structure in a manner consistent with catalog visualizations. thesestatistics are based on sequences of spatial links which follow localhigh-density structures. from these link sequences we compute the discretecurvature, planarity, and torsion. filament statistics are applied to cdm andchdm ($\omega_\nu = 0.3$) simulations of klypin \etal (1996), the cfa1-likemock redshift catalogs of nolthenius, klypin and primack (1994, 1996), and thecfa1 catalog. we also apply the moment-based shape statistics developed bybabul \&amp; starkman (1992), luo \&amp; vishniac (1995), and robinson \&amp; albrecht(1996) to these same catalogs, and compare their robustness and discriminatorypower versus filament statistics. for 100 mpc periodic simulation boxes ($h_0 =50$ km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$), we find discrimination of $\sim 4\sigma$ (where$\sigma$ represents resampling errors) between chdm and cdm for selectedfilament statistics and shape statistics, including variations in the galaxyidentification scheme. comparing the cfa1 data versus the models does not yielda conclusively favored model; no model is excluded at more than a $\sim2\sigma$ level for any statistic, not including cosmic variance which couldfurther degrade the discriminatory power. we find that cfa1 discriminatesbetween models poorly mainly due to its sparseness and small number ofgalaxies, not due to redshift distortion, magnitude limiting, or geometricaleffects. we anticipate that the proliferation of large redshift surveys andsimulations will enable the statistics presented here to provide robustdiscrimination between large-scale structure in various cosmological models.

astro-ph;9702099	linearizing the observed power spectrum	reconstruction of the linear power spectrum from observational data providesa way to compare cosmological models to a large amount of data, as peacock &amp;dodds (1994, 1996) have shown. by applying the appropriate corrections to theobservational power spectrum it is possible to recover the underlying linearpower spectrum for any cosmological model. using extensive n-body simulationswe demonstrate that the method is applicable to a wide range of cosmologicalmodels. however, we find that the recovery of the linear power spectrum fromobservations following pd94 is misleading because the corrections are model-dependent. when we apply the proper corrections for a given model to theobservational power spectrum, we find that no model in our test group recoversthe linear power spectrum well for the bias suggested by pd94 between abell,radio, optical, and iras catalogs 4.5:1.9:1.3:1, with b_iras=1. when we allowb_iras to vary we find that: (i)chdm models give very good fits to observationsif optically-selected galaxies are slightly biased b_opt=1.1 (ii) most lcdmmodels give worse but acceptable fits if blue galaxies are considerablyantibiased: 0.6&lt;b_opt&lt;0.9 and fail if optical galaxies are biased.

astro-ph;9708191	galaxies in n-body simulations: overcoming the overmerging problem	we present analysis of the evolution of dark matter halos in denseenvironments of groups and clusters in dissipationless cosmologicalsimulations. the premature destruction of halos in such environments, known asthe overmerging, reduces the predictive power of n-body simulations and makesdifficult any comparison between models and observations. we analyze thepossible processes that cause the overmerging and assess the extent to whichthis problem can be cured with current computer resources and codes. using bothanalytic estimates and high resolution numerical simulations, we argue that theovermerging is mainly due to the lack of numerical resolution. we find that theforce and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in galaxygroups and clusters is extremely high and was almost never reached before: ~1-3kpc and 10^8-10^9 msun, respectively. we use the high-resolution adaptiverefinement tree (art) n-body code to run cosmological simulations with theparticle mass of \approx 2x10^8/h msun} and the spatial resolution of \approx1-2/h kpc, and show that in these simulations the halos do survive in regionsthat would appear overmerged with lower force resolution. nevertheless, thehalo identification in very dense environments remains a challenge even withthe resolution this high. we present two new halo finding algorithms developedto identify both isolated and satellite halos that are stable (existed atprevious moments) and gravitationally bound. to illustrate the use of thesatellite halos that survive the overmerging, we present a series of halostatistics, that can be compared with those of observed galaxies.

astro-ph;9712142	cdm-variant cosmological models - i: simulations and preliminary  comparisons	we present two matched sets of five simulations each, covering five presentlyfavored simple modifications to the standard cold dark matter (cdm) scenario.one simulation suite, with a linear box size of 75 mpc/h, is designed for highresolution and good statistics on the group/poor cluster scale, and the other,with a box size of 300 mpc/h, is designed for good rich cluster statistics. allruns had 57 million cold particles, and models with massive neutrinos had anadditional 113 million hot particles. we consider separately models withmassive neutrinos, tilt, curvature, and a nonzero cosmological constant inaddition to the standard cdm model. we find that our tiltedomega+omega_lambda=1 (tlcdm) model produces too much small-scale power by afactor of ~3, and our open lambda=0 (ocdm) model also exceeds observedsmall-scale power by a factor of 2. in addition, we take advantage of the largedynamic range in detectable halo masses our simulations allow to check theshape of the press-schechter approximation. we find good fits at cluster massesfor delta_c=1.27--1.35 for a gaussian filter and delta_c=1.57--1.73 for atophat filter. however, press-schechter overpredicts the number density ofhalos compared to the simulations in the high resolution suite by a weaklycosmology-dependent factor of 1.5--2 at galaxy and group masses, which cannotbe fixed by adjusting delta_c within reasonable bounds. an appendix generalizesthe spherical collapse model to any isotropic cosmology.

astro-ph;9810191	evolution of isolated halos and halos inside of groups and clusters in a  lcdm model	a significant fraction of mass in the universe is believed to be in the formof dark matter (dm). due to gravitational instability, the dm collapseshierarchically into dm halos. in this contribution we present a study of theformation and evolution of such dm halos in a cobe-normalized spatially flatlcdm model (omega_0=1-omega_l=0.3; h=0.7) using high-resolution n-bodysimulations. the novelty of this study is use of the newly developedhalo-finding algorithms to study the evolution of both isolated and satellite(located inside virial radii of larger group- and cluster-size systems) halos.the force and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in thehigh-density environments typical of groups and clusters is high: ~1-3 kpc and\~10^9 m_sun, respectively. we use the high-resolution adaptive refinement tree(art) n-body code to follow the evolution of 256^3 dark matter particles withdynamic range in spatial resolution of 32,000 in a box of 60/h mpc.  we show that the correlation function of these halos is anti-biased withrespect to the dark matter correlation function and is high and steeper thanthe correlation function of the isolated virialized objects. the correlationfunction evolves only mildly between z=3 and z=1. the mass evolution ofisolated virialized objects determined from the simulation is in good agreementwith prediction of semi-analytical models. the differences exist, however, ifwe include satellite halos in the halo catalogs.

astro-ph;9812311	origin and evolution of halo bias in linear and non-linear regimes	we present results from a study of bias and its evolution for galaxy-sizehalos in a large, high-resolution simulation of a lcdm model. we consider theevolution of bias estimated using two-point correlation function (b_xi), powerspectrum (b_p), and a direct correlation of smoothed halo and matteroverdensity fields (b_d). we present accurate estimates of the evolution of thematter power spectrum probed deep into the stable clustering regime(k~[0.1-200]h/mpc at z=0). the halo power spectrum evolves much slower than thepower spectrum of matter and has a different shape which indicates that thebias is time- and scale-dependent. at z=0, the halo power spectrum isanti-biased with respect to the matter power spectrum at wavenumbersk~[0.15-30]h/mpc, and provides an excellent match to the power spectrum of theapm galaxies at all probed k. in particular, it nicely matches the inflectionobserved in the apm power spectrum at k~0.15h/mpc. we complement the powerspectrum analysis with a direct estimate of bias using smoothed halo and matteroverdensity fields and show that the evolution observed in the simulation inlinear and mildly non-linear regimes can be well described by the analyticalmodel of mo &amp; white (1996), if the distinction between formation redshift ofhalos and observation epoch is introduced into the model. we present argumentsand evidence that at higher overdensities, the evolution of bias issignificantly affected by dynamical friction and tidal stripping operating onthe satellite halos in high-density regions of clusters and groups; weattribute the strong anti-bias observed in the halo correlation function andpower spectrum to these effects.

astro-ph;9907337	velocity bias in a lcdm model	we use n-body simulations to study the velocity bias of dark matter halos,the difference in the velocity fields of dark matter and halos, in a flat low-density lcdm model. the high force, 2kpc/h, and mass, 10^9msun/h, resolutionallows dark matter halos to survive in very dense environments of groups andclusters making it possible to use halos as galaxy tracers. we find that thevelocity bias pvb measured as a ratio of pairwise velocities of the halos tothat of the dark matter evolves with time and depends on scale. at highredshifts (z ~5) halos move generally faster than the dark matter almost on allscales: pvb(r)~1.2, r&gt;0.5mpc/h. at later moments the bias decreases and getsbelow unity on scales less than r=5mpc/h: pvb(r)~(0.6-0.8) at z=0. we find thatthe evolution of the pairwise velocity bias follows and probably is defined bythe spatial antibias of the dark matter halos at small scales. one-pointvelocity bias b_v, defined as the ratio of the rms velocities of halos and darkmatter, provides a more direct measure of the difference in velocities becauseit is less sensitive to the spatial bias. we analyze b_v in clusters ofgalaxies and find that halos are ``hotter'' than the dark matter: b_v=(1.2-1.3)for r=(0.2-0.8)r_vir, where r_vir is the virial radius. at larger radii, b_vdecreases and approaches unity at r=(1-2)r_vir. we argue that dynamicalfriction may be responsible for this small positive velocity bias b_v&gt;1 foundin the central parts of clusters. we do not find significant difference in thevelocity anisotropy of halos and the dark matter. the dark matter the velocityanisotropy can be approximated as beta(x)=0.15 +2x/(x^2+4), where x is measuredin units of the virial radius.

astro-ph;9910372	spatial and velocity biases	we give a summary of our recent studies of spatial and velocity biases ofgalaxy-size halos in cosmological models. recent progress in numericaltechniques made it possible to simulate halos in large volumes with a suchaccuracy that halos survive in dense environments of groups and clusters ofgalaxies. dark matter halos in simulations look like real galaxies, and, thus,can be used to study the biases - differences between galaxies and the darkmatter. for the standard lcdm model we find that the correlation function andthe power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are antibiased on scalesr&lt;5mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/mpc. the biases depend on scale, redshift, andcircular velocities of selected halos. two processes seem to define theevolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias (or peak bias) and mergerbias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces thenumber of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter).there are two kinds of velocity bias. the pair-wise velocity bias isb_12=0.6-0.8 at r&lt;5mpc/h, z=0. this bias mostly reflects the spatial bias andprovides almost no information on the relative velocities of the galaxies andthe dark matter. one-point velocity bias is a better measure of the velocities.inside clusters the galaxies should move slightly faster (b_v=1.1-1.3) than thedark matter. qualitatively this result can be understood using the jeansequations of the stellar dynamics.

astro-ph;9912257	on effects of resolution in dissipationless cosmological simulations	we present a study of numerical effects in dissipationless cosmologicalsimulations. the numerical effects are evaluated and studied by comparingresults of a series of 64^3-particle simulations of varying force resolutionand number of time steps, performed using three different n-body techniques:the particle mesh (pm), the adaptive p3m (ap3m) code, and the adaptiverefinement tree (art) code. this study can therefore be interesting both as ananalysis of numerical effects and as a systematic comparison of differentcodes. we find that the ap3m and the art codes produce similar results, giventhat convergence is reached within the code type. we also find that numericaleffects may affect the high-resolution simulations in ways that have not beendiscussed before. in particular, our study revealed the presence of two-bodyscattering, effects of which can be greatly amplified by inaccuracies of timeintegration. this process appears to affect the correlation function of matter,mass function and inner density of dark matter halos and other statistics atscales much larger than the force resolution, although different statistics maybe affected in different fashion. we discuss the conditions at which strongtwo-body scattering is possible and discuss the choice of the force resolutionand integration time step. furthermore, we discuss recent claims thatsimulations with force softening smaller than the mean interparticle separationare not trustworthy and argue that this claim is incorrect in general andapplies only to the phase-sensitive statistics. our conclusion is that,depending on the choice of mass and force resolution and integration time step,a force resolution as small as 0.01 of the mean interparticle separation can bejustified.
