0031699764	Dynamic quadrature booster as an aid to system stability	Quadrature boosters (QB) have been widely used to control the power flow distribution between parallel transmission lines. The advent of very fast thyristor/vacuum switch tap changers makes the dynamic quadrature booster a powerful FACTS device for the improvement of the transient and dynamic stability of power systems. The basic concepts of the dynamic QB operation, the modelling aspects of a multimachine power system in which dynamic QB are situated, the ideal control strategy and practical considerations are presented. Simulations show that in a small, simple, power system the QB can substantially suppress disturbances before swings in load angle have become large. In a large interconnected system the action is less successful.

37349088970	Algorithm for frequency measurement based on DFT	An algorithm for frequency measurement based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is analyzed, in which the difference between frequency deviations of two adjacent cycles of the signal is not considered. So the frequency measurement error is rather big when the signal frequency variation is rapid. To solve this problem, an improved algorithm is proposed, in which the influence of difference between frequency deviations of two adjacent cycles of the signal on frequency deviation measurement is considered using the original method. The improved algorithm takes the rate of frequency variation of the signal as a parameter and two methods to identify the parameter are given. One consists in using the rate of frequency variation obtained in the preceding calculation, and the other in using the relatively fixed rate of frequency variation. The results of numerical simulation show that the improved algorithm can give fairly good frequency and accuracy in measuring the rate of frequency variation.

84876752490	Development of a Chinese standard on WAMS main station for further enhancement of real-time dynamics monitoring capability	In spite of wide-scale deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) based wide-area measurement systems (WAMSs) in China, a survey report made by the State Grid Dispatching and Communication Center pointed out that WAMS is still in a process of development and exploration. Its application functions are still not yet systematic and mature. Its level of operational management and practical utilization is relatively low. Its system maintenance and on-duty monitoring are far from well-established compared with that of SCADA. Its processing speed upon data abnormality and degree of attention to data quality cannot yet meet the requirements of real-time operation. Its utilization of functions and data is mainly on post-mortem analysis. There is still a gap between its accuracy of low-frequency oscillation early warning together with the sufficiency of the relevant information and professional requirements of power system operation. There is still a need for improving its reliability and efficiency of data flow in the whole process of acquisition, communication, processing and archiving. In order to further enhance the real-time dynamics monitoring capability through regulatory compliance, a Chinese standard on WAMS main station "Specification for Main Stations of Real-time Dynamics Monitoring Systems for Power Systems" is under development. The standard specifies that the main station is of distributed structure. Different application functions can be distributed accordingly to different computer nodes with key applications having a redundant hardware configuration. All computers in the system should be interconnected directly through a redundantly configured network. Application functions should include monitoring and analysis of low-frequency oscillations, power system dynamics identification, system model and parameter verification, assessment of generator primary frequency regulation etc. The standard specifies performance indexes of WAMS main station regarding main station load ratio, delay and accuracy of data acquisition, MMI response time, and accuracy of on-line low-frequency oscillation detection. To improve WAMS's level of achievement in practical applications, other efforts are also underway.

84887546290	Calculation of transient stability margin distribution under random power injection conditions	Based on extend equal area criterion (EEAC), the numerical probabilistic characteristics of the driving power of generators in a power system are first transformed into those of two coherent generator groups corresponding to the instability mode, and then the numerical probabilistic characteristics of the system stability margin are calculated via semi-invariant by using the linearized expression of stability margin, i.e., a Taylor series with two generator groups' driving power as variables and sensitivity parameters of the stability margin as coefficients. Therefore, the probability distribution of the transient stability margin can be calculated using the Gram-Charlier series. For the ideal two-coherent-group instability mode, fast calculation can be achieved just by an analytical method. For the nonideal two-coherent-group instability mode, sensitivity coefficients of the stability margin are calculated by time-domain simulation and a piecewise function based method is used to describe the stability margin distribution in case of sudden changes of the stability margin or sensitivity coefficients due to changes of the instability mode. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by two numerical examples. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

56349103316	A criterion for out-of-step islanding control based on wide-area disturbed trajectory measurements	Conventional out-of-step islanding device generally takes relative power angles achieving 360° as the indication of out-of-step condition although the risk of such judgment relied solely on a fixed threshold of angle difference in complex power systems has been pointed out. A new method for islanding control of complex power systems is proposed. The system is separated at the oscillation center upon identification of a dynamic saddle point (DSP) on the time-varying OMIB equivalent trajectory transformed from real-time measurements of wide-area power angle trajectories by using the complementary-cluster center-of-inertial (CCCOI) transformation. The proposed method strictly conforms to the instability detection mechanism of extended equal-area criterion (EEAC) quantitative analysis theory, and the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by simulation results. In some cases, the new method is able to detect the out-of-step condition earlier than the conventional out-of-step islanding criterion.

The reason lies in the uncoordinated islanding scheme of out-of-step devices. The traditional coordinating scheme is difficult to compromise between selectivity and celerity simultaneously. Furthermore, the coordinating methods between different out-of-step devices by communication also need more system information comes from a far place, which highly depends on the reliability and rapidness of communication. A two-level setting scheme for out-of-step device is proposed. With this new setting scheme, out-of-step device can be provided with credibility, selectivity and celerity simultaneously, and it can be used to deal with the problem of configuring out-of-step device in a complex power grid with multi-interface borders.

According to the preventive control calculation results, transient stability and security constraints are converted into inequality constraints of control variables which are incorporated into OPF model. OTS is therefore solved by this decoupling and iteration process of the two sub-problems.

As traditional under frequency load shedding (UFLS) and under voltage load shedding (UVLS) devices operate independently using local frequency or voltage measurements, it is difficult to achieve real-time coordination and optimization of system-wide control. A new multi-agent system (MAS) based UFLS/UVLS method is presented to coordinate load shedding devices with local and remote information so as to guarantee control performance with less load shedding cost. Its key concept is based on the space distribution characteristics of voltage and frequency dynamics of different load buses while allowing for automatic adjustment of the load shedding control strategy according to the current system operating condition and the degree of disturbance. Time domain simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus power system and a real power system of China demonstrate the effectiveness of the new UFLS/UVLS scheme. © 2011 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

Taking Chongqing power grid containing UHV transmission as example, we studied its security, stability, and countermeasures. The results reveal that the grid's security and stability issues are classified into some major problems, including the line overload, the transient voltage drop and the transient instability caused by power flow transfer while breaking 1000 kV/500 kV electromagnetic loops, the over-voltage caused by sudden power drops on UHV AC corridor, and the power grid islanding caused by cascading out-of step. Furthermore, based on completing the 3 defense systems, a voltage flexible control method integrating DC power modulation for long-chain transmission corridor and active defense measures preventing the cascading loss of synchronization are presented and validated by simulations.

84874958518	Application of emergency control to reduce risk of system collapse triggered by power transmission interface tripping: Thinking on the India power blackouts	This paper presents a simplified description of the event evolution of the India power blackouts on the 30th and 31st of July in 2012. With the analysis of the technical causes leading to the difference in scale of system collapse between the 2 blackouts, it is pointed out that the key cause of both events is the indirect transfer capability exceeded by cross-grid rerouting of large power flow due to lack of active control measures. While the centralized generator tripping and load shedding automatically triggered by the sudden loss event of transmission interface are the most effective emergency control measures for the prevention of similar blackouts, the economic rationality of which can be assessed from the viewpoint of risk reduction. From the perspective of emergency control technology, it is concluded that several fundamental measures need to be strengthened to ensure the effectiveness of the control, including research on fault identification criterion, analysis of mutual influence between control logic and system response, verification of adaptability of control effect to system operating conditions, and tightening up the operational management of emergency control measures. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

84888595785	Unstable modes evolution and its influencing factors analysis in interconnected power grids	With the expansion of power grids, some unusual dynamic behaviors are emerging. In this paper, based on the extended equal area criterion (EEAC), the first swing and the second swing of angle instability phenomena in the interconnected power grid are demonstrated. The evolution phenomena of unstable modes due to the variation of system models, parameters and control strategies are analyzed. The mechanisms of negative control effects of generator tripping in the non-coherent critical generator's cluster are revealed. It is also pointed out that the rapid decrease of the DC power and load delivered during the accelerating process of local area generators close to the short circuit point deteriorates the interconnected power system transient stability. The results are verified by large-scale power systems simulation. ©2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

84888616461	DC power support for damping low frequency oscillations based on WAMS	As the high voltage direct current (HVDC) system can be quickly controlled, DC power support can be used to damp low frequency oscillation by changing the power flow of the AC tie-line. The purpose of this study is to expatiate on the key technology of DC power support to damp low frequency oscillations, including DC line selection, support time and quantity of power support. It is assumed that the DC control sensitive factor is equal to the sum of products of the dominant generator and DC line power shift distribution factors. Based on the results of sensitive factor, the corresponding DC line is selected to support power. The accuracy and efficiency of this method is validated by the results of China Southern power grid. The opportune moment to support power is when the generator power angle starts to forward swing. The inhibitory effect on low frequency oscillation is not appreciable with a small quantity of power support, while a large quantity of power support will cause antiphase oscillation. There is no significant difference in the inhibitory effect on low frequency oscillation between the constant power and constant current control modes. The above results are obtained from theoretical analysis and time dominant simulation. ©2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

84891131332	Risk management of stability control system considering electrical security accidents responsibility	Higher requirements are made for the management of stability control system by Ordinances of Electrical Security Accident Emergency Disposal and Investigation, which makes it clear that load shedding by stability control system is equivalent to the loss of load under faults. The advanced risk management concept is introduced into the stability control system configuration and daily management. The risk assessment index of stability control system is put forward including economic loss, legal liability of electrical security accident and penalty loss. The legal liability of electrical safety accident is converted to an affordable economic loss cost. On this basis, the decision-making method of stability control system configuration and risk management are proposed. The stability control system risk tolerance is characterized by the criterion that the risk cost must be less than the risk transfer price. The optimization algorithm of stability control system risk management is proposed based on the principle that the sum of risk cost and risk transfer cost should be minimum. That the risk management method can greatly reduce the operation risk of power system is verified by an actual power system. © right.

84894778467	The mechanism of oscillation center migration due to impedance inequality	The regulation and mechanism of oscillation center migration are studied by integrating vector graph and numerical calculation method, based on a two-machine equivalent system model considering impedance inequality. The midpoint of total impedance absolute is defined as the system center. Research results show that impedance inequality will cause migration of oscillation center during an oscillation cycle in the power system angle from 0° to 360° swing cycle. Oscillation center just migrates only inside contact lines when the system center is located at the contact lines. When the system center is located at equivalent system impedance at either end of contact lines, there are two kinds of migration, one is only inside contact lines, the other is the oscillation center may migrate in lines, but more likely migrationes between the lines and the equivalent system impedance that the system center is located. The position of out-of-step center is not affected by the impedance inequality, but out-of-step center occurs not only when the system angle is 180°.

84899789491	Risk-based economical transmission power calculation of transmission sections	In order to effectively coordinate the security and economy of the operation of power systems, and rationally assess the optimum operation power of transmission sections, the concept of economical transmission power of transmission sections based on quantitative analysis of security and stability risk assessment of power systems is proposed. The economical transmission power is defined as the section transmission power when the difference of transmission economic benefits and power system instability risk gets the maximum value, and the emergency control cost under unstable contingency is seen as the instability risk of the power system. A practical method of economical transmission power calculation is proposed, and suggestions for power system dispatchers application are given. Simulation results of an actual large-grid test system show that better economic performance can be attained on the basis of the controllable power system risk provided the transmission sections operate at the economical transmission power.

84908378893	Out-of-step oscillation center change rules and its location under multi-frequency oscillation	Out-of-step oscillation center and its location under multi-frequency oscillation are studied based on a three machine equivalent system. In the same unstable mode, units with different angles cause the oscillation center to migrate to differently modulated sides. The more distinct the different modulations, the greater the offset. Under multi-frequency oscillation, the out-of-step oscillation center still satisfies the condition that voltage is zero. There is only one section whose minimum voltage is equal to zero because of unit oscillation at the same moment, which is the out-of-step oscillation center. When the center appears, the equivalent two machine system power angle on both sides of the line where the center is located swings 180° apart. The maximum range of oscillation center migration is determined by the system impedance parameters. With the impedance parameters determined, the oscillation center migration direction is determined by the three machine system power angle variation tendency. The traditional criteria based on local information can hardly adapt to the multi frequency oscillation scenario. The criterion that the phase difference on both sides of the line swings 180° apart is able to accurately determine the moment the out-of-step oscillation center appears and its location under multi frequency oscillation.
