0906.5025	evidence for dust evolution within the taurus complex from spitzer  images	we present spitzer images of the taurus complex (tc) and take advantage ofthe sensitivity and spatial resolution of the observations to characterize thediffuse ir emission across the cloud. this work highlights evidence of dustevolution within the translucent sections of the archetype reference forstudies of quiescent molecular clouds. we combine spitzer 160 um and iras 100um observations to produce a dust temperature map and a far-ir dust opacity mapat 5' resolution. the average dust temperature is about 14.5k with a dispersionof +/-1k across the cloud. the far-ir dust opacity is a factor 2 larger thanthe average value for the diffuse ism. this opacity increase and theattenuation of the radiation field (rf) both contribute to account for thelower emission temperature of the large grains. the structure of the tcsignificantly changes in the mid-ir images that trace emission from pahs andvsgs. we focus our analysis of the mid-ir emission to a range of eclipticlatitudes where the zodiacal light residuals are small. within this cloud area,there are no 8 and 24 um counterparts to the brightest 160 um emissionfeatures. conversely, the 8 and 24 um images reveal filamentary structure thatis strikingly inconspicuous in the 160 um and extinction maps. the ir colorsvary over sub-parsec distances across this filamentary structure. we comparethe observed colors with model calculations quantifying the impact of the rfintensity and the abundance of stochastically heated particles on the dust sed.to match the range of observed colors, we have to invoke variations by a factorof a few of both the interstellar rf and the abundance of pahs and vsgs. weconclude that within this filamentary structure a significant fraction of thedust mass cycles in and out the small size end of the dust size distribution.

0907.2216	re-analysis of the radio luminosity function of galactic hii regions	we have re-analyzed continuum and recombination lines radio data available inthe literature in order to derive the luminosity function (lf) of galactic hiiregions. the study is performed by considering the first and fourth galacticquadrants independently. we estimate the completeness level of the sample inthe fourth quadrant at 5 jy, and the one in the first quadrant at 2 jy. we showthat the two samples (fourth or first quadrant) include, as well as giant andsuper-giant hii regions, a significant number of sub-giant sources. the lf isobtained, in each galactic quadrant, with a generalized schmidt's estimatorusing an effective volume derived from the observed spatial distribution of theconsidered hii regions. the re-analysis also takes advantage of recentlypublished ancillary absorption data allowing to solve the distance ambiguityfor several objects. a single power-law fit to the lfs retrieves a slope equalto -2.23+/-0.07 (fourth quadrant) and to -1.85+/-0.11 (first quadrant). we alsofind marginal evidence of a luminosity break at l_knee = 10^23.45 erg s^(-1)hz^(-1) for the lf in the fourth quadrant. we convert radio luminosities intoequivalent h_alpha and lyman continuum luminosities to facilitate comparisonswith extra-galactic studies. we obtain an average total hii regions lymancontinuum luminosity of 0.89 +/- 0.23 * 10^(53) sec^(-1), corresponding to 30%of the total ionizing luminosity of the galaxy.

0707.2103	absolute calibration and characterization of the multiband imaging  photometer for spitzer. iii. an asteroid-based calibration of mips at 160  microns	we describe the absolute calibration of the multiband imaging photometer forspitzer (mips) 160 micron channel. after the on-orbit discovery of a near-irghost image that dominates the signal for sources hotter than about 2000 k, weadopted a strategy utilizing asteroids to transfer the absolute calibrations ofthe mips 24 and 70 micron channels to the 160 micron channel. near-simultaneousobservations at all three wavelengths are taken, and photometry at the twoshorter wavelengths is fit using the standard thermal model. the 160 micronflux density is predicted from those fits and compared with the observed 160micron signal to derive the conversion from instrumental units to surfacebrightness. the calibration factor we derive is 41.7 mjy/sr/mips160 (mips160being the instrumental units). the scatter in the individual measurements ofthe calibration factor, as well as an assesment of the external uncertaintiesinherent in the calibration, lead us to adopt an uncertainty of 5.0mjy/sr/mips160 (12%) for the absolute uncertainty on the 160 micron fluxdensity of a particular source as determined from a single measurement. forsources brighter than about 2 jy, non-linearity in the response of the 160micron detectors produces an under-estimate of the flux density: for objects asbright as 4 jy, measured flux densities are likely to be ~20% too low. thiscalibration has been checked against that of iso (using ulirgs) and iras (usingiras-derived diameters), and is consistent with those at the 5% level.

1005.3076	direct estimate of cirrus noise in herschel hi-gal images	in herschel images of the galactic plane and many star forming regions, amajor factor limiting our ability to extract faint compact sources is cirrusconfusion noise, operationally defined as the "statistical error to be expectedin photometric measurements due to confusion in a background of fluctuatingsurface brightness". the histogram of the flux densities of extracted sourcesshows a distinctive faint-end cutoff below which the catalog suffers fromincompleteness and the flux densities become unreliable. this empirical cutoffshould be closely related to the estimated cirrus noise and we show that thisis the case. we compute the cirrus noise directly, both on herschel images fromwhich the bright sources have been removed and on simulated images of cirruswith statistically similar fluctuations. we connect these direct estimates withthose from power spectrum analysis, which has been used extensively to predictthe cirrus noise and provides insight into how it depends on variousstatistical properties and photometric operational parameters. we reportmulti-wavelength power spectra of diffuse galactic dust emission from hi-galobservations at 70 to 500 microns within galactic plane fields at l= 30 degreesand l= 59 degrees. we find that the exponent of the power spectrum is about -3.at 250 microns, the amplitude of the power spectrum increases roughly as thesquare of the median brightness of the map and so the expected cirrus noisescales linearly with the median brightness. generally, the confusion noise willbe a worse problem at longer wavelengths, because of the combination of lowerangular resolution and the rising power spectrum of cirrus toward lower spatialfrequencies, but the photometric signal to noise will also depend on therelative spectral energy distribution of the source compared to the cirrus.

1011.5419	sio outflows in high-mass star forming regions: a potential chemical  clock?	some theoretical models propose that o-b stars form via accretion, in asimilar fashion to low-mass stars. jet-driven molecular outflows play animportant role in this scenario, and their study can help to understand theprocess of high-mass star formation and the different evolutionary phasesinvolved. observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour anevolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with class 0 objectswhile more evolved class i/ii objects show less evidence of powerful jets. thepresent study aims at checking whether an analogous picture can be found in thehigh-mass case. the iram 30-m telescope (spain) has been used to performsingle-pointing sio(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57high-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. continuum data atdifferent wavelengths, from mid-ir to 1.2 mm, have been gathered to build thespectral energy distributions of all the clumps and estimate their bolometricluminosities. sio emission at high velocities, characteristic of molecularjets, is detected in 88% of our sources, a very high detection rate indicatingthat there is ongoing star formation activity in most of the sources of oursample. the sio(2-1) luminosity drops with l/m, which suggests that jetactivity declines as time evolves. this represents the first clear evidence ofa decrease of sio outflow luminosity with time in a homogeneous sample ofhigh-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. the sio(3-2) tosio(2-1) integrated intensity ratio shows only minor changes with evolutionarystate.

1107.0679	evla observations of the nebula around g79.29+0.46	we have observed the radio nebula surrounding the galactic lbv candidateg79.29+0.46 with the evla at 6 cm. these new radio observations allow amorphological comparison between the radio emission, which traces the ionizedgas component, and the mid-ir emission, a tracer of the dust component. theirac (8 \mu m) and mips (24 \mu m and 70 \mu m) images have been reprocessedand compared with the evla map. we confirm the presence of a second shell at 24\mu m and also provide evidence for its detection at 70 \mu m. the differencesbetween the spatial morphology of the radio and mid-ir maps indicate theexistence of two dust populations, the cooler one emitting mostly at longerwavelengths. analysis of the two dusty, nested shells have provided us with anestimate of the characteristic timescales for shell ejection, providingimportant constraints for stellar evolutionary models. finer details of theionized gas distribution can be appreciated thanks to the improved quality ofthe new 6 cm image, most notably the highly structured texture of the nebula.evidence of interaction between the nebula and the surrounding interstellarmedium can be seen in the radio map, including brighter features that delineateregions where the shell structure is locally modified. in particular, thebrighter filaments in the south-west region appear to frame the shockedsouthwestern clump reported from co observations.

1108.2014	spitzer characterisation of dust in an anomalous emission region: the  perseus cloud	anomalous microwave emission is known to exist in the perseus cloud. one ofthe most promising candidates to explain this excess of emission is electricdipole radiation from rapidly rotating very small dust grains, commonlyreferred to as spinning dust. photometric data obtained with the spitzer spacetelescope have been reprocessed and used in conjunction with the dust emissionmodel dustem to characterise the properties of the dust within the cloud. thisanalysis has allowed us to constrain spatial variations in the strength of theinterstellar radiation field ($\chi_\mathrm{isrf}$), the mass abundances of thepahs and vsgs relative to the bgs (y$_\mathrm{pah}$ and y$_\mathrm{vsg}$), thecolumn density of hydrogen (n$_\mathrm{h}$) and the equilibrium dusttemperature (t$_\mathrm{dust}$). the parameter maps of y$_\mathrm{pah}$,y$_\mathrm{vsg}$ and $\chi_\mathrm{isrf}$ are the first of their kind to beproduced for the perseus cloud, and we used these maps to investigate thephysical conditions in which anomalous emission is observed. we find that inregions of anomalous emission the strength of the isrf, and consequently theequilibrium temperature of the dust, is enhanced while there is no significantvariation in the abundances of the pahs and the vsgs or the column density ofhydrogen. we interpret these results as an indication that the enhancement in$\chi_\mathrm{isrf}$ might be affecting the properties of the smallstochastically heated dust grains resulting in an increase in the spinning dustemission observed at 33 ghz. this is the first time that such an investigationhas been performed, and we believe that this type of analysis creates a newperspective in the field of anomalous emission studies, and represents apowerful new tool for constraining spinning dust models.

1111.1852	detection and characterization of a 500 mic dust emissivity excess in  the galactic plane using herschel/hi-gal observations	past and recent observations have revealed unexpected variations in thefir-mm dust emissivity. in the herschel spectral range, those are oftenreferred to as a 500{\mu}m emission excess. several dust emission models havebeen developed to interpret astrophysical data in the fir-mm domain. however,these are commonly unable to fully reconcile theoretical predictions withobservations. in contrast, the recently revised two level system (tls) modelseems to provide a promising way of interpreting the existing data. the newlyavailable herschel hi-gal data which covers most of the inner milky-way offersa unique opportunity to investigate possible variations in the dust emissionproperties both with wavelength and environment. by combining the iris 100{\mu}m with the hi-gal 160, 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m data, we model the dustemission spectra in each pixel of the hi-gal maps, using both the tls modeland, for comparison, a single modified black-body fit. the effect oftemperature mixing along the line of sight is investigated. we find a slightdecrease in the dust temperature with distance from the galactic center. wealso report the detection of a significant 500 {\mu}m emissivity excess in theperipheral regions of the plane (35\circ&lt;|l|&lt;70\circ) of about 13-15% of theemissivity, that can reach up to 20% in some hii regions. we present thespatial distribution of the best-fit values for the two main parameters of thetls model, i.e. the charge correlation length, lc, used to characterize thedisordered charge distribution (dcd) part of the model, and the amplitude a ofthe tls processes, with respect to the dcd effect. they highlight the plausibleexistence of an overall gradient with distance to the galactic center. acomparison with previous findings in the solar neighborhood shows that thelocal value of the excess is less than expected from the galactic gradientobserved here.

1205.4280	a multi-wavelength investigation of rcw175: an hii region harboring  spinning dust emission	using infrared, radio continuum and spectral observations, we performed adetailed investigation of the hii region rcw175. we determined that rcw175,which actually consists of two separate hii regions, g29.1-0.7 and g29.0-0.6,is located at a distance of 3.2+/-0.2 kpc. based on the observations we inferthat the more compact g29.0-0.6 is less evolved than g29.1-0.7 and was possiblyproduced as a result of the expansion of g29.1-0.7 into the surroundinginterstellar medium. we compute a star formation rate for rcw175 of(12.6+/-1.9)x10^{-5} m_{\sun}/yr, and identified 6 possible young stellarobject candidates within its vicinity. additionally, we estimate that rcw175contains a total dust mass of 215+/-53 m_{\sun}.  rcw175 has previously been identified as a source of anomalous microwaveemission (ame), an excess of emission at cm wavelengths often attributed toelectric dipole radiation from the smallest dust grains. we find that the amepreviously detected in rcw175 is not correlated with the smallest dust grains(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or small carbonaceous dust grains), butrather with the exciting radiation field within the region. this is a similarresult to that found in the perseus molecular cloud, another region whichharbors ame, suggesting that the radiation field may play a pivotal role in theproduction of this new galactic emission mechanism. finally, we suggest thatthese observations may hint at the importance of understanding the role playedby the major gas ions in spinning dust models.

1210.3631	spitzer and herschel multiwavelength characterization of the dust  content of evolved hii regions	we have analyzed a uniform sample of 16 evolved hii regions located in a 2deg x 2 deg galactic field centered at (l,b) = (30 deg, 0 deg) and observed aspart of the herschel hi-gal survey. the evolutionary stage of these hii regionswas established using ancillary radio continuum data. by combining hi-gal pacs(70 micron, 160 micron) and spire (250 micron, 350 micron and 500 micron)measurements with mipsgal 24 micron data, we built spectral energydistributions (seds) of the sources and showed that a 2-component grey-bodymodel is a good representation of the data. in particular, wavelengths &gt; 70micron appear to trace a cold dust component, for which we estimated anequilibrium temperature of the big grains (bgs) in the range 20 - 30 k, whilefor lambda &lt; 70 micron, the data indicated the presence of a warm dustcomponent at temperatures of the order of 50 - 90 k. this analysis alsorevealed that dust is present in the interior of hii regions, although likelynot in a large amount. in addition, the data appear to corroborate thehypothesis that the main mechanism responsible for the (partial) depletion ofdust in hii regions is radiation-pressure-driven drift. in this framework, wespeculated that the 24 micron emission which spatially correlates with ionizedgas might be associated with either very small grain (vsg) or bg replenishment,as recently proposed for the case of wind-blown bubbles (wbb). finally, wefound that evolved hii regions are characterized by distinctive far-ir andsub-mm colors, which can be used as diagnostics for their identification inunresolved galactic and extragalactic regions.

1211.3747	an analysis of star formation with herschel in the hi-gal survey. i. the  science demonstration phase fields	the herschel survey of the galactic plane (hi-gal) provides a uniqueopportunity to study star formation over large areas of the sky and differentenvironments in the milky way. we use the best studied hi-gal fields to date,two 2x2 tiles centered on (l, b) = (30, 0) deg and (l, b) = (59, 0) deg, tostudy the star formation activity using a large sample of well selected youngstellar objects (ysos). we estimate the star formation rate (sfr) for thesefields using the number of candidate ysos and their average time scale to reachthe zero age main sequence, and compare it with the rate estimated using theirintegrated luminosity at 70 micron combined with an extragalactic starformation indicator. we measure a sfr of (9.5 +- 4.3)*10^{-4} msol/yr and (1.6+- 0.7)*10^{-4} msol/yr with the source counting method, in l=30 deg and l=59deg, respectively. results with the 70 micron estimator are (2.4 +-0.4)*10^{-4} msol/yr and (2.6 +- 1.1)*10^{-6} msol/yr. since the 70 micronindicator is derived from averaging extragalactic star forming complexes, weperform an extrapolation of these values to the whole milky way and obtainsfr_{mw} = (0.71 +- 0.13) msol/yr from l = 30 deg and sfr_{mw} = (0.10 +- 0.04)msol/yr from l=59 deg. the estimates in l=30 deg are in agreement with the mostrecent results on the galactic star formation activity, indicating that thecharacteristics of this field are likely close to those of the star-formationdominated galaxies used for its derivation. since the sky coverage is limited,this analysis will improve when the full hi-gal survey will be available.

1305.1339	bayesian method for the analysis of the dust emission in the  far-infrared and submillimeter	we present a method, based on bayesian statistics, to fit the dust emissionparameters in the far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. the methodestimates the dust temperature and spectral emissivity index, plus theirrelationship, taking into account properly the statistical and systematicuncertainties. we test it on three sets of simulated sources detectable by theherschel space observatory in the pacs and spire spectral bands (70-500micron), spanning over a wide range of dust temperatures. the simulatedobservations are a one-component interstellar medium, and two two-componentsources, both warm (hii regions) and cold (cold clumps). we first define aprocedure to identify the better model, then we recover the parameters of themodel and measure their physical correlations by means of a monte carlo markovchain algorithm adopting multi-variate gaussian priors. in this process weassess the reliability of the model recovery, and of parameters estimation. weconclude that the model and parameters are properly recovered only undercertain circumstances, and that false models may be derived in some case. weapplied the method to a set of 91 starless cold clumps in an inter-arm regionof the galactic plane with low star formation activity, observed by herschel inthe hi-gal survey. our results are consistent with a temperature independentspectral index.

1307.0335	herschel observations of the sgr b2 cores: hydrides, warm co, and cold  dust	sagittarius b2 (sgr b2) is one of the most massive and luminous star-formingregions in the galaxy and shows chemical and physical conditions similar tothose in distant extragalactic starbursts. we present large-scale far-ir/submmphotometric images and spectroscopic maps taken with the pacs and spireinstruments onboard herschel. the spectra towards the sgr b2 star-formingcores, b2(m) and b2(n), are characterized by strong co line emission, emissionlines from high-density tracers (hcn, hco+, and h2s), [n ii] 205 um emissionfrom ionized gas, and absorption lines from hydride molecules (oh+, h2o+, h2o,ch+, ch, sh+, hf, nh, nh2, and nh3). the rotational population diagrams of cosuggest the presence of two gas temperature components: an extended warmcomponent, which is associated with the extended envelope, and a hottercomponent, which is seen towards the b2(m) and b2(n) cores. as observed inother galactic center clouds, the gas temperatures are significantly higherthan the dust temperatures inferred from photometric images. we determinedfar-ir and total dust masses in the cores. non-local thermodynamic equilibriummodels of the co excitation were used to constrain the averaged gas density inthe cores. a uniform luminosity ratio is measured along the extended envelope,suggesting that the same mechanism dominates the heating of the molecular gasat large scales. the detection of high-density molecular tracers and of strong[n ii] 205 um line emission towards the cores suggests that their morphologymust be clumpy to allow uv radiation to escape from the inner hii regions.together with shocks, the strong uv radiation field is likely responsible forthe heating of the hot co component. at larger scales, photodissociationregions models can explain both the observed co line ratios and the uniforml(co)/lfir luminosity ratios.

1404.2285	characterizing the structure of diffuse emission in hi-gal maps	we present a study of the structure of the galactic interstellar mediumthrough the delta-variance technique, related to the power spectrum and thefractal properties of infrared/sub-mm maps. through this method, it is possibleto provide quantitative parameters which are useful to characterize differentmorphological and physical conditions, and to better constrain the theoreticalmodels. in this respect, the herschel infrared galactic plane survey carriedout at five photometric bands from 70 to 500 \mu m constitutes an uniquedatabase for applying statistical tools to a variety of regions across themilky way. in this paper, we derive a robust estimate of the power-law portionof the power spectrum of four contiguous 2{\deg}x2{\deg} hi-gal tiles locatedin the third galactic quadrant (217{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 225{\deg}, -2{\deg} &lt; b &lt;0{\deg}). the low level of confusion along the line of sight testified by coobservations makes this region an ideal case. we find very different values ofthe power spectrum slope from tile to tile but also from wavelength towavelength (2 &lt; \beta &lt; 3), with similarities between fields attributable tocomponents located at the same distance. thanks to the comparison with modelsof turbulence, an explanation of the determined slopes in terms of the fractalgeometry is also provided, and possible relations with the underlying physicsare investigated. in particular, an anti-correlation between ism fractaldimension and star formation efficiency is found for the two main distancecomponents observed in these fields. a possible link between the fractalproperties of the diff?use emission and the resulting clump mass function isdiscussed.

1406.4443	the identification of filaments on far infrared and submillimiter  images. morphology, physical conditions and relation with star formation of  filamentary structure	observations of molecular clouds reveal a complex structure, with gas anddust often arranged in filamentary rather than spherical geometries. theassociations of pre- and proto- stellar cores with the filaments suggest adirect link with the process of star formation. any study of the properties ofsuch filaments requires a representative samples from different enviroments andso an unbiased detection method. we developed such an approach using thehessian matrix of a surface-brightness distribution to identify filaments anddetermine their physical and morphological properties. after testing the methodon simulated, but realistic filaments, we apply the algorithms tocolumn-density maps computed from herschel observations of the galactic planeobtained by the hi-gal project. we identified ~500 filaments, in the longituderange of l=216.5 to l=225.5, with lengths from ~1 pc up to ~30 pc and widthsbetween 0.1 pc and 2.5 pc. average column densities are between 10^20 cm^-2 and10^22 cm^-2. filaments include the majority of dense material with n_h_2 &gt;6x10^21cm^-2. we find that the pre- and proto-stellar compact sources alreadyidentified in the same region are mostly associated with filaments. however,surface densities in excess of the expected critical values for high-mass starformation are only found on the filaments, indicating that these structures arenecessary to channel material into the clumps. furthermore, we analyze thegravitational stability of filaments and discuss their relationship with starformation.

1409.6892	modeling and predicting the shape of the far-infrared to submillimeter  emission in ultra-compact hii regions and cold clumps	dust properties are very likely affected by the environment in which dustgrains evolve. for instance, some analyses of cold clumps (7 k- 17 k) indicatethat the aggregation process is favored in dense environments. however,studying warm (30 k-40 k) dust emission at long wavelength ($\lambda$$&gt;$300$\mu$m) has been limited because it is difficult to combine farinfared-to-millimeter (fir-to-mm) spectral coverage and high angular resolutionfor observations of warm dust grains. using herschel data from 70 to 500$\mu$m, which are part of the herschel infrared galactic (hi-gal) surveycombined with 1.1 mm data from the bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps), wecompared emission in two types of environments: ultra-compact hii (uchii)regions, and cold molecular clumps (denoted as cold clumps). with thiscomparison we tested dust emission models in the fir-to-mm domain thatreproduce emission in the diffuse medium, in these two environments (uchiiregions and cold clumps). we also investigated their ability to predict thedust emission in our galaxy. we determined the emission spectra in twelve uchiiregions and twelve cold clumps, and derived the dust temperature (t) using therecent two-level system (tls) model with three sets of parameters and theso-called t-$\beta$ (temperature-dust emissvity index) phenomenological models,with $\beta$ set to 1.5, 2 and 2.5. we tested the applicability of the tlsmodel in warm regions for the first time. this analysis indicates distincttrends in the dust emission between cold and warm environments that are visiblethrough changes in the dust emissivity index. however, with the use of standardparameters, the tls model is able to reproduce the spectral behavior observedin cold and warm regions, from the change of the dust temperature alone,whereas a t-$\beta$ model requires $\beta$ to be known.

1511.02208	the hi supershell gs 118+01-44 and its role in the interstellar medium	we carry out a multiwavelength study to characterize the hi supershelldesignated gs 118+01-44, and to analyse its possible origin. a multiwavlengthstudy has been carried out to study the supershell and its environs. weperformed an analysis of the hi, co, radio continuum, and infrared emissiondistributions. the canadian galactic plane survey (cgps) hi data reveals thatgs 118+01-44 is centred at (l, b) = (117.7, 1.4) with a systemic velocity of-44.3 km/s. according to galactic rotation models this structure is located at3.0 +- 0.6 kpc from the sun. there are several hii regions and three supernovaremnants (snrs) catalogued in the region. on the other hand, the analysis ofthe temperature spectral index distribution shows that in the region there is apredominance of non-thermal emission. infrared emission shows that cooltemperatures dominate the area of the supershell. concerning the origin of thestructure, we found that even though several ob stars belonging to cas ob5 arelocated in the interior of gs 118+01-44, an analysis of the energy injected bythese stars through their stellar winds indicates that they do not havesufficient energy to create gs 118+01-44. therefore, an additional energysource is needed to explain the genesis of gs 118+01-44. on the other hand, thepresence of several hii regions and young stellar object candidates in theedges of gs 118+01-44 shows that the region is still active in forming newstars.

astro-ph;0003031	iso spectroscopy of the hh 7-11 flow and its red-shifted counterpart	we have used the two spectrometers on the infrared space observatory toobserve the hh 7-11 flow, its red-shifted counterpart, and the candidateexciting source svs 13, in the star formation region ngc 1333. we detect atomic([oi]63um and 145um, [siii]34.8um, [cii]158um) and molecular (h_2, co, h_2o)lines at various positions along the bipolar flow.  most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock-excitedemission. in particular, our analysis shows that dissociative (j-type) andnon-dissociative (c-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere alongboth lobes of the flow. we confirm the low-excitation nature of the herbig-haronebulosities, with shock velocities &lt;40-50 km/s. toward both lobes of theoutflow we find pre-shock densities of n_0~10^4 cm-3 for both the j and ccomponents, implying b_0~100ug. in the central region of the flow, close to theexciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the c-shock component isn_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. we propose thatthe deficiency of gas-phase water in the post c-shock regions is due tofreezing onto warm grains processed through the j-shock front and travelingalong the magnetic field lines. the total observed cooling from thedissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slowmolecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral hi wind.  finally, the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears tobe weakly photo-ionised by bd +30 549, the dominant illuminating source of thengc 1333 reflection nebula.

astro-ph;0103065	infrared and millimetric study of the young outflow cepheus e	the cepheus e outflow has been studied in the mid and far infrared using theiso cam and lws instruments, and at millimetric wavelengths using ovro. in thenear and mid-ir, its morphology is similar to that expected for a jet drivenoutflow, where the leading bow shocks entrain and accelerate the surroundingmolecular gas. as expected, fine structure atomic/ionic emission lines arisefrom the bow shocks, at both the mach disk and the stagnation tip, wherej-shocks are dominant. the h2, h2o and co molecular emission could arisefurther `downstream' at the bow shock wings where the shocks (v = 8-35 km/s)are oblique and more likely to be c-type. the 13co emission arises fromentrained molecular gas and a compact high velocity emission is observed,together with an extended low velocity component that almost coincidesspatially with the h2 near-ir emission. the millimetric continuum emissionshows two sources. we identify one of them with iras 23011+6126, postulating isthe driver of the cepheus e outflow; the other, also an embedded source, islikely to be driving one of other outflows observed in the region.

astro-ph;0208277	the precession of the giant hh34 outflow: a possible jet deceleration  mechanism	the giant jets represent a fundamental trace of the historical evolution ofthe outflow activity over timescales which are comparable to the accretion timeof the outflow sources in their main protostellar phase. the study of such hugejets provides the possibility of retrieving important elements related to thelife of the outflow sources. in this paper, we study the role of precession(combined with jet velocity-variability and the resulting enhanced interactionwith the surrounding environment) as a deceleration mechanism for giant jetsusing a numerical approach. we obtain predictions of h alpha intensity maps andposition-velocity diagrams from 3d simulations of the giant hh 34 jet(including an appropriate ejection velocity time-variability and a precessionof the outflow axis), and we compare them with previously publishedobservations of this object. our simulations represent a step forward fromprevious numerical studies of hh objects, in that the use of a 7-level, binaryadaptive grid has allowed us to compute models which appropiately cover allrelevant scales of a giant jet, from the ~ 100 au jet radius close to thesource to the ~ 1 pc length of the outflow. a good qualitative and quantitativeagreement is found between the model predictions and the observations.moreover, we show that a critical parameter for obtaining a better or worseagreement with the observations is the ratio rho_j/rho_a between the jet andthe environmental densities. the implications of this result in the context ofthe current star formation models are discussed (abridged).

(sn 1991bg, the prototype of thesubclass of fast declining type ia supernovae, is a special case.) thedispersion in the hubble diagram in jhk is only ~0.15 mag. the near-infraredproperties of type ia supernovae continue to be excellent measures of theluminosity distances to the supernova host galaxies, due to the need for onlysmall corrections from the epoch of observation to maximum light, lowdispersion in absolute magnitudes at maximum light, and the minimal reddeningeffects in the near-infrared.

astro-ph;9709140	highly collimated molecular hydrogen jets near iras 05487+0255: nir  imaging and spectroscopy	we present new narrow-band near-infrared images together with k band spectraof highly collimated bipolar jets close to the iras 05487+0255 source. the jetsare located at 50" west of the herbig-haro 110 outflow. the jets are notvisible at optical wavelengths, and therefore, do not fall into the `standard'herbig-haro object classification scheme. nevertheless, they belong to an evergrowing group of molecular hydrogen jets associated with ysos which areoptically undetected. the jets are very well collimated, with a length-to-widthratio of 10-20. the spectra of the jet and counter-jet in the k-band show alimited number of molecular hydrogen emission lines which makes it difficult toobtain an accurate excitation temperature. we estimate tex = 1104+/-67 k andtex = 920+/- 156 k for the red and blue jet components respectively. the radialvelocities of the jet and counter-jet, based on the shift of the (1,0) s(1)2.121 micron line, are -275+/- 50 km/s and 180+/- 50 km/s respectively,suggesting an angle of 30 to 45 degrees between the jet and the line of sight.the molecular hydrogen emission of the entire jet extends for at least 40" or0.1 pc at the distance of orion. if the flow velocity is comparable to that ofthe radial velocities, then the dynamical age of the system is quite short(about 500 yrs), consistent with a young jet arising from an embedded source.entrainment in a turbulent mixing layer may explain this morphology andspectral character.

astro-ph;9711250	effects of cooling on the propagation of magnetized jets	we present multi-dimensional simulations of magnetized radiative jetsappropriate to young stellar objects. magnetized jets subject to collisionallyexcited radiative losses have not, as yet, received extensive scrutiny. thepurpose of this letter is to articulate the propagation dynamics of radiativemhd jets in the context of the extensive jet literature. most importantly, welook for morphological and kinematic diagnostics that may distinguishhydrodynamic protostellar jets from their magnetically dominated cousins. oursimulations are axisymmetric (2.5-d). a toroidal b_phi field geometry is used.our models have high sonic mach numbers (ms approx 10), but lower fast modemach number (mf approx 5). this is approximately the case for jets formed viadisk-wind or x-wind models - currently the consensus choice for launching andcollimating yso jets. time-dependent radiative losses are included via acoronal cooling curve. our results demonstrate that the morphology andpropagation characteristics of strongly magnetized radiative jets can differsignificantly from jets with weak fields. in particular the formation ofnose-cones via post-shock hoop stresses leads to narrow bow shocks and enhancedbow shock speeds. in addition, the hoop stresses produce strong shocks in thejet beam which constrasts with the relatively unperturbed beam in radiativehydrodynamic jets. our simulations show that pinch modes produced by magnetictension can strongly effect magnetized protostellar jets.
