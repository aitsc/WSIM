0812.4405	abell 851 and the role of starbursts in cluster galaxy evolution	we use extensive new observations of the very rich z ~ 0.4 cluster ofgalaxies a851 to examine the nature and origin of starburst galaxies inintermediate-redshift clusters. new hst observations, spitzer photometry andground-based spectroscopy cover most of a region of the cluster about 10 arcminacross, corresponding to a clustercentric radial distance of about 1.6 mpc.this spatial coverage allows us to confirm the existence of amorphology-density relation within this cluster, and to identify several large,presumably infalling, subsystems. we confirm our previous conclusion that avery large fraction of the starforming galaxies in a851 have recently undergonestarbursts. we argue that starbursts are mostly confined to two kinds of sites:infalling groups and the cluster center. at the cluster center it appears thatinfalling galaxies are undergoing major mergers, resulting in starbursts whoseoptical emission lines are completely buried beneath dust. the aftermath ofthis process appears to be proto-s0 galaxies devoid of star formation. incontrast, major mergers do not appear to be the cause of most of the starburstsin infalling groups, and fewer of these events result in the transformation ofthe galaxy into an s0. some recent theoretical work provides possibleexplanations for these two distinct processes, but it is not clear whether theycan operate with the very high efficiency needed to account for the very largestarburst rate observed.

0902.0954	wings: a wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey iii. deep near-infrared  photometry of 28 nearby clusters	context. this is the third paper of a series devoted to the wide-field nearbygalaxy-cluster survey (wings).wings is a long term project aimed at gatheringwide-field, multiband imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies in a complete sampleof 77 x-ray selected nearby clusters (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07) located far from thegalactic plane (b&gt;20deg). the main goal of this project is to establish a localreference sample for evolutionary studies of galaxies and galaxy clusters.aims. this paper presents the near-infrared (j,k) photometric catalogs of 28clusters of the wings sample and describes the procedures followed to constructthem. methods. the raw data has been reduced at casu and special care has beendevoted to the final coadding, drizzling technique, astrometric solution andmagnitude calibration for the wfcam pipeline processed data. we haveconstructed the photometric catalogs based on the final calibrated coaddedmosaics (0.79 deg2) in j (19 clusters) and k (27 clusters) bands. a customizedinteractive pipeline has been used to clean the catalogs and to make mockimages for photometric errors and completeness estimates. results. we providedeep near-infrared photometric catalogs (90% complete in detection rate attotal magnitudes j =20.5, k =19.4, and in classification rate at j = 19.5 and k= 18.5), giving positions, geometrical parameters, total and aperturemagnitudes for all detected sources. for each field we classify the detectedsources as stars, galaxies and objects of "unknown" nature.

0907.2392	superdense massive galaxies in wings local clusters	massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1 have been found to have small physicalsizes, hence to be superdense. several mechanisms, including minor mergers,have been proposed for increasing galaxy sizes from high- to low-z. we searchfor superdense massive galaxies in the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey(wings) of x-ray selected galaxy clusters at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07. we discover asignificant population of superdense massive galaxies with masses and sizescomparable to those observed at high redshift. they approximately represent 22%of all cluster galaxies more massive than 3x10^10msol, are mostly s0 galaxies,have a median effective radius &lt;re&gt; =1.61+/-0.29kpc, a median sersic index &lt;n&gt;= 3.0+/-0.6, and very old stellar populations with a median mass-weighted ageof 12.1+/-1.3gyr. we calculate a number density of 2.9x10^-2mpc^-3 forsuperdense galaxies in local clusters, and a hard lower limit of1.3x10^-5mpc^-3 in the whole comoving volume between z = 0.04 and z = 0.07. wefind a relation between mass, effective radius and luminosity-weighted age inour cluster galaxies, which can mimic the claimed evolution of the radius withredshift, if not properly taken into account. we compare our data withspectroscopic high-z surveys and find that -when stellar masses are considered-there is consistency with the local wings galaxy sizes out to z~2, while adiscrepancy of a factor of 3 exists with the only spectroscopic z&gt;2 study. incontrast, there is strong evidence for a large evolution in radius for the mostmassive galaxies with m*&gt;4x10^11msol compared to similarly massive galaxies inwings, i.e. the bcgs.

1001.2701	the shapes of bcgs and normal ellipticals in nearby clusters	we compare the apparent axial ratio distributions of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) and normal ellipticals (es) in our sample of 75 galaxy clustersfrom the wings survey. most bcgs in our clusters (69%) are classified as cdgalaxies. the sample of cds has been completed by 14 additional cds (non-bcgs)we found in our clusters. we find that: (i) es have triaxial shape, thetriaxiality sharing almost evenly the intrinsic axial ratios parameter space,with a weak preference for prolateness; (ii) the bcgs have triaxial shape aswell. however, their tendence towards prolateness is much stronger than in thecase of es. such a strong prolateness appears entirely due to the sizeable(dominant) component of cds inside the wings sample of bcgs. in fact, while the'normal'(non-cd) bcgs do not differ from es, as far as the shape distributionis concerned, the axial ratio distribution of bcg_cd galaxies is found tosupport quite prolate shapes; (iii) our result turns out to be strongly atvariance with the only similar, previous analysis by ryden et al.(1993)(rlp93),where bcgs and es were found to share the same axial ratio distribution; (iv)our data suggest that the above discrepancy is mainly caused by the differentcriteria that rlp93 and ourselves use to select the cluster samples, coupledwith a preference of cds to reside in powerful x-ray emitting clusters; (v) thegif2 n-body results suggest that the prolateness of the bcgs (in particular thecds) could reflect the shape of the associated dark matter halos.

1003.5563	the hellas2xmm survey. xiii. multi-component analysis of the spectral  energy distribution of obscured agn	we combine near-to-mid-ir spitzer data with shorter wavelength observations(optical to x-rays) to get insights on the properties of a sample of luminous,obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). we aim at modeling their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds) in order to estimate the main parametersrelated to the dusty torus. the sample comprises 16 obscured high-redshift(0.9&lt;z&lt;2.1) xray luminous quasars (l_2-10 ~ 10^44 erg s-1) selected from thehellas2xmm survey. the seds are described by a multi-component model includinga stellar component, an agn component and a starburst. the majority (~80%) ofthe sources show moderate optical depth (tau_9.7um&lt;3) and the derived columndensities n_h are consistent with the xray inferred values (10^22 &lt;n_h&lt; 3x10^23cm-2) for most of the objects, confirming that the sources are moderatelyobscured compton-thin agn. accretion luminosities in the range 5x10^44 &lt; lbol &lt;4x10^46 erg s-1 are inferred. we compare model luminosities with those obtainedby integrating the observed sed, finding that the latter are lower by a factorof ~2 in the median. the discrepancy can be as high as an order of magnitudefor models with high optical depth (tau_9.7um=10). the ratio between theluminosities obtained by the fitting procedure and from the observed sedsuggest that, at least for type~2 agn, observed bolometric luminosities arelikely to underestimate intrinsic ones and the effect is more severe for highlyobscured sources. bolometric corrections from the hard x-ray band are computedand have a median value of k_2-10kev ~ 20. the obscured agn in our sample arecharacterized by relatively low eddington ratios (median lambda_edd~0.08). onaverage, they are consistent with the eddington ratio increasing at increasingbolometric correction (e.g. vasudevan &amp; fabiam 2009).

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1106.1647	on the nature of the absorber in iras 09104+4109: the x-ray and  mid-infrared view	we present a long (~76 ks) chandra observation of iras 09104+4109, ahyper-luminous galaxy, optically classified as a type 2 agn hosted in a cdgalaxy in a cluster at z=0.442. we also report on the results obtained byfitting its broad-band spectral energy distribution. the compton-thick natureof this source (which has been often referred to as an "archetype" ofcompton-thick type 2 quasars) was formerly claimed on the basis of its marginaldetection in the pds instrument onboard bepposax, being then disputed usingxmm-newton data. both chandra analysis and optical/mid-ir spectral fitting areconsistent with the presence of heavy (~1-5 10^{23} cm^{-2}) but not extreme(compton-thick) obscuration. however, using the mid-ir and the [oiii] emissionas proxies of the nuclear hard x-ray luminosity suggests the presence ofheavier obscuration. the 54-month swift bat map shows excess hard x-rayemission likely related to a nearby (z=0.009) type 2 agn, close enough to iras09104+4109 to significantly enhance and contaminate its emission in the earlybepposax pds data.

1107.2924	gas and dust in a submillimeter galaxy at z = 4.24 from the herschel  atlas	we report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source,id141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the h-atlas cosmologicalsurvey. id141 was observed using the iram 30-meter telescope and plateau debure interferometer (pdbi), the submillimeter array (sma) and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) submillimeter telescope to measure the dustcontinuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon([c i] and [c ii]). the detection of strong co emission lines with the pdbiconfirms that id141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). the strength ofthe continuum and emission lines suggests that id141 is gravitationally lensed.the width (delta v (fwhm) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the co andcarbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. the propertiesderived for id141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (l_fir ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x10^13/mu_l lsun, where mu_l is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)and warm (t_kin ~ 40k) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rateof (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_l msun/yr. the carbon emission lines indicate a dense(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) photo-dominated region, illuminated by a far-uv radiationfield a few thousand times more intense than that in our galaxy. in conclusion,the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, id141, are remarkably similar tothose of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1109.2026	morphology of galaxies in the wings clusters	we present the morphological catalog of galaxies in nearby clusters of thewings survey (fasano et al. 2006). the catalog contains a total number of 39923galaxies, for which we provide the automatic estimates of the morphologicaltype applying the purposely devised tool morphot to the v-band wings imaging.for ~3000 galaxies we also provide visual estimates of the morphological types.a substantial part of the paper is devoted to the description of the morphottool, whose application is limited, at least for the moment, to the wingsimaging only. the approach of the tool to the automation of morphologicalclassification is a non parametric and fully empiri- cal one. in particular,morphot exploits 21 morphological diagnostics, directly and easily computablefrom the galaxy image, to provide two independent classifications: one based ona maximum likelihood (ml), semi-analytical technique, the other one on a neuralnetwork (nn) machine. a suitably selected sample of ~1000 visually clas- sifiedwings galaxies is used to calibrate the diagnostics for the ml estimator and asa training set in the nn machine. the final morphological estimator combinesthe two techniques and proves to be effective both when applied to anadditional test sample of ~1000 visually classified wings galaxies and whencompared with small samples of sdss galaxies visually classified by fukugita etal. (2007) and nair et al. (2010). finally, besides the galaxy morphologydistribution (corrected for field contamination) in the wings clusters, wepresent the ellipticity ({\epsilon}), color (b-v) and sersic index (n)distributions for different morphological types, as well as the morphologicalfractions as a function of the clustercentric distance (in units of r200).

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

1207.2668	smooth and clumpy dust distribution in agn: a direct comparison of two  commonly explored infrared emission models	the geometry of the dust distribution within the inner regions of activegalactic nuclei (agn) is still a debated issue and relates directly with theagn unified scheme. traditionally, models discussed in the literature assumeone of two distinct dust distributions in what is believed to be a toroidalregion around the supermassive black holes: a continuous distribution,customarily referred to as smooth, and a concentration of dust in clumps orclouds, referred to as clumpy.  in this paper we perform a thorough comparison between two of the mostpopular models in the literature, namely the smooth models by fritz. et al.2006 and the clumpy models by nenkova et al. 2008a, in their common parametersspace. particular attention is paid to the silicate features at ~9.7 and ~18micron, the width of the infrared bump, the near-infrared index and theluminosity at 12.3 micron, all previously reported as possible diagnostic toolsto distinguish between the two dust distributions. we find that, due to thedifferent dust chemical compositions used in the two models, the behaviour ofthe silicate features at 9.7 and 18 micron is quite distinct between the twomodels. the width of the infrared bump and the peak of the infrared emissioncan take comparable values, their distributions do, however, vary. thenear-infrared index is also quite different, due partly to the primary sourcesadopted by the two models. models with matched parameters do not producesimilar seds and virtually no random parameter combinations can result inseemingly identical seds.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1209.4651	the herschel virgo cluster survey xii: fir properties of  optically-selected virgo cluster galaxies	the herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) is the deepest, confusion-limitedsurvey of the virgo cluster at far-infrared (fir) wavelengths. the entiresurvey at full depth covers $\sim$55 sq. deg. in 5 bands (100-500 \micron),encompassing the areas around the central dominant elliptical galaxies (m87,m86 &amp; m49) and extends as far as the nw cloud, the w cloud and the southernextension. the survey extends beyond this region with lower sensitivity so thatthe total area covered is 84 sq. deg. in this paper we describe the data, thedata acquisition techniques and present the detection rates of the opticallyselected virgo cluster catalogue (vcc). we detect 254 (34%) of 750 vcc galaxiesfound within the survey boundary in at least one band and 171 galaxies aredetected in all five bands. for the remainder of the galaxies we have measuredstrict upper limits for their fir emission. the population of detected galaxiescontains early- as well as late-types although the latter dominate thedetection statistics. we have modelled 168 galaxies, showing no evidence of astrong synchrotron component in their fir spectra, using a single-temperaturemodified blackbody spectrum with a fixed emissivity index ($\beta = 2$). astudy of the $\chi^2$ distribution indicates that this model is not appropriatein all cases, and this is supported by the fir colours which indicate a spreadin $\beta$=1--2. statistical comparison of the dust mass and temperaturedistributions from 140 galaxies with $\chi^2_{dof=3} &lt; 7.8$ (95% confidencelevel) shows that late-types have typically colder, more massive dustreservoirs; the early-type dust masses have a mean of ${\rm log}(&lt;m&gt; /m_{\sun}) = 6.3 \pm 0.3 $, while for late-types ${\rm log}(&lt;m&gt; / m_{\sun}) =7.1\pm 0.1$...

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1305.3130	herschel observations of edge-on spirals (heroes). i: far-infrared  morphology and dust mass determination	context. edge-on spiral galaxies with prominent dust lanes provide us with anexcellent opportunity to study the distribution and properties of the dustwithin them. the heroes project was set up to observe a sample of seven largeedge-on galaxies across various wavelengths for this investigation.  aims. within this first paper, we present the herschel observations andperform a qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, and we derive someglobal properties of the far infrared and submillimetre emission.  methods. we determine horizontal and vertical profiles from the herschelobservations of the galaxies in the sample and describe the morphology.modified black-body fits to the global fluxes, measured using aperturephotometry, result in dust temperatures and dust masses. the latter values arecompared to those that are derived from radiative transfer models taken fromthe literature.  results. on the whole, our herschel flux measurements agree well witharchival values. we find that the exponential horizontal dust distributionmodel often used in the literature generally provides a good description of theobserved horizontal profiles. three out of the seven galaxies show signaturesof extended vertical emission at 100 and 160 {\mu}m at the 5{\sigma} level, butin two of these it is probably due to deviations from an exactly edge-onorientation. only for ngc 4013, a galaxy in which vertically extended dust hasalready been detected in optical images, we can detect vertically extendeddust, and the derived scaleheight agrees with the value estimated throughradiative transfer modelling. our analysis hints at a correlation between thedust scaleheight and its degree of clumpiness, which we infer from thedifference between the dust masses as calculated from modelling of optical dataand from fitting the spectral energy distribution of herschel datapoints.

1307.2360	the hybrid solution for the fundamental plane	by exploiting the database of early-type galaxies (etgs) members of the wingssurvey of nearby clusters, we address here the long debated question of theorigin and shape of the fundamental plane (fp). our data suggest that differentphysical mechanisms concur in shaping and tilting the fp with respect to thevirial plane (vp) expectation. in particular, an hybrid solution in which thestructure of galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors tothe fp tilt seems to be favoured. we find that the bulk of the tilt should beattributed to structural non-homology, while stellar population effects play animportant but less crucial role. our data indicate that the differential fptilt between the v and k-band is due to a sort of entanglement betweenstructural and stellar population effects, for which the inward steepening ofcolor profiles (v-k) tends to increase at increasing the stellar mass of etgs.the same analysis applied to the atlas3d and sdss data in common with wings(wsdss throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkabledifference being the less important role of the stellar mass-to-light-ratio indetermining the fp tilt. the atlas3d data also suggest that the tilt depends aswell on the dark matter (dm) fraction and on the rotational contribution to thekinetic energy (vrot/sigma). we show that the global properties of the fp canbe understood in terms of the underlying correlation among mass, structure andstellar population of etgs, for which, at increasing the stellar mass, etgsbecome (on average) older and more centrally concentrated. finally, we showthat a malmquist-like selection effect may mimic a differential evolution ofthe mass-to-light ratio for galaxies of different masses. this should be takeninto account in the studies investigating the amount of the so calleddownsizing phenomenon.

(2013) atz=1-2. the number density of local compact galaxies with luminosity weighted(lw) ages compatible with being already passive at high redshift is comparedwith the density of compact passive galaxies observed at high-z. our resultsplace an upper limit of a factor ~2 to the evolution of the number density andare inconsistent with a significant size evolution for most of the compactgalaxies observed at high-z. the evolution may be instead significant (up to afactor 5) for the most extreme, ultracompact galaxies. considering all compactgalaxies, regardless of lw age and star formation activity, a minority of localcompact galaxies (&lt;=1/3) might have formed at z&lt;1. finally, we show that thesecular decrease of the galaxy stellar mass due to simple stellar evolution mayin some cases be a non-negligible factor in the context of the evolution of themass-size relation, and we caution that passive evolution in mass should betaken into account when comparing samples at different redshifts.

1311.1774	the herschel virgo cluster survey xvi: a cluster inventory	herschel fir observations are used to construct virgo cluster galaxyluminosity functions and to show that the cluster lacks the very bright and thenumerous faint sources detected in field galaxy surveys. the far-infrared sedsare fitted to obtain dust masses and temperatures and the dust mass function.the cluster is over dense in dust by about a factor of 100 compared to thefield. the same emissivity (beta) temperature relation applies for differentgalaxies as that found for different regions of m31. we use optical and hi datato show that virgo is over dense in stars and atomic gas by about a factor of100 and 20 respectively. metallicity values are used to measure the mass ofmetals in the gas phase. the mean metallicity is about 0.7 solar and 50% of themetals are in the dust. for the cluster as a whole the mass density of stars ingalaxies is 8 times that of the gas and the gas mass density is 130 times thatof the metals. we use our data to consider the chemical evolution of theindividual galaxies, inferring that the measured variations in effective yieldare due to galaxies having different ages, being affected to varying degrees bygas loss. four galaxy scaling relations are considered: mass-metallicity,mass-velocity, mass-star formation rate and mass-radius - we suggest thatinitial galaxy mass is the prime driver of a galaxy's ultimate destiny.finally, we use x-ray observations and galaxy dynamics to assess the dark andbaryonic matter content compared to the cosmological model.

1401.1017	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xv. planck submillimetre sources in  the virgo cluster	we cross-correlate the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs) with thefully sampled 84 deg2 herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) fields. we searchfor and identify the 857 and 545 ghz pccs sources in the hevics fields bystudying their fir/submm and optical counterparts. we find 84 and 48 compactplanck sources in the hevics fields at 857 and 545 ghz, respectively. almostall sources correspond to individual bright virgo cluster galaxies. the vastmajority of the planck detected galaxies are late-type spirals, with the scclass dominating the numbers, while early-type galaxies are virtually absentfrom the sample, especially at 545 ghz. we compare the hevics spire fluxdensities for the detected galaxies with the four different pccs flux densityestimators and find an excellent correlation with the aperture photometry fluxdensities, even at the highest flux density levels. we find only seven pccssources in the hevics fields without a nearby galaxy as obvious counterpart,and conclude that all of these are dominated by galactic cirrus features or arespurious detections. no planck sources in the hevics fields seem to beassociated to high-redshift proto-clusters of dusty galaxies or strongly lensedsubmm sources. finally, our study is the first empirical confirmation of thesimulation-based estimated completeness of the pccs, and provides a strongsupport of the internal pccs validation procedure.

1402.4131	wings-spe iii: equivalent width measurements, spectral properties and  evolution of local cluster galaxies	[abridged] we investigate the frequency of the various spectral types as afunction both of the clusters' properties and of the galaxies' characteristics.in this way, using the same classification criteria adopted for higher redshiftstudies, we can consistently compare the properties of the local clusterpopulation to those of their more distant counterparts. we describe a method wehave developed to automatically measure the equivalent width of spectral linesin a robust way even in spectra with a non optimal signal to noise. like this,we can derive a spectral classification reflecting the stellar content, basedon the presence and strength of the [oii] and hdelta lines. we are able tomeasure 4381 of the ~6000 originally observed spectra, in the fields of 48clusters, 2744 of which are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. thespectral classification is then analyzed as a function of galaxies' luminosity,stellar mass, morphology, local density and host cluster's global properties,and compared to higher redshift samples (morphs and ediscs). the vast majorityof galaxies in the local clusters population are passive objects, being alsothe most luminous and massive. at a magnitude limit of mv&lt;-18, galaxies in apost-starburst phase represent only ~11% of the cluster population and thisfraction is reduced to ~5% at mv&lt;-19.5, which compares to the 18% at the samemagnitude limit for high-z clusters. "normal" star forming galaxies [e( c )]are proportionally more common in local clusters. the relative occurrence ofpost--starbursts suggests a very similar quenching efficiency in clusters atredshifts in the 0 to ~1 range. furthermore, more important than the globalenvironment, the local density seems to be the main driver of galaxy evolutionin local clusters, at least with respect to their stellar populations content.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1402.5967	a resolved analysis of cold dust and gas in the nearby edge-on spiral  ngc 891	we investigate the connection between dust and gas in the nearby edge-onspiral galaxy ngc 891. high resolution herschel pacs and spire 70, 100, 160,250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m images are combined with jcmt scuba 850 $\mu$mobservations to trace the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energydistribution (sed). maps of the hi 21 cm line and co(j=3-2) emission trace theatomic and molecular hydrogen gas, respectively. we fit one-component modifiedblackbody models to the integrated sed, finding a global dust mass of8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 k. wealso fit the pixel-by-pixel seds to produce maps of the dust mass andtemperature. the dust mass distribution correlates with the total stellarpopulation as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission. the derived dust temperature,which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 k, is found to correlate with the 24$\mu$m emission. allowing the dust emissivity index to vary, we find an averagevalue of $\beta$ = 1.9$\pm$0.3. we confirm an inverse relation between the dustemissivity spectral index and dust temperature, but do not observe anyvariation of this relationship with vertical height from the mid-plane of thedisk. a comparison of the dust properties with the gaseous components of theism reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities ofdust and the molecular hydrogen and total gas surface densities. observedasymmetries in the dust temperature, and the h$_{2}$-to-dust and totalgas-to-dust ratios hint that an enhancement in the star formation rate may bethe result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel starformation in the ne compared to the sw. whilst the asymmetry likely arises fromdust obscuration due to the geometry of the line-of-sight projection of thespiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star formation rate in thene side of the disk.

1403.4272	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga): iv. dust  scaling relations at sub-kpc resolution	the imprints of dust-starlight interactions are visible in scaling relationsbetween stellar characteristics, star formation parameters and dust properties.we aim to examine dust scaling relations on a sub-kpc resolution in theandromeda galaxy (m31) by comparing the properties on a local and global scaleto other galaxies of the local universe. new herschel observations are combinedwith available data from galex, sdss, wise and spitzer to construct a datasetcovering uv to submm wavelengths. we work at the resolution of the spire $500\;\mu$m beam, with pixels corresponding to physical regions of 137 x 608 pc inthe galaxy's disk. a panchromatic spectral energy distribution was modelled foreach pixel and several dust scaling relations are investigated. we find, on asub-kpc scale, strong correlations between $m_d/m_\star$ and nuv-r, and between$m_d/m_\star$ and $\mu_\star$ (the stellar mass surface density). strikingsimilarities with corresponding relations based on integrated galaxies arefound. we decompose m31 in four macro-regions based on their fir morphology;the bulge, inner disk, star forming ring and the outer disk. all regionsclosely follow the galaxy-scale average trends. the specific star formationcharacteristics we derive for these macro-regions give strong hints of aninside-out formation of the bulge-disk geometry, as well as an internaldownsizing process. however, within each macro-region, a great diversity inindividual micro-regions is found. furthermore, we confirm that dust in thebulge of m31 is heated only by the old stellar populations. in general, thelocal dust scaling relations indicate that the dust content in m31 ismaintained by a subtle interplay of past and present star formation. thesimilarity with galaxy-based relations strongly suggests that they are in situcorrelations, with underlying processes that must be local in nature.

1406.7649	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) v:  strengthening the case for substantial interstellar grain growth	in this paper we consider the implications of the distributions of dust andmetals in the disc of m31. we derive mean radial dust distributions using adust map created from herschel images of m31 sampling the entire far-infrared(fir) peak. modified blackbodies are fit to approximately 4000 pixels with avarying, as well as a fixed, dust emissivity index (beta). an overall metaldistribution is also derived using data collected from the literature. we use asimple analytical model of the evolution of the dust in a galaxy with dustcontributed by stellar sources and interstellar grain growth, and fit thismodel to the radial dust-to-metals distribution across the galaxy. our analysisshows that the dust-to-gas gradient in m31 is steeper than the metallicitygradient, suggesting interstellar dust growth is (or has been) important inm31. we argue that m31 helps build a case for cosmic dust in galaxies being theresult of substantial interstellar grain growth, while the net dust productionfrom stars may be limited. we note, however, that the efficiency of dustproduction in stars, e.g., in supernovae (sne) ejecta and/or stellaratmospheres, and grain destruction in the interstellar medium (ism) may bedegenerate in our simple model. we can conclude that interstellar grain growthby accretion is likely at least as important as stellar dust productionchannels in building the cosmic dust component in m31.

0705.1513	a spectrophotometric model applied to cluster galaxies: the wings  dataset	[abridged] the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey (wings) is a projectaiming at the study of the galaxy populations in clusters in the local universe(0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07) and the influence of environment on the physical properties ofgalaxies. this survey provides a high quality set of spectroscopic data for~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. a salient feature of this model is thepossibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing youngerstars to be more obscured than older ones. our technique, for the first time,takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. a set of templatespectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, withfeatures closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms ofspectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. our method of analyzingthese spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties relatedto each physical parameter we are inferring. the well-known degeneracy problem,i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction indifferent age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to therecovered parameters. the values found in this way, together with their errorbars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possiblesolutions for a given spectrum. a comparison test was also performed on a wingssubsample, containing objects in common with the sloan digital sky survey,yielding excellent agreement. we find that the stellar content as a function ofage is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties onlymildly depend on the s/n ratio. the metallicity of the dominant stellarpopulation is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the starformation history pattern.

1409.1815	the identification of dust heating mechanisms in nearby galaxies using  herschel 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightness ratios	we examined variations in the 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightnessratios within 24 nearby (&lt;30 mpc) face-on spiral galaxies observed with theherschel space observatory to identify the heating mechanisms for dust emittingat these wavelengths. the analysis consisted of both qualitative andquantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 micron ratios to h alphaand 24 micron surface brightnesses, which trace the light from star formingregions, and 3.6 micron emission, which traces the light from the older stellarpopulations of the galaxies. we find broad variations in the heating mechanismsfor the dust. in one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at&lt;=160 microns (and in rare cases potentially at &lt;=350 microns) originates fromdust heated by star forming regions. in another subset, we found that theemission at &gt;=250 microns (and sometimes at &gt;=160 microns) originates from dustheated by the older stellar population. in the rest of the sample, either theresults are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contributeequally to the global dust heating. the observed variations in dust heatingmechanisms does not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emissionand radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dusttemperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability indust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.

1503.01339	morphological fractions of galaxies in wings clusters: revisiting the  morphology-density paradigm	we present the morphology-density and morphology-radius relations (t-sigmaand t-r, respectively) obtained from the wings database of galaxies in nearbyclusters. aiming to achieve the best statistics, we exploit the whole sample ofgalaxies brighter than mv=-19.5 (5,504 objects), stacking up the 76 clusters ofthe wings survey altogether. using this global cluster sample, we find that thet-sigma relation holds only in the inner cluster regions (r&lt;1/3xr200), whilethe t-r relation keeps almost unchanged over the whole range of local density.a couple of tests and two sets of numerical simulations support the robustnessof these results against the effects of the limited cluster area coverage ofthe wings imaging. the above mentioned results hold for all cluster masses(x-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion) and all galaxy stellar masses (m).the strength of the t-sigma relation (where present) increases with increasingm, while this effect is not found for the t-r relation. noticeably, theabsence/presence of subclustering determines the presence/absence of thet-sigma relation outside the inner cluster regions, leading us to the generalconclusion that the link between morphology and local density is preserved justin dynamically evolved regions. we hypothesize that some mechanism ofmorphological broadening/redistribution operates in the intermediate/outerregions of substructured (non relaxed) clusters, producing a strong weakeningof the t-sigma relation.

1503.02628	omegawings: omegacam@vst observations of wings galaxy clusters	the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey (wings) is a wide-fieldmulti-wavelength survey of x-ray selected clusters at z =0.04-0.07. theoriginal 34'x34' wings field-of- view has now been extended to cover a 1 sq.degfield with both photometry and spectroscopy. in this paper we present thejohnson b and v-band omegacam/vst observations of 46 wings clusters, togetherwith the data reduction, data quality and sextractor photometric catalogs.  with a median seeing of 1arcs in both bands, our 25-minutes exposures in eachband typically reach the 50% completeness level at v=23.1 mag. the quality ofthe astrometric and photometric accuracy has been verified by comparison withthe 2mass as well as with sdss astrometry, and sdss and previous wings imaging.star/galaxy separation and sky-subtraction procedure have been tested comparingwith previous wings data.  the sextractor photometric catalogues are publicly available at the cds, andwill be included in the next release of the wings database on the vo togetherwith the omegacam reduced images. these data form the basis for a large ongoingspectroscopic campaign with aaomega/aat and is being employed for a variety ofstudies.

1504.07105	jellyfish galaxy candidates at low redshift	galaxies that are being stripped of their gas can sometimes be recognizedfrom their optical appearance. extreme examples of stripped galaxies are theso-called ``jellyfish galaxies'', that exhibit tentacles of debris materialwith a characteristic jellyfish morphology. we have conducted the firstsystematic search for galaxies that are being stripped of their gas at low-z(z=0.04-0.07) in different environments, selecting galaxies with varyingdegrees of morphological evidence for stripping. we have visually inspected band v-band images and identified 344 candidates in 71 galaxy clusters of theomegawings+wings sample and 75 candidates in groups and lower mass structuresin the pm2gc sample. we present the atlas of stripping candidates and a firstanalysis of their environment and their basic properties, such as morphologies,star formation rates and galaxy stellar masses. candidates are found in allclusters and at all clustercentric radii, and their number does not correlatewith the cluster velocity dispersion sigma or x-ray luminosity l_x.interestingly, convincing cases of candidates are also found in groups andlower mass haloes (10^{11}-10^{14} m_{sun}), although the physical mechanism atwork needs to be securely identified. all the candidates are disky, havestellar masses ranging from log m/m_{sun} &lt; 9 to &gt; 11.5 and the majority ofthem form stars at a rate that is on average a factor of 2 higher (2.5 sigma)compared to non-stripped galaxies of similar mass. the few post-starburst andpassive candidates have weak stripping evidence. we conclude that the strippingphenomenon is ubiquitous in clusters and could be present even in groups andlow mass haloes. further studies will reveal the physics of the gas strippingand clarify the mechanisms at work.

1505.03150	ngc4370: a case study for testing our ability to infer dust distribution  and mass in nearby galaxies	a fraction of the early-type galaxy population hosts a prominent dust lane.methods to quantify the dust content of these systems based on optical imagingdata usually yield dust masses which are an order of magnitude lower than dustmasses derived from the observed fir emission. high-quality optical data fromthe next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) and fir/submm observations fromthe herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) allow us to revisit previous methodsto determine the dust content in galaxies and explore new ones. we aim toderive the dust mass in ngc 4370 from both optical and fir data, andinvestigate the need to invoke a putative diffuse dust component. we createcolor and attenuation maps, which are converted to approximate dust mass mapsbased on simple dust geometries. dust masses are also derived from sed fits tofir/submm observations. finally, inverse radiative transfer fitting isperformed to investigate more complex dust geometries. the empirical methodsapplied to the optical data yield lower limits of 3.4e5 solar masses, an orderof magnitude below the total dust masses derived from sed fitting. in contrast,radiative transfer models yield dust masses which are slightly lower, but fullyconsistent with the fir-derived mass. dust is more likely to be distributed ina ring around the centre of ngc 4370 as opposed to an exponential disc or asimple foreground screen. moreover, using inverse radiative transfer fitting,we are able to constrain most of the parameters describing these geometries.the resulting dust masses are high enough to account for the dust observed atfir/submm wavelengths, so that no diffuse dust component needs to be invoked.we furthermore caution for the interpretation of dust masses and optical depthsbased on optical data alone, using overly simplistic star-dust geometries andthe neglect of scattering effects.

1506.01201	galaxy luminosity functions in wings clusters	using v band photometry of the wings survey, we derive galaxy luminosityfunctions (lf) in nearby clusters. this sample is complete down to mv=-15.15,and it is homogeneous, thus allowing the study of an unbiased sample ofclusters with different characteristics. we constructed the photometric lf for72 out of the original 76 wings clusters, excluding only those without avelocity dispersion estimate. for each cluster we obtained the lf for galaxiesin a region of radius=0.5 x r200, and fitted them with single and doubleschechter's functions. we also derive the composite lf for the entire sample,and those pertaining to different morphological classes. finally we derive thespectroscopic cumulative lf for 2009 galaxies that are cluster members. thedouble schechter fit parameters are neither correlated with the clustervelocity dispersion, nor with the x-ray luminosity. our median values of theschechter's fit slope are, on average, in agreement with measurements of nearbyclusters, but are less steep that those derived from large surveys, such as thesdss. early--type galaxies outnumber late-types at all magnitudes, but bothearly and late types contribute equally to the faint end of the lf. finally,the spectroscopic lf is in excellent agreement with the ones derived for a2199,a85 and virgo, and with the photometric one at the bright magnitudes (whereboth are available). there is a large spread in the lf of different clusters.however, this spread is not caused by correlation of the lf shape with clustercharacteristics such as x--ray luminosity or velocity dispersions. the faintend is flatter than what previously derived (alpha_f=-1.7) at odds with whatpredicted from numerical simulations.

1507.01552	$\textit{herschel}$-atlas:the connection between star formation and agn  activity in radio-loud and radio-quiet active galaxies	we examine the relationship between star formation and agn activity byconstructing matched samples of local ($0&lt;z&lt;0.6$) radio-loud and radio-quietagn in the $\textit{herschel}$-atlas fields. radio-loud agn are classified ashigh-excitation and low-excitation radio galaxies (hergs, lergs) using theiremission lines and $\textit{wise}$ 22-$\mu$m luminosity. agn accretion and jetpowers in these active galaxies are traced by [oiii] emission-line and radioluminosity, respectively. star formation rates (sfrs) and specific starformation rates (ssfrs) were derived using $\textit{herschel}$ 250-$\mu$mluminosity and stellar mass measurements from the sdss$-$mpa-jhu catalogue. inthe past, star formation studies of agn have mostly focused on high-redshiftsources to observe the thermal dust emission that peaks in the far-infrared,which limited the samples to powerful objects. however, with$\textit{herschel}$ we can expand this to low redshifts. our stacking analysesshow that sfrs and ssfrs of both radio-loud and radio-quiet agn increase withincreasing agn power but that radio-loud agn tend to have lower sfr.additionally, radio-quiet agn are found to have approximately an order ofmagnitude higher ssfrs than radio-loud agn for a given level of agn power. thedifference between the star formation properties of radio-loud and -quiet agnis also seen in samples matched in stellar mass.

1509.05413	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s. ix. an x-ray outflow in a luminous  obscured quasar at z~1.6	in active galactic nuclei (agn)-galaxy co-evolution models, agn winds andoutflows are often invoked to explain why super-massive black holes andgalaxies stop growing efficiently at a certain phase of their lives. they arecommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. evidence ofultra-fast (v&gt;0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of agn has beencollected in the past decade by sensitive x-ray observations for sizablesamples of agn, mostly at low redshift. here we present ultra-deep xmm-newtonand chandra spectral data of an obscured (nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsicallyluminous (l2-10kev~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named pid352) at z~1.6 (derivedfrom the x-ray spectral analysis) in the chandra deep field-south. the sourceis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observedenergies of e~2-3 kev. while the emission line is interpreted as being due toneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorptionfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (fexxv, fexxvi) with anoutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionizationmodels. the mass outflow rate - ~2 msun/yr - is similar to the source accretionrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,corresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. pid352 represents oneof the few cases where indications of x-ray outflowing gas have been observedat high redshift thus far. this wind is powerful enough to provide feedback onthe host galaxy.

1511.07430	the bolometric and uv attenuation in normal spiral galaxies of the  herschel reference survey	the dust in nearby galaxies absorbs a fraction of theuv-optical-near-infrared radiation produced by stars. this energy isconsequently re-emitted in the infrared. we investigate the portion of thestellar radiation absorbed by spiral galaxies from the hrs by modelling theiruv-to-submillimetre spectral energy distributions. our models provide anattenuated and intrinsic sed from which we find that on average 32 % of allstarlight is absorbed by dust. we define the uv heating fraction as thepercentage of dust luminosity that comes from absorbed uv photons and find thatthis is 56 %, on average. this percentage varies with morphological type, withlater types having significantly higher uv heating fractions. we find a strongcorrelation between the uv heating fraction and specific star formation rateand provide a power-law fit. our models allow us to revisit the irx-afuvrelations, and derive these quantities directly within a self-consistentframework. we calibrate this relation for different bins of nuv-r colour andprovide simple relations to relate these parameters. we investigated therobustness of our method and we conclude that the derived parameters arereliable within the uncertainties which are inherent to the adopted sed model.this calls for a deeper investigation on how well extinction and attenuationcan be determined through panchromatic sed modelling.

0806.2343	spitzer 24 micron detections of starburst galaxies in abell 851	spitzer-mips 24 micron and ground-based observations of the rich galaxycluster abell 851 at z=0.41 are used to derive star formation rates from themid-ir 24 micron and from [o ii] 3727 emission. many cluster galaxies havesfr(24 um)/sfr([o ii]) &gt;&gt; 1, indicative of star formation highly obscured bydust. we focus on the substantial minority of a851 cluster members where strongbalmer absorption points to a starburst on a 10^{8-9} year timescale. as istypical, a851 galaxies with strong balmer absorption occur in two types: withoptical emission (starforming), and without (post-starburst). our principalresult is the former, so-called e(a) galaxies, are mostly detected (9 out of12) at 24 um -- for these we find typically sfr(24 um)/sfr([o ii]) ~ 4. strongbalmer absorption and high values of sfr(24 um)/sfr([o ii]) both indicatemoderately active starbursts and support the picture that e(a) galaxies are theactive starbursts that feed the post-starburst population. while 24 umdetections are frequent with balmer-strong objects (even 6 out of 18 of thesupposedly "post-starburst'' galaxies are detected) only 2 out of 7 of thecontinuously starforming `e(c)' galaxies (with weak balmer absorption) aredetected -- for them, sfr(24 um)/sfr([o ii]) ~ 1. their optical spectraresemble present-epoch spirals that dominate today's universe; we strengthenthis association by that sfr(24 um)/sfr([o ii]) ~ 1 is the norm today. that is,not just the amount of star formation, but its mode, has evolved strongly fromz ~ 0.4 to the present. by fitting spectrophotometric models we measure thestrength and duration of the bursts to quantify the evolutionary sequence fromactive- to post-starburst, and to harden the evidence that moderately activestarbursts are the defining feature of starforming cluster galaxies at z ~ 0.4.

astro-ph;0511428	revisiting the infrared spectra of active galactic nuclei with a new  torus emission model	we describe improved modelling of the emission by dust in a toroidal--likestructure heated by a central illuminating source within active galactic nuclei(agn). we chose a simple but realistic torus geometry, a flared disc, and adust grain distribution function including a full range of grain sizes. theoptical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking into account thedifferent sublimation temperatures of the silicate and graphite grains, whichsolves previously reported inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature intype-1 agn. we exploit this model to study the spectral energy distributions(seds) of 58 extragalactic (both type-1 and type-2) sources using archivaloptical and infrared (ir) data. we find that both agn and starburstcontributions are often required to reproduce the observed seds, although in afew cases they are very well fitted by a pure agn component. the agncontribution to the far-ir luminosity is found to be higher in type-1 sources,with all the type-2 requiring a substantial contribution from a circum-nuclearstarburst. our results appear in agreement with the agn unified scheme, sincethe distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to becompatible for type-1 and type-2 agn. further support to the unificationconcept comes from comparison with medium-resolution ir spectra of type-1 agnby the spitzer observatory, showing evidence for a moderate silicate emissionaround 10 \mums which our code reproduces. from our analysis we infer accretionflows in the inner nucleus of local agn characterized by high equatorialoptical depths ($a_v\simeq 100$), moderate sizes ($r_{max}&lt;100 pc$) and veryhigh covering factors ($f\simeq 80$ per cent) on average.

astro-ph;0701178	hidden activity in high-redshift spheroidal galaxies from mid-infrared  and x-ray observations in the goods-north field	we exploit very deep mid-ir (mir) and x-ray observations by spitzer andchandra in the goods north to identify signs of hidden (either starburst oragn) activity in spheroidal galaxies between z~0.3 and 1. our reference is acomplete sample of 168 morphologically classified spheroidal galaxies withz[ab]&lt;22.5 selected from goods acs imaging. nineteen of these have 24 microndetections in the goods catalogue, half of which have an x-ray counterpart inthe 2 ms chandra catalogue, while about 25% have 1.4 ghz fluxes larger than 40microjy. traces of hidden activity in the spheroidal population are alsosearched for in the deep x-ray images and 14 additional galaxies are detectedin x-rays only. the nature of the observed mir emissions is investigated bymodelling their seds based on the available multi-wavelength photometry,including x-ray, uv, optical, near-ir, mir and radio fluxes, and opticalspectroscopy. the amount of dust derived from the ir emission observed byspitzer appears in excess of that expected by mass loss from evolved stars. ouranalysis of the x-ray and mir properties leads us to conclude that at least 8of the 19 24-um bright sources should hide an obscured agn, while the x-rayundetected sources are more likely dominated by star formation. [abridged] weconclude that ~30 objects (~20%) of the original flux-limited sample of 168spheroidal galaxies in the goods-north are detected during phases of prominentactivity, of both stellar and quasar origin. due to the short expectedlifetimes of the ir and x-ray emissions, this fraction might imply asignificant level of activity in this class of galaxies during the relativelyrecent cosmic epochs, z~0.3 to z~1, under investigation.
