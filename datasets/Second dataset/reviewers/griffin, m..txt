0910.1094	akari and blast observations of the cassiopeia a supernova remnant and  surrounding interstellar medium	we use new large area far infrared maps ranging from 65 - 500 micronsobtained with the akari and the balloon-borne large aperture submillimetertelescope (blast) missions to characterize the dust emission toward thecassiopeia a supernova remnant (snr). using the akari high resolution data wefind a new "tepid" dust grain population at a temperature of ~35k and with anestimated mass of 0.06 solar masses. this component is confined to the centralarea of the snr and may represent newly-formed dust in the unshocked supernovaejecta. while the mass of tepid dust that we measure is insufficient by itselfto account for the dust observed at high redshift, it does constitute anadditional dust population to contribute to those previously reported. we fitour maps at 65, 90, 140, 250, 350, and 500 microns to obtain maps of the columndensity and temperature of "cold" dust (near 16 k) distributed throughout theregion. the large column density of cold dust associated with clouds seen inmolecular emission extends continuously from the surrounding interstellarmedium to project on the snr, where the foreground component of the clouds isalso detectable through optical, x-ray, and molecular extinction. at theresolution available here, there is no morphological signature to isolate anycold dust associated only with the snr from this confusing interstellaremission. our fit also recovers the previously detected "hot" dust in theremnant, with characteristic temperature 100 k.

0910.3642	the blast 250-micron selected galaxy population in goods-south	we identify and investigate the nature of the 20 brightest 250-micron sourcesdetected by the blast within the central 150 sq. arcmin of the goods-southfield. aided by the available deep vla radio imaging, reaching s_1.4 = 30micro-jy, we have identified radio counterparts for 17/20 of the 250-micronsources. the resulting enhanced positional accuracy of ~1 arcsec has thenallowed us to exploit the deep multi-frequency imaging of goods-south toestablish secure galaxy counterparts for the 17 radio-identified sources, andplausible galaxy candidates for the 3 radio-unidentified sources. confusion isa serious issue for this deep blast 250-micron survey, due to the large size ofthe beam. nevertheless, we argue that our chosen counterparts are significant,and often dominant contributors to the measured blast flux densities. for allof these 20 galaxies we have been able to determine spectroscopic (8) orphotometric (12) redshifts. the result is the first `complete' redshiftdistribution for a deep 250-micron selected galaxy sample. this reveals that250-micron surveys reaching detection limits of ~30 mjy contain not onlylow-redshift spirals/lirgs, but also the extreme z~2 dust-enshrouded starburstgalaxies previously discovered at sub-millimetre wavelengths. based on theirirac colours, we find that virtually all of the blast galaxy identificationsappear better described as analogues of the m82 starburst galaxy, or scstar-forming discs rather than highly obscured ulirgs. inspection of the laboca870-micron imaging of the goods-south field yields detections of 7/11 of thez&gt;1 blast sources, and reveals 250/870 flux-density ratios consistent with astandard 40k modified black-body fit with a dust emissivity index beta=1.5.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1071	herschel and scuba-2 imaging and spectroscopy of a bright, lensed  submillimetre galaxy at z = 2.3	we present a detailed analysis of the far-ir properties of the bright,lensed, z = 2.3, smg, smm j2135-0102, using new observations with herschel,scuba-2 and the vla. these data allow us to constrain the galaxy's sed and showthat it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000um luminosity, l(bol), of (2.3 +/-0.2) x 10^12 l(sun) and a likely sfr of ~400 m(sun)/yr. the galaxy sits on thefar-ir/radio correlation for far-ir-selected galaxies. at ~&gt;70um, the sed canbe described adequately by dust components with t(d) ~ 30 and 60k. usingspire's fourier transform spectrometer we report a detection of the [cii] 158umcooling line. if the [cii], co and far-ir continuum arise in photo-dissociationregions, we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 10^3 cm^-3, and a far-uvradiation field, g_0, 10^3x stronger than the milky way. l([cii])/l(bol) issignificantly higher than in local ulirgs but similar to the values found inlocal star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. this is consistent with smmj2135-0102 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc,evidence that smgs are not simply scaled-up ulirgs. our results show thatspire's fts has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscuredgalaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not becompetitive with ground-based co-line searches. it will, however, allowdetailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as wellas the chemistry of their ism, once more suitably bright candidates have beenfound.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3115	filamentary structures and compact objects in the aquila and polaris  clouds observed by herschel	our pacs and spire images of the aquila rift and part of the polaris flareregions, taken during the science demonstration phase of herschel discoveredfascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physicallyrelated to compact cores. we briefly describe a new multi-scale,multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measuretheir parameters in our herschel images. all of the extracted starless cores(541 in aquila and 302 in polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrowfilaments. with its combination of the far-ir resolution and sensitivity,herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in aquilaand 59 arcsec in polaris (9000 au in both regions). our first results ofobservations with herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores mayoriginate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thinfilaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. to unravel the roles of theprocesses, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;these follow-up observations are planned.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.2039	planck early results: first assessment of the high frequency instrument  in-flight performance	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) is designed to measure thetemperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgroundand galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545and 857 ghz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 ghz), 7' (143 ghz), and 5'(217 ghz and higher). hfi has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 may2009. the bolometers cooled to 100 mk as planned. the settings of the readoutelectronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize hfi's noiseperformance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during groundtesting. observations of mars, jupiter, and saturn verified both the opticalsystem and the time response of the detection chains. the optical beams areclose to predictions from physical optics modeling. the time response of thedetection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. the detectors suffer froman unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. due tothe redundancy of planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percentof data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.the cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation onperiods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of allbolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. only thehigh energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is aprobable source of low frequency noise.

1101.3154	the initial conditions of high-mass star formation: radiative transfer  models of irdcs seen in the herschel hi-gal survey	the densest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) may represent the earliestobservable stage of high-mass star formation. these clouds are very cold, hencethey emit mainly at far-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths. for the first time,herschel has provided multi-wavelength, spatially resolved observations ofcores within irdcs, which, when combined with radiative transfer modelling, canconstrain their properties, such as mass, density profile and dust temperature.we use a 3d, multi-wavelength monte carlo radiative transfer code to model indetail the emission from six cores in three typical irdcs seen in the hi-galsurvey (g030.50+00.95, g031.03+00.26 and g031.03+00.76), and thereby todetermine the properties of these cores and compare them with their low-massequivalents. we found masses ranging from 90 to 290 solar masses withtemperatures from 8 to 11k at the centre of each core and 18 to 28k at thesurface. the maximum luminosity of an embedded star within each core wascalculated, and we rule out the possibility of significant high mass starformation having yet occurred in three of our cores.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1103.0201	characterizing interstellar filaments with herschel in ic5146	we provide a first look at the results of the herschel gould belt surveytoward the ic5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of thefilamentary structure in this region. the column density map, derived from our70-500 micron herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, andconfirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. weanalyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that theunderlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at largeradii. our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by anarrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, whichis in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central jeans lengths.this characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 tothe sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffusegas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of thedissipation of large-scale turbulence.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1203.6472	cluster-formation in the rosette molecular cloud at the junctions of  filaments	for many years feedback processes generated by ob-stars in molecular clouds,including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or uv-radiation, havebeen proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. however, hydrodynamicmodels including radiation and gravity show that uv-illumination has little orno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. the rosette molecularcloud, irradiated by the ngc2244 cluster, is a template region for triggeredstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure byapplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (disperse), andprobability density functions (pdfs) on herschel column density maps, obtainedwithin the hobys key program. the analysis reveals not only the filamentarystructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lieat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. the pdfs ofsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. the two uv-exposedregions have a double-peaked pdf we interprete as caused by shock compression.the deviations of the pdf from the log-normal shape typically associated withlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, arefound here within the very same cloud. this shows that there is no fundamentaldifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.we conclude that star-formation in rosette - and probably in high-massstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact ofuv-radiation. moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose fromthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced inthe direct interaction zone between an expanding hii--region and the molecularcloud.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1211.6360	herschel view of the taurus b211/3 filament and striations: evidence of  filamentary growth?	we present first results from the herschel gould belt survey for theb211/l1495 region in the taurus molecular cloud. thanks to their highsensitivity and dynamic range, the herschel images reveal the structure of thedense, star-forming filament b211 with unprecedented detail, along with thepresence of striations perpendicular to the filament and generally orientedalong the magnetic field direction as traced by optical polarization vectors.based on the column density and dust temperature maps derived from the herscheldata, we find that the radial density profile of the b211 filament approaches apower-law behavior {\rho} {\propto} r^(-2.0{\pm}0.4) at large radii and thatthe temperature profile exhibits a marked drop at small radii. the observeddensity and temperature profiles of the b211 filament are in good agreementwith a theoretical model of a cylindrical filament undergoing gravitationalcontraction with a polytropic equation of state: p {\propto} {\rho}^{\gamma}and t {\propto} {\rho}^({\gamma}-1), with {\gamma}=0.97{\pm}0.01&lt;1 (i.e. notstrictly isothermal). the morphology of the column density map, where some ofthe perpendicular striations are apparently connected to the b211 filament,further suggests that the material may be accreting along the striations ontothe main filament. the typical velocities expected for the infalling materialin this picture are ~0.5-1 km/s, which are consistent with the existingkinematical constraints from previous co observations.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1303.6725	hermes: a deficit in the surface brightness of the cosmic infrared  background due to galaxy cluster gravitational lensing	we have observed four massive galaxy clusters with the spire instrument onthe herschel space observatory and measure a deficit of surface brightnesswithin their central region after subtracting sources. we simulate the effectsof instrumental sensitivity and resolution, the source population, and thelensing effect of the clusters to estimate the shape and amplitude of thedeficit. the amplitude of the central deficit is a strong function of thesurface density and flux distribution of the background sources. we find thatfor the current best fitting faint end number counts, and excellent lensingmodels, the most likely amplitude of the central deficit is the full intensityof the cosmic infrared background (cib). our measurement leads to a lower limitto the integrated total intensity of the cib of i(250 microns) &gt;0.69_(-0.03)^(+0.03) (stat.)_(-0.06)^(+0.11) (sys.) mjy/sr, with more cibpossible from both low-redshift sources and from sources within the targetclusters. it should be possible to observe this effect in existing high angularresolution data at other wavelengths where the cib is bright, which would allowtests of models of the faint source component of the cib.

1304.0327	what determines the density structure of molecular clouds ? a case study  of orion b with herschel	a key parameter to the description of all star formation processes is thedensity structure of the gas. in this letter, we make use of probabilitydistribution functions (pdfs) of herschel column density maps of orion b,aquila, and polaris, obtained with the herschel gould belt survey (hgbs). weaim to understand which physical processes influence the pdf shape, and withwhich signatures. the pdfs of orion b (aquila) show a lognormal distributionfor low column densities until av 3 (6), and a power-law tail for high columndensities, consistent with a rho r^-2 profile for the equivalent sphericaldensity distribution. the pdf of orion b is broadened by external compressiondue to the nearby ob stellar aggregates. the pdf of a quiescent subregion ofthe non-star-forming polaris cloud is nearly lognormal, indicating thatsupersonic turbulence governs the density distribution. but we also observe adeviation from the lognormal shape at av&gt;1 for a subregion in polaris thatincludes a prominent filament. we conclude that (i) the point where the pdfdeviates from the lognormal form does not trace a universal av-threshold forstar formation, (ii) statistical density fluctuations, intermittency andmagnetic fields can cause excess from the lognormal pdf at an early cloudformation stage, (iii) core formation and/or global collapse of filaments and anon-isothermal gas distribution lead to a power-law tail, and (iv) externalcompression broadens the column density pdf, consistent with numericalsimulations.
