0905.2908	diffuse x-ray emission in globular cluster cores	the unresolved x-ray emission in the cores of 10 globular clusters hostingmillisecond pulsars is investigated. subtraction of the known resolved pointsources leads to detectable levels of unresolved emission in the core region ofm28, ngc 6440, m62, and ngc 6752. the x-ray luminosities in the 0.3-8 kevenergy band of this emission component were found to lie in the range $\sim 1.5\times 10^{31}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (ngc 6752) to $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{32}$ ergss$^{-1}$ (m28). the lowest limiting luminosity for x-ray source detectionsamongst these four clusters was $1.1 \times 10^{30}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ for ngc6752. the spectrum of the unresolved emission can be fit equally well by apower-law, a thermal bremsstrahlung model, a black body plus power-law, or athermal bremsstrahlung model plus black body component. the unresolved emissionis considered to arise from the cumulative contribution of active binaries,cataclysmic variables, and faint millisecond pulsars with their associatedpulsar wind nebulae. in examining the available x-ray data, no evidence for anypulsar wind nebular emission in globular clusters is found. it is shown thatthe x-ray luminosity contribution of a faint source population based on anextrapolation of the luminosity function of detected point sources iscompatible with the unresolved x-ray emission in the cores of ngc 6440 and ngc6752. adopting the same slope for the luminosity function for m62 as for ngc6440 and ngc 6752 leads to a similar result for m62. for m28, the contributionfrom faint sources in the core can attain a level comparable with the observedvalue if a steeper slope is adopted. the characteristics on the faint sourcepopulation as constrained by the properties of the unresolved x-ray emissionare briefly discussed.

0910.3725	application of the disk evaporation model to agns	the disk corona evaporation model extensively developed for theinterpretation of observational features of black hole x-ray binaries (bhxrbs)is applied to agns. since the evaporation of gas in the disk can lead to itstruncation for accretion rates less than a maximal evaporation rate, the modelcan naturally account for the soft spectrum in high luminosity agns and thehard spectrum in low luminosity agns. the existence of two different luminositylevels describing transitions from the soft to hard state and from the hard tosoft state in bhxrbs, when applied to agns, suggests that agns can be in eitherspectral state within a range of luminosities. for example, at a viscosityparameter, \alpha, equal to 0.3, the eddington ratio from the hard to softtransition and from the soft to hard transition occurs at 0.027 and 0.005respectively. when the eddington ratio of the agn lies below the critical valuecorresponding to its evolutionary state, the disk is truncated. with decreasingeddington ratios, the inner edge of the disk increases to greater distancesfrom the black hole with a concomitant increase in the inner radius of thebroad line region, $r_{blr}$. the absence of an optically thick inner disk atlow luminosities gives rise to region in the size of borad line-luminosityplane for which the relation $r_{blr} \propto l^{1/2}$ inferred at highluminosities is excluded. as a result, a lower limit to the accretion rate ispredicted for the observability of broad emission lines, if the broad lineregion is associated with an optically thick accretion disk. thus, true seyfert2 galaxies may exist at very low accretion rates/luminosities. the differencesbetween bhxrbs and agns in the framework of the disk corona model are discussedand possible modifications to the model are briefly suggested.

0708.0220	the thermal evolution of the donors in am cvn binaries	(abridged) we calculate the full stellar-structural evolution of donors in amcvn systems formed through the wd channel coupled to the binary's evolution.contrary to assumptions made in prior modelling, these donors are not fullyconvective over much of the am cvn phase and do not evolve adiabatically undermass loss indefinitely. instead, we identify three distinct phases ofevolution: a mass transfer turn-on phase (during which the orbital periodcontinues to decrease even after contact, the donor contracts, and the masstransfer rate accelerates to its maximum), a phase in which the donor expandsadiabatically in response to mass loss, and a cooling phase beginning atorbital periods of approximately 45--55 minutes during which the donorcontracts. the physics that determines the behaviour in the first and thirdphases, both of which are new outcomes of this study, are discussed in somedetail. we find the overall duration of the turn-on phase to be between $\sim10^4$-$10^6$ yrs, significantly longer than prior estimates. we predict thedonor's luminosity and effective temperature. during the adiabatic expansionphase (ignoring irradiation effects), the luminosity is approximately$10^{-6}$--$10^{-4} l_\odot$ and the effective temperature is approximately1000--1800 k. however, the flux generated in the accretion flow dominates thedonor's intrinsic light at all times. the impact of irradiation on the donorextends the phase of adiabatic expansion to longer orbital periods and altersthe donor's observational characteristics. irradiated donors during theadiabatic phase can attain a surface luminosity of up to $\approx10^{-2}l_\odot$. we argue that the turn-on and cooling phases both will leavesignificant imprints on the am cvn population's orbital period distribution.

1004.0288	impact of type ia supernova ejecta on a helium-star binary companion	the impact of type ia supernova ejecta on a helium-star companion isinvestigated via high-resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. fora range of helium-star models and initial binary separations it is found thatthe mass unbound in the interaction, $\delta m_{\rm ub}$, is related to theinitial binary separation, $a$, by a power law of the form $\delta m_{\rm ub}\propto a^{m}$. this power-law index is found to vary from -3.1 to -4.0,depending on the mass of the helium star. the small range of this indexbrackets values found previously for hydrogen-rich companions, suggesting thatthe dependence of the unbound mass on orbital separation is not stronglysensitive to the nature of the binary companion. the kick velocity is alsorelated to the initial binary separation by a power law with an index in arange from -2.7 to -3.3, but the power-law index differs from those found inprevious studies for hydrogen-rich companions. the space motion of thecompanion after the supernova is dominated by its orbital velocity in thepre-supernova binary system. the level of ni/fe contamination of the companionresulting from the passage of the supernova ejecta is difficult to estimate,but an upper limit on the mass of bound nickel is found to be $\sim 5\times10^{-4}\ m_\odot$.

1007.1036	adiabatic mass loss and the outcome of the common envelope phase of  binary evolution	we have developed a new method for calculating common envelope (ce) eventsbased on explicit consideration of the donor star's structural response toadiabatic mass loss. in contrast to existing ce prescriptions, which specify apriori the donor's remnant mass, we determine this quantity self-consistentlyand find it depends on binary and ce parameters. this aspect of our model isparticularly important to realistic modeling for upper main sequence stardonors without strongly degenerate cores (and hence without a clearcore/envelope boundary). we illustrate the central features of our method byconsidering ce events involving 10 solar mass donors on or before their redgiant branch. for such donors, the remnant core mass can be as much as 30%larger than the star's he-core mass. applied across a population of suchbinaries, our methodology results in a significantly broader remnant mass andfinal orbital separation distribution and a 20% increase in ce survival ratesas compared to previous prescriptions for the ce phase.

1007.4545	population synthesis of common envelope mergers: i. giant stars with  stellar or substellar companions	using a population synthesis technique, we have calculated detailed models ofthe present-day field population of objects that have resulted from the mergerof a giant primary and a main-sequence or brown dwarf secondary duringcommon-envelope evolution. we used a grid of 116 stellar and 32 low-mass/browndwarf models, a crude model of the merger process, and followed the angularmomentum evolution of the binary orbit and the primary's rotation prior tomerger, as well as the merged object's rotation after the merger. we find thatpresent-day merged objects that are observable as giant stars or core-heliumburning stars in our model population constitute between 0.24% and 0.33% of theinitial population of zams binaries, depending upon the input parameterschosen. the median projected rotational velocity of these merged objects is ~16km/sec, an order of magnitude higher than the median projected rotationalvelocity in a model population of normal single stars calculated using the samestellar models and initial mass function. the masses of the merged objects aretypically less than ~2 solar masses, with a median mass of 1.28 solar masses,which is slightly more than, but not significantly different from, their normalsingle star counterparts. the luminosities in our merged object populationrange from ~10-100 solar luminosities, with a strong peak in the luminositydistribution at ~60 solar luminosities, since the majority of the mergedobjects (57%) lie on the horizontal branch at the present epoch. the results ofour population synthesis study are discussed in terms of possible observationalcounterparts either directly involving the high rotational velocity of themerger product or indirectly, via the effect of rotation on envelope abundancesand on the amount and distribution of circumstellar matter.

1010.0638	masses and envelope binding energies of primary stars at the onset of a  common envelope	we present basic properties of primary stars that initiate a common envelope(ce) in a binary, while on the giant branch. we use the population-synthesiscode described in politano et al.

0709.0143	the existence of inner cool disks in the low hard state of accreting  black holes	the condensation of matter from a corona to a cool, optically thick innerdisk is investigated for black hole x-ray transient systems in the low hardstate. a description of a simple model for the exchange of energy and massbetween corona and disk originating from thermal conduction is presented,taking into account the effect of compton cooling of the corona by photons fromthe underlying disk. it is found that a weak, condensation-fed inner disk canbe present in the low hard state of black hole transient systems for a range ofluminosities which depend on the magnitude of the viscosity parameter. for$\alpha \sim 0.1-0.4$ an inner disk can exist for luminosities in the range$\sim 0.001- 0.02$ eddington value. the model is applied to the x-rayobservations of the black hole candidate sources gx 339-4 and swiftj1753.5-0127 in their low hard state. it is found that compton cooling isimportant in the condensation process, leading to the maintenance of cool innerdisks in both systems. as the results of the evaporation/condensation model areindependent of the black hole mass, it is suggested that such inner cool disksmay contribute to the optical and ultraviolet emission of low luminosity activegalactic nuclei.

1011.2580	the effect of coronal radiation on a residual inner disk in the low/hard  spectral state of black hole x-ray binary systems	thermal conduction between a cool accretion disk and a hot inner corona canresult in either evaporation of the disk or condensation of the hot corona. atlow mass accretion rates, evaporation dominates and can completely remove theinner disk. at higher mass accretion rates, condensation becomes more efficientin the very inner regions, so that part of the mass accretes via a weak(initially formed) inner disk which is separated from the outer disk by a fullyevaporated region at mid radii. at still higher mass accretion rates,condensation dominates everywhere, so there is a continuous cool disk extendingto the innermost stable circular orbit. we extend these calculations byincluding the effect of irradiation by the hot corona on the disk structure.the flux which is not reflected is reprocessed in the disk, adding to theintrinsic thermal emission from gravitational energy release. this increasesthe seed photons for compton cooling of the hot corona, enhancing condensationof the hot flow and re-inforcing the residual inner disk rather thanevaporating it. our calculations confirm that a residual inner disk canco-exist with a hard, coronally dominated, spectrum over a range of $0.006&lt;\dotm&lt;0.016$ (for $\alpha=0.2$). this provides an explanation for the weak thermalcomponent seen recently in the low/hard state of black hole x-ray binarysystems.

1110.1288	probing substellar companions of agb stars through spirals and arcs	recent observations of strikingly well-defined spirals in the circumstellarenvelopes of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars point to the existence ofbinary companions in these objects. in the case of planet or brown dwarf masscompanions, we investigate the observational properties of the spiral-onionshell wakes due to the gravitational interaction of these companions with theoutflowing circumstellar matter. three dimensional hydrodynamical simulationsat high resolution show that the substellar mass objects produce detectablesignatures at 100 au distance, for the wake induced by a jupiter to brown dwarfmass object orbiting a solar mass agb star. in particular, the arm patternpropagates with a speed depending on the local wind and sound speeds, implyingpossible variations in the arm separation in the wind acceleration regionand/or in a slow wind with significant temperature variation. the patternpropagation speeds of the inner and outer boundaries differ by twice the soundspeed, leading to the overlap of high density boundaries in slow winds andproducing a subpattern of the spiral arm feature. vertically, the wake formsconcentric arcs with angular sizes anticorrelated to the wind mach number. weprovide an empirical formula for the peak density enhancement as a function ofthe mass, orbital distance, and velocity of the object as well as the wind andlocal sound speeds. in typical condition of agb envelopes, the arm-interarmdensity contrast can be greater than 30 % of the background density within adistance of ~10(m_p/m_j) au for the object mass m_p in units of jupiter massm_j. these results suggest that such features may probe unseen substellar massobjects embedded in the winds of agb stars and may be useful in planning futurehigh sensitivity/resolution observations with alma.

1209.4961	disk corona interaction: mechanism for the disk truncation and spectrum  change in low luminosity agn	the truncation of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk isinvestigated in the context of low luminosity agn (llagn). we generalize thedisk evaporation model used in the interpretative framework of black hole x-raybinaries by including the effect of a magnetic field in accretion diskssurrounding supermassive black holes. the critical transition mass accretionrate for which the disk is truncated is found to be insensitive to magneticeffects, but its inclusion leads to a smaller truncation radius in comparisonto a model without its consideration. that is, a thin viscous disk is truncatedfor llagn at an eddington ratio less than 0.03 for a standard viscosityparameter ($\alpha = 0.3$). an increase of the viscosity parameter results in ahigher critical transition mass accretion rate and a correspondingly smallertruncation distance, the latter accentuated by greater magnetic energydensities in the disk. based on these results, the truncation radii inferredfrom spectral fits of llagn published in the literature are consistent with thedisk evaporation model. the infrared emission arising from the truncatedgeometrically thin accretion disks may be responsible for the red bump seen insuch llagn.

1306.5881	constraints on the viscosity and magnetic field in hot accretion flows  around black holes	the magnitude of the viscosity and magnetic field parameters in hot accretionflows is investigated in low luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns).theoretical studies show that a geometrically thin, optically thick disk istruncated at mass accretion rates less than a critical value by mass evaporatedvertically from the disk to the corona, with the truncated region replaced byan advection dominated accretion flow (adaf). the critical accretion rate forsuch a truncation is a function of the viscosity and magnetic field.observations of x-ray photon indices and spectral fits of a number of llagnspublished in the literature provide an estimate of the critical rate of massaccretion and the truncation radius respectively. by comparing theobservational results with theoretical predictions, the viscosity and magneticfield parameters in the hot accretion flow region are estimated. specifically,the mass accretion rates inferred in different sources constrain the viscosityparameter, whereas the truncation radii of the disk, as inferred from spectralfits, further constrain the magnetic field parameter. it is found that thevalue of the viscosity parameter in the corona/adaf ranges from 0.17 to 0.5,with values clustered about 0.2-0.3. magnetic pressure is required by therelatively small truncation radii for some llagns and is found to be as high asits equipartition value with the gas pressure. the inferred values of theviscosity parameter are in agreement with those obtained from the observationsof non-stationary accretion in stellar mass black hole x-ray transients. thisconsistency provides support for the paradigm that a geometrically thin disk istruncated by means of a mass evaporation process from the disk to the corona atlow mass accretion rates.

1510.03916	high-resolution co observation of the carbon star cit 6 revealing the  spiral structure and a nascent bipolar outflow	cit 6 is a carbon star in the transitional phase from the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) to the protoplanetary nebulae (ppn). observational evidences oftwo point sources in the optical, circumstellar arc segments in an hc$_3$n lineemission, and a bipolar nebula in near-infrared provide strong support for thepresence of a binary companion. hence, cit 6 is very attractive for studyingthe role of companions in the agb-ppn transition. we have carried out highresolution $^{12}$co $j=2-1$ and $^{13}$co $j=2-1$ observations of cit 6 withthe submillimeter array combined with the submillimeter telescope (single-dish)data. the $^{12}$co channel maps reveal a spiral-shell pattern connecting thehc$_3$n segments in a continuous form, and an asymmetric outflow correspondingto the near-infrared bipolar nebula. rotation of the $^{12}$co channel peakposition may be related to the inner spiral winding and/or the bipolar outflow.an eccentric orbit binary is suggested for the presences of an anisotropic massloss to the west and a double spiral pattern. the lack of interarm emission tothe west may indicate a feature corresponding to the periastron passage of ahighly eccentric orbit of the binary. spatially-averaged radial and spectralprofiles of $^{12}$co $j=2-1$ and $^{13}$co $j=2-1$ are compared with simplespherical radiative transfer models, suggesting a change of $^{12}$co/$^{13}$coabundance ratio from $\sim30$ to $\sim50$ inward in the cse of cit 6. themillimeter continuum emission is decomposed into extended dust thermal emission(spectral index $\sim-2.4$) and compact emission from radio photosphere(spectral index $\sim-2.0$).

0807.3402	on the properties of inner cool disks in the hard state of black hole  x-ray transient systems	the formation of a cool disk in the innermost regions of black hole x-raytransient systems in the low hard state is investigated. taking into accountthe combined cooling associated with the compton and conductive energytransport processes in a corona, the radial structure of a disk is describedfor a range of mass accretion rates. the mass flow in an optically thick innerregion can be maintained by the condensation of matter from a corona with thedisk temperature and luminosity varying continuously as a function of theaccretion rate. although such a disk component can be present, the contributionof the optically thick disk component to the total luminosity can be smallsince the mass flow due to condensation in the optically thick disk underlyingthe corona can be significantly less than the mass flow rate in the corona. themodel is applied to the observations of the low quiescent state of the blackhole source gx 339-4 at luminosities of around $0.01 l_{edd}$ and is able toexplain the temperature of the thermal component at the observed luminosities.since conductive cooling dominates compton cooling at low mass accretion rates,the luminosity corresponding to the critical mass accretion rate above which aweak thermal disk component can be present in the low hard state is estimatedto be as low as $0.001 l_{edd}$.

astro-ph;0011503	hydrodynamical winds from two-temperature plasma in x-ray binaries	hydrodynamical winds from a spherical two-temperature plasma surrounding acompact object are constructed. the mass-loss rate is computed as a function ofelectron temperature, optical depth and luminosity of the sphere, the values ofwhich can be constrained by the fitting of the spectral energy distributionsfor known x-ray binary systems. the sensitive dependence of the mass loss ratewith these parameters leads to the identification of two distinct regions inthe parameter space separating wind-dominated from non wind dominated systems.a critical optical depth, tau_c, as a function of luminosity and electrontemperature, is defined which differentiates these two regions. systems withoptical depths significantly smaller than tau_c are wind-dominated.  the results are applied to black hole candidate x-ray binary systems in thehard spectral state (cyg x-1, gx 339-4 and nova muscae), and it is found thatthe inferred optical depth (tau) is similar to tau_c suggesting that they arewind regulated systems. on the other hand, for x-ray binary systems containinga neutron star (e.g., cyg x-2) tau is much larger than tau_c indicating theabsence of significant hydrodynamical winds.

astro-ph;0102119	the influence of hydrodynamical winds on hot accretion disk solutions	the effect of a possible hydrodynamical wind on the nature of hot accretiondisk solutions is studied. it is found that the advection dominated branch, inthe presence of a wind, maintains the self-similar solution for the diskstructure with the temperature, $\theta \propto 1/r$, optical depth $\tau\propto r^{p-1/2}$ and accretion rate $\dot m \propto r^p$. based on globalsolutions, cooling due to wind energy loss and advection are found to beequally important. for a wide range of viscosity and wind parameters, thetemperature is about one-tenth of the virial value and $p \approx 0.9$,independent of the mass accretion rate and radius. in the context of cooling byunsaturated comptonization of soft photons, solutions also exist whereradiative cooling, advection, and wind cooling are important. in this case,wind regulated solutions are possible. here, the radial dependence of thecritical mass accretion rate above which solutions do not exist is unchangedfrom those solutions without winds. the wind/advection dominated solutions arelocally unstable to a new type of instability called ``wind driven insbility''where the presence of a wind causes the disk to be unstable to long wavelengthperturbations of the surface density. the growth rate of this instability isinversely proportional to the ratio of the radiative cooling to thegravitational energy dissipation rates and it can grow on a timescale muchlonger than the viscous timescale in the disk for sufficiently small radiativecooling efficiencies.

astro-ph;0307492	galactic populations of ultracompact binaries	recent rxte and chandra discoveries of low mass x-ray binaries withultra-short orbital periods have initiated theoretical work on the origins ofthese peculiar systems. using the startrack population synthesis code theformation and evolution of x-ray ultracompact binaries (ucbs) in the galacticfield are analyzed. the relative number of ucbs with a neutron star or a blackhole accretor populating our galaxy is predicted. our results demonstrate thatstandard evolutionary scenarios involving primordial binaries can be sufficientto produce the ucbs in the galactic field without requiring additionalprocesses associated with the dense stellar environments in the cores ofglobular clusters. in contrast to previous studies we find that the majority ofthe immediate progenitors of these systems consist of a hydrogen exhausteddonor with an onemg white dwarf. the evolution of these systems leads to theaccretion induced collapse of the white dwarf to a neutron star, which can playan important role in the formation of a majority of galactic ucbs. we predictthat with an increase in the number of x-ray active ucbs hosting neutron starsby an order of magnitude, a system with a black hole accretor may be found.

astro-ph;0308222	on the origin of x-ray emission from millisecond pulsars in 47 tuc	the observed spectra and x-ray luminosities of millisecond pulsars in 47 tuccan be interpreted in the context of theoretical models based on strong, smallscale multipole fields on the neutron star surface. for multipole fields thatare relatively strong as compared to the large scale dipole field, the emittedx-rays are thermal and likely result from polar cap heating associated with thereturn current from the polar gap. on the other hand, for weak multipolefields, the emission is nonthermal and results from synchrotron radiation of$e^{\pm}$ pairs created by curvature radiation. the x-ray luminosity, $l_x$, isrelated to the spin down power, $l_{sd}$, expressed in the form $l_x \proptol^{\beta}_{sd}$ with $\beta \sim 0.5$ and $\sim 1$ for strong and weakmultipole fields respectively. if the polar cap size is of the order of thelength scale of the multipole field, $s$ and $\beta \sim 0.5$, the polar captemperature is $\sim 3 \times 10^6 k (\frac{l_{sd}}{10^{34}erg s^{-1}})^{1/8}(\frac{s}{3\times 10^4 cm})^{-1/2}$.  a comparison of the x-ray properties of millisecond pulsars in globularclusters and in the galactic field suggests that the emergence of relativelystrong small scale multipole fields from the neutron star interior may becorrelated with the age and evolutionary history of the underlying neutronstar.

astro-ph;0308361	magnetic braking revisited	we present a description for the angular momentum loss rate due to magneticbraking for late type stars taking into account recent observational data onthe relationship between stellar activity and rotation. the analysis is basedon an idealized two component coronal model subject to constraints imposed onthe variation of the coronal gas density with rotation period inferred from theobserved variation of x-ray luminosity, l_x, with rotation rate, omega, (l_x\propto omega^2) for single rotating dwarfs. an application of the model tohigh rotation rates leads to a gradual turnover of the x-ray luminosity whichis similar to the saturation recently observed in rapidly rotating dwarfs. theresulting angular momentum loss rate, \dot j, depends on omega in the form \dotj \propto omega^beta where beta ~ 3 for slow rotators and ~ 1.3 for fastrotators. the relation at high rotation rates significantly differs from thepower law exponent for slowly rotating stars, depressing the angular momentumloss rate without necessarily requiring the saturation of the magnetic field.the application of this model to the evolution of cataclysmic variable binarysystems leads to mass transfer rates that are in approximate accord with thoseobserved in comparison to rates based on either a skumanich law or an empiricallaw based on beta=1.

astro-ph;0311287	on the chandra x-ray sources in the galactic center	recent deep chandra surveys of the galactic center region have revealed theexistence of a faint, hard x-ray source population. while the nature of thispopulation is unknown, it is likely that several types of stellar objectscontribute. for sources involving binary systems, accreting white dwarfs andaccreting neutron stars with main sequence companions have been proposed. amongthe accreting neutron star systems, previous studies have focused on stellarwind-fed sources. in this paper, we point out that binary systems in which masstransfer occurs via roche lobe overflow (rlof) can also contribute to thisx-ray source population.  a binary population synthesis study of the galactic center region has beencarried out, and it is found that evolutionary channels for neutron starformation involving the accretion induced collapse of a massive onemg whitedwarf, in addition to the core collapse of massive stars, can contribute tothis population. the rlof systems would appear as transients with quiescentluminosities, above 2 kev, in the range from 10^31-10^32 ergs/s. the resultsreveal that rlof systems primarily contribute to the faint x-ray sourcepopulation in the muno et al. (2003) survey and wind-fed systems can contributeto the less sensitive wang et al.

astro-ph;0509279	hot one-temperature accretion flows revisited	the effectiveness of the thermal coupling of ions and electrons in thecontext of optically thin, hot accretion flows is investigated. in the limit ofcomplete coupling, we focus on the one-temperature accretion flows. based on aglobal analysis, the results are compared with two-temperature accretion flowmodels and with the observations of black hole sources. many features are quitesimilar. that is, hot one-temperature solutions are found to exist for massflow rates less than a critical value; i.e., $\dot{m}\la 10\alpha^2\dot{m}_{\rmedd}$, where $\dot{m}_{\rm edd}= l_{\rm edd}/c^2$ is the eddington accretionrate. at low mass flow rates, $\dot{m}\la 10^{-3}\alpha^2 \dot{m}_{\rm edd}$,the solution is in the advection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) regime. but athigher rates, radiative cooling is effective and is mainly balanced byadvective {\em heating}, placing the solution in the regime of luminous hotaccretion flow (lhaf). to test the viability of the one-temperature models, wehave fitted the spectra of the two black hole sources, sgr a* and xtej1118+480, which have been examined successfully with two-temperature models.it is found that the one-temperature models do not provide acceptable fits tothe multi-wavelength spectra of sgr a* nor to xte j1118+480 as a result of thehigher temperatures characteristic of the one-temperature models. it isconcluded that the thermal coupling of ions and electrons cannot be fullyeffective and that a two-temperature description is required in hot accretionflow solutions.

astro-ph;0602609	pulsar wind nebulae and the non-thermal x-ray emission of millisecond  pulsars	the non-thermal, non-pulsed x-ray emission of msps is investigated. as inyoung pulsars, msps emit a relativistic wind, which interacting with theinterstellar medium and/or a binary companion can significantly contribute tothe non-pulsed emission of these pulsars. an application and extension of asimple model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old recycled mspb1957+20. it is found that the pulsar wind can, indeed, contribute to both theresolved and unresolved x-ray emission. for other msp in the galactic fieldwhere the spectral index of the non-pulsed component has been measured (i.e.,psr b1937+21, j0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar wind to the non-pulsedx-ray luminosity is estimated. for the msps in the core regions of globularclusters, the pulsar wind nebula is likely affected by its interaction with thedense stellar environment, possibly leading to a diminished contribution to thetotal x-ray emission. in this case, the existence of non-thermal non-pulsedx-ray emission is more likely for binary rather than isolated msps with theemission arising from the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind with abinary companion. our study suggests that the magnetization parameter in thepulsar wind nebulae of msps is significantly larger than that of the crabnebula by about a factor of 10. the emission from msps moving at highvelocities may appear spatially extended with a tail-like morphology, which maycontribute to the faint filamentary x-ray source subpopulation in the galaxy.

astro-ph;0612032	on the rarity of double black hole binaries: consequences for  gravitational-wave detection	double black hole binaries are among the most important sources ofgravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such as ligo or virgo. evenif formed with lower efficiency than double neutron star binaries, they coulddominate the predicted detection rates, since black holes are more massive thanneutron stars and therefore could be detected at greater distances. here wediscuss an evolutionary process that can very significantly limit the formationof close double black hole binaries: the vast majority of their potentialprogenitors undergo a common envelope (ce) phase while the donor, one of themassive binary components, is evolving through the hertzsprung gap. our latesttheoretical understanding of the ce process suggests that this will probablylead to a merger, inhibiting double black hole formation. barring uncertaintiesin the physics of ce evolution, we use population synthesis calculations, andfind that the corresponding reduction in the merger rate of double black holesformed in galactic fields is so great (by ~500) that their contribution toinspiral detection rates for ground-based detectors could become relativelysmall (1 in 10) compared to double neutron star binaries. a similar processalso reduces the merger rates for double neutron stars, by factor of ~5,eliminating most of the previously predicted ultracompact ns-ns systems. ourpredicted detection rates for advanced ligo are now much lower for double blackholes (~2/yr), but are still quite high for double neutron stars (~20/yr). ifdouble black holes were found to be dominant in the detected inspiral signals,this could indicate that they mainly originate from dense star clusters (notincluded here) or that our theoretical understanding of the ce phase requiressignificant revision.

astro-ph;9612128	the pattern of correlated x-ray timing and spectral behavior in grs  1915+105	from data obtained from the pca in the 2-11 kev and 11-30.5 kev energy range,grs 1915+105 is seen during rxte observations between 1996 may and october ontwo separate branches in a hardness intensity diagram. on the hard branch, grs1915+105 exhibits narrow quasi-periodic oscillations ranging from 0.5 to 6 hzwith ${\delta \nu \over \nu} \sim 0.2$. the qpos are observed over intensitiesranging from about 6,000 to 20,000 counts s$^{-1}$ in the 2 - 12.5 kev energyband, indicating a strong dependence on source intensity. strong harmonics areseen, especially, at lower frequencies. as the qpo frequency increases, theharmonic feature weakens and disappears. on the soft branch, narrow qpos areabsent and the low frequency component of the power density spectrum isapproximated by a power-law, with index $\sim -1.25$ for low count rates and$\sim -1.5$ for high count rates ($\gta 18000$ cts/s). occasionally, a broadpeaked feature in the 1-6 hz frequency range is also observed on this branch.the source was probably in the very high state similar to those of other blackhole candidates. thermal-viscous instabilities in accretion disk models do notpredict the correlation of the narrow qpo frequency and luminosity unless thefraction of luminosity from the disk decreases with the total luminosity.

astro-ph;9801230	double core evolution x. through the envelope ejection phase	the evolution of binary systems consisting of an asymptotic giant branch starof mass equal to 3 m_sun or 5 m_sun, and a main sequence star of mass equal to0.4 m_sun or 0.6 m_sun with orbital periods &gt; 200 days has been followed fromthe onset through the late stages of the common envelope phase. using a nestedgrid technique, the three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of anasymptotic giant branch star with radii approximately 1 a.u. indicate that asignificant fraction of the envelope gas is unbound (about 31% and 23% forbinaries of 3 m_sun and 0.4 m_sun, and 5 m_sun and 0.6 m_sun respectively) bythe ends of the simulations, and that the efficiency of the mass ejectionprocess is about 40%. while the original volume of the giant is virtuallyevacuated in the late stages, most of the envelope gas remains marginally boundon the grid. at the ends of our simulations, when the orbital decay timescaleexceeds about 5 years, the giant core and companion orbit one another with aperiod of about 1 day (2.4 days for a binary involving a more evolved giant),although this is an upper limit to the final orbital period. for a binary of 5m_sun and 0.4 m_sun, the common envelope may not be completely ejected.

astro-ph;9901050	variable-frequency qpos from the galactic microquasar grs 1915+105	we show that the galactic microquasar grs 1915+105 exhibits quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos) whose frequency varies continuously from 1-15 hz, duringspectrally hard dips when the source is in a flaring state. we report hereanalyses of simultaneous energy spectra and power density spectra at 4 sintervals. the energy spectrum is well fit at each time step by an opticallythick accretion disk plus power law model, while the power density spectrumconsists of a varying red noise component plus the variable frequency qpo. thefeatures of both spectra are strongly correlated with one another. the 1-15 hzqpos appear when the power law component becomes hard and intense, andthemselves have an energy spectrum consistent with the power law component(with root mean square amplitudes as high as 10%). the frequency of theoscillations, however, is most strikingly correlated with the parameters of thethermal disk component. the tightest correlation is between qpo frequency andthe disk x-ray flux. this fact indicates that the properties of the qpo are notdetermined by solely a disk or solely a corona.

astro-ph;9912243	on the formation of helium double degenerate stars and pre-cataclysmic  variables	the evolution of low mass (m &lt; 2.5 msun) binaries through the common envelopephase has been studied for systems in which one member is on its first ascentof the red giant branch. three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations have beencarried out for a range of red giant masses (1 - 2 msun) with degenerate heliumcores (0.28 - 0.45 msun) and companions (0.1 - 0.45 msun) for initial orbitalperiods ranging from about 15 - 1000 days. the results suggest that these lowmass binary systems can survive the common envelope phase provided that thehelium degenerate core is more massive than about 0.2 - 0.25 msun and that themass of the red giant progenitor is less than about 2 msun.  for the observed short period double degenerate systems, it is found thatevolutionary scenarios involving two phases of common envelope evolution arenot likely and that a scenario involving an algol-like phase of mass transferfollowed by a common envelope phase is viable, suggesting that the first-formedwhite dwarf is often reheated by nuclear burning on its surface. a formationmechanism for two subdwarf b stars observed in eclipsing short period binarieswith low mass main sequence stars is also described.
