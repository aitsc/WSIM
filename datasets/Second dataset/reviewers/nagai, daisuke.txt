0706.2881	cluster merger shock constraints on particle acceleration and nonthermal  pressure in the intracluster medium	x-ray observations of galaxy cluster merger shocks can be used to constrainnonthermal processes in the intracluster medium (icm). the presence ofnonthermal pressure components in the icm, as well as the shock acceleration ofparticles and their escape, all affect shock jump conditions in distinct ways.therefore, these processes can be constrained using x-ray surface brightnessand temperature maps of merger shock fronts. here we use these observations toplace constraints on particle acceleration efficiency in intermediate machnumber (m ~ 2-3) shocks and explore the potential to constrain the contributionof nonthermal components (e.g., cosmic rays, magnetic field, and turbulence) toicm pressure in cluster outskirts. we model the hydrodynamic jump conditions inmerger shocks discovered in the galaxy clusters a520 (m ~ 2) and 1e 0657-56 (m~ 3) using a multifluid model comprised of a thermal plasma, a nonthermalplasma, and a magnetic field. based on the published x-ray spectroscopic dataalone, we find that the fractional contribution of cosmic rays accelerated inthese shocks is lower than about 10% of the shock downstream pressure. currentobservations do not constrain the fractional contribution of nonthermalcomponents to the pressure of the undisturbed shock upstream. future x-rayobservations, however, have the potential to either detect particleacceleration in these shocks through its effect on the shock dynamics, or toplace a lower limit on the nonthermal pressure contributions in the undisturbedicm. we briefly discuss implications for models of particle acceleration incollisionless shocks and the estimates of galaxy cluster masses derived fromx-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations.

0903.4895	residual gas motions in the intracluster medium and bias in hydrostatic  measurements of mass profiles of clusters	we present analysis of bulk and random gas motions in the intracluster mediumusing high-resolution eulerian cosmological simulations of sixteen simulatedclusters, including both very relaxed and unrelaxed systems and spanning avirial mass range of 5*10^13 - 2*10^15 msun/h. we investigate effects of theresidual subsonic gas motions on the hydrostatic estimates of mass profiles andconcentrations of galaxy clusters. in agreement with previous studies we findthat the gas motions contribute up to ~ 5%-15% of the total pressure support inrelaxed clusters with contribution increasing with cluster-centric radius. thefractional pressure support is higher in unrelaxed systems. this contributionwould not be accounted for in hydrostatic estimates of the total mass profileand would lead to systematic underestimate of mass. we demonstrate that totalmass can be recovered accurately if pressure due to gas motions measured insimulations is explicitly taken into account in the equation of hydrostaticequilibrium. given that the underestimate of mass is increasing at largerradii, where gas is less relaxed and contribution of gas motions to pressure islarger, the total density profile derived from hydrostatic analysis is moreconcentrated than the true profile. this may at least partially explain somehigh values of concentrations of clusters estimated from hydrostatic analysisof x-ray data.

0908.2133	effects of baryon dissipation on the dark matter virial scaling relation	we investigate effects of baryon dissipation on the dark matter virialscaling relation between total mass and velocity dispersion and the velocitybias of galaxies in groups and clusters using self-consistent cosmologicalsimulations. we show that the baryon dissipation increases the velocitydispersion of dark matter within the virial radius by 5% - 10%. the effect ismainly driven by the change in density and gravitational potential in innerregions of cluster, and it is larger in lower mass systems where gas coolingand star formation are more efficient. we also show that the galaxy velocitybias depends on how galaxies are selected. galaxies selected based on theirstellar mass exhibit no velocity bias, while galaxies selected based on theirtotal mass show positive bias of ~10%, consistent with previous results basedon collisionless dark matter- only simulations. we further find thatobservational estimates of galaxy velocity dispersion are unbiased with respectto the velocity dispersion of dark matter, provided galaxies are selected usingtheir stellar masses and and their velocity dispersions are computed with morethan twenty most massive galaxies. velocity dispersions estimated with fewergalaxies, on the other hand, can lead to significant underestimate of dynamicalmasses. results presented in this paper should be useful in interpretatinghigh-redshift groups and clusters as well as cosmological constraints derivedfrom upcoming optical cluster surveys.

1003.2270	shapes of gas, gravitational potential and dark matter in lambda-cdm  clusters	we present analysis of the three-dimensional shape of intracluster gas inclusters formed in cosmological simulations of the lambda-cdm cosmology andcompare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of theoverall isopotential surfaces. we find that in simulations with radiativecooling, star formation and stellar feedback (csf), intracluster gas outsidethe cluster core is more spherical compared to non-radiative (nr) simulations,while in the core the gas in the csf runs is more triaxial and has a distinctlyoblate shape. the latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settlesinto a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. the shape of the gasin the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gascooling. we find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential ratherwell outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. at smallerradii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. in the csfruns, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationallysupported. interestingly, we find that in nr simulations the difference betweengas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which makethe gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. finally,we use mock chandra x-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observedin three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity ofx-ray isophotes. contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clustersagainst observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling of theintracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.

1006.1945	impact of cluster physics on the sunyaev-zel'dovich power spectrum	we use an analytic model to investigate the theoretical uncertainty on thethermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) power spectrum due to astrophysicaluncertainties in the thermal structure of the intracluster medium. our modelaccounts for star formation and energy feedback (from supernovae and activegalactic nuclei) as well as radially dependent non-thermal pressure support dueto random gas motions, the latter calibrated by recent hydrodynamicalsimulations. we compare the model against x-ray observations of low redshiftclusters, finding excellent agreement with observed pressure profiles. varyingthe levels of feedback and non-thermal pressure support can significantlychange both the amplitude and shape of the thermal sz power spectrum.increasing the feedback suppresses power at small angular scales, shifting thepeak of the power spectrum to lower ell. on the other hand, increasing thenon-thermal pressure support has the opposite effect, significantly reducingpower at large angular scales. in general, including non-thermal pressure atthe level measured in simulations has a large effect on the power spectrum,reducing the amplitude by 50% at angular scales of a few arcminutes compared toa model without a non-thermal component. our results demonstrate thatmeasurements of the shape of the power spectrum can reveal useful informationon important physical processes in groups and clusters, especially athigh-redshift where there exists little observational data. comparing with therecent south pole telescope measurements of the small-scale cosmic microwavebackground power spectrum, we find our model reduces the tension between thevalues of sigma_8 measured from the sz power spectrum and from clusterabundances.

1007.1924	cluster bulleticity	the unique properties of dark matter are revealed during collisions betweenclusters of galaxies, like the bullet cluster (1e 0657-56) and baby bullet(macsj0025-12). these systems provide evidence for an additional, invisiblemass in the separation between the distribution of their total mass, measuredvia gravitational lensing, and their ordinary 'baryonic' matter, measured viaits x-ray emission. unfortunately, the information available from these systemsis limited by their rarity. constraints on the properties of dark matter, suchas its interaction cross-section, are therefore restricted by uncertainties inthe individual systems' impact velocity, impact parameter and orientation withrespect to the line of sight.  here we develop a complementary, statistical measurement in which every pieceof substructure falling into every massive cluster is treated as a bullet. wedefine 'bulleticity' as the mean separation between dark matter and ordinarymatter, and we measure the signal in hydrodynamical simulations. the phasespace of substructure orbits also exhibits symmetries that provide anequivalent control test.  any detection of bulleticity in real data would indicate a difference in theinteraction cross-sections of baryonic and dark matter that may rule outhypotheses of non-particulate dark matter that are otherwise able to modelindividual systems. a subsequent measurement of bulleticity could constrain thedark matter cross-section. even with conservative estimates, the existing hstarchive should yield an independent constraint tighter than that from thebullet cluster. this technique is then trivially extendable to, and benefitsenormously from larger, future surveys.

1102.1437	the halo occupation distribution of black holes: dependence on mass	we investigate the halo occupation distribution (hod) of black holes within ahydrodynamic cosmological simulation that directly follows black hole growth.similar to the hod of galaxies/subhalos, we find that the black hole occupationnumber can be described by the form n_bh proportional to 1+ (m_host)^alphawhere alpha evolves mildly with redshift indicating that a given mass halo(m_host) at low redshift tends to host fewer bhs than at high redshift (asexpected as a result of galaxy and bh mergers). we further divide theoccupation number into contributions from black holes residing in central andsatellite galaxies within a halo. the distribution of m_bh within halos tendsto consist of a single massive bh (distributed about a peak mass stronglycorrelated with m_host), and a collection of relatively low-mass secondary bhs,with weaker correlation with m_host. we also examine the spatial distributionof bhs within their host halos, and find they typically follow a power-lawradial distribution (i.e. much more centrally concentrated than the subhalodistribution). finally, we characterize the host mass for which bh growth isfeedback dominated (e.g. star formation quenched). we show that halos withm_host &gt; 3 * 10^12 m_sun have primary bhs that are feedback dominated by z~3with lower mass halos becoming increasingly more affected at lower redshift.

1104.3550	the halo occupation distribution of active galactic nuclei	using a fully cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that self-consistentlyincorporates the growth and feedback of supermassive black holes and thephysics of galaxy formation, we examine the effects of environmental factors(e.g., local gas density, black hole feedback) on the halo occupationdistribution of low luminosity active galactic nuclei (agn). we decompose themean occupation function into central and satellite contribution and computethe conditional luminosity functions (clf). the clf of the central agn followsa log-normal distribution with the mean increasing and scatter decreasing withincreasing redshifts. we analyze the light curves of individual agn and showthat the peak luminosity of the agn has a tighter correlation with halo masscompared to instantaneous luminosity. we also compute the clf of satellite agnat a given central agn luminosity. we do not see any significant correlationbetween the number of satellites with the luminosity of the central agn at afixed halo mass. we also show that for a sample of agn with luminosity above10^42 ergs/s the mean occupation function can be modeled as a softened stepfunction for central agn and a power law for the satellite population. theradial distribution of agn inside halos follows a power law at all redshiftswith a mean index of -2.33 +/- 0.08. incorporating the environmental dependenceof supermassive black hole accretion and feedback, our formalism provides atheoretical tool for interpreting current and future measurements of agnclustering.

1108.5736	halo contraction effect in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation	the condensation of gas and stars in the inner regions of dark matter halosleads to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. while this effect isbased on simple gravitational physics, the question of its validity inhierarchical galaxy formation has led to an active debate in the literature. weuse a collection of several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations to study the halo contraction effect in systems ranging from dwarfgalaxies to clusters of galaxies, at high and low redshift. the simulations arerun by different groups with different codes and include hierarchical merging,gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback. we show that in all ourcases the inner dark matter density increases relative to the matchingsimulation without baryon dissipation, at least by a factor of several. thestrength of the contraction effect varies from system to system and cannot bereduced to a simple prescription. we present a revised analytical model thatdescribes the contracted mass profile to an rms accuracy of about 10%. themodel can be used to effectively bracket the response of the dark matter haloto baryon dissipation. the halo contraction effect is real and must be includedin modeling of the mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

1109.0553	deconstructing the kinetic sz power spectrum	we present a detailed investigation of the impact of astrophysical processeson the shape and amplitude of the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz) powerspectrum from the post-reionization epoch. this is achieved by constructing anew model of the ksz power spectrum which we calibrate to the results ofhydrodynamic simulations. by construction, our method accounts for all relevantdensity and velocity modes and so is unaffected by the limited box size of oursimulations. we find that radiative cooling and star-formation can reduce theamplitude of the ksz power spectrum by up to 33%, or 1 uk^2 at ell = 3000. thisis driven by a decrease in the mean gas density in groups and clusters due tothe conversion of gas into stars. variations in the redshifts at which heliumreionization occurs can effect the amplitude by a similar fraction, whilecurrent constraints on cosmological parameters (namely sigma_8) translate to afurther +-15% uncertainty on the ksz power spectrum. we demonstrate how themodels presented in this work can be constrained -- reducing the astrophysicaluncertainty on the ksz signal -- by measuring the redshift dependence of thesignal via ksz tomography. finally, we discuss how the results of this work canhelp constrain the duration of reionization via measurements of the kinetic szsignal sourced by inhomogeneous (or patchy) reionization.

1112.3659	evolution of the merger induced hydrostatic mass bias in galaxy clusters	in this work, we examine the effects of mergers on the hydrostatic massestimate of galaxy clusters using high-resolution eulerian cosmologicalsimulations. we utilize merger trees to isolate the last merger for eachcluster in our sample and follow the time evolution of the hydrostatic massbias as the systems relax. we find that during a merger, a shock propagatesoutward from the parent cluster, resulting in an overestimate in thehydrostatic mass bias. after the merger, as a cluster relaxes, the bias inhydrostatic mass estimate decreases but remains at a level of -5-10% with15-20% scatter within r500. we also investigate the post-merger evolution ofthe pressure support from bulk motions, a dominant cause of this residual massbias. at r500, the contribution from random motions peaks at 30% of the totalpressure during the merger and quickly decays to \sim 10-15% as a clusterrelaxes. additionally, we use a measure of the random motion pressure tocorrect the hydrostatic mass estimate. we discover that 4 gyr after mergers,the direct effects of the merger event on the hydrostatic mass bias have becomenegligible. thereafter, the mass bias is primarily due to residual bulk motionsin the gas which are not accounted for in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation.we present a hydrostatic mass bias correction method that can recover theunbiased cluster mass for relaxed clusters with 9% scatter at r500 and 11%scatter in the outskirts, within r200.

1201.2168	constraining cluster physics with the shape of x-ray clusters:  comparison of local x-ray clusters versus lcdm clusters	simulations of cluster formation have demonstrated that condensation ofbaryons into central galaxies during cluster formation can drive the shape ofthe gas distribution in galaxy clusters significantly rounder, even at radii aslarge as half of the virial radius. however, such simulations generally predictstellar fractions within cluster virial radii that are ~2 to 3 times largerthan the stellar masses deduced from observations. in this work we compareellipticity profiles of clusters simulated with and without baryonic cooling tothe cluster ellipticity profiles derived from chandra and rosat observations inan effort to constrain the fraction of gas that cools and condenses into thecentral galaxies within clusters. we find that the observed ellipticityprofiles are fairly constant with radius, with an average ellipticity of 0.18+/- 0.05. the observed ellipticity profiles are in good agreement with thepredictions of non-radiative simulations. on the other hand, the ellipticityprofiles of the clusters in simulations that include radiative cooling, starformation, and supernova feedback (but no agn feedback) deviate significantlyfrom the observed ellipticity profiles at all radii. the simulations withcooling overpredict (underpredict) ellipticity in the inner (outer) regions ofgalaxy clusters. by comparing the simulations with and without cooling, we showthat the cooling of gas via cooling flows in the central regions of simulatedclusters causes the gas distribution to be more oblate in the central regions,but makes the outer gas distribution more spherical. we find that late-time gascooling and star formation are responsible for the significantly oblate gasdistributions in cluster cores, but the gas shapes outside of cluster cores areset primarily by baryon dissipation at high redshift z &gt; 2.

1203.6368	bispectrum of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we perform a detailed study of the bispectrum of the sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect. using an analytical model for the pressure profiles of the intraclustermedium, we demonstrate the sz bispectrum to be a sensitive probe of theamplitude of the matter power spectrum parameter sigma_8. we find that thebispectrum amplitude scales as b_sz ~ sigma_8^{11-12}, compared to that of thepower spectrum, which scales as a_tsz ~ sigma_8^{7-9}. we show that the szbispectrum is principally sourced by massive clusters at redshifts aroundz~0.4, which have been well-studied observationally. this is in contrast to thesz power spectrum, which receives a significant contribution from less-wellunderstood low-mass and high-redshift groups and clusters. therefore, theamplitude of the bispectrum at l~3000 is less sensitive to astrophysicaluncertainties than the sz power spectrum. we show that current high resolutioncmb experiments should be able to detect the sz bispectrum amplitude with highsignificance, in part due to the low contamination from extra-galacticforegrounds. a combination of the sz bispectrum and the power spectrum cansharpen the measurements of thermal and kinetic sz components and helpdistinguish cosmological and astrophysical information from high-resolution cmbmaps.

1306.3993	weighing galaxy clusters with gas. i. on the methods of computing  hydrostatic mass bias	mass estimates of galaxy clusters from x-ray and sunyeav-zel'dovichobservations assume the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium withtheir gravitational potential. however, since galaxy clusters are dynamicallyactive objects whose dynamical states can deviate significantly from theequilibrium configuration, the departure from the hydrostatic equilibriumassumption is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainties in clustercosmology. in the literature there has been two methods for computing thehydrostatic mass bias based on the euler and the modified jeans equations,respectively, and there has been some confusion about the validity of these twomethods. the word "jeans" was a misnomer, which incorrectly implies that thegas is collisionless. to avoid further confusion, we instead refer thesemethods as "summation" and "averaging" methods respectively. in this work, weshow that these two methods for computing the hydrostatic mass bias areequivalent by demonstrating that the equation used in the second method can bederived from taking spatial averages of the euler equation. specifically, weidentify the correspondences of individual terms in these two methodsmathematically and show that these correspondences are valid to within a fewpercent level using hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation. inaddition, we compute the mass bias associated with the acceleration of gas andshow that its contribution is small in the virialized regions in the interiorof galaxy cluster, but becomes non-negligible in the cluster outskirts ofmassive clusters where materials are being actively accreted. we discussimplications for understanding the origin of hydrostatic mass biases and forcharacterizing them using hydrodynamical simulations as well as observations.

1308.6589	weighing galaxy clusters with gas. ii. on the origin of hydrostatic mass  bias in lambdacdm galaxy clusters	the use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes hinges on our ability tomeasure their masses accurately and with high precision. hydrostatic mass isone of the most common methods for estimating the masses of individual galaxyclusters, which suffer from biases due to departures from hydrostaticequilibrium. using a large, mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters froma high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, in this work we showthat in addition to turbulent and bulk gas velocities, acceleration of gasintroduces biases in the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters. inunrelaxed clusters, the acceleration bias is comparable to the bias due tonon-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced turbulent and bulk gasmotions. in relaxed clusters, the mean mass bias due to acceleration is small(&lt;3%), but the scatter in the mass bias can be reduced by accounting for gasacceleration. additionally, this acceleration bias is greater in the outskirtsof higher redshift clusters where mergers are more frequent and clusters areaccreting more rapidly. since gas acceleration cannot be observed directly, itintroduces an irreducible bias for hydrostatic mass estimates. thisacceleration bias places limits on how well we can recover cluster masses fromfuture x-ray and microwave observations. we discuss implications for clustermass estimates based on x-ray, sunyaev-zeldovich effect, and gravitationallensing observations and their impact on cluster cosmology.

1310.1731	on the cross-section of dark matter using substructure infall into  galaxy clusters	we develop a statistical method to measure the interaction cross-section ofdark matter, exploiting the continuous minor merger events in which smallsubstructures fall into galaxy clusters. we find that by taking the ratio ofthe distances between the galaxies and dark matter, and galaxies and gas inaccreting sub-halos, we form a quantity that can be statistically averaged overa large sample of systems whilst removing any inherent line-of-sightprojections. in order to interpret this ratio as a cross-section of dark matterwe derive an analytical description of sub-halo infall which encompasses; theforce of the main cluster potential, the drag on a gas sub-halo, a model fordark matter self-interactions and the resulting sub-halo drag, the force on thegas and galaxies due to the dark matter sub-halo potential, and finally thebuoyancy on the gas and dark matter. we create mock observations fromcosmological simulations of structure formation and find that collisionlessdark matter becomes physically separated from x-ray gas by up to 20h^-1 kpc.adding realistic levels of noise, we are able to predict achievable constraintsfrom observational data. current archival data should be able to detect adifference in the dynamical behaviour of dark matter and standard modelparticles at 6 sigma, and measure the total interaction cross-section sigma/mwith 68% confidence limits of +/- 1cm2g^-1. we note that this method is notrestricted by the limited number of major merging events and is easily extendedto large samples of clusters from future surveys which could potentially pushstatistical errors to 0.1cm^2g^-1.

1404.4634	testing x-ray measurements of galaxy cluster outskirts with cosmological  simulations	the study of galaxy cluster outskirts has emerged as one of the new frontiersin extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology with the advent of new observationsin x-ray and microwave. however, the thermodynamic properties and chemicalenrichment of this diffuse and azimuthally asymmetric component of theintracluster medium (icm) are still not well understood. this work, for thefirst time, systematically explores potential observational biases in theseregions. to assess x-ray measurements of galaxy cluster properties at largeradii ($&gt;{r}_{500c}$), we use mock chandra analyses of cosmological galaxycluster simulations. the pipeline is identical to that used for chandraobservations, but the biases discussed in this paper are relevant for all x-rayobservations outside of ${r}_{500c}$. we find the following from our analysis:(1) filament regions can contribute as much as $50\%$ at $r_{200c}$ to theemission measure; (2) x-ray temperatures and metal abundances from model fittedmock x-ray spectra in a multi-temperature icm respectively vary to the level of$10\%$ and $50\%$; (3) resulting density profiles vary to within $10\%$ out to$r_{200c}$, and gas mass, total mass, and baryon fractions all vary to within afew percent; (4) the bias from a metal abundance extrapolated a factor of fivehigher than the true metal abundance results in total mass measurements biasedhigh by $20\%$ and total gas measurements biased low by $10\%$; and (5)differences in projection and dynamical state of a cluster can lead to gasdensity slope measurements that differ by a factor of $15\%$ and $30\%$,respectively. the presented results can partially account for some of therecent gas profile measurements in cluster outskirts by, e.g., suzaku. ourfindings are pertinent to future x-ray cosmological constraints from clusteroutskirts.

1404.4636	hydrodynamic simulation of non-thermal pressure profiles of galaxy  clusters	cosmological constraints from x-ray and microwave observations of galaxyclusters are subjected to systematic uncertainties. non-thermal pressuresupport due to internal gas motions in galaxy clusters is one of the majorsources of astrophysical uncertainties. using a mass-limited sample of galaxyclusters from a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, wecharacterize the non-thermal pressure fraction profile and study its dependenceon redshift, mass, and mass accretion rate. we find that the non-thermalpressure fraction profile is universal across redshift when galaxy clusterradii are defined with respect to the mean matter density of the universeinstead of the commonly used critical density. we also find that thenon-thermal pressure is predominantly radial, and the gas velocity anisotropyprofile exhibits strong universality when galaxy cluster radii are defined withrespect to the mean matter density of the universe. however, we find that thenon-thermal pressure fraction is strongly dependent on the mass accretion rateof the galaxy cluster. we provide fitting formulae for the universalnon-thermal pressure fraction and velocity anisotropy profiles of gas in galaxyclusters, which should be useful in modeling astrophysical uncertaintiespertinent to using galaxy clusters as cosmological probes.

1406.4410	temperature structure of the intra-cluster medium from sph and amr  simulations	analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters suggestthat x-ray masses can be underestimated by 10% to 30%. the largest biasoriginates by both violation of hydrostatic equilibrium and an additionaltemperature bias caused by inhomogeneities in the x-ray emitting intra-clustermedium (icm). to elucidate on this large dispersion among theoreticalpredictions, we evaluate the degree of temperature structures in cluster setssimulated either with smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (sph) andadaptive-mesh-refinement (amr) codes. we find that the sph simulations producelarger temperature variations connected to the persistence of bothsubstructures and their stripped cold gas. this difference is more evident inno-radiative simulations, while it is reduced in the presence of radiativecooling. we also find that the temperature variation in radiative clustersimulations is generally in agreement with the observed one in the centralregions of clusters. around r_500 the temperature inhomogeneities of the sphsimulations can generate twice the typical hydrostatic-equilibrium mass bias ofthe amr sample. we emphasize that a detailed understanding of the physicalprocesses responsible for the complex thermal structure in icm requiresimproved resolution and high sensitivity observations in order to extend theanalysis to higher temperature systems and larger cluster-centric radii.

0803.1803	the cluster-merger shock in 1e 0657-56	the merging galaxy cluster 1e 0657-56, known as the "bullet cluster," is oneof the hottest clusters known. the x-ray emitting plasma exhibitsbow-shock-like temperature and density jumps. the segregation of this plasmafrom the peaks of the mass distribution determined by gravitational lensing hasbeen interpreted as a direct proof of collisionless dark matter. if the highshock speed inferred from the shock jump conditions equals the relative speedof the merging cdm halos, however, this merger is predicted to be such a rareevent in a lcdm universe that observing it presents a possible conflict withthe lcdm model.  we examined this question using high resolution, 2d simulations of gasdynamics in cluster collisions to analyze the relative motion of the clusters,the bow shock, and the contact discontinuity, and relate these to the x-raydata for the bullet cluster. we find that the velocity of the fluid shock neednot equal the relative velocity of the cdm components. an illustrativesimulation finds that the present relative velocity of the cdm halos is 16%lower than that of the shock. while this conclusion is sensitive to thedetailed initial mass and gas density profiles of the colliding clusters, sucha decrease of the inferred halo relative velocity would significantly increasethe likelihood of finding 1e 0657-56 in a lcdm universe.

1408.3832	analytical model for non-thermal pressure in galaxy clusters - ii.  comparison with cosmological hydrodynamics simulation	turbulent gas motion inside galaxy clusters provides a non-negligiblenon-thermal pressure support to the intracluster gas. if not corrected, itleads to a systematic bias in the estimation of cluster masses from x-ray andsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) observations assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, andaffects interpretation of measurements of the sz power spectrum andobservations of cluster outskirts from ongoing and upcoming large clustersurveys. recently, shi &amp; komatsu developed an analytical model for predictingthe radius, mass, and redshift dependence of the non-thermal pressurecontributed by the kinetic random motions of intracluster gas sourced by thecluster mass growth. in this paper, we compare the predictions of thisanalytical model to a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation.as different mass growth histories result in different non-thermal pressure, weperform the comparison on 65 simulated galaxy clusters on a cluster-by-clusterbasis. we find an excellent agreement between the modelled and simulatednon-thermal pressure profiles. our results open up the possibility of using theanalytical model to correct the systematic bias in the mass estimation ofgalaxy clusters. we also discuss tests of the physical picture underlying theevolution of intracluster non-thermal gas motions, as well as a way to furtherimprove the analytical modeling, which may help achieve a unified understandingof non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters.

1410.8142	non-equilibrium electrons in the outskirts of galaxy clusters	the analysis of x-ray and sunyaev-zel\'dovich measurements of theintracluster medium (icm) assumes that electrons are in thermal equilibriumwith ions in the plasma. however, electron-ion equilibration timescales can becomparable to the hubble time in the low density galaxy cluster outskirts,leading to differences between the electron and ion temperatures. thistemperature difference can lead to systematic biases in cluster mass estimatesand mass-observable scaling relations. to quantify the impact ofnon-equilibrium electrons on the icm profiles in cluster outskirts, we use ahigh resolution cosmological simulation with a two-temperature model assumingthe spitzer equilibration timescale for the electrons. first, we show how theradial profile of this temperature bias depends on both the mass and massaccretion rate of the cluster; the bias is most pronounced in the most massiveand most rapidly accreting clusters. for the most extreme case in our sample,we find that the bias is of order 10% at half of the cluster virial radius andincreases to 40% at the edge of the cluster. we also find that gas in filamentsis less susceptible to the non-equilibrium effect, leading to azimuthalvariations at large cluster-centric radii. by analyzing mock chandraobservations of simulated clusters, we show that such azimuthal variations canbe probed with deep x-ray observations. finally, the mass-dependent temperaturebias introduces biases in hydrostatic mass and cluster temperature, which hasimplications for cluster-based cosmological inferences. we provide amass-dependent model for the temperature bias profile which can be useful formodeling the effect of electron-ion equilibration in galaxy clusters.

1411.5361	mass accretion and its effects on the self-similarity of gas profiles in  the outskirts of galaxy clusters	galaxy clusters exhibit remarkable self-similar behavior which allows us toestablish simple scaling relationships between observable quantities andcluster masses, making galaxy clusters useful cosmological probes. recent x-rayobservations suggest that self-similarity may be broken in the outskirts ofgalaxy clusters. in this work, we analyze a mass-limited sample of massivegalaxy clusters from the omega500 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation toinvestigate the self-similarity of the diffuse x-ray emitting intraclustermedium (icm) in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. we find that theself-similarity of the outer icm profiles is better preserved if they arenormalized with respect to the mean density of the universe, while the innerprofiles are more self-similar when normalized using the critical density.however, the outer icm profiles as well as the location of accretion shockaround clusters are sensitive to their mass accretion rate, which causes theapparent breaking of self-similarity in cluster outskirts. we also find thatthe collisional gas does not follow the distribution of collisionless darkmatter perfectly in the infall regions of galaxy clusters, leading to 10%departures in the gas-to-dark matter density ratio from the cosmic mean value.our results have a number implications for interpreting observations of galaxyclusters in x-ray and through the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and theirapplication to cluster cosmology.

1412.0662	the physical nature of the cosmic accretion of baryons and dark matter  into halos and their galaxies	the cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons into halos typically ismeasured using some evolving virial relation, but recent work suggests thatmost halo growth at late cosmic time (z &lt; 2) is not physical but is rather theby-product of an evolving virial radius ("pseudo-evolution"). using omega25, asuite of cosmological simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gasdynamics with differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermalfeedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic accretioninto halos and their galaxies. physically meaningful cosmic accretion of bothdark matter and baryons occurs at z &gt; 1 across our halo mass range: m_200m =10^{11-14} m_sun. however, dark matter, because it is dissipationless, isdeposited (in a time-average sense) at &gt; r_200m(z) in a shell-like manner, suchthat dark-matter mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth atany radius within a halo at z &lt; 1. in contrast, gas, because it is able to coolradiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate thatroughly tracks the accretion rate at r_200m, at all redshifts. infalling gasstarts to decouple from dark matter at ~2 r_200m and continues to accrete tosmaller radii until the onset of strong angular-momentum support at ~ 0.1r_200m. thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject to pseudo-evolution,the growth of baryons is not. the fact that the accretion rate of gas ongalactic scales tracks the accretion rate near r_200m provides insight into thetight relations between the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their hosthalos across cosmic time.

1501.00317	the influence of mergers on scatter and evolution in sunyaev-zel'dovich  effect scaling relations	the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) observable-mass (y-m) scaling relation isa promising technique for obtaining mass estimates for large samples of galaxyclusters and holds a key to studying the nature of dark matter and dark energy.however, cosmological inference based on sze cluster surveys is limited by ourincomplete knowledge of bias, scatter, and evolution in the y-m relation. inthis work, we investigate the effects of galaxy cluster mergers on the scalingrelation using the omega500 high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamicsimulation. we show that the non-thermal pressure associated withmerger-induced gas motions contributes significantly to the bias, scatter, andevolution of the scaling relation. after the merger, the kinetic energy ofmerging systems is slowly converted into thermal energy through dissipation ofturbulent gas motions, which causes the thermal sze signal to increase steadilywith time. this post-merger evolution is one of the primary source of bias andscatter in the y-m relation. however, we show that when the missing non-thermalenergy is accounted for, the resulting relation exhibits little to no redshiftevolution and the scatter around the scaling relation is ~20-30 % smaller thanthat of the thermal sze signal alone. our work opens up a possibility tofurther improve the current robust mass proxy, y, by accounting for the missingnon-thermal pressure component. we discuss future prospect of measuringinternal gas motions in galaxy clusters and its implication for cluster-basedcosmological tests.

1507.02730	testing astro-h measurements of bulk and turbulent gas motions in galaxy  clusters	gas motions in galaxy clusters play important roles in determining theproperties of the intracluster medium (icm) and constraining cosmologicalparameters using x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations of galaxyclusters. the upcoming astro-h mission, equipped with high-resolution x-rayspectrometer, will make the first direct measurements of gas motions in galaxyclusters through measurements of doppler shifting and broadening of emissionlines. however, the physical interpretation of the data will be challenging dueto the complex thermal and velocity structures of the icm. in this work, weinvestigate how well we can measure bulk and turbulent gas motions in the icmwith astro-h, by analyzing mock astro-h simulations of galaxy clustersextracted from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we assess how photoncounts, spectral fitting methods, multiphase icm structure, deprojections, andregion selection affect the measurements of gas motions. we show that whileastro-h is capable of recovering the underlying spherically averaged velocityprofiles to within 20% with reasonable amount of photon counts (&gt;~200) in the6.7 kev fe xxv line complex, there are considerable azimuthal variations in theicm velocities, even in dynamically relaxed systems, which must be taken intoaccount when interpreting data and developing observing strategies. finally, weshow that astro-h should enable direct measurements of the hydrostatic massbias with an accuracy of &lt;~5%, by accounting for both rotational and randomvelocities from doppler shifts and broadening of emission lines. our resultsare broadly applicable for future x-ray missions, such as athena+ and smart-x.

astro-ph;0206469	cold fronts in cdm clusters	recently, high-resolution chandra observations revealed the existence of verysharp features in the x-ray surface brightness and temperature maps of severalclusters (vikhlinin et. al., 2001). these features, called ``cold fronts'', arecharacterized by an increase in surface brightness by a factor &gt;2 over 10-50kpc, accompanied by a drop in temperature of a similar magnitude. the existenceof such sharp gradients can be used to put interesting constraints on thephysics of the intracluster medium (icm), if their mechanism and longevity arewell understood. here, we present results of a search for cold fronts inhigh-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters in cold dark matter (cdm)models. we show that sharp gradients with properties similar to those ofobserved cold fronts naturally arise in cluster mergers when the shocks heatgas surrounding the merging sub-cluster, while its dense core remainsrelatively cold. the compression induced by supersonic motions and shockheating during the merger enhance the amplitude of gas density and temperaturegradients across the front. our results indicate that cold fronts arenon-equilibrium transient phenomena and can be observed for a period of lessthan a billion years. we show that the velocity and density fields of gassurrounding the cold front can be very irregular which would complicateanalyses aiming to put constraints on the physical conditions of theintracluster medium in the vicinity of the front.

astro-ph;0208308	effect of internal flows on sunyaev-zeldovich measurements of cluster  peculiar velocities	galaxy clusters are potentially powerful probes of the large-scale velocityfield in the universe because their peculiar velocity can be estimated directlyvia the kinematic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz). using high-resolutioncosmological simulations of an evolving cluster of galaxies, we evaluate howwell the average velocity obtained via a ksz measurement reflects the actualcluster peculiar velocity. we find that the internal velocities in theintracluster gas are comparable to the overall cluster peculiar velocity, 20 to30% of the sound speed even when a cluster is relatively relaxed. nevertheless,the velocity averaged over the ksz map inside a circular aperture matched tothe cluster virial region provides an unbiased estimate of a cluster's radialpeculiar velocity with a dispersion of 50 to 100 km/s, depending on the line ofsight and dynamical state of the cluster. this dispersion puts a lower limit onthe accuracy with which cluster peculiar velocity can be measured. although thedispersion of the average is relatively small, the velocity distribution isbroad; regions of low signal must be treated with care to avoid bias. wediscuss the extent to which systematic errors might be modelled, and theresulting limitations on using galaxy clusters as cosmological velocitytracers.

astro-ph;0404350	simulating the formation of galaxy clusters	we study the effects of radiative cooling, star formation and stellarfeedback on the properties and evolution of galaxy clusters usinghigh-resolution adaptive mesh refinement n-body+gasdynamics simulations ofclusters forming in the lcdm universe. cooling leads to the condensation of gasin the inner regions of clusters, which in turn leads to steepening of the darkmatter profile. the cooling gas is replaced by the higher-entropy gas from theouter regions, which raises the entropy and temperature of gas in the clustercore. the magnitude of these effects is likely overestimated in the currentsimulations because they suffer from the overcooling problem: a much largerfraction of baryons is in the form of cold gas and stars than is observed. wefind that the thermal stellar feedback alone does not remedy this problem.additional ad-hoc preheating can lower the amount of cold gas but a simpleuniform preheating results in incorrect star formation history, as it delaysthe bulk of star formation until z&lt;1. our analysis shows that the overcoolingin a cluster as a whole is really the overcooling in the central galaxy and itsprogenitors at high redshifts. this indicates that an additional heatingmechanism that can continuously heat the gas in the cluster core is required toreproduce the observed cluster properties. energy injection by the activegalactic nuclei, which may provide such heating, may thus be an importantmissing ingredient in the current theoretical models of cluster formation.

astro-ph;0405189	the effect of gas cooling on the shapes of dark matter halos	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the shapes of dark matter (dm) halosusing high-resolution cosmological gasdynamics simulations of clusters andgalaxies in the lcdm cosmology. we find that halos formed in simulations withgas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed inadiabatic simulations. gas cooling results in an average increase of theprinciple axis ratios of halos by ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. thesystematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to thevirial radius. we argue that the differences in simulations with and withoutcooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools andcondenses toward the center, and during major mergers. we perform a series ofhigh-resolution n-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in majormergers of dm halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. in the dm halo-onlymergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentumof the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. however,significant shape changes in the dm distribution may result if stellar disksare included. in this case the shape of the dm halos is correlated with themorphology of the stellar remnants.

0808.3769	effect of helium sedimentation on x-ray measurements of galaxy clusters	the uniformity of the helium-to-hydrogen abundance ratio in x-ray emittingintracluster medium (icm) is one of the commonly adopted assumptions in x-rayanalyses of galaxy clusters and cosmological constraints derived from thesemeasurements. in this work, we investigate the effect of he sedimentation onx-ray measurements of galaxy clusters in order to assess this assumption andassociated systematic uncertainties. by solving a set of flow equations for ah-he plasma, we show that the helium-to-hydrogen mass ratio is significantlyenhanced in the inner regions of clusters. the effect of he sedimentation, ifnot accounted for, introduces systematic biases in observable properties ofclusters derived using x-ray observations. we show that these biases alsointroduce an apparent evolution in the observed gas mass fractions of x-rayluminous, dynamically relaxed clusters and hence biases in observationalconstraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, derived from thecluster distance-redshift relation. the hubble parameter derived from thecombination of x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) measurements isaffected by the he sedimentation process as well. future measurements aiming toconstrain w or h_0 to better than 10% may need to take into account the effectof he sedimentation. we propose that the evolution of gas mass fraction in theinner regions of clusters should provide unique observational diagnostics ofthe he sedimentation process.

astro-ph;0406247	response of dark matter halos to condensation of baryons: cosmological  simulations and improved adiabatic contraction model	the cooling of gas in the centers of dark matter halos is expected to lead toa more concentrated dark matter distribution. the response of dark matter tothe condensation of baryons is usually calculated using the model of adiabaticcontraction, which assumes spherical symmetry and circular orbits. in contrast,halos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multipleviolent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halosare highly eccentric. we study the effects of the cooling of gas in the innerregions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations which includegas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation. we find that thedissipation of gas indeed increases the density of dark matter and steepens itsradial profile in the inner regions of halos compared to the case withoutcooling. for the first time, we test the adiabatic contraction model incosmological simulations and find that the standard model systematicallyoverpredicts the increase of dark matter density in the inner 5% of the virialradius. we show that the model can be improved by a simple modification of theassumed invariant from m(r)r to m(r_av)r, where r and r_av are the current andorbit-averaged particle positions. this modification approximately accounts fororbital eccentricities of particles and reproduces simulation profiles towithin 10-20%. we present analytical fitting functions that accurately describethe transformation of the dark matter profile in the modified model and can beused for interpretation of observations.

astro-ph;0408273	the radial distribution of galaxies in lcdm clusters	we study the radial distribution of subhalos and galaxies usinghigh-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters formed in theconcordance lcdm cosmology. in agreement with previous studies, we find thatthe radial distribution of subhalos is significantly less concentrated thanthat of the dark matter, when subhalos are selected using their present-daygravitationally bound mass. we show that the difference in the radialdistribution is not a numerical artifact and is due to tidal stripping. thesubhalos in the cluster core lose more than 70% of their initial mass sinceaccretion, while the average tidal mass loss for halos near the virial radiusis ~30%. this introduces a radial bias in the spatial distribution of subhaloswhen they are selected using their tidally truncated mass. we demonstrate thatthe radial bias disappears almost entirely if subhalos are selected using theirmass or circular velocity at the accretion epoch. the comparisons of theresults of dissipationless simulations to the observed distribution of galaxiesin clusters are therefore sensitive to the selection criteria used to selectsubhalo samples. using the simulations that include cooling and starformation,we show that the radial distribution of subhalos is in reasonable agreementwith the observed radial distribution of galaxies in clusters for0.1&lt;r/r200&lt;2.0, if subhalos are selected using the stellar mass of galaxies.the radial bias is minimized in this case because the stars are located in thecenters of dark matter subhalos and are tightly bound. the stellar mass of anobject is therefore approximately conserved as the dark matter is stripped fromthe outer regions. nevertheless, the concentration of the radial distributionof galaxies is systematically lower than that of the dark matter.

astro-ph;0501227	effects of cooling and star formation on the baryon fractions in  clusters	we study the effects of dissipation on the baryon fractions in clusters usinghigh-resolution cosmological simulations of nine clusters that resolveformation of cluster galaxies. the simulations of each cluster are performedwith the shock-capturing eulerian adaptive mesh refinement n-body+gasdynamicsart code with and without radiative cooling. we show that dissipation andassociated galaxy formation increase the total baryon fractions within radii aslarge as the virial radius. the effect is the strongest within cluster cores,where the simulations with cooling have baryon fractions larger than theuniversal value, while the fraction of baryons in adiabatic simulations aresmaller than universal. at larger radii (r &gt;~ r_500) the cumulative baryonfractions in simulations with cooling are close to, while those in theadiabatic runs remain below than, the universal value. the gas fractions insimulations with dissipation are reduced by ~20-40% at r&lt;0.3r_vir and ~10% atlarger radii compared to the adiabatic runs, because a fraction of gas isconverted into stars. there is an indication that gas fractions withindifferent radii increase with increasing cluster mass as f_gas ~ m_vir^0.2. wefind that the total baryon fraction within the virial radius does not evolvewith time in both adiabatic simulations and in simulations with cooling.finally, to evaluate systematic uncertainties in the baryon fraction incosmological simulations we present a comparison of gas fractions in ouradiabatic simulations to re-simulations of the same objects with theentropy-conserving sph code gadget. the cumulative gas fraction profiles in thetwo sets of simulations on average agree to &lt;~3% at r/r_vir&gt;0.2, but differsystematically by up to 10% at small radii.

astro-ph;0508114	the effect of baryons on halo shapes	observational evidence indicates a mismatch between the shapes ofcollisionless dark matter (dm) halos and those of observed systems. usinghydrodynamical cosmological simulations we investigate the effect of baryonicdissipation on halo shapes. we show that dissipational simulations producesignificantly rounder halos than those formed in equivalent dissipationlesssimulations. gas cooling causes an average increase in halo principal axisratios of ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions and a systematic shift that persistsout to the virial radius, alleviating any tension between theory andobservations. although the magnitude of the effect may be overestimated due toovercooling, cluster formation simulations designed to reproduce the observedfraction of cold baryons still produce substantially rounder halos. subhalosalso exhibit a trend of increased axis ratios in dissipational simulations.moreover, we demonstrate that subhalos are generally rounder than correspondingfield halos even in dissipationless simulations. lastly, we analyze a series ofbinary, equal-mass merger simulations of disk galaxies. collisionless mergersreveal a strong correlation between dm halo shape and stellar remnantmorphology. in dissipational mergers, the combination of strong gas inflows andstar formation leads to an increase of the dm axis ratios in the remnant. allof these results highlight the vital role of baryonic processes in comparingtheory with observations and warn against over-interpreting discrepancies withcollisionless simulations on small scales.

astro-ph;0512208	the impact of galaxy formation on the sunyaev-zeldovich effect of galaxy  clusters	we study the effects of galaxy formation on the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect(sze) observable-mass relations using high-resolution cosmological simulations.the simulations of eleven individual clusters spanning a decade in mass areperformed with the shock-capturing eulerian adaptive mesh refinementn-body+gasdynamics art code. to assess the impact of galaxy formation, wecompare two sets of simulations performed in an adiabatic regime and those withseveral physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation:radiative cooling, star formation, stellar feedback and metal enrichment. weshow that a sze signal integrated to a sufficiently large fraction of clustervolume correlates strongly with its enclosed mass, independent of details ofgas physics and dynamical state of the cluster. the slope and redshiftevolution of the sze flux-mass relation are also insensitive to processes ofgalaxy formation and are well characterized by a simple self-similar clustermodel. its normalization, on the other hand, is significantly affected by gascooling and associated star formation. our simulations show that inclusion ofthese processes suppresses the normalization by ~30-40%. the effect is due to adecrease in gas mass fraction, which is offset slightly by an increase in gasmass-weighted temperature. gas cooling and star formation also cause anincrease in total mass and modify the normalization by a few percent. finally,the comparison with recent observations of the sze scaling relations highlightsthe importance of galaxy formation in theoretical modelling of clusters andshows that current generation of simulations produce clusters with grossproperties quite similar to their observed counterparts.

astro-ph;0603205	a new robust low-scatter x-ray mass indicator for clusters of galaxies	we present comparison of x-ray proxies for the total cluster mass, includingthe spectral temperature (tx), gas mass measured within r500 (mg), and the newproxy, yx, which is a simple product of tx and mg and is related to the totalthermal energy of the icm. we use mock chandra images constructed for a sampleof clusters simulated with the eulerian n-body+gasdynamics adaptive meshrefinement art code in the concordance lcdm cosmology. the simulations achievehigh spatial and mass resolution and include radiative cooling, star formation,and other processes accompanying galaxy formation. our analysis shows thatsimulated clusters exhibit a high degree of regularity and tight correlationsbetween the considered observables and total mass. the normalizations of them-tx, mg-tx, and m-yx relations agree to better than 10-15% with the currentobservational measurements of these relations. our results show that yx is thebest mass proxy with a remarkably low scatter of only ~5-7% in m500 for a fixedyx, at both low and high redshifts and regardless of whether clusters arerelaxed or not. in addition, we show that redshift evolution of the yx-m500relation is close to the self-similar prediction, which makes yx a veryattractive mass indicator for measurements of the cluster mass function fromx-ray selected samples.

astro-ph;0609247	testing x-ray measurements of galaxy clusters with cosmological  simulations	x-ray observations of galaxy clusters potentially provide powerfulcosmological probes if systematics due to our incomplete knowledge of theintracluster medium (icm) physics are understood and controlled. in this paper,we present mock chandra analyses of cosmological cluster simulations and assessx-ray measurements of galaxy cluster properties using a model and procedureessentially identical to that used in real data analysis. we show thatreconstruction of three-dimensional icm density and temperature profiles isexcellent for relaxed clusters, but still reasonably accurate for unrelaxedsystems. the total icm mass is measured quite accurately (&lt;6%) in all clusters,while the hydrostatic estimate of the gravitationally bound mass is biased lowby about 5%-20% through the virial region, primarily due to additional pressuresupport provided by subsonic bulk motions in the icm, ubiquitous in oursimulations even in relaxed systems. gas fraction determinations are thereforebiased high; the bias increases toward cluster outskirts and dependssensitively on its dynamical state, but we do not observe significant trends ofthe bias with cluster mass or redshift. we also find that different average icmtemperatures, such as the x-ray spectroscopic tspec and gas-mass-weighted tmg,are related to each other by a constant factor with a relatively smallobject-to-object scatter and no systematic trend with mass, redshift or thedynamical state of clusters. we briefly discuss direct applications of ourresults for different cluster-based cosmological tests.

astro-ph;0609621	the impact of baryonic cooling on giant arc abundances	using ray tracing for simple analytic profiles, we demonstrate that thelensing cross section for producing giant arcs has distinct contributions dueto arcs formed through image distortion only, and arcs form from the merging oftwo or three images. we investigate the dependence of each of thesecontributions on halo ellipticity and on the slope of the density profile, anddemonstrate that at fixed einstein radius, the lensing cross section increasesas the halo profile becomes steeper. we then compare simulations with andwithout baryonic cooling of the same cluster for a sample of six clusters, anddemonstrate that cooling can increase the overall abundance of giant arcs byfactors of a few. the net boost to the lensing probability for individualclusters is mass dependent, and can lower the effective low mass limit oflensing clusters. this last effect can potentially increase the number oflensing clusters by an extra 50%. while the magnitude of these effects may beoverestimated due to the well known overcooling problem in simulations, it isevident that baryonic cooling has a non-negligible impact on the expectedabundance of giant arcs, and hence cosmological constraints from giant arcabundances may be subject to large systematic errors.

astro-ph;0612700	missing thermal energy of the intracluster medium	the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect is a direct probe of thermal energycontent of the universe, induced in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) skythrough scattering of cmb photons off hot electrons in the intracluster medium(icm). we report a 9-sigma detection of the sz signal in the cmb maps ofwilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) 3yr data, through study of a sampleof 193 massive galaxy clusters with observed x-ray temperatures greater than 3kev. for the first time, we make a model-independent measurement of thepressure profile in the outskirts of the icm, and show that it closely followsthe profiles obtained by x-ray observations and numerical simulations. we findthat our measurements of the sz effect would account for only half of thethermal energy of the cluster, if all the cluster baryons were in the hot icmphase. our measurements indicate that a significant fraction (35 +/- 8 %) ofbaryonic mass is missing from the hot icm, and thus must have cooled to formgalaxies, intracluster stars, or an unknown cold phase of the icm. there doesnot seem to be enough mass in the form of stars or cold gas in the clustergalaxies or intracluster space, signaling the need for a yet-unknown baryoniccomponent (at 3-sigma level), or otherwise new astrophysical processes in theicm.

astro-ph;0703199	the cluster-merger shock in 1e 0657-56: faster than the speeding bullet?	shock waves driven in the intergalactic medium during the merging of galaxyclusters have been observed in x-ray imaging and spectroscopy. fluid motionsinferred from the shock strength and morphology can be compared to the colddark matter (cdm) distribution inferred from gravitational lensing. a detailedreconstruction of the cdm kinematics, however, must take into account thenontrivial response of the fluid intracluster medium to the collisionless cdmmotions. we have carried out two-dimensional simulations of gas dynamics incluster collisions. we analyze the relative motion of the clusters, the bowshock wave, and the contact discontinuity and relate these to x-ray data. wefocus on the "bullet cluster," 1e 0657-56, a near head-on collision ofunequal-mass clusters, for which the gas density and temperature jumps acrossthe prominent bow shock imply a high shock velocity 4,700 km/s. the velocity ofthe fluid shock has been widely interpreted as the relative velocity of the cdmcomponents. this need not be the case, however. an illustrative simulationfinds that the present relative velocity of the cdm halos is 16% lower thanthat of the shock. while this conclusion is sensitive to the detailed initialmass and gas density profile of the colliding clusters, such a decrease of theinferred halo relative velocity would increase the likelihood of finding 1e0657-56 in a lambdacdm universe.

astro-ph;0703661	effects of galaxy formation on thermodynamics of the intracluster medium	we present detailed comparisons of the intracluster medium (icm) incosmological eulerian cluster simulations with deep chandra observations ofnearby relaxed clusters. to assess the impact of galaxy formation, we comparetwo sets of simulations, one performed in the non-radiative regime and anotherwith radiative cooling and several physical processes critical to variousaspects of galaxy formation: star formation, metal enrichment and stellarfeedback. we show that the observed icm properties outside cluster cores arewell-reproduced in the simulations that include cooling and star formation,while the non-radiative simulations predict an overall shape of the icmprofiles inconsistent with observations. in particular, we find that the icmentropy in our runs with cooling is enhanced to the observed levels at radii aslarge as half of the virial radius. we also find that outside cluster coresentropy scaling with the mean icm temperature in both simulations and chandraobservations is consistent with being self-similar within current error bars.we find that the pressure profiles of simulated clusters are also close toself-similar and exhibit little cluster-to-cluster scatter. the x-rayobservable-total mass relations for our simulated sample agree with the chandrameasurements to \~10%-20% in normalization. we show that this systematicdifference could be caused by the subsonic gas motions, unaccounted for inx-ray hydrostatic mass estimates. the much improved agreement of simulationsand observations in the icm profiles and scaling relations is encouraging andthe existence of tight relations of x-ray observables, such as yx, and totalcluster mass and the simple redshift evolution of these relations hold promisefor the use of clusters as cosmological probes.
