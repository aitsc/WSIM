0908.1359	the nature of pulsar radio emission	high-quality averaged radio profiles of some pulsars exhibit double, highlysymmetric features both in emission and absorption. it is shown that both typesof features are produced by a split-fan beam of extraordinary-mode curvatureradiation (cr) that is emitted/absorbed by radially-extended streams ofmagnetospheric plasma. with no emissivity in the plane of the stream, such abeam produces bifurcated emission components (bfcs) when our line of sightpasses through the plane. a distinct example of double component created inthat way is present in averaged profile of the 5 ms pulsar j1012+5307. we showthat the component can indeed be very well fitted by the textbook formula forthe non-coherent beam of curvature radiation in the polarisation state that isorthogonal to the plane of electron trajectory. the observed width of the bfcdecreases with increasing frequency at the rate that confirms the curvatureorigin. likewise, the double absorption features (double notches) are producedby the same beam of the extraordinary-mode cr, when it is eclipsed by thinplasma streams. the intrinsic property of cr to create bifurcated fan beamsexplains the double features in terms of very natural geometry and implies thecurvature origin of pulsar radio emission.

0911.3798	rotational asymmetry of pulsar profiles	we analyse the influence of rotation on shapes of pulse profiles offast-rotating (millisecond) pulsars. corotation has two opposing effects: 1)the caustic enhancement of the trailing side (ts) by aberration and retardation(ar), which squeezes the emission into a narrower phase interval; 2) theweakening of the ts caused by the asymmetry of curvature radiation about thedipole axis. analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in theinertial observer's frame (iof) enables these two effects to be consideredtogether. we demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the ts thereexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed. this phasecorresponds to the zero (or minimum) curvature of the iof trajectories andmaximum bunching of the emission. the maximum gradient of polarisation angle(pa) in the s-shaped pa curve is also associated with the curvature minimum andoccurs at exactly the same phase. the asymmetry of trajectory curvature withrespect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiencyof pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase. emission over afixed range of altitudes, as expected in millisecond pulsars, leads to broadleading profiles and sharp peaks with a cutoff phase on the ts. we apply ourresults to the main pulse of the 5 ms pulsar j1012+5307.

1201.4135	a multiwavelength view of the flaring state of pks 2155-304 in 2006	multiwavelength (mwl) observations of the blazar pks 2155-304 during twoweeks in july and august 2006, the period when two exceptional flares at veryhigh energies (vhe, e&gt;= 100 gev) occurred, provide a detailed picture of theevolution of its emission. the complete data set from this campaign ispresented, including observations in vhe gamma-rays (h.e.s.s.), x-rays (rxte,chandra, swift xrt), optical (swift uvot, bronberg, watcher, rotse), and in theradio band (nrt, hartrao, atca). optical and radio light curves from 2004 to2008 are compared to the available vhe data from this period, to put the 2006campaign into the context of the long-term evolution of the source. the x-rayand vhe gamma-ray emission are correlated during the observed high state of thesource, but show no direct connection with longer wavelengths. the long-termflux evolution in the optical and radio bands is found to be correlated andshows that the source reaches a high state at long wavelengths after theoccurrence of the vhe flares. spectral hardening is seen in the swift xrt data.the nightly averaged high-energy spectra of the non-flaring nights can bereproduced by a stationary one-zone ssc model, with only small variations inthe parameters. the spectral and flux evolution in the high-energy band duringthe night of the second vhe flare is modelled with multi-zone ssc models, whichcan provide relatively simple interpretations for the hour time-scale evolutionof the high-energy emission, even for such a complex data set. for the firsttime in this type of source, a clear indication is found for a relation betweenhigh activity at high energies and a long-term increase in the low frequencyfluxes.

1204.0452	asymmetry of bifurcated features in radio pulsar profiles	high-quality integrated radio profiles of some pulsars contain bifurcated,highly symmetric emission components (becs). they are observed when our line ofsight traverses through a split-fan shaped emission beam. it is shown that foroblique cuts through such a beam, the features appear asymmetric at nearly allfrequencies, except from a single `frequency of symmetry' nu_sym, at which bothpeaks in the bec have the same height. around nu_sym the ratio of flux in thetwo peaks of a bec evolves in a way resembling the multifrequency behaviour ofj1012+5307. because of the inherent asymmetry resulting from the obliquetraverse of sightline, each minimum in double notches can be modelledindependently. such a composed model reproduces the double notches of b1929+10if the fitted function is the microscopic beam of curvature radiation in theorthogonal polarisation mode. these results confirm our view that some of thedouble components in radio pulsar profiles directly reveal the microscopicnature of the emitted radiation beam as the microbeam of curvature radiationpolarised orthogonally to the trajectory of electrons.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1310.6956	hess j1818-154, a new composite supernova remnant discovered in tev  gamma rays and x-rays	composite supernova remnants (snrs) constitute a small subclass of theremnants of massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observedfrom both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula(pwn) located inside of the snr. these systems represent a unique evolutionaryphase of snrs where observations in the radio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray regimesallow the study of the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. in thisarticle, we report results from observations of the shell-type snr g15.4+0.1performed with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) and xmm-newton. acompact tev $\gamma$-ray source, hessj1818-154, located in the center andcontained within the shell of g15.4+0.1 is detected by h.e.s.s. and featurs aspectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of $-2.3\pm 0.3_{stat} \pm 0.2_{sys}$ and an integral flux off$(&gt;$0.42$\,\mathrm{tev}$)=($0.9 \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm0.2_{\mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. furthermore, a recentobservation with xmm-newton reveals extended x-ray emission strongly peaked inthe center of g15.4+0.1. the x-ray source shows indications of anenergy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 kevand more extended emission that fills the entire region within the snr at lowerenergies. together, the x-ray and vhe $\gamma$-ray emission provide strongevidence of a pwn located inside the shell of g15.4+0.1, and this snr cantherefore be classified as a \emph{composite} based on these observations. theradio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn is compatible with aone-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside theemission region. an unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which isthought to power the pwn, has been detected neither in radio nor in x-rayobservations of g15.4+0.1.

1311.4742	energy budget of the bifurcated component in the radio pulsar profile of  psr j1012+5307	the bifurcated emission component (bec) in the radio profile of themillisecond pulsar j1012+5307 can be interpreted as the signature of thecurvature radiation beam polarised orthogonally to the plane of electrontrajectory. since the beam is intrinsically narrow (~1 deg), the associatedemission region must be small for the observed bec to avoid smearing out byspatial convolution. we estimate whether the energy available in the stream issufficient to produce such a bright feature in the averaged profile. the energyconsiderations become complicated by the angular constraints imposed by thewidth of the microbeam, and by the specific spectrum of the bec which is foundto have the spectral index xi ~ -0.9 in comparison to the index of xi ~ -2 forthe total profile. for typical parameters, the luminosity of the bec isdetermined to be 4 10^{25} erg/s, whereas the maximum-possiblebeam-size-limited power of the stream is l_max ~ 2 10^{29} erg/s. this impliesthe minimum energy-conversion efficiency of eta ~ 2 10^{-4}. the bec'sluminosity does not exceed any absolute limits of energetics, in particular, itis smaller than the power of primary electron and/or secondary plasma stream.however, the implied efficiency of energy transfer into the radio band isextreme if the coherently emitting charge-separated plasma density is limitedto the goldreich-julian value. this suggests that the bifurcated shape of thebec has macroscopic origin, however, several uncertainties (eg. the dipoleinclination and spectral shape) make this conclusion not firm.

1411.0866	the origin of the frequency-dependent behaviour of pulsar radio profiles	we present further development of a pulsar emission model based on multiplestreams diverging away from the magnetic dipole axis, and formingazimuthally-structured fan-shaped beams. it is shown that this geometry,successfully tested on profiles with bifurcated features, naturally solvesseveral classical pulsar problems and avoids some difficulties of thetraditional nested cone/core model. this is best visible for profiles withseveral components, such as those of class t, q and m, because they mostclearly exhibit a range of effects previously interpreted within the conalmodel. in particular, with no reference to the flaring boundary of the polarmagnetic flux tube, the stream model explains the apparent radius-to-frequencymapping (rfm), including its reduced strength for the inner pair of components.the lag of the central component (apparent `core') with respect to thecentroids of the flanking (`conal') components can also be naturally explainedwith no reference to emission rings located at disparate altitudes. the streammodel also reveals why the millisecond pulsars, despite their more stronglyflaring magnetic field lines, do not exhibit as strong rfm as the normalpulsars. the model is then successful in reproducing properties of so disparateobjects as the m-class and millisecond pulsars, including some peculiarities ofthe latter. with no hesitation we, therefore, advance the view that pulsarshave fan beams generated by outflowing streams, whereas the nested cone/corebeams may well not exist at all.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

1412.2251	h.e.s.s. detection of tev emission from the interaction region between  the supernova remnant g349.7+0.2 and a molecular cloud	g349.7+0.2 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr) located at thedistance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrumfrom radio to high energy (he) gamma-rays. radio and infrared observationsindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. in this paper,the detection of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission coincident with thissnr with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is reported. anintegral flux f(e&gt;400gev)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/scorresponding to 0.7% of that of the crab nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index gamma_vhe = 2.8+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. the analysis of more than 5 yr of fermi-latdata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photonindex gamma_he = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. the combined gamma-ray spectrumof g349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (bpl) or apower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (plc). in the formercase, the photon break energy is found at e_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 gev, slightlyhigher than what is usually observed in the he/vhe gamma-ray emittingmiddle-aged snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. in the lattercase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measuredat e_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) tev. a pion-decayprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nucleiwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explainthe gamma-ray emission. the bpl with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the plcprovide equally good fits to the data. the product of the average gas densityand the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nh wp~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

1507.08454	the ratio of profile peak separations as a probe of pulsar radio-beam  structure	the known population of pulsars contains objects with four and five componentprofiles, for which the peak-to-peak separations between the inner and outercomponents can be measured. these q and m type profiles can be interpreted as aresult of sightline cut through a nested cone beam, or through a set ofazimuthal fan beams. we show that the ratio r_w of the components' separationsprovides a useful measure of the beam shape, which is mostly independent ofparameters that determine the beam scale and complicate interpretation ofsimpler profiles. in particular, the method does not depend on the emissionaltitude and the dipole tilt distribution. the different structures of theradio beam imply manifestly different statistical distributions of r_w, withthe conal model being several orders of magnitude less consistent with datathan the fan beam model. to bring the conal model into consistency with data,strong effects of observational selection need to be called for, with 80% of qand m profiles assumed to be undetected because of intrinsic blending effects.it is concluded that the statistical properties of q and m profiles are moreconsistent with the fan-shaped beams, than with the traditional nested conegeometry.

astro-ph;0003059	model of peak separation in the gamma lightcurve of the vela pulsar	the separation $\del$ between two peaks in the gamma-ray pulse profile iscalculated as a function of energy for several polar cap models withcurvature-radiation-induced cascades. the monte carlo results are interpretedwith the help of analytical approximations and discussed in view of the recentdata analysis for the vela pulsar (kanbach 1999). we find that the behaviour of$\del$ as a function of photon energy $\epsilon$ depends primarily on localvalues of the magnetic field, $b_{\rm local}$, in the region whereelectromagnetic cascades develop. for low values of $b_{\rm local}$ ($&lt;10^{12}$ g), $\del(\epsilon)$ is kept constant. however, for stronger magneticfields ($\ga 10^{12}$ g) in the hollow-column model $\del$ decreases withincreasing photon energy at a rate dependent on maximum energy of beamparticles as well as on viewing geometry. there exists a critical photon energy$\et$ above which the relation $\del(\epsilon)$ changes drastically: for$\epsilon &gt; \et$, in hollow-column models the separation $\del$ increases(whereas in filled-column model it decreases) rapidly with increasing$\epsilon$, at a rate of $\sim 0.28$ of the total phase per decade of photonenergy. the existence of critical energy $\et$ is a direct consequence ofone-photon magnetic absorption effects. in general, $\et$ is located close tothe high-energy cutoff of the spectrum, thus photon statistics at $\et$ shouldbe very low. that will make difficult to verify the existence of $\et$ in realgamma-ray pulsars. spectral properties of the vela pulsar would favour thosemodels which use low values of magnetic field in the emission region ($b_{\rmlocal} \simless 10^{11}$ g) which in turn implies a constant value of thepredicted $\del$ within egret range.

astro-ph;0003093	electron energy losses near pulsar polar caps: a monte carlo approach	we use monte carlo approach to study the energetics of electrons acceleratedin a pulsar polar gap. as energy-loss mechanisms we consider magnetic comptonscattering of thermal x-ray photons and curvature radiation. the results arecompared with previous calculations which assumed that changes of electronenergy occurred smoothly according to approximations for the average energyloss rate due to the compton scattering. we confirm a general dependence ofefficiency of electron energy losses due to inverse compton mechanism on thetemperature and size of a thermal polar cap and on the pulsar magnetic field.however, we show that trajectories of electrons in energy-altitude space ascalculated in the smooth way do not always coincide with averaged monte carlobehaviour. in particular, for pulsars with high magnetic field strength($b_{pc} &gt; 3\times 10^{12}$ g) and low thermal polar cap temperatures ($t &lt;5\times 10^6$ k) final electron lorentz factors computed with the two methodsmay differ by a few orders of magnitude. we discuss consequences for particularobjects with identified thermal x-ray spectral components like geminga, vela,and psr b1055-52.

astro-ph;0010301	model spectra of rotation powered pulsars in the integral range	the energy range of ibis is a promising ground for testing mutual relationsof distinct components expected in the spectra of high-energy radiation fromrotation powered pulsars. according to some polar-cap models two suchcomponents - due to curvature and synchrotron emission - may contributecomparable amounts of power between 15 kev and 10 mev (rudak &amp; dyks 1999).zhang &amp; harding (2000) argued recently for the inclusion of a third possiblecomponent, due to inverse compton scattering (ics) of soft thermal photons onsecondary $\epm$-pairs. here we present the results of monte carlo calculationsof all three spectral components within a polar-cap model which allows forinteractions of relativistic particles with the soft photons coming from thepulsar surface. for teragauss pulsars with the surface temperature of a fewtimes 10^5 k the ics component dominates the spectrum in the energy range below10 mev, and thus its presence increases the ratio of x-ray to gamma-rayluminosity (in comparison to the models ignoring the ics on secondary$\epm$-pairs) to a level observed in the vela pulsar.

astro-ph;0303006	two-pole caustic model for high-energy lightcurves of pulsars	we present a new model of high-energy lightcurves from rotation poweredpulsars. the key ingredient of the model is the gap region (i.e. the regionwhere particle acceleration is taking place and high-energy photons originate)which satisfies the following assumptions: i) the gap region extends from eachpolar cap to the light cylinder; ii) the gap is thin and confined to thesurface of last open magnetic-field lines; iii) photon emissivity is uniformwithin the gap region. the model lightcurves are dominated by strong peaks(either double or single) of caustic origin. unlike in other pulsar models withcaustic effects, the double peaks arise due to crossing two caustics, each ofwhich is associated with a different magnetic pole. the generic features of thelightcurves are consistent with the observed characteristics of pulsarlightcurves: 1) the most natural (in terms of probability) shape consists oftwo peaks (separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in phase for large viewing angles); 2) thepeaks posess well developed wings; 3) there is a bridge (inter-peak) emissioncomponent; 4) there is a non-vanishing off-pulse emission level; 5) the radiopulse occurs before the leading high-energy peak. the model is well suited forfour gamma-ray pulsars - crab, vela, geminga and b1951+32 - with double-peaklightcurves exhibiting the peak separation of 0.4 to 0.5 in phase. hereby, weapply the model to the vela pulsar. moreover, we indicate the limitation of themodel in accurate reproducing of the lightcurves with single pulses andnarrowly separated (about 0.2 in phase) pulse peaks. we also discuss theoptical polarization properties for the crab pulsar in the context of thetwo-pole caustic model.

astro-ph;0402507	rotational sweepback of magnetic field lines in geometrical models of  pulsar radio emission	we study the rotational distortions of the vacuum dipole magnetic field inthe context of geometrical models of the radio emission from pulsars. we findthat at low altitudes the rotation deflects the local direction of the magneticfield by at most an angle of the order of r_n^2, where r_n = r/rlc, r is theradial distance of the radio emission and rlc is the light cylinder radius. tothe second order in r_n, this distortion is symmetrical with respect to theplane containing the dipole axis and the rotation axis (omega-mu plane). thelowest order distortion which is asymmetrical with respect to the omega-muplane is third order in r_n. we show, however, that the influence of thesweepback on the outer boundary of the open field line region (open volume) isa much larger effect, of the order of r_n^1/2. the open volume is shiftedbackwards with respect to the rotation direction by an angle delta_ov ~ 0.2sin(alpha) r_n^1/2 where alpha is the dipole inclination with respect to therotation axis. the associated phase shift of the pulse profile delta_phi_ov ~0.2 r_n^1/2 can easily exceed the shift due to combined effects of aberrationand propagation time delays (=~ 2r_n). this strongly affects the misalignmentof the center of the pa curve and the center of the pulse profile, therebymodifying the delay-radius relation. contrary to intuition, the effect ofsweepback dominates over other effects when emission occurs at low altitudes.for r_n &lt;~ 0.003 the shift becomes negative, ie. the center of the positionangle curve precedes the profile center. with the sweepback effect included,the modified delay-radius relation predicts larger emission radii and is inmuch better agreement with the other methods of determining r_n.

astro-ph;0503411	pulsar shadow as the origin of double notches in radio pulse profiles	we present the model of eclipsing a rotating, spatially extended source ofdirectional emission by a central absorber, and apply it to the pulsarmagnetosphere. the model assumes the radially extended inward radio emissionalong the local direction of the magnetic field, and the pulsar as theabsorber. the geometry of the magnetic field lines of the rotating dipole isfavourable for the double eclipse events, which we identify with the doublenotches observed in pulse profiles of nearby pulsars. for pulsars with largedipole inclinations 70 &lt;~ alpha &lt;~ 110 deg the double notches are predicted tooccur within a narrow phase range of 20 to 30 deg before the main radio peak.application of the model to psr b0950+08 establishes it as a nearly orthogonalrotator (alpha =~ 75 deg, beta =~ -10 deg) with many pulse components naturallyinterpreted in terms of the inward radio emission from a large range ofaltitudes. the inward components include the intermittently strong, leadingcomponent of the main pulse, which would traditionally have been interpeted asa conal emission in the outward direction. the model also identifies themagnetic field lines along which the radially extended inward radio emissionoccurs in b0950+08. these have a narrow range of the footprint parameter sclose to 1.1 (closed field line region, near the last open field lines). wedescribe directional characteristics of inward emission from the radiallyextended region and compare them with characteristics of extended outwardemission. our work shows that pulse profiles of at least some pulsars may be asuperposition of both inward and outward emission.
