0706.1578	the origin of the magellanic stream and its leading arm	we explore the magellanic stream (ms) using a gaussian decomposition of thehi velocity profiles in the leiden-argentine-bonn (lab) all-sky hi survey. thisdecomposition exposes the ms to be composed of two filaments distinct bothspatially (as first pointed out by putman et al.) and in velocity. using thevelocity coherence of the filaments, one can be traced back to its origin inwhat we identify as the southeast hi overdensity (seho) of the large magellaniccloud (lmc), which includes 30 doradus. parts of the leading arm (la) can alsobe traced back to the seho in velocity and position. therefore, at leastone-half of the trailing stream and most of the la originates in the lmc,contrary to previous assertions that both the ms and the la originate in thesmall magellanic cloud (smc) and/or in the magellanic bridge. the two msfilaments show strong periodic, undulating spatial and velocity patterns thatwe speculate are an imprint of the lmc rotation curve. if true, then the driftrate of the stream gas away from the magellanic clouds is ~49 km/s and the ageof the ms is ~1.74 gyr. the staveley-smith et al. high-resolution hi data ofthe lmc show gas outflows from supergiant shells in the seho that seem to becreating the la and lmc filament of the ms. blowout of lmc gas is an effect notpreviously accounted for but one that probably plays an important role increating the ms and la.

0706.1975	proper motions in the galactic bulge: plaut's window	a proper motion study of a field of 20' x 20' inside plaut's low extinctionwindow (l,b)=(0 deg,-8 deg), has been completed. relative proper motions andphotographic bv photometry have been derived for ~21,000 stars reaching tov~20.5 mag, based on the astrometric reduction of 43 photographic plates,spanning over 21 years of epoch difference. proper motion errors are typically1 mas/yr and field dependent systematics are below 0.2 mas/yr.cross-referencing with the 2mass catalog yielded a sample of ~8,700 stars, fromwhich predominantly disk and bulge subsamples were selected photometricallyfrom the jh color-magnitude diagram. the two samples exhibited differentproper-motion distributions, with the disk displaying the expected reflex solarmotion as a function of magnitude. galactic rotation was also detected forstars between ~2 and ~3 kpc from us. the bulge sample, represented by redgiants, has an intrinsic proper motion dispersion of (sigma_l,sigma_b)=(3.39,2.91)+/-(0.11,0.09) mas/yr, which is in good agreement with previous results,and indicates a velocity anisotropy consistent with either rotationalbroadening or tri-axiality. a mean distance of 6.37^{+0.87}_{-0.77} kpc hasbeen estimated for the bulge sample, based on the observed k magnitude of thehorizontal branch red clump. the metallicity [m/h] distribution was alsoobtained for a subsample of 60 bulge giants stars, based on calibratedphotometric indices. the observed [m/h] shows a peak value at [m/h]~-0.1 withan extended metal poor tail and around 30% of the stars with supersolarmetallicity. no change in proper motion dispersion was observed as a functionof [m/h]. we are currently in the process of obtaining ccd ubvri photometry forthe entire proper-motion sample of ~21,000 stars.

0902.2591	the role of dwarf galaxies in building large stellar halos	the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation rests on the idea that smallergalactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. the pastdecade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, drivenin part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. multi-object spectroscopyenabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the milky wayand m31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. improvements inhigh-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundancepatterns of the milky way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained bygalactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.  these breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearbystars in the milky way and luminous red giant stars in m31 and local groupdwarf satellites. in the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allowobservations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, andthey will enable observations of individual stars far out in the galactic halo.the chemical abundance census now available for the milky way will becomepossible for our nearest neighbor, m31. velocity dispersion measurements nowavailable in m31 will become possible for systems beyond the local group suchas sculptor and m81 group galaxies. detailed studies of a greater number ofindividual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satelliteswill test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemicalevolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses indifferent environments.

0902.2759	galactic dynamics and local dark matter	the concordance lambda cold dark matter (lambda-cdm) model for the formationof structure in the universe, while remarkably successful at describingobservations of structure on large scales, continues to be challenged byobservations on galactic scales. fortunately, cdm models and their variousproposed alternatives make a rich variety of testable predictions that make thelocal group and our own milky way galaxy key laboratories for exploring darkmatter (dm) in this regime. however, some of the most definitive tests of localdm require microarcsecond astrometry of faint sources, an astrometric regimethat is a unique niche of sim lite. this chapter explores the important anddistinct contributions that can be made by sim lite in the exploration ofgalaxy dynamics and dm on galaxy scales and that have cosmologicalconsequences. key areas of potential sim lite exploration include (1) measuringthe shape, orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark halo of themilky way and other nearby galaxies, (2) determining the orbits of galacticsatellites, which may be representatives of late infall from the hierarchicalformation of the milky way, (3) ascertaining the distribution of angularmomentum and orbital anisotropy of stars and globular clusters to the outerreaches of the galactic halo, dynamical properties that hold clues to the earlyhierarchical formation of the galaxy, (4) measuring the physical nature of dmby placing strong constraints on the phase space density in the cores of nearbydsph galaxies, and (5) reconstructing the dynamical history of the local groupthrough the determination of orbits and masses of its constituent galaxies.

0902.2835	properties of dark matter revealed by astrometric measurements of the  milky way and local galaxies	the fact that dark matter (dm), thus far, has revealed itself only on scalesof galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and theresponsibility to confront the age old mystery "what is the nature of matter?"by deriving basic data on the nature of dm - e.g., mass of its particle(s),present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in theuniverse, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering theproperties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantlyextending the standard models of particle physics. determining the mass of thedm particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle familyto which it (or they) belongs. beyond mass, there are issues of stability. thedm particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may becomeunstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. in bothcases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component.  some key parameters of dm can most accurately be measured in the very nearbyuniverse because dm dominates the mass in the outer milky way (mw), in othergalaxies in the local group, and in the local group in its entirety. thepresence and amount of dm can be quantified by study of dynamical processesobservable in fine detail within these entities. precise measurements of 3-dvelocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellarsystems out to the edge of the galaxy can reveal "what is the shape,orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo" as well as"what is the total mass of the galaxy?"

0906.1587	the role of planet accretion in creating the next generation of red  giant rapid rotators	rapid rotation in field red giant stars is a relatively rare but well-studiedphenomenon; here we investigate the potential role of planet accretion inspinning up these stars. using zahn's theory of tidal friction and stellarevolution models, we compute the decay of a planet's orbit into its evolvinghost star and the resulting transfer of angular momentum into the stellarconvective envelope. this experiment assesses the frequency of planet ingestionand rapid rotation on the red giant branch (rgb) for a sample of 99 knownexoplanet host stars. we find that the known exoplanets are indeed capable ofcreating rapid rotators; however, the expected fraction due to planet ingestionis only ~10% of the total seen in surveys of present-day red giants. of theplanets ingested, we find that those with smaller initial semimajor axes aremore likely to create rapid rotators because these planets are accreted whenthe stellar moment of inertia is smallest. we also find that many planets maybe ingested prior to the rgb phase, contrary to the expectation that accretionwould generally occur when the stellar radii expand significantly as giants.finally, our models suggest that the rapid rotation signal from ingestedplanets is most likely to be seen on the lower rgb, which is also wherealternative mechanisms for spin-up, e.g., angular momentum dredged up from thestellar core, do not operate. thus, rapid rotators on the lower rgb are thebest candidates to search for definitive evidence of systems that haveexperienced planet accretion.

0908.3187	evidence for a triaxial milky way dark matter halo from the sagittarius  stellar tidal stream	observations of the lengthy tidal streams produced by the destruction of thesagittarius dwarf spheroidal (sgr dsph) are capable of providing strongconstraints on the shape of the galactic gravitational potential. however,previous work, based on modeling different stream properties in axisymmetricgalactic models has yielded conflicting results: while the angular precessionof the sgr leading arm is most consistent with a spherical or slightly oblatehalo, the radial velocities of stars in this arm are only reproduced by prolatehalo models. we demonstrate that this apparent paradox can be resolved byinstead adopting a triaxial potential. our new galactic halo model, whichsimultaneously fits all well-established phase space constraints from the sgrstream, provides the first conclusive evidence for, and tentative measurementof, triaxiality in an individual dark matter halo. the milky way halo within ~60 kpc is best characterized by a minor/major axis ratio of the isovelocitycontours c/a ~ 0.67, intermediate/major axis ratio b/a ~ 0.83, and triaxialityparameter t ~ 0.56. in this model, the minor axis of the dark halo iscoincident with the galactic x axis connecting the sun and the galactic centerto within ~ 15 degrees, while the major axis also lies in the galactic plane,approximately along the galactic y axis.

1003.1132	the sagittarius dwarf galaxy: a model for evolution in a triaxial milky  way halo	we present a new n-body model for the tidal disruption of the sagittarius(sgr) dwarf that is capable of simultaneously satisfying the majority ofangular position, distance, and radial velocity constraints imposed by currentwide-field surveys of its dynamically young (&lt; 3 gyr) tidal debris streams. inparticular, this model resolves the conflicting angular position and radialvelocity constraints on the sgr leading tidal stream that have been highlightedin recent years. while the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcationobserved in the leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest thatthis bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of thesgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. the key element in the successof this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric component to thegalactic gravitational potential which can be described in terms of a triaxialdark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio (c/a)_phi = 0.72 andintermediate/major axis ratio (b/a)_phi = 0.99 at radii 20 &lt; r &lt; 60 kpc. theminor/intermediate/major axes of this halo lie along the directions (l, b) =(7, 0), (0, 90), and (97, 0) respectively, corresponding to a nearly-oblateellipsoid whose minor axis is contained within the galactic disk plane. wedemonstrate that with simple assumptions about the star formation history ofsgr, tidal stripping models naturally give rise to gradients in the metallicitydistribution function (mdf) along the stellar debris streams similar to thoseobserved in recent studies.

1005.5390	assessing the milky way satellites associated with the sagittarius dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	numerical models of the tidal disruption of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarfgalaxy have recently been developed that for the first time simultaneouslysatisfy most observational constraints on the angular position, distance, andradial velocity trends of both leading and trailing tidal streams emanatingfrom the dwarf. we use these dynamical models in combination with extant 3-dposition and velocity data for galactic globular clusters and dsph galaxies toidentify those milky way satellites that are likely to have originally formedin sgr and been stripped from it during its extended interaction with the milkyway. we conclude that the globular clusters arp 2, m 54, ngc 5634, terzan 8,and whiting 1 are likely associated with the sgr dwarf, and that berkeley 29,ngc 5053, pal 12, and terzan 7 may be as well. the initial sgr system thereforemay have contained 5-9 globular clusters, corresponding to a specific frequencys_n = 5 - 9 for an initial sgr luminosity m_v = -15.0. our result is consistentwith the 8\pm2 sgr globular clusters expected from statistical modeling of thegalactic globular cluster distribution and the corresponding false-associationrate due to chance alignments with the sgr streams. these clusters areconsistent with previous reconstructions of the sgr age-metallicity relation,and show no evidence for a second-parameter effect shaping their horizontalbranch morphologies. we find no statistically significant evidence to suggestthat any of the recently discovered population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxiesare conclusively associated with the sgr tidal streams.

1011.4516	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra. ii.  catalog of stars in milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we present a catalog of fe, mg, si, ca, and ti abundances for 2961 red giantstars that are likely members of eight dwarf satellite galaxies of the milkyway (mw): sculptor, fornax, leo i, sextans, leo ii, canes venatici i, ursaminor, and draco. for the purposes of validating our measurements, we alsoobserved 445 red giants in mw globular clusters and 21 field red giants in themw halo. the measurements are based on keck/deimos medium-resolutionspectroscopy combined with spectral synthesis. we estimate uncertainties in[fe/h] by quantifying the dispersion of [fe/h] measurements in a sample ofstars in monometallic globular clusters. we estimate uncertainties in mg, si,ca, and ti abundances by comparing our medium-resolution spectroscopicmeasurements to high-resolution spectroscopic abundances of the same stars. forthis purpose, our deimos sample included 132 red giants with publishedhigh-resolution spectroscopy in globular clusters, the mw halo field, and dwarfgalaxies. the standard deviations of the differences in [fe/h] and [alpha/fe](the average of [mg/fe], [si/fe], [ca/fe], and [ti/fe]) between the two samplesis 0.15 and 0.16, respectively. this catalog represents the largest sample ofmulti-element abundances in dwarf galaxies to date. the next papers in thisseries draw conclusions on the chemical evolution, gas dynamics, and starformation histories from the catalog presented here. the wide range of dwarfgalaxy luminosity reveals the dependence of dwarf galaxy chemical evolution ongalaxy stellar mass.

1011.5221	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra. iv.  alpha element distributions in milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we derive the star formation histories of eight dwarf spheroidal (dsph) milkyway satellite galaxies from their alpha element abundance patterns. nearly 3000stars from our previously published catalog (paper ii) comprise our data set.the average [alpha/fe] ratios for all dsphs follow roughly the same path withincreasing [fe/h]. we do not observe the predicted knees in the [alpha/fe] vs.[fe/h] diagram, corresponding to the metallicity at which type ia supernovaebegin to explode. instead, we find that type ia supernova ejecta contribute tothe abundances of all but the most metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -2.5) stars. we havealso developed a chemical evolution model that tracks the star formation rate,types ii and ia supernova explosions, and supernova feedback. without metalenhancement in the supernova blowout, massive amounts of gas loss define thehistory of all dsphs except fornax, the most luminous in our sample. all six ofthe best-fit model parameters correlate with dsph luminosity but not withvelocity dispersion, half-light radius, or galactocentric distance.

1012.3515	group finding in the stellar halo using photometric surveys: current  sensitivity and future prospects	the ubiquity of substructure in the stellar halo has already beendemonstrated by the sdss and 2mass and future surveys promise to explore thehalo in ever more detail. this paper examines what can be learnt from currentand future photometric-databases using group-finding techniques. we comparegroups recovered from a sample of m-giants from 2mass with those found insynthetic surveys of simulated $\lambda$cdm stellar halos and demonstrate broadconsistency. we also find that these recovered groups are likely to representthe majority of high-luminosity ($\log(l/l_{sun})&gt;6.67$) satellites accretedwithin the last 10 gyr and on orbits with apocenters within 100 kpc. howeverthe sensitivity of the m-giant survey to accretion events that were eitherancient, from low-luminosity objects or those on radial orbits is limitedbecause of the low number of stars, bias towards high-metallicity stars and theshallow depth. we examine the extent to which these limitations are addressedby current and future surveys, in particular catalogues of main-sequenceturn-off (msto) stars from sdss and lsst, and of rr-lyrae stars from lsst orpanstarrs. the msto surveys are more sensitive to low-luminosity events($\log(l/l_{sun}~5$ or less) than the 2mass m-giant sample, while the rr-lyraesurveys, with superior depth, are good at detecting events on highly eccentricorbits. when combined we expect these photometric surveys to provide acomprehensive picture of the last 10 gyr of galactic accretion. events olderthan this are too phase mixed to be discovered and would require additionalinformation such as velocity and chemical abundance.

1102.5366	candidate x-ray-emitting ob stars in the carina nebula identified via  infrared spectral energy distributions	we report the results of a new survey of massive, ob stars throughout thecarina nebula using the x-ray point source catalog provided by the chandracarina complex project (cccp) in conjunction with infrared (ir) photometry fromthe two micron all-sky survey and the spitzer space telescope vela--carinasurvey. mid-ir photometry is relatively unaffected by extinction, hence itprovides strong constraints on the luminosities of ob stars, assuming thattheir association with the carina nebula, and hence their distance, isconfirmed. we fit model stellar atmospheres to the optical (ubv) and irspectral energy distributions (seds) of 182 ob stars with known spectral typesand measure the bolometric luminosity and extinction for each star. we findthat the extinction law measured toward the ob stars has two components:av=1--1.5 mag produced by foreground dust with a ratio of total-to-selectiveabsorption rv=3.1 plus a contribution from local dust with rv&gt;4.0 in the carinamolecular clouds that increases as av increases. using x-ray emission as astrong indicator of association with carina, we identify 94 candidate ob starswith lbol\geq10^4 lsun by fitting their ir seds. if the candidate ob stars areeventually confirmed by follow-up spectroscopic observations, the number ofcataloged ob stars in the carina nebula will increase by ~50%. correcting forincompleteness due to ob stars falling below the lbol cutoff or the cccpdetection limit, these results potentially double the size of the young massivestellar population.

1103.1387	the frequency of rapid rotation among k giant stars	we present the results of a search for unusually rapidly rotating giant starsin a large sample of k giants (~1300 stars) that had been spectroscopicallymonitored as potential targets for the space interferometry mission'sastrometric grid. the stars in this catalog are much fainter and typically moremetal-poor than those of other catalogs of red giant star rotationalvelocities, but the spectra generally only have signal-to-noise (s/n) of~20-60, making the measurement of the widths of individual lines difficult. tocompensate for this, we have developed a cross-correlation method to deriverotational velocities in moderate s/n echelle spectra to efficiently probe thissample for rapid rotator candidates. we have discovered 28 new red giant rapidrotators as well as one extreme rapid rotator with a vsini of 86.4 km/s. rapidrotators comprise 2.2% of our sample, which is consistent with other surveys ofbrighter, more metal-rich k giant stars. although we find that the temperaturedistribution of rapid rotators is similar to that of the slow rotators, thismay not be the case with the distributions of surface gravity and metallicity.the rapid rotators show a slight overabundance of low gravity stars and as agroup are significantly more metal-poor than the slow rotators, which mayindicate that the rotators are tidally-locked binaries.

1103.2060	a pan-carina yso catalog: intermediate-mass young stellar objects in the  carina nebula identified via mid-infrared excess emission	we present a catalog of 1439 young stellar objects (ysos) spanning the 1.42deg^2 field surveyed by the chandra carina complex project (cccp), whichincludes the major ionizing clusters and the most active sites of ongoing starformation within the great nebula in carina. candidate ysos were identified viainfrared (ir) excess emission from dusty circumstellar disks and envelopes,using data from the spitzer space telescope vela--carina survey and thetwo-micron all sky survey. we model the 1--24 /mu m ir spectral energydistributions of the ysos to constrain physical properties. our pan-carina ysocatalog (pcyc) is dominated by intermediate-mass (2 msun &lt; m &lt; 10 msun) objectswith disks, including herbig ae/be stars and their less evolved progenitors.the pcyc provides a valuable complementary dataset to the cccp x-ray sourcecatalogs, identifying 1029 ysos in carina with no x-ray detection. we alsocatalog 410 ysos with x-ray counterparts, including 62 candidate protostars.candidate protostars with x-ray detections tend to be more evolved than thosewithout. in most cases, x-ray emission apparently originating fromintermediate-mass, disk-dominated ysos is consistent with the presence oflow-mass companions, but we also find that x-ray emission correlates withcooler stellar photospheres and higher disk masses. we suggest thatintermediate-mass ysos produce x-rays during their early pre-main sequenceevolution, perhaps driven by magnetic dynamo activity during the convectiveatmosphere phase, but this emission dies off as the stars approach the mainsequence. extrapolating over the stellar initial mass function scaled to thepcyc population, we predict a total population of &gt;2x10^4 ysos and apresent-day star formation rate (sfr) of &gt;0.008 msun/yr. the global sfr in thecarina nebula, averaged over the past ~5 myr, has been approximately constant.

1104.2594	discovery of a large stellar periphery around the small magellanic cloud	the magellanic clouds are a local laboratory for understanding the evolutionand properties of dwarf irregular galaxies. to reveal the extended structureand interaction history of the magellanic clouds we have undertaken alarge-scale photometric and spectroscopic study of their stellar periphery (themagellanic periphery survey, maps). we present first maps results for the smallmagellanic cloud (smc): washington m, t2 + ddo51 photometry reveals metal-poorred giant branch stars in the smc that extend to large radii (~11 kpc), aredistributed nearly azimuthally symmetrically (ellipticity=0.1), and arewell-fitted by an exponential profile (out to r~7.5 deg). an ~6 gyr old, [fe/h]-1.3 main-sequence turnoff is also evident to at least r=7.3 deg, and as far as8.4 deg in some directions. we find evidence for a "break" population beyond ~8radial scalelengths having a very shallow radial density profile that could beeither a bound stellar halo or a population of extratidal stars. thedistribution of the intermediate stellar component (3&lt;r&lt;7.5 deg) contrasts withthat of the inner stellar component (r&lt;3 deg), which is both more elliptical(ellipticity~0.3) and offset from the center of the intermediate component by0.59 deg, although both components share a similar radial exponential scalelength. this offset is likely due to a perspective effect because stars on theeastern side of the smc are closer on average than stars on the western side.this mapping of its outer stellar structures indicates that the smc is morecomplex than previously thought.

1106.2542	lifting the dusty veil with near- and mid-infrared photometry: i.  description and applications of the rayleigh-jeans color excess method	the milky way (mw) remains a primary laboratory for understanding thestructure and evolution of spiral galaxies, but typically we are denied clearviews of mw stellar populations at low galactic latitudes because of extinctionby interstellar dust. however, the combination of 2mass near-infrared (nir) andspitzer-irac mid-infrared (mir) photometry enables a powerful method fordetermining the line of sight reddening to any star: the sampled wavelengthslie in the rayleigh-jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of moststars, where, to first order, all stars have essentially the same intrinsiccolor. thus, changes in stellar nir-mir colors due to interstellar reddeningare readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colorsand magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to theirintrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for galactic structurestudies. in this paper we explore this "rayleigh-jeans color excess" (rjce)method and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the rjce methodbased on a single reference color, (h-[4.5um]), can rather accurately removedust effects from previously uninterpretable 2mass color-magnitude diagrams ofstars in fields along the heavily reddened galactic mid-plane, with results farsuperior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods. wealso show that "total" galactic midplane extinction looks rather different fromthat predicted using 100um emission maps from the iras/issa and cobe/dirbeinstruments as presented by schlegel et al. instead, the galactic mid-planeextinction strongly resembles the distribution of 13-co (j=1-&gt;0) emission.future papers will focus on refining the rjce method and applying the techniqueto understand better not only dust and its distribution, but the distributionof stars intermixed with the dust in the low-latitude galaxy.

1111.0014	kinematics and chemistry of stars along the sagittarius trailing tidal  tail and constraints on the milky way mass distribution	we present three-dimensional kinematics of sagittarius (sgr) trailing tidaldebris in six fields located 70-130 degrees along the stream from the sgr dwarfgalaxy core. the data are from our proper-motion (pm) survey of kapteyn'sselected areas, in which we have measured accurate pms to faint magnitudes in40x40 arcmin fields evenly spaced across the sky. the radial velocity (rv)signature of sgr has been identified among our follow-up spectroscopic data infour of the six fields and combined with mean pms ofspectroscopically-confirmed members to derive space motions of sgr debris basedon 15-64 confirmed stream members per field. these kinematics are compared topredictions of the law &amp; majewski (2010) model of sgr disruption; we findreasonable agreement with model predictions in rvs and pms along galacticlatitude. however, an upward adjustment of the local standard of rest velocitytheta_lsr from its standard 220 km/s to at least $232\pm14$ km/s (and possiblyas high as $264\pm23$ km/s) is necessary to bring 3-d model debris kinematicsand our measurements into agreement. satisfactory model fits thatsimultaneously reproduce known position, distance, and radial velocity trendsof the sgr tidal streams, while significantly increasing theta_lsr}, could onlybe achieved by increasing the galactic bulge and disk mass while leaving thedark matter halo fixed to the best-fit values from law &amp; majewski (2010). wederive low-resolution spectroscopic abundances along this stretch of the sgrstream and find a constant [fe/h] = -1.15 (with ~0.5 dex scatter in each field-- typical for dwarf galaxy populations) among the four fields with reliablemeasurements. a constant metallicity suggests that debris along the ~60-degreespan of this study was all stripped from sgr on the same orbital passage.

1111.4985	milky way tomography iv: dissecting dust	we use sdss photometry of 73 million stars to simultaneously obtain best-fitmain-sequence stellar energy distribution (sed) and amount of dust extinctionalong the line of sight towards each star. using a subsample of 23 millionstars with 2mass photometry, whose addition enables more robust results, weshow that sdss photometry alone is sufficient to break degeneracies betweenintrinsic stellar color and dust amount when the shape of extinction curve isfixed. when using both sdss and 2mass photometry, the ratio of the total toselective absorption, $r_v$, can be determined with an uncertainty of about 0.1for most stars in high-extinction regions. these fits enable detailed studiesof the dust properties and its spatial distribution, and of the stellar spatialdistribution at low galactic latitudes. our results are in good agreement withthe extinction normalization given by the schlegel et al. (1998, sfd) dust mapsat high northern galactic latitudes, but indicate that the sfd extinction mapappears to be consistently overestimated by about 20% in the southern sky, inagreement with schlafly et al. (2010). the constraints on the shape of the dustextinction curve across the sdss and 2mass bandpasses support the models byfitzpatrick (1999) and cardelli et al. (1989). for the latter, we find an$r_v=3.0\pm0.1$(random) $\pm0.1$(systematic) over most of the high-latitudesky. at low galactic latitudes (|b|&lt;5), we demonstrate that the sfd map cannotbe reliably used to correct for extinction as most stars are embedded in dust,rather than behind it. we introduce a method for efficient selection ofcandidate red giant stars in the disk, dubbed "dusty parallax relation", whichutilizes a correlation between distance and the extinction along the line ofsight. we make these best-fit parameters, as well as all the input sdss and2mass data, publicly available in a user-friendly format.

1112.5336	the shapes of milky way satellites: looking for signatures of tidal  stirring	we study the shapes of milky way satellites in the context of the tidalstirring scenario for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the standardprocedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data andthus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which areusually subtle in low surface brightness systems. taking advantage of the factthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introducediscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and thefourier bar mode. we apply these measures of shape first to a variety ofsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in darkmatter halos and orbiting the milky way. in addition to strong mass loss andrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformationthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the firstpericenter passage. these tidally induced bars persist for a few gyr beforebeing shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strongenough. we test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape ofnearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the milky way. we detect inner bars inursa minor, sagittarius, lmc and possibly carina. in addition, six out ofeleven studied dwarfs show elongated stellar distributions in the outer partsthat may signify transition to tidal tails. we thus find the shapes of milkyway satellites to be consistent with the predictions of the tidal stirringmodel.

1202.5311	probing the halo from the solar vicinity to the outer galaxy: connecting  stars in local velocity structures to large-scale clouds	(abridged) this paper presents the first connections made between two localfeatures in velocity-space found in a survey of m giant stars and stellarspatial inhomogeneities on global scales. comparison to cosmological,chemodynamical stellar halo models confirm that the m giant population isparticularly sensitive to rare, recent and massive accretion events. theseevents can give rise to local observed velocity sequences - a signature of asmall fraction of debris from a common progenitor, passing at high velocitythrough the survey volume, near the pericenters of their eccentric orbits. themajority of the debris is found in much larger structures, whose morphologiesare more cloud-like than stream-like and which lie at the orbital apocenters.adopting this interpretation, the full-space motions represented by theobserved velocity features are derived under the assumption that the memberswithin each sequence share a common velocity. orbit integrations are then usedto trace the past and future trajectories of these stars across the skyrevealing plausible associations with large, previously-discovered, cloud-likestructures. the connections made between nearby velocity structures and thesedistant clouds represent preliminary steps towards developing coherent maps ofsuch giant debris systems. these maps promise to provide new insights into theorigin of debris clouds, new probes of galactic history and structure, and newconstraints on the high-velocity tails of the local dark matter distributionthat are essential for interpreting direct detection experiments.

1208.1775	observable signatures of planet accretion in red giant stars i: rapid  rotation and light element replenishment	the orbital angular momentum of a close-orbiting giant planet can besufficiently large that, if transferred to the envelope of the host star duringthe red giant branch (rgb) evolution, it can spin-up the star's rotation tounusually large speeds. this spin-up mechanism is one possible explanation forthe rapid rotators detected among the population of generally slow-rotating redgiant stars. these rapid rotators thus comprise a unique stellar samplesuitable for searching for signatures of planet accretion in the form ofunusual stellar abundances due to the dissemination of the accreted planet inthe stellar envelope. in this study, we look for signatures of replenishment inthe li abundances and (to a lesser extent) 12c/13c, which are both normallylowered during rgb evolution. accurate abundances were measured from highsignal-to-noise echelle spectra for samples of both slow and rapid rotator redgiant stars. we find that the rapid rotators are on average enriched in lithiumcompared to the slow rotators, but both groups of stars have identicaldistributions of 12c/13c within our measurement precision. both of theseabundance results are consistent with the accretion of planets of only a fewjupiter masses. we also explore alternative scenarios for understanding themost li-rich stars in our sample---particularly li regeneration during variousstages of stellar evolution. finally, we find that our stellar samples shownon-standard abundances even at early rgb stages, suggesting that initialprotostellar li abundances and 12c/13c may be more variable than originallythought.

1209.0759	the milky way's circular velocity curve between 4 and 14 kpc from apogee  data	we measure the milky way's rotation curve over the galactocentric range 4 kpc&lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc from the first year of data from the apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee). we model the line-of-sight velocitiesof 3,365 stars in fourteen fields with b = 0 deg between 30 deg &lt; l &lt; 210 degout to distances of 10 kpc using an axisymmetric kinematical model thatincludes a correction for the asymmetric drift of the warm tracer population(\sigma_r ~ 35 km/s). we determine the local value of the circular velocity tobe v_c(r_0) = 218 +/- 6 km/s and find that the rotation curve is approximatelyflat with a local derivative between -3.0 km/s/kpc and 0.4 km/s/kpc. we alsomeasure the sun's position and velocity in the galactocentric rest frame,finding the distance to the galactic center to be 8 kpc &lt; r_0 &lt; 9 kpc, radialvelocity v_{r,sun} = -10 +/- 1 km/s, and rotational velocity v_{\phi,sun} =242^{+10}_{-3} km/s, in good agreement with local measurements of the sun'sradial velocity and with the observed proper motion of sgr a*. we investigatevarious systematic uncertainties and find that these are limited to offsets atthe percent level, ~2 km/s in v_c. marginalizing over all the systematics thatwe consider, we find that v_c(r_0) &lt; 235 km/s at &gt;99% confidence. we find anoffset between the sun's rotational velocity and the local circular velocity of26 +/- 3 km/s, which is larger than the locally-measured solar motion of 12km/s. this larger offset reconciles our value for v_c with recent claims thatv_c &gt;~ 240 km/s. combining our results with other data, we find that the milkyway's dark-halo mass within the virial radius is ~8x10^{11} m_sun.

1210.3362	global properties of m31's stellar halo from the splash survey. i.  surface brightness profile	we present the surface brightness profile of m31's stellar halo out to aprojected radius of 175 kpc. the surface brightness estimates are based onconfirmed samples of m31 red giant branch stars derived from keck/deimosspectroscopic observations. a set of empirical spectroscopic and photometricm31 membership diagnostics is used to identify and reject foreground andbackground contaminants. this enables us to trace the stellar halo of m31 tolarger projected distances and fainter surface brightnesses than previousphotometric studies. the surface brightness profile of m31's halo follows apower-law with index -2.2 +/- 0.2 and extends to a projected distance of atleast ~175 kpc (~ 2/3 of m31's virial radius), with no evidence of a downwardbreak at large radii. the best-fit elliptical isophotes have b/a=0.94 with themajor axis of the halo aligned along the minor axis of m31's disk, consistentwith a prolate halo, although the data are also consistent with m31's halohaving spherical symmetry. the fact that tidal debris features arekinematically cold is used to identify substructure in the spectroscopic fieldsout to projected radii of 90 kpc, and investigate the effect of thissubstructure on the surface brightness profile. the scatter in the surfacebrightness profile is reduced when kinematically identified tidal debrisfeatures in m31 are statistically subtracted; the remaining profile indicates acomparatively diffuse stellar component to m31's stellar halo exists to largedistances. beyond 90 kpc, kinematically cold tidal debris features can not beidentified due to small number statistics; nevertheless, the significantfield-to-field variation in surface brightness beyond 90 kpc suggests that theoutermost region of m31's halo is also comprised to a significant degree ofstars stripped from accreted objects.

1301.1367	very metal-poor stars in the outer galactic bulge found by the apogee  survey	despite its importance for understanding the nature of early stellargenerations and for constraining galactic bulge formation models, at presentlittle is known about the metal-poor stellar content of the central milky way.this is a consequence of the great distances involved and intervening dustobscuration, which challenge optical studies. however, the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee), a wide-area, multifiber,high-resolution spectroscopic survey within sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii), is exploring the chemistry of all galactic stellar populations atinfrared wavelengths, with particular emphasis on the disk and the bulge. anautomated spectral analysis of data on 2,403 giant stars in twelve fields inthe bulge obtained during apogee commissioning yielded five stars with lowmetallicity([fe/h]$\le-1.7$), including two that are very metal-poor[fe/h]$\sim-2.1$ by bulge standards.  luminosity-based distance estimates place the five stars within the outerbulge, where other 1,246 of the analyzed stars may reside. a manual reanalysisof the spectra verifies the low metallicities, and finds these stars to beenhanced in the $\alpha$-elements o, mg, and si without significant$\alpha$-pattern differences with other local halo or metal-weak thick-diskstars of similar metallicity, or even with other more metal-rich bulge stars.while neither the kinematics nor chemistry of these stars can yet definitivelydetermine which, if any, are truly bulge members, rather than denizens of otherpopulations co-located with the bulge, the newly-identified stars reveal thatthe chemistry of metal-poor stars in the central galaxy resembles that ofmetal-weak thick-disk stars at similar metallicity.

0712.4312	modeling the structure and dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with  dark matter and tides	we report the results of n-body simulations of disrupting satellites aimed atexploring whether the observed features of dsphs can be accounted for withsimple, mass-follows-light (mfl) models including tidal disruption. as a testcase, we focus on the carina dwarf spheroidal (dsph), which presently has themost extensive data at large radius. we find that previous n-body, mflsimulations of dsphs did not sufficiently explore the parameter space ofsatellite mass, density and orbital shape to find adequate matches to galacticdsph systems, whereas with a systematic survey of parameter space we are ableto find tidally disrupting, mfl satellite models that rather faithfullyreproduce carina's velocity profile, velocity dispersion profile and projecteddensity distribution over its entire sampled radius. the successful mfl modelsatellites have very eccentric orbits, currently favored by cold dark matter(cdm) models, and central velocity dispersions that still yield an accuraterepresentation of the bound mass and observed central m/l~40 of carina, despiteinflation of the velocity dispersion outside the dsph core by unbound debris.our survey of parameter space also allows us to address a number of commonlyheld misperceptions of tidal disruption and its observable effects on dsphstructure and dynamics. the simulations suggest that even modest tidaldisruption can have a profound effect on the observed dynamics of dsph stars atlarge radii. satellites that are well-described by tidally disrupting mflmodels could still be fully compatible with l-cdm if for example they representa later stage in the evolution of luminous subhalos.

1309.5535	discovery of a dynamical cold point in the heart of the sagittarius dsph  galaxy with observations from the apogee project	the dynamics of the core of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dsph)galaxy are explored using high-resolution (r~22,500), h-band, near-infraredspectra of over 1,000 giant stars in the central 3 deg^2 of the system, ofwhich 328 are identified as sgr members. these data, among some of the earliestobservations from the sdss-iii/apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment (apogee) and the largest published sample of high resolution sgrdsph spectra to date, reveal a distinct gradient in the velocity dispersion ofsgr from 11-14 km/s for radii &gt;0.8 degrees from center to a dynamical coldpoint of 8 km/s in the sgr center --- a trend differing from that found inprevious kinematical analyses of sgr over larger scales that suggest a more orless flat dispersion profile at these radii. well-fitting mass models witheither cored and cusped dark matter distributions can be found to match thekinematical results, although the cored profile succeeds with significantlymore isotropic stellar orbits than required for a cusped profile. it isunlikely that the cold point reflects an unusual mass distribution. thedispersion gradient may arise from variations in the mixture of populationswith distinct kinematics within the dsph; this explanation is suggested (e.g.,by detection of a metallicity gradient across similar radii), but notconfirmed, by the present data. despite these remaining uncertainties abouttheir interpretation, these early test data (including some from instrumentcommissioning) demonstrate apogee's usefulness for precision dynamical studies,even for fields observed at extreme airmasses.

0801.4657	discovery of a giant stellar tidal stream around the disk galaxy ngc  4013	we report the discovery of a giant, loop-like stellar structure around theedge-on spiral galaxy ngc 4013. this arcing feature extends 6 arcmin (~26 kpcin projected distance) northeast from the center and 3 arcmin (~=12 kpc) fromthe disk plane; likely related features are also apparent on the southwest sideof the disk, extending to 4 arcmin (~17 kpc). the detection of this lowsurface-brightness mur= 27.0+0.3-0.2 mag/sqarcsec) structure is independentlyconfirmed in three separate datasets from three different telescopes.  although its true three dimensional geometry is unknown, the sky- projectedmorphology of this structure displays a match with the theoretical predictionsfor the edge-on, projected view of a stellar tidal streams of a dwarf satellitemoving in a low inclined (~25deg), nearly circular orbit. using the recentmodel of the monoceros tidal stream in the milky way by penarrubia et al. astemplate, we find that the progenitor system may have been a galaxy with aninitial mass 6*10^8 msun, of which current position and final fate is unknown.according to this simulation, the tidal stream may be approximately ~2.8 gyr ofage.  our results demonstrate that ngc 4013, previously considered a prototypicalisolated disk galaxy in spite of having one of the most prominent hi warpsdetected thus far, may have in fact suffered a recent minor merger. thisdiscovery highlights that undisturbed disks at high surface brightness levelsin the optical but warped in hi maps may in fact reveal complex signatures ofrecent accretion events in deep photometric surveys.

1310.4824	a tidally-stripped stellar component of the magellanic bridge	deep photometry of the small magellanic cloud (smc) stellar periphery (r=4deg, 4.2 kpc) is used to study its line-of-sight depth with red clump (rc)stars. the rc luminosity function is affected little by young (&lt;1 gyr)blue-loop stars in these regions because their main-sequence counterparts arenot observed in the color magnitude diagrams. the smc's eastern side is foundto have a large line-of-sight depth (~23 kpc) while the western side has a muchshallower depth (~10 kpc), consistent with previous photographic platephotometry results. we use a model smc rc luminosity function to deconvolve theobserved rc magnitudes and construct the density function in distance for ourfields. three of the eastern fields show a distance bimodality with onecomponent at the "systemic" ~67 kpc smc distance and a second component at ~55kpc. our data are not reproduced well by the various extant magellanic cloudand stream simulations. however, the models predict that the known himagellanic bridge (stretching from the smc eastward towards the lmc) has adecreasing distance with angle from the smc and should be seen in both thegaseous and stellar components. from comparison with these models we concludethat the most likely explanation for our newly identified ~55 kpc stellarstructure in the eastern smc is a stellar counterpart of the hi magellanicbridge that was tidally stripped from the smc ~200 myr ago during a closeencounter with the lmc. this discovery has important implications formicrolensing surveys of the smc.

1310.7573	evidence for an interaction in the nearest starbursting dwarf irregular  galaxy ic 10	using deep 21-cm hi data from the green bank telescope we have detected an~18.3 kpc-long gaseous extension associated with the starbursting dwarf galaxyic 10. the newly-found feature stretches 1.3 deg to the northwest and has alarge radial velocity gradient reaching to ~65 km/s lower than the ic 10systemic velocity. a region of higher column density at the end of theextension that possesses a coherent velocity gradient (~10 km/s across ~26arcmin) transverse to the extension suggests rotation and may be a satellitegalaxy of ic 10. the hi mass of ic 10 is 9.5x10^7 (d/805 kpc)^2 msun and themass of the new extension is 7.1x10^5 (d/805 kpc)^2 msun. an ic 10-m31 orbitusing known radial velocity and proper motion values for ic 10 show that the hiextension is inconsistent with the trailing portion of the orbit so that anm31-tidal or ram pressure origin seems unlikely. we argue that the mostplausible explanation for the new feature is that it is the result of a recentinteraction (and possible late merger) with another dwarf galaxy. thisinteraction could not only have triggered the origin of the recent starburst inic 10, but could also explain the existence of previously-foundcounter-rotating hi gas in the periphery of the ic 10 which was interpreted asoriginating from primordial gas infall.

1311.4569	chemical cartography with apogee: large-scale mean metallicity maps of  the milky way	we present galactic mean metallicity maps derived from the first year of thesdss-iii apogee experiment. mean abundances in different zones ofgalactocentric radius (0 &lt; r &lt; 15 kpc) at a range of heights above the plane (0&lt; |z| &lt; 3 kpc), are derived from a sample of nearly 20,000 stars withunprecedented coverage, including stars in the galactic mid-plane at largedistances. we also split the sample into subsamples of stars with low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] abundance ratios. we assess possible biases in deriving themean abundances, and find they are likely to be small except in the innerregions of the galaxy. a negative radial gradient exists over much of thegalaxy; however, the gradient appears to flatten for r &lt; 6 kpc, in particularnear the galactic mid-plane and for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. at r &gt; 6 kpc, thegradient flattens as one moves off of the plane, and is flatter at all heightsfor high-[{\alpha}/m] stars than for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. alternatively,these gradients can be described as vertical gradients that flatten at largergalactocentric radius; these vertical gradients are similar for both low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] populations. stars with higher [{\alpha}/m] appear to have aflatter radial gradient than stars with lower [{\alpha}/m]. this could suggestthat the metallicity gradient has grown steeper with time or, alternatively,that gradients are washed out over time by migration of stars.

1312.1641	the acs survey of globular clusters. xiii. photometric calibration in  comparison with stetson standards	in this study we compare the photometric data of 34 milky way globularclusters, observed within the acs treasury program (pi: ata sarajedini) withthe corresponding ground-based data, provided by the photometric standard fieldcatalogs of stetson (2000, 2005). we focus on the transformation between thehst/acs f606w to v-band and f814w to i-band only. the goal is to assess thevalidity of the filter transformation equations by sirianni et al.(2005) withrespect to their dependence on metallicity, horizontal branch morphology, massand integrated (v-i) colour of the various globular clusters. such a dependenceis expected due to the fact that the transformation equations are based on theobservations of only one globular cluster, i.e., ngc 2419. surprisingly, thecorrelation between offset and metallicity is found to be weak, with a lowlevel significance. the correlation between offset and horizontal branchstructure, as well as total cluster mass is still weaker. based on theavailable data we do not find the photometric offset to be linked to multiplestellar populations, e.g., as found in ngc 0288, ngc 1851, and ngc 5139. theresults of this study show that there are small systematic offsets between thetransformed acs- and observed ground based photometry, and that these are onlyweakly correlated, if at all, with various cluster parameters and theirunderlying stellar populations. as a result, investigators wishing to transformglobular cluster photometry from the sirianni et al.(2005) ground-based v, isystem onto the stetson (2000) system simply need to add 0.040 (+/-0.012) tothe v-band magnitudes and 0.047 (+/-0.011) to the i-band magnitudes. this inturn means that the transformed acs (v-i) colours match the ground-based valuesfrom stetson (2000) to within ~0.01 mag.

1403.3239	discovery of two rare rigidly-rotating magnetosphere stars in the apogee  survey	the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) - one ofthe sloan digital sky survey iii programs -- is using near-infrared spectra of$\sim 100,000$ red giant branch star candidates to study the structure of themilky way. in the course of the survey, apogee also acquires spectra of hotfield stars to serve as telluric calibrators for the primary science targets.we report the serendipitous discovery of two rare, fast-rotating b stars of the$\sigma$ ori e type among those blue field stars observed during the first yearof apogee operations. both of the discovered stars display the spectroscopicsignatures of the rigidly rotating magnetospheres (rrm) common to this class ofhighly-magnetized ($b \sim 10$ kilogauss) stars, increasing the number of knownrrm stars by $\sim 10 \%$. one (hd 345439) is a main-sequence b star withunusually strong he absorption (similar to $\sigma$ ori e), while the other (hd23478) fits a "he-normal" b3iv classification. we combine the apogee discoveryspectra with other optical and near-infrared spectra of these two stars, and of$\sigma$ ori e itself, to show how near-infrared spectroscopy can be a uniquelypowerful tool for discovering more of these rare objects, which may showlittle/no rrm signatures in their optical spectra. we discuss the potential forfurther discovery of $\sigma$ ori e type stars, as well as the implications ofour discoveries for the population of these objects and insights into theirorigin and evolution.

1405.1032	the apogee red-clump catalog: precise distances, velocities, and  high-resolution elemental abundances over a large area of the milky way's  disk	the sloan digital sky survey iii's apache point observatory galacticevolution experiment (apogee) is a high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopicsurvey covering all of the major components of the galaxy, including thedust-obscured regions of the inner milky way disk and bulge. here we present asample of 10,341 likely red-clump stars (rc) from the first two years of apogeeoperations, selected based on their position incolor-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature space using a newmethod calibrated using stellar-evolution models and high-qualityasteroseismology data. the narrowness of the rc locus incolor-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the starswith an accuracy of 5 to 10%. the sample extends to typical distances of about3 kpc from the sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and spans a volume ofapproximately 100 kpc^3 over 5 kpc &lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc, |z| &lt;~ 2 kpc, and -15 deg &lt;~galactocentric azimuth &lt;~ 30 deg. the apogee red-clump (apogee-rc) catalogcontains photometry from 2mass, reddening estimates, distances, line-of-sightvelocities, stellar parameters and elemental abundances determined from thehigh-resolution apogee spectra, and matches to major proper motion catalogs. wedetermine the survey selection function for this data set and discuss how therc selection samples the underlying stellar populations. we use this sample tolimit any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the ~45degree-wide azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be &lt;= 0.02 dex,which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the radial metallicitygradient. this result constrains coherent non-axisymmetric flows within a fewkpc from the sun.

0803.3045	kinematics of stars in kapteyn selected area 71: sampling the monoceros  and sagittarius tidal streams	we present a 3d kinematical analysis of stars located in kapteyn selectedarea 71 (l = 167.1, b = -34.7), where previously a stellar excess was found(dinescu et al. 2002, newberg et al. 2002). previous findings indicated thatthe stellar excess has a cold kinematical signature as inferred from propermotions, and was initially associated with debris from the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy (sgr) -- namely the southern trailing tail. we have obtained radialvelocities using the hydra multiobject spectrograph on the wiyn 3.5 mtelescope. results for 183 proper-motion selected stars indicate that thedominant population in this stellar excess is not debris from sgr, but rather apopulation that kinematically belongs to the ring-like stream that is now knownas the monoceros stream. the orbit determined for this population agrees verywell with the predictions for the monoceros stream from penarrubia et al.(2005). the radial-velocity dispersion of this population is between 20 and 30km/s, lower than that of the galactic field. also, the shape of theradial-velocity distribution shows a sharp cut-off on one side, which is morein line with model predictions of the disruption of a satellite rather thanwith the distribution of the galactic field. despite the fact that we nowbelieve most of the stars in the stellar excess to be part of monoceros, aboutten stars in this stellar excess have highly negative radial velocities, whichis a clear indication of their membership to the sgr trailing tidal tail.

1408.3408	hubble space telescope proper motions along the sagittarius stream: i.  observations and results for stars in four fields	we present a multi-epoch hubble space telescope (hst) study of stellar propermotions (pms) for four fields spanning 200 degrees along the sagittarius (sgr)stream: one trailing arm field, one field near the sgr dwarf spheroidal tidalradius, and two leading arm fields. we determine absolute pms of dozens ofindividual stars per field, using established techniques that use distantbackground galaxies as stationary reference frame. stream stars are identifiedbased on combined color-magnitude diagram and pm information. the results arebroadly consistent with the few existing pm measurements for the sgr galaxy andthe trailing arm. however, our new results provide the highest pm accuracy forthe stream to date, the first pm measurements for the leading arm, and thefirst pm measurements for individual stream stars; we also serendipitouslydetermine the pm of the globular cluster ngc~6652. in the trailing-arm field,the individual pms allow us to kinematically separate trailing-arm stars fromleading-arm stars that are 360 degrees further ahead in their orbit. also, inthree of our fields we find indications that two distinct kinematicalcomponents may exist within the same arm and wrap of the stream. qualitativecomparison of the hst data to the predictions of the law &amp; majewski andpenarrubia et al. n-body models show that the pm measurements closely followthe predicted trend with sgr longitude. this provides a successful consistencycheck on the pm measurements, as well as on these n-body approaches (which werenot tailored to fit any pm data).

1409.3566	tracing chemical evolution over the extent of the milky way's disk with  apogee red clump stars	we employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolutionsdss-iii/apogee spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution ofmetallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of themilky way disk. using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clumpstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h]distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/fe] at intermediatemetallicities, -0.9&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([fe/h]=+0.2) thetwo sequences smoothly merge. we investigate the effects of the apogeeselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have littlequalitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. the describedabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5&lt;r&lt;11 kpc and 0&lt;|z|&lt;2 kpcacross the galaxy. the [alpha/fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence issurprisingly constant throughout the galaxy, with little variation from regionto region (~10%). using simple galactic chemical evolution models we derive anaverage star formation efficiency (sfe) in the high-alpha sequence of ~4.5e-101/yr, which is quite close to the nearly-constant value found inmolecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. this result suggests thatthe early evolution of the milky way disk was characterized by stars thatshared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,turbulent, and molecular-dominated ism with a gas consumption timescale (1/sfe)of ~2 gyr. finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner galaxycan be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold inthe outer galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations withdistinct enrichment histories.

1409.3843	global properties of m31's stellar halo from the splash survey: ii.  metallicity profile	we present the metallicity distribution of red giant branch (rgb) stars inm31's stellar halo, derived from photometric metallicity estimates for over1500 spectroscopically confirmed rgb halo stars. the stellar sample comes from38 halo fields observed with the keck/deimos spectrograph, ranging from 9 to175 kpc in projected distance from m31's center, and includes 52 confirmed m31halo stars beyond 100 kpc. while a wide range of metallicities is seenthroughout the halo, the metal-rich peak of the metallicity distributionfunction becomes significantly less prominent with increasing radius. themetallicity profile of m31's stellar halo shows a continuous gradient from 9 to~100 kpc, with a magnitude of -0.01 dex/kpc. the stellar velocity distributionsin each field are used to identify stars that are likely associated with tidaldebris features. the removal of tidal debris features does not significantlyalter the metallicity gradient in m31's halo: a gradient is maintained infields spanning 10 to 90 kpc. we analyze the halo metallicity profile, as wellas the relative metallicities of stars associated with tidal debris featuresand the underlying halo population, in the context of current simulations ofstellar halo formation. we argue that the large scale gradient in m31's haloimplies m31 accreted at least one relatively massive progenitor in the past,while the field to field variation seen in the metallicity profile indicatesthat multiple smaller progenitors are likely to have contributed substantiallyto m31's outer halo.

1410.1350	bayesian distances and extinctions for giants observed by kepler and  apogee	we present a first determination of distances and extinctions for individualstars in the first release of the apokasc catalogue, built from the jointefforts of the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee)and the kepler asteroseismic science consortium (kasc). our method takes intoaccount the spectroscopic constraints derived from the apogee stellarparameters and chemical abundances pipeline, together with the asteroseismicparameters from kasc. these parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsicstellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the bayesian toolparam. we then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observedphotometry in sdss, 2mass, and wise passbands. the first 1989 giants targetedby apokasc are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, withindividual uncertainties of just ~1.8 per cent. our extinction estimates aresystematically smaller than provided in the kepler input catalogue and by theschlegel, finkbeiner and davis maps. distances to individual stars in the ngc6791 and ngc 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals.comparison with the apogee red clump and saga catalogues provide another usefulcheck, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few percent.overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinctiondeterminations for the bulk of the apokasc sample. approximately one third ofthe stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions andhence increased uncertainties. uncertainties are expected to be reduced infuture releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will haveseismically-determined evolutionary status classifications.

1410.2503	the apokasc catalog: an asteroseismic and spectroscopic joint survey of  targets in the kepler fields	we present the first apokasc catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismicproperties of 1916 red giants observed in the kepler fields. the spectroscopicparameters provided from the apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the keplerasteroseismology science consortium. we assess both random and systematicsources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in thekepler fields. total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order80 k in teff , 0.06 dex in [m/h], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in massand radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and randomerrors. asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise andaccurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their meanvalues and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. there are, however,systematic underlying trends with teff and log g. our effective temperaturescale is between 0-200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared fluxmethod, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for alower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog (kic).we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic andspectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in kicmetallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in teffand log g consistent with those derived in the literature. we present meanfitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss futureprospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

1410.8135	the power spectrum of the milky way: velocity fluctuations in the  galactic disk	we investigate the kinematics of stars in the mid-plane of the milky way onscales between 25 pc and 10 kpc with data from the apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee), the radial velocity experiment (rave),and the geneva-copenhagen survey (gcs). using red-clump stars in apogee, wedetermine the large-scale line-of-sight velocity field out to 5 kpc from thesun in (0.75 kpc)^2 bins. the solar motion v_{sun-c} with respect to thecircular velocity v_c is the largest contribution to the power on large scalesafter subtracting an axisymmetric rotation field; we determine the solar motionby minimizing the large-scale power to be v_{sun-c} = 24+/-1 (ran.)+/-2 (syst[v_c])+/-5 (syst. [large-scale]) km/s, where the systematic uncertainty is dueto (a) a conservative 20 km/s uncertainty in v_c and (b) the estimated power onunobserved larger scales. combining the apogee peculiar-velocity field withred-clump stars in rave out to 2 kpc from the sun and with local gcs stars, wedetermine the power spectrum of residual velocity fluctuations in the milkyway's disk on scales between 0.2/kpc &lt; k &lt; 40/kpc. most of the power iscontained in a broad peak between 0.2/kpc &lt; k &lt; 0.9/kpc. we investigate theexpected power spectrum for various non-axisymmetric perturbations anddemonstrate that the central bar with commonly used parameters but ofrelatively high mass can explain the bulk of velocity fluctuations in the planeof the galactic disk near the sun. streaming motions ~10 km/s on &gt;~3 kpc scalesin the milky way are in good agreement with observations of external galaxiesand directly explain why local determinations of the solar motion areinconsistent with global measurements.

1503.02110	chemical cartography with apogee: metallicity distribution functions and  the chemical structure of the milky way disk	using a sample of 69,919 red giants from the sdss-iii/apogee data release 12,we measure the distribution of stars in the [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane andthe metallicity distribution functions (mdf) across an unprecedented volume ofthe milky way disk, with radius $3&lt;r&lt;15$ kpc and height $|z|&lt;2$ kpc. stars inthe inner disk ($r&lt;5$ kpc) lie along a single track in [$\alpha$/fe] vs.[fe/h], starting with $\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at[$\alpha$/fe]$\sim0$ and [fe/h]$\sim+0.4$. at larger radii we find two distinctsequences in [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] space, with a roughly solar-$\alpha$sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-$\alpha$ sequence thatmerges with the low-$\alpha$ sequence at super-solar [fe/h]. the location ofthe high-$\alpha$ sequence is nearly constant across the disk, however thereare very few high-$\alpha$ stars at $r&gt;11$ kpc. the peak of the midplane mdfshifts to lower metallicity at larger $r$, reflecting the galactic metallicitygradient. most strikingly, the shape of the midplane mdf changes systematicallywith radius, with a negatively skewed distribution at $3&lt;r&lt;7$ kpc, to a roughlygaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in theouter galaxy. for stars with $|z|&gt;1$ kpc or [$\alpha$/fe]$&gt;0.18$, the mdf showslittle dependence on $r$. the positive skewness of the outer disk mdf may be asignature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations byorbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of mdf shape but asimple model of radial migration can do so.

0805.1137	the ghost of a dwarf galaxy: fossils of the hierarchical formation of  the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 5907	we present an extragalactic perspective of an extended stellar tidal streamwrapping around the edge-on, spiral galaxy ngc 5907. our deep images reveal forthe first time a large scale complex of arcing loops that is an excellentexample of how a low-mass satellite accretion can produce an interwoven,rosette-like structure of debris dispersed in the halo of its host galaxy. theexistence of this structure, which has probably formed and survived for severalgigayears, confirms that halos of spiral galaxies in the local universe maystill contain a significant number of galactic fossils from their hierarchicalformation. to examine the validity of the external accretion scenario, wepresent n-body simulations of the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy-likesystem in a disk galaxy plus dark halo potential that demonstrate that most ofthe observed tidal features observed in ngc 5907 can be explained by a singleaccretion event. unfortunately, with no kinematic data and only the projectedgeometry of the stream as constraint, the parameters of our model areconsiderably degenerate and, for now, must be considered illustrative only.interestingly, ngc 5907 has long been considered a prototypical example of awarped spiral in relative isolation. the presence of an extended tidal streamchallenges this picture and suggests that the gravitational perturbationsinduced by the stream progenitor may be the cause for the warp. the detectionof an old, complex tidal stream in a nearby galaxy with rather modestinstrumentation points to the viability of surveys to find extragalactic tidalsubstructures around spiral galaxies in the local volume (&lt; 15 mpc) -- with theprospect of obtaining a census with enough statistical significance to becompared with cosmological simulations.

1511.05930	comparison of hipparcos trigonometric and mount wilson spectroscopic  parallaxes for 90 subgiants that defined the class in 1935	a history is given of the discovery between 1914 and 1935 of stars ofintermediate luminosity between giants and dwarfs with spectral types betweeng0 to k3. the mt wilson spectroscopists identified about 90 such stars in their1935 summary paper of spectroscopic absolute magnitudes for 4179 stars. called"subgiants" by str\"omberg, these 90 stars defined the group at the time. theposition of the mt wilson subgiants in the hr diagram caused difficulties incomparisons of high weight trigonometric parallaxes being measured and withrussell's prevailing evolution proposal, and critics questioned the reality ofthe mt wilson subgiants. we compare, star-by-star, the mt wilson spectroscopicabsolute magnitudes of the 90 stars defining their sample against thoseabsolute magnitudes derived from hipparcos (hip) trigonometric parallaxes. weaddress concerns over biases in the mt wilson calibration sample and biasescreated by the adopted methodology for calibration. historically, theseconcerns were sufficient to discredit the discovery of subgiants in the mtwilson sample. however, as shown here, the majority of the mount wilson starsidentified as subgiants that also have reliable hip trigonometric parallaxes dolie among the subgiant sequence in the hip hr diagram. moreover, no significantoffset is seen between the m(v) brightnesses derived from the mt wilsonspectroscopic parallaxes and the m(v) values derived from hipparcostrigonometric parallaxes with a fractional error of 10%, which confirms in animpressive manner the efficacy of the original mt wilson assessments. theexistence of subgiants proved that russell's contraction proposal for stellarevolution from giants to the main sequence was incorrect. instead, gamow's 1944unpublished conjecture that subgiants are post main-sequence stars just havingleft the main sequence was very nearly correct but was a decade before itstime.

astro-ph;0002033	multiwavelength observations of the second largest known fr ii radio  galaxy, nvss 2146+82	we present multi-frequency vla, multicolor ccd imaging, optical spectroscopy,and rosat hri observations of the giant fr ii radio galaxy nvss 2146+82. thisgalaxy, which was discovered by the nrao vla sky survey (nvss), has an angularextent of nearly 20' from lobe to lobe. the radio structure is normal for an frii source except for its large size and regions in the lobes with unusuallyflat radio spectra. our spectroscopy indicates that the optical counterpart ofthe radio core is at a redshift of z=0.145, so the linear size of the radiostructure is ~4 h_50^-1 mpc. this object is therefore the second largest fr iiknown (3c 236 is ~6 h_50^-1 mpc). optical imaging of the field surrounding thehost galaxy reveals an excess number of candidate galaxy cluster members abovethe number typically found in the field surrounding a giant radio galaxy. wiynhydra spectra of a sample of the candidate cluster members reveal that sixshare the same redshift as nvss 2146+82, indicating the presence of at least a``rich group'' containing the fr ii host galaxy. rosat hri observations of nvss2146+82 place upper limits on the x-ray flux of 1.33 x 10^-13 ergs cm^-2 s^-1for any hot igm and 3.52 x 10^-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 for an x-ray agn, therebylimiting any x-ray emission at the distance of the radio galaxy to that typicalof a poor group or weak agn. several other giant radio galaxies have been foundin regions with overdensities of nearby galaxies, and a separate study hasshown that groups containing fr iis are underluminous in x-rays compared togroups without radio sources. we speculate that the presence of the host galaxyin an optically rich group of galaxies that is underluminous in x-rays may berelated to the giant radio galaxy phenomenon.

astro-ph;0005215	spectroscopy of giant stars in the pyxis globular cluster	the pyxis globular cluster is a recently discovered globular cluster thatlies in the outer halo (r_{gc} ~ 40 kpc) of the milky way. pyxis lies along oneof the proposed orbital planes of the large magellanic cloud (lmc), and it hasbeen proposed to be a detached lmc globular cluster captured by the milky way.we present the first measurement of the radial velocity of the pyxis globularcluster based on spectra of six pyxis giant stars. the mean heliocentric radialvelocity is ~ 36 km/sec, and the corresponding velocity of pyxis with respectto a stationary observer at the position of the sun is ~ -191 km/sec. thisradial velocity is a large enough fraction of the cluster's expected totalspace velocity, assuming that it is bound to the milky way, that it allowsstrict limits to be placed on the range of permissible transverse velocitiesthat pyxis could have in the case that it still shares or nearly shares anorbital pole with the lmc. we can rule out that pyxis is on a near circularorbit if it is magellanic debris, but we cannot rule out an eccentric orbitassociated with the lmc. we have calculated the range of allowed proper motionsfor the pyxis globular cluster that result in the cluster having an orbitalpole within 15 degrees of the present orbital pole of the lmc and that areconsistent with our measured radial velocity, but verification of the tidalcapture hypothesis must await proper motion measurement from the spaceinterferometry mission or hst. a spectroscopic metallicity estimate of [fe/h] =-1.4 +/- 0.1 is determined for pyxis from several spectra of its brightestgiant; this is consistent with photometric determinations of the clustermetallicity from isochrone fitting.

astro-ph;0108474	on the distribution of orbital poles of milky way satellites	in numerous studies of the outer galactic halo some evidence for accretionhas been found. if the outer halo did form in part or wholly through mergerevents, we might expect to find coherent streams of stars and globular clustersfollowing similar orbits as their parent objects, which are assumed to bepresent or former milky way dwarf satellite galaxies. we present a study ofthis phenomenon by assessing the likelihood of potential descendant ``dynamicalfamilies'' in the outer halo. we conduct two analyses: one that involves astatistical analysis of the spatial distribution of all known galactic dwarfsatellite galaxies (dsgs) and globular clusters, and a second, more specificanalysis of those globular clusters and dsgs for which full phase spacedynamical data exist. in both cases our methodology is appropriate only tomembers of descendant dynamical families that retain nearly aligned orbitalpoles today. since the sagittarius dwarf (sgr) is considered a paradigm for thetype of merger/tidal interaction event for which we are searching, we alsoundertake a case study of the sgr system and identify several globular clustersthat may be members of its extended dynamical family.

(2004, astro-ph/0406146) discusses possibleorbits, implications of the coldness of the stream, and progenitor satelliteproperties. the kinematics (and perhaps [fe/h] distribution) of our halo sampleindicate that it is different from other m31 halo samples; this may be anindication of substructure in the halo. the stream seems to have a higher mean[fe/h] than the halo, -0.51 vs -0.74 dex, and a smaller [fe/h] spread. thestream's high metallicity implies that its progenitor must have been a luminousdwarf galaxy. the caii triplet strengths of the m31 giants are generallyconsistent with photometric estimates of their metallicity (derived by fittingrgb fiducials in the color-magnitude diagram). there is indirect evidence ofintermediate-age stars in the stream.

astro-ph;0502366	discovery of an extended halo of metal-poor stars in the andromeda  spiral galaxy	understanding galaxy formation involves look-back and fossil-record studiesof distant and nearby galaxies, respectively. debris trails in our galaxy'sspheroidal halo of old stars provide evidence of "bottom-up" formation viatidal disruption/merging of dwarf satellite galaxies, but it is difficult tostudy our galaxy's large-scale structure from within. studies of ourneighbouring andromeda galaxy have concluded that its spheroid containschemically enriched ("metal-rich") stars out to a radius of 30 kiloparsecs withan exponential r^1/4 fall-off in density thereby resembling a galactic "bulge".were andromeda's true halo to be found, our detailed yet global view of itsstellar dynamics, substructure, chemical abundance, and age distribution woulddirectly constrain hierarchical halo formation models. we report here on thediscovery of a hitherto elusive halo of metal-poor andromeda stars, distinctfrom its bulge, with a power-law brightness profile extending beyond r = 160kiloparsecs. this is 3 - 5 times larger than any previously mapped andromedaspheroidal/disk component. together, the galactic and andromeda halos span &gt;1/3of the distance between them, suggesting that stars occupy a substantial volumefraction of our local group, and possibly most galaxy groups.

astro-ph;0605171	a new method for isolating m31 red giant stars: the discovery of stars  out to a radial distance of 165 kiloparsecs	we present a method for isolating a clean sample of red giant stars in theouterregions of the andromeda spiral galaxy (m31) from an ongoing spectroscopicsurvey using the deimos instrument on the keck 10-m telescope. the survey aimsto study the kinematics, global structure, substructure, and metallicity ofm31's halo. although most of our spectroscopic targets were photometricallyscreened to reject foreground milky way dwarf star contaminants, the latterclass of objects still constitutes a substantial fraction of the observedspectra in the sparse outer halo. our likelihood-based method for isolating m31red giants uses five criteria: (1) radial velocity, (2) photometry in theintermediate-width ddo51 band to measure the strength of the mgh/mgb absorptionfeatures, (3) strength of the na i 8190a absorption line doublet, (4) locationwithin an (i, v-i) color-magnitude diagram, and (5) comparison of photometric(cmd-based) versus spectroscopic (ca ii 8500a triplet-based) metallicityestimates. we also discuss k i and tio diagnostics for giant/dwarf separationthat might be useful in future analyses. training sets consisting of definitem31 red giants and galactic dwarf stars are used to derive empiricalprobabilitydistribution functions for each diagnostic. these functions are usedto calculate the likelihood that a given star is a red giant in m31 versus amilky way dwarf. by applying this diagnostic method to our spectroscopic dataset, we isolate 40 m31 red giants beyond a projected distance of r = 60 kpcfrom the galaxy's center, including three out at r ~ 165 kpc. the ability toidentify individual m31 red giants gives us an unprecedented level ofsensitivity in studying the properties of the galaxy's outer halo.
