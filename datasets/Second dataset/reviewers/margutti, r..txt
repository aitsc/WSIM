0901.4038	the optical afterglows and host galaxies of three short/hard gamma-ray  bursts	short grbs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of doublecompact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.optical observations of short grbs allow us to measure redshifts, firmlyidentify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localizegrbs within them. multiwavelength observations of grb afterglows provide usefulinformation on the emission mechanisms at work. these are all key issues thatallow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. wecarried out photometric observations of the short/hard grb 051227, grb 061006,and grb 071227 with the eso-vlt starting from several hours after the explosiondown to the host galaxy level several days later. for grb 061006 and grb 071227we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. we compared theresults obtained from our optical observations with the available x-ray data ofthese bursts. for all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglowsand firmly identified their host galaxies. about half a day after the burst,the optical afterglows of grb 051227 and grb 061006 present a decaysignificatly steeper than in the x-rays. in the case of grb 051227, the opticaldecay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in thetwo wavelengths ranges. the three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies atmoderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the solar one. theprojected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centersspan a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts andpresent evidence for local absorption in their x-ray spectra. we discuss ourfindings in light of the current models of short grb progenitors.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

1004.0901	unveiling the origin of x-ray flares in gamma-ray bursts	we present an updated catalog of 113 x-ray flares detected by swift in the~33% of the x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grb). 43 flares have ameasured redshift. for the first time the analysis is performed in 4 differentx-ray energy bands, allowing us to constrain the evolution of the flaretemporal properties with energy. we find that flares are narrower at higherenergies: their width follows a power-law relation w~e^{-0.5} reminiscent ofthe prompt emission. flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time whichis twice the rise time on average. both time scales linearly evolve with time,giving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both timescales are stretched by the same factor. as a consequence, the flare widthlinearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearlydistinguishes the flare from the grb prompt emission. the flare 0.3-10 kev peakluminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with largescatter: l_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. when multiple flares are present, a globalsoftening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than theprevious one. the 0.3-10 kev isotropic energy distribution is a log-normalpeaked at 10^{51} erg, with a possible excess at low energies. the flareaverage spectral energy distribution (sed) is found to be a power-law withspectral energy index beta~1.1. these results confirmed that the flares aretightly linked to the prompt emission. however, after considering variousmodels we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entireset of observations.

1004.1568	lag-luminosity relation in gamma-ray burst x-ray flares: a direct link  to the prompt emission	the temporal and spectral analysis of 9 bright x-ray flares out of a sampleof 113 flares observed by swift reveals that the flare phenomenology isstrictly analogous to the prompt gamma-ray emission: high energy flare profilesrise faster, decay faster and peak before the low energy emission. however,flares and prompt pulses differ in one crucial aspect: flares evolve with time.as time proceeds flares become wider, with larger peak lag, lower luminositiesand softer emission. the flare spectral peak energy e_{p,i} evolves to lowervalues following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux.the two flares with best statistics show higher than expected isotropic energye_{iso} and peak luminosity l_{p,iso} when compared to the e_{p,i}-e_{iso} ande_{p,i}-l_{iso} prompt correlations. e_{p,i} is found to correlate with l_{iso}within single flares, giving rise to a time resolved e_{p,i}(t)-l_{iso}(t).like prompt pulses, flares define a lag-luminosity relation: l_{p,iso}^{0.3-10kev} t_{lag}^{-0.95+/-0.23}. the lag-luminosity is proven to be a fundamentallaw extending 5 decades in time and 5 in energy. moreover, this is directevidence that grb x-ray flares and prompt gamma-ray pulses are produced by thesame mechanism. finally we establish a flare-afterglow morphology connection:flares are preferentially detected superimposed to one-break or canonical x-rayafterglows.

1004.3831	gamma-ray burst long lasting x-ray flaring activity	in this paper we shed light on late time (i.e. with peak time t_{pk} \gtrsim1000 s) flaring activity. we address the morphology and energetic of flares inthe window \sim 10^3-10^6 s to put constraints on the temporal evolution of theflare properties and to identify possible differences in the mechanismproducing the early and late time flaring emission, if any. this requires thecomplete understanding of the observational biases affecting the detection ofx-ray flares superimposed on a fading continuum at t &gt; 1000 s. we consider allthe swift grbs that exhibit late time flares. our sample consists of 36 flares,14 with redshift measurements. we inherit the strategy of data analysis fromchincarini et al. (2010) in order to make a direct comparison with the earlytime flare properties. the morphology of the flare light curve is the same forboth early time and late time flares, while they differ energetically. thewidth of late time flares increases with time similarly to the early timeflares. simulations confirmed that the increase of the width with time is notdue to the decaying statistics, at least up to 10^4 s. the energy output oflate time flares is one order of magnitude lower than the early time flare one,being \sim 1% e_{prompt}. the evolution of the peak luminosity as well as thedistribution of the peak flux-to-continuum ratio for late time flares indicatethat the flaring emission is decoupled from the underlying continuum,differently from early time flares/steep decay. a sizable fraction of late timeflares are compatible with afterglow variability. the internal shock originseems the most promising explanation for flares. however, some differences thatemerge between late and early time flares suggest that there could be no uniqueexplanation about the nature of late time flares.

1005.1569	the sooner: a large robotic telescope	the approach of observational astronomy is mainly aimed at the constructionof larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelengthcoverage. certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completelyfulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes(bh), neutron stars (ns) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.recently, mainly through the vela, beppo-sax and swift satellites, we reached areasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the universe and of some ofthe processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (bh). weplan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics ofvery fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extremecompact objects. the innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) thedesign (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotictelescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the uniquefeatures: "no telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengthsobservations (photometry, spectroscopy o\&amp; polarimetry); 3) high timeresolution observations. the conceptual design of the telescope and relatedinstrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: high frequencya-periodic variability, polarization, high z grbs, short grbs, grb-supernovaeassociation, multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersionspectroscopy. this experiment will turn the "exception" (like the opticalobservations of grb 080319b) to "routine".

1006.0800	the afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205: evidence for a ly-alpha  emitter at z=4.65	gamma-ray bursts have been proved to be detectable up to distances muchlarger than any other astrophysical object, providing the most effective way,complementary to ordinary surveys, to study the high redshift universe. to thisend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to thestudy of the high-z grb 090205. we carried out optical/nir spectroscopy andimaging of grb 090205 with the eso-vlt starting from hours after the event upto several days later to detect the host galaxy. we compared the resultsobtained from our optical/nir observations with the available swift high-energydata of this burst. our observational campaign led to the detection of theoptical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205 and to the first measure of itsredshift, z=4.65. similar to other, recent high-z grbs, grb 090205 has a shortduration in the rest-frame with t_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibilitythat it might belong to the short grbs class. the x-ray afterglow of grb 090205shows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. photometricobservations of the grb 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxywith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 myr. moreover, the metallicity ofz &gt; 0.27 z_sun derived from the grb afterglow spectrum is among the highestderived from grb afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burstoccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. finally, a detailed analysis of theafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to lyman-alphaemission at the redshift of the burst. grb 090205 is thus hosted in a typicallyman-alpha emitter (lae) at z=4.65. this makes the grb 090205 host thefarthest grb host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.

1009.0172	on the average gamma-ray burst x-ray flaring activity	gamma-ray burst x-ray flares are believed to mark the late time activity ofthe central engine. we compute the temporal evolution of the average flareluminosity $&lt; l &gt;$ in the common rest frame energy band of 44 grbs taken fromthe large \emph{swift} 5-years data base. our work highlights the importance ofa proper consideration of the threshold of detection of flares against thecontemporaneous continuous x-ray emission. in the time interval $30\rm{s}&lt;t&lt;1000\,\rm{s}$ we find $&lt; l &gt;\propto t^{-2.7\pm 0.1}$; this impliesthat the flare isotropic energy scaling is $e_{\rm{iso,flare}}\proptot^{-1.7}$. the decay of the continuum underlying the flare emission closelytracks the average flare luminosity evolution, with a typical flare tosteep-decay luminosity ratio which is $l_{\rm{flare}}/l_{\rm{steep}}=4.7$: thissuggests that flares and continuum emission are deeply related to one another.we infer on the progenitor properties considering different models. accordingto the hyper-accreting black hole scenario, the average flare luminosityscaling can be obtained in the case of rapid accretion ($t_{\rm{acc}}\ll t$) orwhen the last $\sim 0.5 m_{\sun}$ of the original $14 m_{\sun}$ progenitor starare accreted. alternatively, the steep $\propto t^{-2.7}$ behaviour could betriggered by a rapid outward expansion of an accretion shock in the materialfeeding a convective disk. if instead we assume the engine to be a rapidlyspinning magnetar, then its rotational energy can be extracted to power a jetwhose luminosity is likely to be between the monopole ($l\propto e^{-2t}$) anddipole ($l\propto t^{-2}$) cases. in both scenarios we suggest the variability,which is the main signature of the flaring activity, to be established as aconsequence of different kinds of instabilities.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

1106.3568	the birth of a relativistic outflow in the unusual {\gamma}-ray  transient swift j164449.3+573451	active galactic nuclei (agn), powered by long-term accretion onto centralsupermassive black holes, produce relativistic jets with lifetimes of greaterthan one million yr that preclude observations at birth. transient accretiononto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of astray star, may therefore offer a unique opportunity to observe and study thebirth of a relativistic jet. on 2011 march 25, the swift {\gamma}-ray satellitediscovered an unusual transient source (swift j164449.3+573451) potentiallyrepresenting such an event. here we present the discovery of a luminous radiotransient associated with swift j164449.3+573451, and an extensive set ofobservations spanning centimeter to millimeter wavelengths and covering thefirst month of evolution. these observations lead to a positional coincidencewith the nucleus of an inactive galaxy, and provide direct evidence for anewly-formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto amillion solar mass black hole. while a relativistic outflow was not predictedin this scenario, we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturallyexplains the high-energy properties, radio luminosity, and the inferred rate ofsuch events. the weaker beaming in the radio compared to {\gamma}-rays/x-rays,suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z ~6.

1107.1740	x-ray flare candidates in short gamma-ray bursts	we present the first systematic study of x-ray flare candidates in shortgamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) exploiting the large 6-year swift database with theaim to constrain the physical nature of such fluctuations. we find that flarecandidates appear in different types of sgrb host galaxy environments and showno clear correlation with the x-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates aredetected both in sgrbs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-raysand in sgrbs which do not show such component. we furthermore show that sgrbx-ray flare candidates only partially share the set of observational propertiesof long grb (lgrb) flares. in particular,the main parameter driving theduration evolution of x-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to bethe elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on thedifferent progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, promptvariability time-scales and energy budgets. on the contrary, sgrb flarecandidates significantly differ from lgrb flares in terms of peak luminosity,isotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variabilityflux. however, these differences disappear when the central engine time-scalesand energy budget are accounted for, suggesting that (i) flare candidates andprompt pulses in sgrbs likely have a common origin; (ii) similar dissipationand/or emission mechanisms are responsible for the prompt and flare emission inlong and short grbs, with sgrbs being less energetic albeit faster evolvingversions of the long class. finally, we show that in strict analogy to the sgrbprompt emission, flares candidates fall off the lag-luminosity relation definedby lgrbs, thus strengthening the sgrb flare-prompt pulse connection.

1112.1058	the x-ray light curve of gamma-ray bursts: clues to the central engine	we present the analysis of a large sample of gamma-ray burst (grb) x-raylight curves in the rest frame to characterise their intrinsic properties inthe context of different theoretical scenarios. we determine the morphology,time scales, and energetics of 64 long grbs observed by \emph{swift}/xrt\emph{without} flaring activity. we furthermore provide a one-to-one comparisonto the properties of grbs \emph{with} x-ray flares. we find that the steepdecay morphology and its connection with x-ray flares favour a scenario inwhich a central engine origin. we show that this scenario can also account forthe shallow decay phase, provided that the grb progenitor star has aself-similar structure with a constant envelope-to-core mass ratio $\sim0.02-0.03$. however, difficulties arise for very long duration($t_p\gtrsim10^4$ s) shallow phases. alternatively, a spinning-down magnetarwhose emitted power refreshes the forward shock can quantitatively account forthe shallow decay properties. in particular we demonstrate that this model canaccount for the plateau luminosity vs. end time anticorrelation.

1205.7075	the afterglow and environment of the short grb111117a	we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of the shortgrb111117a, and follow-up observations of its host galaxy. from rapid opticaland radio observations we place limits of r \gtrsim 25.5 mag at \deltat \approx0.55 d and f_nu(5.8 ghz) &lt; 18 \mujy at \deltat \approx 0.50 d, respectively.however, using a chandra observation at t~3.0 d we locate the absolute positionof the x-ray afterglow to an accuracy of 0.22" (1 sigma), a factor of about 6times better than the swift-xrt position. this allows us to robustly identifythe host galaxy and to locate the burst at a projected offset of 1.25 +/- 0.20"from the host centroid. using optical and near-ir observations of the hostgalaxy we determine a photometric redshift of z=1.3 (+0.3,-0.2), one of thehighest for any short grb, and leading to a projected physical offset for theburst of 10.5 +/- 1.7 kpc, typical of previous short grbs. at this redshift,the isotropic gamma-ray energy is e_{gamma,iso} \approx 3\times10^51 erg(rest-frame 23-2300 kev) with a peak energy of e_{pk} \approx 850-2300 kev(rest-frame). in conjunction with the isotropic x-ray energy, grb111117aappears to follow our recently-reported e_x,iso-e_gamma,iso-e_pk universalscaling. using the x-ray data along with the optical and radio non-detectionswe find that for a blastwave kinetic energy of e_{k,iso} \approx e_{gamma,iso},the circumburst density is n_0 \sim 3x10^(-4)-1 cm^-3 (for a range ofepsilon_b=0.001-0.1). similarly, from the non-detection of a break in the x-raylight curve at t&lt;3 d, we infer a minimum opening angle for the outflow oftheta_j&gt; 3-10 degrees (depending on the circumburst density). we conclude thatchandra observations of short grbs are effective at determining precisepositions and robust host galaxy associations in the absence of optical andradio detections.

1206.4050	ultra-luminous supernovae as a new probe of the interstellar medium in  distant galaxies	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery and light curves, and follow-up mmt andgemini spectroscopy of an ultra-luminous supernova (ulsn; dubbed ps1-11bam) ata redshift of z=1.566 with a peak brightness of m_uv=-22.3 mag. ps1-11bam isone of the highest redshift spectroscopically-confirmed sne known to date. thespectrum is characterized by broad absorption features typical of previousulsne (e.g., cii, siiii), and by strong and narrow mgii and feii absorptionlines from the interstellar medium (ism) of the host galaxy, confirmed by an[oii]3727 emission line at the same redshift. the equivalent widths of thefeii2600 and mgii2803 lines are in the top quartile of the quasar interveningabsorption system distribution, but are weaker than those of gamma-ray burstintrinsic absorbers (i.e., grb host galaxies). we also detect the host galaxyin pre-explosion pan-starrs1 data and find that its uv spectral energydistribution is best fit with a young stellar population age of tau~15-45 myrand a stellar mass of m \sim (1.1-2.6)x10^9 m_sun (for z=0.05-1 z_sun). thestar formation rate inferred from the uv continuum and [oii]3727 emission lineis ~10 m_sun/yr, higher than in any previous ulsn host. ps1-11bam provides thefirst direct demonstration that ulsne can serve as probes of the interstellarmedium in distant galaxies. at the present, the depth and red sensitivity ofps1 are uniquely suited to finding such events at cosmologically interestingredshifts (z~1-2); the future combination of lsst and 30-m class telescopespromises to extend this technique to z~4.

1207.2152	multi-wavelength observations of supernova 2011ei: time-dependent  classification of type iib and ib supernovae and implications for their  progenitors	we present x-ray, uv/optical, and radio observations of thestripped-envelope, core-collapse supernova (sn) 2011ei, one of the leastluminous sne iib or ib observed to date. our observations begin with adiscovery within 1 day of explosion and span several months afterward. earlyoptical spectra exhibit broad, type ii-like hydrogen balmer profiles thatsubside rapidly and are replaced by type ib-like he-rich features on thetimescale of one week. high-cadence monitoring of this transition suggests thatabsorption attributable to a high velocity (&gt; 12,000 km/s) h-rich shell is notrare in type ib events. radio observations imply a shock velocity of v = 0.13cand a progenitor star mass-loss rate of 1.4 x 10^{-5} msun yr^{-1} (assumingwind velocity v_w=10^3 km/s). this is consistent with independent constraintsfrom deep x-ray observations with swift-xrt and chandra. overall, themulti-wavelength properties of sn 2011ei are consistent with the explosion of alower-mass (3-4 msun), compact (r* &lt;= 1x10^{11} cm), he core star. the starretained a thin hydrogen envelope at the time of explosion, and was embedded inan inhomogeneous circumstellar wind suggestive of modest episodic mass-loss. weconclude that sn 2011ei's rapid spectral metamorphosis is indicative oftime-dependent classifications that bias estimates of explosion rates for typeiib and ib objects, and that important information about a progenitor star'sevolutionary state and mass-loss immediately prior to sn explosion can beinferred from timely multi-wavelength observations.

0711.3739	when grb afterglows get softer, hard components come into play	we aim to investigate the ability of simple spectral models to describe thegrb early afterglow emission. we performed a time resolved spectral analysis ofa bright grb sample detected by the swift burst alert telescope and promptlyobserved by the swift x-ray telescope,with spectroscopically measured redshiftin the period april 2005 -- january 2007. the sample consists of 22 grbs and atotal of 214 spectra. we restricted our analysis to the softest spectrasub--sample which consists of 13 spectra with photon index &gt; 3. in this samplewe found that four spectra, belonging to grb060502a, grb060729, grb060904b,grb061110a prompt--afterglow transition phase, cannot be modeled neither by asingle power law nor by the band model. instead we find that the data presenthigh energy (&gt; 3 kev, in the observer frame) excesses with respect to thesemodels. we estimated the joint statistical significance of these excesses atthe level of 4.3 sigma. in all four cases, the deviations can be modeled wellby adding either a second power law or a blackbody component to the usualsynchrotron power law spectrum. the additional power law would be explained bythe emerging of the afterglow, while the blackbody could be interpreted as thephotospheric emission from x-ray flares or as the shock breakout emission. inone case these models leave a 2.2 sigma excess which can be fit by a gaussianline at the energy the highly ionized nickel recombination. although the datado not allow an unequivocal interpretation, the importance of this analysisconsists in the fact that we show that a simple power law model or a band modelare insufficient to describe the x-ray spectra of a small homogeneous sample ofgrbs at the end of their prompt phase.

1209.4654	illuminating the darkest gamma-ray bursts with radio observations	we present x-ray, optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of grbs110709b and 111215a, as well as optical and near-ir observations of their hostgalaxies. the combination of x-ray detections and deep optical/near-infraredlimits establish both bursts as "dark". sub-arcsecond positions enabled byradio detections lead to robust host galaxy associations, with opticaldetections that indicate z &lt; 4 (110709b) and 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.7 (111215a). using theradio and x-ray data for each burst we find that grb 110709b requires a_v &gt; 5.3mag and grb 111215a requires a_v &gt; 8.5 mag (z=2), among the largest extinctionvalues inferred for dark bursts to-date. the two bursts also exhibit largeneutral hydrogen column densities (n_h &gt; 10^22/cm^2; z=2) as inferred fromtheir x-ray spectra, in agreement with the trend for dark grbs. finally, wefind that for both bursts the afterglow emission is best explained by acollimated outflow with a total beaming-corrected energy of e_gamma+e_k ~ 7-9 x10^51 erg (z=2) expanding into a wind medium with a high density (n~100-350cm^-3 at 10^17 cm). while the energy release is typical of long grbs, theinferred density may be indicative of larger mass loss rates for grbprogenitors in dusty (and hence metal rich) environments. this studyestablishes the critical role of radio observations in determining the originand properties of dark grbs. observations with the jvla and alma will provide asample with sub-arcsecond positions and robust host associations that will helpshed light on obscured star formation and the role of metallicity in grbprogenitors.

1209.5423	the afterglow and ulirg host galaxy of the dark short grb 120804a	we present the optical discovery and sub-arcsecond optical and x-raylocalization of the afterglow of the short grb 120804a, as well as optical,near-ir, and radio detections of its host galaxy. x-ray observations withswift/xrt, chandra, and xmm-newton to ~19 d reveal a single power law decline.the optical afterglow is faint, and comparison to the x-ray flux indicates thatgrb 120804a is "dark", with a rest-frame extinction of a_v~2.5 mag (at z~1.3).the intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density inferred from the x-ray spectrum,n_h~2x10^22 cm^-2, is commensurate with the large extinction. the host galaxyexhibits red optical/near-ir colors. equally important, jvla observations at0.9-11 d reveal a constant 5.8 ghz flux density and an optically-thin spectrum,unprecedented for grb afterglows, but suggestive instead of emission from thehost galaxy. the optical/near-ir and radio fluxes are well fit with the scaledspectral energy distribution of the local ultra-luminous infrared galaxy(ulirg) arp 220 at z~1.3, with a resulting star formation rate of ~300 msun/yr.the inferred extinction and small projected offset (2.2+/-1.2 kpc) are alsoconsistent with the ulirg scenario, as is the presence of a companion galaxy ata separation of about 11 kpc. the limits on radio afterglow emission, inconjunction with the observed x-ray and optical emission, require a circumburstdensity of ~10^-3 cm^-3 an isotropic-equivalent energy scale of e_gamma,iso ~e_k,iso ~ 7x10^51 erg, and a jet opening angle of &gt;8 deg. the expected fractionof luminous infrared galaxies in the short grb host sample is ~0.01-0.3 (forpure stellar mass and star formation weighting, respectively). thus, theobserved fraction of 2 events in about 25 hosts (grbs 120804a and 100206a),provides additional support to our previous conclusion that short grbs trackboth stellar mass and star formation activity.

1212.1173	radio monitoring of the tidal disruption event swift j164449.3+573451.  ii. the relativistic jet shuts off and a transition to forward shock  x-ray/radio emission	we present continued multi-frequency radio observations of the relativistictidal disruption event sw1644+57 extending to dt~600 d. the data were obtainedwith the jvla and ami large array. we combine these data with public swift/xrtand chandra x-ray observations over the same time-frame to show that the jethas undergone a dramatic transition starting at ~500 d, with a sharp decline inthe x-ray flux by about a factor of 170 on a timescale of dt/t&lt;0.2. the rapiddecline rules out a forward shock origin (direct or reprocessing) for the x-rayemission at &lt;500 d, and instead points to internal dissipation in the innerjet. on the other hand, our radio data uniquely demonstrate that the low x-rayflux measured by chandra at ~610 d is consistent with emission from the forwardshock. furthermore, the chandra data are inconsistent with thermal emissionfrom the accretion disk itself since the expected temperature of 30-60 ev andinner radius of 2-10 r_s cannot accommodate the observed flux level or thedetected emission at &gt;1 kev. we associate the rapid decline with a turn off ofthe relativistic jet when the mass accretion rate dropped below mdot_edd~0.006msun/yr (for a 3x10^6 msun black hole and order unity efficiency) indicatingthat the peak accretion rate was about 330 mdot_edd, and the total accretedmass by 500 d is about 0.15 msun. from the radio data we further findsignificant flattening in the integrated energy of the forward shock at &gt;250 dwith e_j,iso~2x10^54 erg (e_j~10^52$ erg for a jet opening angle, theta_j=0.1)following a rise by about a factor of 15 at 30-250 d. projecting forward, wepredict that the emission in the radio and x-ray bands will evolve in tandemwith similar decline rates.

0712.1412	anomalous x-ray emission in grb060904b: a nickel line?	the detection of an extra component in grb060904b x-ray spectra in additionto the standard single power-law behaviour has recently been reported in theliterature. this component can be fit with different models; in particular theaddition of a spectral line provides the best representation.in this paper weinvestigate the physical properties that the surrounding medium must have inorder to produce a spectral feature that can explain the detected emission. weanalyse and discuss how and if the detected spectral excess fits in differenttheoretical models developed to explain the nature of line emission during theafterglow phase of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). trasmission and reflection modelshave been considered. given the high value (&gt;&gt;1) of the thomson optical depth,the emission is likely to arise in a reflection scenario. within reflectionmodels, the external reflection geometry fails to predict the observedluminosity. on the contrary, the detected feature can be explained in a funnelscenario with typical opening angle theta of 5 degrees, nickel mass of theorder of 0.1 m_o and t=10^6 k. for theta=20 degrees, assuming the reprocessingmaterial to be the sn shell, the detected emission implies a nickel mass of 0.4m_o at t=10^7 k and a metallicity 10 times the solar value. if the giant x-rayflare that dominates the early xrt light curve is identified with the ionizingsource, the sn expansion began 3000 s before the grb event.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

(2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1401.2368	sn2011hs: a fast and faint type iib supernova from a supergiant  progenitor	observations spanning a large wavelength range, from x-ray to radio, of thetype iib supernova 2011hs are presented, covering its evolution during thefirst year after explosion. the optical light curve presents a narrower shapeand a fainter luminosity at peak than previously observed for type iib sne.high expansion velocities are measured from the broad absorption h i and he ilines. from the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the time evolutionof the photospheric velocities with hydrodynamical models, we found that sn2011hs is consistent with the explosion of a 3-4 msun he-core progenitor star,corresponding to a main sequence mass of 12-15 msun, that ejected a mass of56ni of about 0.04 msun, with an energy of e= 8.5 x 10^50 erg. such a low-massprogenitor scenario is in full agreement with the modelling of the nebularspectrum taken at $\sim$215 days from maximum. from the modelling of theadiabatic cooling phase, we infer a progenitor radius of $\approx$500-600 rsun,clearly pointing to an extended progenitor star. the radio light curve of sn2011hs yields a peak luminosity similar to that of sn 1993j, but with a highermass loss rate and a wind density possibly more similar to that of sn 2001ig.although no significant deviations from a smooth decline have been found in theradio light curves, we cannot rule out the presence of a binary companion star.

1401.2991	interaction between the broad-lined type ic supernova 2012ap and  carriers of diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are absorption features observed inoptical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated withcarbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. however, because thecentral wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronictransitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remaineduncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. here we report onunusually strong dibs in optical spectra of the broad-lined type ic supernovasn 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)timescales. the 4428 and 6283 angstrom dib features get weaker with time,whereas the 5780 angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. these nonuniformchanges suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of thedibs and that the dib carriers possess high ionization potentials, such assmall cations or charged fullerenes. we conclude that moderate-resolutionspectra of supernovae with dib absorptions obtained within weeks of outburstcould reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of theirprogenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of dibcarriers.

1402.6344	relativistic supernovae have shorter-lived central engines or more  extended progenitors: the case of sn\,2012ap	deep late-time x-ray observations of the relativistic, engine-driven, type icsn2012ap allow us to probe the nearby environment of the explosion and revealthe unique properties of relativistic sne. we find that on a local scale of~0.01 pc the environment was shaped directly by the evolution of the progenitorstar with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate &lt;5x10^-6 msun yr-1 in line with grbsand the other relativistic sn2009bb. like sub-energetic grbs, sn2012ap ischaracterized by a bright radio emission and evidence for mildly relativisticejecta. however, its late time (t~20 days) x-ray emission is ~100 times fainterthan the faintest sub-energetic grb at the same epoch, with no evidence forlate-time central engine activity. these results support theoretical proposalsthat link relativistic sne like 2009bb and 2012ap with the weakest observedengine-driven explosions, where the jet barely fails to breakout. furthermore,our observations demonstrate that the difference between relativistic sne andsub-energetic grbs is intrinsic and not due to line-of-sight effects. thisphenomenology can either be due to an intrinsically shorter-lived engine or toa more extended progenitor in relativistic sne.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1404.5211	optical spectroscopic observations of gamma-ray blazars candidates i:  preliminary results	a significant fraction ($\sim 30$ %) of the gamma-ray sources listed in thesecond $\textit{fermi}$ lat (2fgl) catalog is still of unknown origin, beingnot yet associated with counterparts at lower energies. using the availableinformation at lower energies and optical spectroscopy on the selectedcounterparts of these gamma-ray objects we can pinpoint their exact nature.here we present a pilot project pointing to assess the effectiveness of theseveral classification methods developed to select gamma-ray blazar candidates.to this end, we report optical spectroscopic observations of a sample of 5gamma-ray blazar candidates selected on the basis of their infrared wise colorsor of their low-frequency radio properties. blazars come in two main classes:bl lacs and fsrqs, showing similar optical spectra except for the strongeremission lines of the latter. for three of our sources the almost featurelessoptical spectra obtained confirm their bl lac nature, while for the sourcewisej022051.24+250927.6 we observe emission lines with equivalent width $ew\sim31$ $\aa$, identifying it as a fsrq with $z = 0.48$. the sourcewisej064459.38+603131.7, although not featuring a clear radio counterpart,shows a blazar-like spectrum with weak emission lines with $ew \sim 7$ $\aa$,yielding a redshift estimate of $z=0.36$. in addition we report opticalspectroscopic observations of 4 wise sources associated with known gamma-rayblazars without a firm classification or redshift estimate. for all of theselatter sources we confirm a bl lac classification, with a tentative redshiftestimate for the source wisej100800.81+062121.2 of $z = 0.65$.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1408.1606	the broad-lined type ic sn 2012ap and the nature of relativistic  supernovae lacking a gamma-ray burst detection	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations of sn 2012ap,a broad-lined type ic supernova in the galaxy ngc 1729 that produced arelativistic and rapidly decelerating outflow without a gamma-ray burstsignature. photometry and spectroscopy follow the flux evolution from -13 to+272 days past the b-band maximum of -17.4 +/- 0.5 mag. the spectra aredominated by fe ii, o i, and ca ii absorption lines at ejecta velocities of20,000 km/s that change slowly over time. other spectral absorption lines areconsistent with contributions from photospheric he i, and hydrogen may also bepresent at higher velocities (&gt; 27,000 km/s). we use these observations toestimate explosion properties and derive a total ejecta mass of 2.7 msolar, akinetic energy of 1.0x10^{52} erg, and a 56ni mass of 0.1-0.2 msolar. nebularspectra (t &gt; 200d) exhibit an asymmetric double-peaked [oi] 6300,6364 emissionprofile that we associate with absorption in the supernova interior, althoughtoroidal ejecta geometry is an alternative explanation. sn 2012ap joins sn2009bb as another exceptional supernova that shows evidence for a centralengine (e.g., black-hole accretion or magnetar) capable of launching anon-negligible portion of ejecta to relativistic velocities without acoincident gamma-ray burst detection. defining attributes of their progenitorsystems may be related to notable properties including above-averageenvironmental metallicities of z &gt; zsolar, moderate to high levels ofhost-galaxy extinction (e(b-v) &gt; 0.4 mag), detection of high-velocity helium atearly epochs, and a high relative flux ratio of [ca ii]/[o i] &gt; 1 at nebularepochs. these events support the notion that jet activity at various energyscales may be present in a wide range of supernovae.

1501.02706	a common stochastic process rules gamma-ray burst prompt emission and  x-ray flares	prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray afterglow emission in gamma-ray bursts(grbs) are characterized by a bursty behavior and are often interspersed withlong quiescent times. there is compelling evidence that x-ray flares are linkedto prompt gamma-rays. however, the physical mechanism that leads to the complextemporal distribution of gamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares is not understood.here we show that the waiting time distribution (wtd) of pulses and flaresexhibits a power-law tail extending over 4 decades with index ~2 and can be themanifestation of a common time-dependent poisson process. this result is robustand is obtained on different catalogs. surprisingly, grbs with many (&gt;=8)gamma-ray pulses are very unlikely to be accompanied by x-ray flares after theend of the prompt emission (3.1 sigma gaussian confidence). these results areconsistent with a simple interpretation: an hyperaccreting disk breaks up intoone or a few groups of fragments, each of which is independently accreted withthe same probability per unit time. prompt gamma-rays and late x-ray flares arenothing but different fragments being accreted at the beginning and at the end,respectively, following the very same stochastic process and likely the samemechanism.

1504.06668	type iib supernova 2013df entering into an interaction phase: a link  between the progenitor and the mass loss	we report the late-time evolution of type iib supernova (sn iib) 2013df. sn2013df showed a dramatic change in its spectral features at ~1 year after theexplosion. early on it showed typical characteristics shared by sne iib/ib/icdominated by metal emission lines, while later on it was dominated by broad andflat-topped halpha and he i emissions. the late-time spectra are strikinglysimilar to sn iib 1993j, which is the only previous example clearly showing thesame transition. this late-time evolution is fully explained by a change in theenergy input from the $^{56}$co decay to the interaction between the sn ejectaand dense circumstellar matter (csm). the mass loss rate is derived to be ~(5.4+- 3.2) x 10^{-5} msun/yr (for the wind velocity of ~20 km/s), similar to sn1993j but larger than sn iib 2011dh by an order of magnitude. the strikingsimilarity between sne 2013df and 1993j in the (candidate) progenitors and thecsm environments, and the contrast in these natures to sn 2011dh, infer thatthere is a link between the natures of the progenitor and the mass loss: sneiib with a more extended progenitor have experienced a much stronger mass lossin the final centuries toward the explosion. it might indicate that sne iibfrom a more extended progenitor are the explosions during a strong binaryinteraction phase, while those from a less extended progenitor have a delaybetween the strong binary interaction and the explosion.

1505.03522	grb 140606b / iptf14bfu: detection of shock-breakout emission from a  cosmological gamma-ray burst?	we present optical and near-infrared photometry of grb~140606b ($z=0.384$),and optical photometry and spectroscopy of its associated supernova (sn). theresults of our modelling indicate that the bolometric properties of the sn($m_{\rm ni} = 0.4\pm0.2$~m$_{\odot}$, $m_{\rm ej} = 5\pm2$~m$_{\odot}$, and$e_{\rm k} = 2\pm1 \times 10^{52}$ erg) are fully consistent with thestatistical averages determined for other grb-sne. however, in terms of its$\gamma$-ray emission, grb~140606b is an outlier of the amati relation, andoccupies the same region as low-luminosity ($ll$) and short grbs. the$\gamma$-ray emission in $ll$grbs is thought to arise in some or all eventsfrom a shock-breakout (sbo), rather than from a jet. the measured peak photonenergy ($e_{\rm p}\approx800$ kev) is close to that expected for $\gamma$-rayscreated by a sbo ($\gtrsim1$ mev). moreover, based on its position in the$m_{v,\rm p}$--$l_{\rm iso,\gamma}$~plane and the $e_{\rmk}$--$\gamma\beta$~plane, grb~140606b has properties similar to both sbo-grbsand jetted-grbs. additionally, we searched for correlations between theisotropic $\gamma$-ray emission and the bolometric properties of a sample ofgrb-sne, finding that no statistically significant correlation is present. theaverage kinetic energy of the sample is $\bar{e}_{\rm k} = 2.1\times10^{52}$erg. all of the grb-sne in our sample, with the exception of sn 2006aj, arewithin this range, which has implications for the total energy budget availableto power both the relativistic and non-relativistic components in a grb-snevent.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1511.01907	metamorphosis of sn 2014c: delayed interaction between a hydrogen poor  core-collapse supernova and a nearby circumstellar shell	we present optical observations of supernova sn 2014c, which underwent anunprecedented slow metamorphosis from h-poor type ib to h-rich type iin overthe course of one year. the observed spectroscopic evolution is consistent withthe supernova having exploded in a cavity before encountering a massive shellof the progenitor star's stripped hydrogen envelope. possible origins for thecircumstellar shell include a brief wolf-rayet fast wind phase that overtook aslower red supergiant wind, eruptive ejection, or confinement of circumstellarmaterial by external influences of neighboring stars. an extended high velocityhalpha absorption feature seen in near-maximum light spectra implies that theprogenitor star was not completely stripped of hydrogen at the time of corecollapse. archival pre-explosion subaru telescope suprime-cam and hubble spacetelescope wide field planetary camera 2 images of the region obtained in 2009show a coincident source that is most likely a compact massive star cluster inngc 7331 that hosted the progenitor system. by comparing the emissionproperties of the source with stellar population models that incorporateinteracting binary stars we estimate the age of the host cluster to be 30 - 300myr, and favor ages closer to 30 myr in light of relatively strong halphaemission. sn 2014c is the best-observed member of a class of core-collapsesupernovae that fill the gap between events that interact strongly with dense,nearby environments immediately after explosion and those that never show signsof interaction. better understanding of the frequency and nature of thisintermediate population can contribute valuable information about the poorlyunderstood final stages of stellar evolution.
