0903.2139	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. i. the transiting  planetary system wasp-5	we present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolarplanetary system wasp-5, obtained with the danish 1.54m telescope at eso lasilla. in order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussedthe telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter40 pixels (16 arcsec). data reduction was undertaken using standard aperturephotometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparisonstars. the resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag forthe first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. we construct detailed signal tonoise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to ourobservations. we model the light curves with the jktebop code and combine theresults with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary modelsto derive the physical properties of the wasp-5 system. we find that the planethas a mass of m_b = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033 mjup, a radius of r_b = 1.171 +/-0.056 +/- 0.012 rjup, a large surface gravity of g_b = 29.6 +/- 2.8 m/s2 and adensity of rho_b = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematicuncertainties). the planet's high equilibrium temperature of t_eq = 1732 +/- 80k makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.

0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1207.1244	a possible binary system of a stellar remnant in the high magnification  gravitational microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-514	we report the extremely high magnification (a &gt; 1000) binary microlensingevent ogle-2007-blg-514. we obtained good coverage around the double peakstructure in the light curve via follow-up observations from differentobservatories. the binary lens model that includes the effects of parallax(known orbital motion of the earth) and orbital motion of the lens yields abinary lens mass ratio of q = 0.321 +/- 0.007 and a projected separation of s =0.072 +/- 0.001$ in units of the einstein radius. the parallax parameters allowus to determine the lens distance d_l = 3.11 +/- 0.39 kpc and total massm_l=1.40 +/- 0.18 m_sun; this leads to the primary and secondary componentshaving masses of m_1 = 1.06 +/- 0.13 m_sun and m_2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 m_sun,respectively. the parallax model indicates that the binary lens system islikely constructed by the main sequence stars. on the other hand, we used abayesian analysis to estimate probability distributions by the model thatincludes the effects of xallarap (possible orbital motion of the source arounda companion) and parallax (q = 0.270 +/- 0.005, s = 0.083 +/- 0.001). theprimary component of the binary lens is relatively massive with m_1 =0.9_{-0.3}^{+4.6} m_sun and it is at a distance of d_l = 2.6_{-0.9}^{+3.8} kpc.given the secure mass ratio measurement, the companion mass is therefore m_2 =0.2_{-0.1}^{+1.2} m_sun. the xallarap model implies that the primary lens islikely a stellar remnant, such as a white dwarf, a neutron star or a blackhole.

(b) theknown jfc population is not complete even at 3 km radius, and even for cometswith perihelia near ~2 au. (c) we find that the jfc nuclear cumulative sizedistribution (csd) has a power-law slope of around -1.9. (d) this power-law isclose to that derived from visible-wavelength observations, suggesting thatthere is no strong dependence of geometric albedo with radius. (e) the observedcsd shows a hint of structure with an excess of comets with radii 3 to 6 km.(f) our csd is consistent with an intrinsic distribution that lacks manysub-kilometer objects.

1502.06663	reanalyses of anomalous gravitational microlensing events in the  ogle-iii early warning system database with combined data	we reanalyze microlensing events in the published list of anomalous eventsthat were observed from the ogle lensing survey conducted during 2004-2008period. in order to check the existence of possible degenerate solutions andextract extra information, we conduct analyses based on combined data fromother survey and follow-up observation and consider higher-order effects. amongthe analyzed events, we present analyses of 8 events for which either newsolutions are identified or additional information is obtained. we find thatthe previous binary-source interpretations of 5 events are better interpretedby binary-lens models. these events include ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2007-blg-159, ogle-2007-blg-491, ogle-2008-blg-143, and ogle-2008-blg-210.with additional data covering caustic crossings, we detect finite-sourceeffects for 6 events including ogle-2006-blg-215, ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2006-blg-450, ogle-2008-blg-143, ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513.among them, we are able to measure the einstein radii of 3 events for whichmulti-band data are available. these events are ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513. for ogle-2008-blg-143, we detecthigher-order effect induced by the changes of the observer's position caused bythe orbital motion of the earth around the sun. in addition, we presentdegenerate solutions resulting from the known close/wide or eclipticdegeneracy. finally, we note that the masses of the binary companions of thelenses of ogle-2006-blg-450 and ogle-2008-blg-210 are in the brown-dwarfregime.

1502.07345	a census of variability in globular cluster m68 (ngc 4590)	we analyse 20 nights of ccd observations in the v and i bands of the globularcluster m68 (ngc 4590), using these to detect variable objects. we alsoobtained electron-multiplying ccd (emccd) observations for this cluster inorder to explore its core with unprecedented spatial resolution from theground.  we reduced our data using difference image analysis, in order to achieve thebest possible photometry in the crowded field of the cluster. in doing so, weshowed that when dealing with identical networked telescopes, a reference imagefrom any telescope may be used to reduce data from any other telescope, whichfacilitates the analysis significantly. we then used our light curves toestimate the properties of the rr lyrae (rrl) stars in m68 through fourierdecomposition and empirical relations. the variable star properties thenallowed us to derive the cluster's metallicity and distance.  we determine new periods for the variable stars, and search for newvariables, especially in the core of the cluster where our method performsparticularly well. we detect an additional 4 sx phe stars, and confirm thevariability of another star, bringing the total number of confirmed variablestars in this cluster to 50. we also used archival data stretching back to 1951in order to derive period changes for some of the single-mode rrl stars, andanalyse the significant number of double-mode rrl stars in m68. furthermore, wefind evidence for double-mode pulsation in one of the sx phe stars in thiscluster. using the different types of variables, we derived an estimate of themetallicity, [fe/h]=$-2.07 \pm 0.06$ on the zw scale, and 4 independentestimates of the distance modulus ($\mu_0 \sim$ 15.00 mag) for this cluster.thanks to the first use of difference image analysis on time-seriesobservations of m68, we are now confident that we have a complete census of therrl stars in this cluster.

1503.09184	transits and starspots in the wasp-6 planetary system	we present updates to \textsc{prism}, a photometric transit-starspot model,and \textsc{gemc}, a hybrid optimisation code combining mcmc and a geneticalgorithm. we then present high-precision photometry of four transits in thewasp-6 planetary system, two of which contain a starspot anomaly. all fourtransits were modelled using \textsc{prism} and \textsc{gemc}, and the physicalproperties of the system calculated. we find the mass and radius of the hoststar to be $0.836\pm 0.063\,{\rm m}_\odot$ and $0.864\pm0.024\,{\rm r}_\odot$,respectively. for the planet we find a mass of $0.485\pm 0.027\,{\rm m}_{\rmjup}$, a radius of $1.230\pm0.035\,{\rm r}_{\rm jup}$ and a density of$0.244\pm0.014\,\rho_{\rm jup}$. these values are consistent with those foundin the literature. in the likely hypothesis that the two spot anomalies arecaused by the same starspot or starspot complex, we measure the stars rotationperiod and velocity to be $23.80 \pm 0.15$\,d and $1.78 \pm0.20$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively, at a co-latitude of 75.8$^\circ$. we findthat the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetaryorbital axis is $\lambda = 7.2^{\circ} \pm 3.7^{\circ}$, indicating axialalignment. our results are consistent with and more precise than publishedspectroscopic measurements of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect. these resultssuggest that wasp-6\,b formed at a much greater distance from its host star andsuffered orbital decay through tidal interactions with the protoplanetary disc.

1505.06888	spectrophotometric properties of the nucleus of comet  67p/churyumov-gerasimenko from the osiris instrument onboard the rosetta  spacecraft	the rosetta mission of the european space agency has been orbiting the comet67p/churyumov-gerasimenko (67p) since august 2014 and is now in its escortphase. a large complement of scientific experiments designed to complete themost detailed study of a comet ever attempted are onboard rosetta. we presentresults for the photometric and spectrophotometric properties of the nucleus of67p derived from the osiris imaging system, which consists of a wide anglecamera (wac) and a narrow angle camera (nac). the disk-averaged phase functionof the nucleus of 67p shows a strong opposition surge with a g parameter valueof -0.13$\pm$0.01 in the hg system formalism and an absolute magnitude$h_v(1,1,0)$ = 15.74$\pm$0.02 mag. the integrated spectrophotometry in 20filters covering the 250-1000 nm wavelength range shows a red spectralbehavior, without clear absorption bands except for a potential absorptioncentered at $\sim$ 290 nm that is possibly due to so$_2$ ice. the nucleus showsstrong phase reddening, with disk-averaged spectral slopes increasing from11\%/(100 nm) to 16\%/(100 nm) in the 1.3$^{\circ}$--54$^{\circ}$ phase anglerange. the geometric albedo of the comet is 6.5$\pm$0.2\% at 649 nm, with localvariations of up to $\sim$ 16\% in the hapi region. from the disk-resolvedimages we computed the spectral slope together with local spectrophotometry andidentified three distinct groups of regions (blue, moderately red, and red).the hapi region is the brightest, the bluest in term of spectral slope, and themost active surface on the comet. local spectrophotometry shows an enhancementof the flux in the 700-750 nm that is associated with coma emissions.

1506.08173	pluto's atmosphere from stellar occultations in 2012 and 2013	we analyze two multi-chord stellar occultations by pluto observed on july18th, 2012 and may 4th, 2013, and monitored respectively from five and sixsites. they provide a total of fifteen light-curves, twelve of them being usedfor a simultaneous fit that uses a unique temperature profile, assuming a clear(no-haze) and pure n_2 atmosphere, but allowing for a possible pressurevariation between the two dates. we find a solution that fits satisfactorily(i.e. within the noise level) all the twelve light-curves, providingatmospheric constraints between ~1,190 km (pressure ~ 11 \mubar) and ~ 1,450 km(pressure ~0.1 \mubar) from pluto's center. our main results are: (1) thebest-fitting temperature profile shows a stratosphere with strong positivegradient between 1,190 km (at 36 k, 11 \mubar) and r = 1,215 km (6.0 \mubar),where a temperature maximum of 110 k is reached; above it is a mesosphere withnegative thermal gradient of -0.2 k/km up to ~ 1,390 km (0.25 \mubar), where,the mesosphere connects itself to a more isothermal upper branch around 81 k;(2) the pressure shows a small (6 %) but significant increase (6-\sigma level)between the two dates; (3) without troposphere, pluto's radius is found to ber_p = 1,190 +/- 5km. allowing for a troposphere, r_p is constrained to liebetween 1,168 and 1,195 km; (4) the currently measured co abundance is toosmall to explain the mesospheric negative thermal gradient. cooling by hcn ispossible, but only if this species is largely saturated; alternativeexplanations like zonal winds or vertical compositional variations of theatmosphere are unable to explain the observed mesospheric trend.

1508.06636	spitzer microlens measurement of a massive remnant in a well-separated  binary	we report the detection and mass measurement of a binary lensogle-2015-blg-1285la,b, with the more massive component having$m_1&gt;1.35\,m_\odot$ (80% probability). a main-sequence star in this mass rangeis ruled out by limits on blue light, meaning that a primary in this mass rangemust be a neutron star or black hole. the system has a projected separation$r_\perp= 6.1\pm 0.4\,{\rm au}$ and lies in the galactic bulge. thesemeasurements are based on the "microlens parallax" effect, i.e., comparing themicrolensing light curve as seen from $spitzer$, which lay at $1.25\,{\rm au}$projected from earth, to the light curves from four ground-based surveys, threein the optical and one in the near infrared. future adaptive optics imaging ofthe companion by 30m class telescopes will yield a much more accuratemeasurement of the primary mass. this discovery both opens the path and definesthe challenges to detecting and characterizing black holes and neutron stars inwide binaries, with either dark or luminous companions. in particular, wediscuss lessons that can be applied to future $spitzer$ and $kepler$ k2microlensing parallax observations.

1509.05609	larger and faster: revised properties and a shorter orbital period for  the wasp-57 planetary system from a pro-am collaboration	transits in the wasp-57 planetary system have been found to occur half anhour earlier than expected. we present ten transit light curves from amateurtelescopes, on which this discovery was based, thirteen transit light curvesfrom professional facilities which confirm and refine this finding, andhigh-resolution imaging which show no evidence for nearby companions. we usethese data to determine a new and precise orbital ephemeris, and measure thephysical properties of the system. our revised orbital period is 4.5s shorterthan found from the discovery data alone, which explains the early occurrenceof the transits. we also find both the star and planet to be larger and lessmassive than previously thought. the measured mass and radius of the planet arenow consistent with theoretical models of gas giants containing noheavy-element core, as expected for the sub-solar metallicity of the host star.two transits were observed simultaneously in four passbands. we use theresulting light curves to measure the planet's radius as a function ofwavelength, finding that our data are sufficient in principle but not inpractise to constrain its atmospheric properties. we conclude with a discussionof the current and future status of transmission photometry studies for probingthe atmospheres of gas-giant transiting planets.

1511.05171	physical properties of the planetary systems wasp-45 and wasp-46 from  simultaneous multi-band photometry	accurate measurements of the physical characteristics of a large number ofexoplanets are useful to strongly constrain theoretical models of planetformation and evolution, which lead to the large variety of exoplanets andplanetary-system configurations that have been observed. we present a study ofthe planetary systems wasp-45 and wasp-46, both composed of a main-sequencestar and a close-in hot jupiter, based on 29 new high-quality light curves oftransits events. in particular, one transit of wasp-45 b and four of wasp-46 bwere simultaneously observed in four optical filters, while one transit ofwasp-46 b was observed with the ntt obtaining precision of 0.30 mmag with acadence of roughly three minutes. we also obtained five new spectra of wasp-45with the feros spectrograph. we improved by a factor of four the measurement ofthe radius of the planet wasp-45 b, and found that wasp-46 b is slightly lessmassive and smaller than previously reported. both planets now have a moreaccurate measurement of the density (0.959 +\- 0.077 \rho jup instead of 0.64+\- 0.30 \rho jup for wasp-45 b, and 1.103 +\- 0.052 \rho jup instead of 0.94+\- 0.11 \rho jup for wasp-46 b). we tentatively detected radius variationswith wavelength for both planets, in particular in the case of wasp-45 b wefound a slightly larger absorption in the redder bands than in the bluer ones.no hints for the presence of an additional planetary companion in the twosystems were found either from the photometric or radial velocity measurements.

astro-ph;0601563	discovery of a cool planet of 5.5 earth masses through gravitational  microlensing	in the favoured core-accretion model of formation of planetary systems, solidplanetesimals accumulate to build up planetary cores, which then accretenebular gas if they are sufficiently massive. around m-dwarf stars (the mostcommon stars in our galaxy), this model favours the formation of earth-mass toneptune-mass planets with orbital radii of 1 to 10 astronomical units (au),which is consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbitm-dwarf host stars. more than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered witha wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of neptune's mass orless have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 au fromnormal stars. here we report the discovery of a 5.5 (+5.5/-2.7) m_earthplanetary companion at a separation of 2.6 (+1.5/-0.6) au from a 0.22(+0.21/-0.11) m_solar m-dwarf star. (we propose to name it ogle-2005-blg-390lb,indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens star of the microlensingevent.) the mass is lower than that of gj876d, although the error bars overlap.our detection suggests that such cool, sub-neptune-mass planets may be morecommon than gas giant planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory.
