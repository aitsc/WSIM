0905.3453	the parsec-scale properties of the radio galaxy 4c 26.42 in the dense  cooling core cluster a1795	the aim of the present work is to study the radio emission on the parsecscale of 4c 26.42, the brightest cluster galaxy in abell 1795, in the frameworkof radiosources in a dense cool core cluster. we present very long baselinearray (vlba) observations at 1.6, 5, 8.4 and 22 ghz. we performed a spectralindex and multiepoch analysis. the source appears two-sided with a well definedand symmetric z-structure at ~5 mas from the core. the kiloparsec-scalemorphology is similar to the parsec-scale structure, but reversed in p.a., withsymmetric 90 deg. bends at about 2 arcsec from the nuclear region. comparingdata obtained at 3 different epochs we derive a 3$\sigma$ limit to the apparentproper motion of $\beta_a$ &lt; 0.04. we suggest that the parsec-scale jets aresub-relativistic, in contrast with the high velocities found for most low-powerradio galaxies. the origin of the unusual radio morphology remains a puzzle. wesuggest that the identification of the parent galaxy with the central cd in acooling cluster plays an important role in the properties and structure of thejets.

0908.4391	the bologna complete sample of nearby radio sources: ii -- phase  referenced observations of faint nuclear sources	to study statistical properties of different classes of sources, it isnecessary to observe a sample that is free of selection effects. to do this, weinitiated a project to observe a complete sample of radio galaxies selectedfrom the b2 catalogue of radio sources and the third cambridge revisedcatalogue (3cr), with no selection constraint on the nuclear properties. wenamed this sample "the bologna complete sample" (bcs). we present new vlbiobservations at 5 and 1.6 ghz for 33 sources drawn from a sample not biasedtoward orientation. by combining these data with those in the literature,information on the parsec-scale morphology is available for a total of 76 of 94radio sources with a range in radio power and kiloparsec-scale morphologies.the fraction of two-sided sources at milliarcsecond resolution is high (30%),compared to the fraction found in vlbi surveys selected at centimeterwavelengths, as expected from the predictions of unified models. theparsec-scale jets are generally found to be straight and to line up with thekiloparsec-scale jets. a few peculiar sources are discussed in detail.

0707.3516	jet properties and evolution in small and intermediate scale objects	kinematic and spectral studies are improving our knowledge of the agedistribution in compact radio sources, providing evidence that small sourcesare generally very young. the properties of jets in objects spanning the sizerange from a few tens of parsecs to some kiloparsecs become then of particularinterest. because of our selection criteria and of the small scales involved,the properties of jets in the population of compact symmetric objects (cso) arenot well known yet. polarization properties seem to indicate a strong influenceby the interaction with the dense surrounding medium, and some objects showevidence of relativistic bulk motion. more evolved jets are present in theclass of low power compact (lpc) sources and a number of cases are discussedhere. since it is becoming increasingly clear that not all these sources willsurvive to evolve into large scale radio galaxies, the question of the finalevolution of the cso and lpc population is also discussed, with examples ofcandidate dying sources.

1204.0790	assessing the significance of apparent correlations between radio and  gamma-ray blazar fluxes	whether a correlation exists between the radio and gamma-ray flux densitiesof blazars is a long-standing question, and one that is difficult to answerconfidently because of various observational biases which may either dilute orapparently enhance any intrinsic correlation between radio and gamma-rayluminosities. we introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluatequantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsicsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray fluxdensities of blazars. the novelty of the method lies in a combination of datarandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data areintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significanceassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid malmquist bias and automaticallyaccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). the method isapplicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statisticalcriteria. for larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which thesample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each binindividually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent toluminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of verylarge, statistically complete samples. we show that for a smaller number ofredshift bins, the method yields a worse significance, and in this way it isconservative in that it does not assign a stronger, artificially enhancedsignificance. we demonstrate how our test performs as a function of number ofsources, strength of correlation, and number of redshift bins used, and we showthat while our test is robust against common-distance biases and associatedfalse positives for uncorrelated data, it retains the power of other methods inrejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation for correlated data.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1208.0230	physical properties of the nuclear region in seyfert galaxies derived  from observations with the european vlbi network	we report on sensitive dual-frequency (1.7 and 5 ghz) european vlbi networkobservations of the central region of nine seyfert galaxies. these sources areamong the faintest and least luminous members of a complete sample of nearby(d&lt;22 mpc) low luminosity agns. we detect radio emission on milliarcsecondscale in the nuclei of 4 galaxies, while for the other five sources we set anupper limit of &lt;~100 microjy. in three sources, namely ngc 3227, ngc 3982, andngc 4138, radio emission is detected at both 1.7 and 5 ghz and it is resolvedin two or more components. we describe the structural and spectral propertiesof these features; we find that in each of these three nuclei there is onecomponent with high brightness temperature (typically t_b &gt;10^7.5 k) andflat/intermediate spectral index (0.3\leq alpha \leq 0.6, s(nu) \simnu^(-alpha), accompanied by secondary steep spectrum extended components. inthese cases, non-thermal emission from jets or outflows is thus the mostnatural explanation. a faint feature is detected in ngc 4477 at 5 ghz; keepingin mind the modest significance of this detection (~5sigma), we propose the hotcorona as the origin of non-thermal emission, on the basis of the unrealisticmagnetic field values required by synchrotron self-absorption. finally, thefive non-detected nuclei remain elusive and further observations onintermediate scales will be necessary to investigate their nature.

1208.5853	vlba monitoring of mrk 421 at 15 ghz and 24 ghz during 2011	high-resolution radio observations are ideal for constraining the value ofphysical parameters in the inner regions of active-galactic-nucleus jets andcomplement results on multiwavelength (mwl) observations. this study is part ofa wider multifrequency campaign targeting the nearby tev blazar markarian 421(z=0.031), with observations in the sub-mm (sma), optical/ir (gasp), uv/x-ray(swift, rxte, maxi), and gamma rays (fermi-lat, magic, veritas). we investigatethe jet's morphology and any proper motions, and the time evolution of physicalparameters such as flux densities and spectral index. the aim of our widermultifrequency campaign is to try to shed light on questions such as the natureof the radiating particles, the connection between the radio and gamma-rayemission, the location of the emitting regions and the origin of the fluxvariability. we consider data obtained with the very long baseline array (vlba)over twelve epochs (one observation per month from january to december 2011) at15 ghz and 24 ghz. we investigate the inner jet structure on parsec scalesthrough the study of model-fit components for each epoch. the structure of mrk421 is dominated by a compact (~0.13 mas) and bright component, with aone-sided jet detected out to ~10 mas. we identify 5-6 components in the jetthat are consistent with being stationary during the 12-month period studiedhere. measurements of the spectral index agree with those of other works: theyare fairly flat in the core region and steepen along the jet length.significant flux-density variations are detected for the core component. fromour results, we draw an overall scenario in which we estimate a viewing angle2{\deg} &lt; theta &lt; 5{\deg} and a different jet velocity for the radio and thehigh-energy emission regions, such that the respective doppler factors are{\delta}r ~3 and {\delta}h.e. ~14.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1309.5286	on the connection between radio and gamma rays. variability and  polarization properties in relativistic jets	relativistic jets are one of the most powerful manifestations of the releaseof energy produced around supermassive black holes at the centre of activegalactic nuclei (agn). their emission is observed across the entireelectromagnetic spectrum, from the radio band to gamma rays. despite decades ofefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. inparticular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energyemission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths areamong the greatest challenges in the study of agn. from the comparison of theradio and gamma-ray light curves of gamma-ray flaring objects, there isevidence that some flares, either in radio or in gamma rays, have not anobvious connection at the other extreme of the electromagnetic spectrum, likein the case of the narrow-line seyfert 1 sbs 0846+513. an intriguing aspectpointed out by high resolution radio observations is the change of thepolarization properties close in time with some high energy flares. inparticular, in pks 1510-089 and 3c 454.3 a rotation of almost 90 degrees hasbeen observed after strong gamma-ray flares. the swing of the polarizationangle may be related either to the propagation of a shock along the jet thatorders the magnetic field, or a change of the opacity regime.

1310.0828	dark matter constraints from observations of 25 milky way satellite  galaxies with the fermi large area telescope	the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way are some of the mostdark-matter-dominated objects known. due to their proximity, high dark mattercontent, and lack of astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal galaxies arewidely considered to be among the most promising targets for the indirectdetection of dark matter via gamma rays. here we report on gamma-rayobservations of 25 milky way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies based on 4years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data. none of the dwarf galaxies aresignificantly detected in gamma rays, and we present gamma-ray flux upperlimits between 500 mev and 500 gev. we determine the dark matter content of 18dwarf spheroidal galaxies from stellar kinematic data and combine latobservations of 15 dwarf galaxies to constrain the dark matter annihilationcross section. we set some of the tightest constraints to date on the theannihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 2 gev and 10 tev intoprototypical standard model channels. we find these results to be robustagainst systematic uncertainties in the lat instrument performance, diffusegamma-ray background modeling, and assumed dark matter density profile.

1401.0548	fermi-lat detection of gravitational lens delayed gamma-ray flares from  blazar b0218+357	using data from the fermi large area telescope (lat), we report the firstclear gamma-ray measurement of a delay between flares from the gravitationallylensed images of a blazar. the delay was detected in b0218+357, a knowndouble-image lensed system, during a period of enhanced gamma-ray activity withpeak fluxes consistently observed to reach &gt;20-50 times its previous averageflux. an auto-correlation function analysis identified a delay in the gamma-raydata of 11.46 +/- 0.16 days (1 sigma) that is ~1 day greater than previousradio measurements. considering that it is beyond the capabilities of the latto spatially resolve the two images, we nevertheless decomposed individualsequences of superposing gamma-ray flares/delayed emissions. in three such~8-10 day-long sequences within a ~4-month span, considering confusion due tooverlapping flaring emission and flux measurement uncertainties, we found fluxratios consistent with ~1, thus systematically smaller than those from radioobservations. during the first, best-defined flare, the delayed emission wasdetailed with a fermi pointing, and we observed flux doubling timescales of~3-6 hrs implying as well extremely compact gamma-ray emitting regions.

1402.5930	limb-brightened jet of 3c 84 revealed by the 43-ghz  very-long-baseline-array observation	we present a study of sub-pc scale radio structure of the radio galaxy 3c84/ngc 1275 based on the very long baseline array (vlba) data at 43 ghz. wediscover a limb-brightening in the "restarted" jet associated with the 2005radio outburst. in the 1990s, the jet structure was ridge-brightening ratherthan limb-brightening, despite the observations being done with similar angularresolution. this indicates that the transverse jet structure has changedrecently. this change in the morphology shows an interesting agreement with the$\gamma$-ray flux increase, i.e., the $\gamma$-ray flux in 1990s was at leastseven times lower than the current one. one plausible explanation for thelimb-brightening is the velocity structure of the jet in the context of thestratified jet, which is a successful scenario to explain the $\gamma$-rayemission in some active galactic nuclei (agns). if this is the case, the changein apparent transverse structure might be caused by the change in thetransverse velocity structure. we argue the possibility that the transitionfrom ridge-brightening to limb-brightening is related to the $\gamma$-ray timevariability on the timescale of decades. we also discuss the collimationprofile of the jet.

1405.1082	a strong radio brightening at the jet base of m87 during the elevated  very-high-energy gamma-ray state in 2012	we report our intensive radio monitoring observations of the jet in m87 withthe vlbi exploration of radio astrometry (vera) and the european vlbi network(evn) from february 2011 to october 2012, together with contemporaneoushigh-energy gamma-ray light curves obtained by the fermi-lat. during thisperiod, an elevated level of the m87 flux is reported at vhe gamma rays. wedetected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolvedjet base (radio core) with vera at 22 and 43ghz coincident with the vheactivity. meanwhile, we confirmed with evn at 5ghz that hst-1 (an alternativegamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its fluxdensity and structure. these results in the radio bands strongly suggest thatthe vhe gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or56 schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. we furtherconducted vera astrometry for the m87 core during the flaring period, anddetected core shifts between 22 and 43ghz. we also discovered a clearfrequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5ghz; theradio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a largeramplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at22 and 43ghz. this indicates that a new radio-emitting component was creatednear the black hole in the period of the vhe event, and then propagated outwardwith progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. by combining these results,we estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived asub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. this value is significantly slower thanthe super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during theprominent vhe flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger vhe activitycan be associated with the production of the higher lorentz factor jet.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.5846	the physics of the radio emission in the quiet side of the agn  population with the ska	despite targets of many multiwavelength campaigns, the main physicalprocesses at work in agn are still under debate. in particular the origin ofthe radio emission and the mechanisms involved are among the open questions inastrophysics. in the radio-loud agn population the radio emission is linked tothe presence of bipolar outflows of relativistic jets. however, the largemajority of the agn population do not form powerful highly-relativistic jets onkpc scales and are characterized by radio luminosity up to 10^23 w/hz at 1.4ghz, challenging our knowledge on the physical processes at the basis of theradio emission in radio-quiet objects. the main mechanisms proposed so far aresynchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic mini-jets, thermalcyclo-synchrotron emission by low-efficiency accretion flow (like adaf oradios), or thermal free-free emission from the x-ray heated corona or wind. thedifficulty in understanding the main mechanism involved is related to theweakness of these objects, which precludes the study of non-local radio-quietagn. multifrequency, high-sensitivity radio observations are crucial toconstrain the nature of the power engine, and they may help in distinguishingbetween the contribution from star formation and agn activity. the advent ofthe ska, with its sub-arcsecond resolution and unprecedented sensitivity willallow us to investigate these processes in radio-quiet agn, even at highredshift for the first time. both the broad-band radio spectrum and thepolarization information will help us in disentangling between non-thermal andthermal origin of the radio emission. the jump in sensitivity of a few order ofmagnitudes at the (sub-)ujy level will enable us to detect radio emission froma large number of radio-quiet agn at high redshift, providing a fundamentalstep in our understanding of their cosmological evolution.

1501.03330	the connection between radio and high energy emission in black hole  powered systems in the ska era	strong evidence exists for a highly significant correlation between the radioflux density and gamma-ray energy flux in blazars revealed by fermi. however,there are central issues that need to be clarified in this field: what are thecounterparts of the about 30% of gamma-ray sources that are as yetunidentified? are they just blazars in disguise or they are something moreexotic, possibly associated with dark matter? how would they fit in theradio-gamma ray connection studied so far?  with their superb sensitivity, ska1-mid and ska1-sur will help to resolve allof these questions. even more, while the radio-mev/gev connection has beenfirmly established, a radio-vhe connection has been entirely elusive so far.the advent of cta in the next few years and the expected cta-ska1 synergy willoffer the chance to explore this connection, even more intriguing as itinvolves the opposite ends of the electromagnetic spectrum and the accelerationof particles up to the highest energies.  we are already preparing to address these questions by exploiting data fromthe various ska pathfinders and precursors. we have obtained 18 cm europeanvlbi network observations of e&gt;10 gev sources, with a detection rate of 83%.moreover, we are cross correlating the fermi catalogs with the mwacommissioning survey: when faint gamma-ray sources are considered, purepositional coincidence is not significant enough for selecting counterparts andwe need an additional physical criterion to pinpoint the right object. it canbe radio spectral index, variability, polarization, or compactness, needinghigh angular resolution in ska1-mid; timing studies can also reveal pulsars,which are often found from dedicated searches of unidentified gamma-raysources. ska will be the ideal instrument for investigating thesecharacteristics in conjunction with cta.

1501.05464	limits on dark matter annihilation signals from the fermi lat 4-year  measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background	we search for evidence of dark matter (dm) annihilation in the isotropicgamma-ray background (igrb) measured with 50 months of fermi large areatelescope (lat) observations. an improved theoretical description of thecosmological dm annihilation signal, based on two complementary techniques andassuming generic weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) properties, rendersmore precise predictions compared to previous work. more specifically, weestimate the cosmologically-induced gamma-ray intensity to have an uncertaintyof a factor ~20 in canonical setups. we consistently include both the galacticand extragalactic signals under the same theoretical framework, and study theimpact of the former on the igrb spectrum derivation. we find no evidence for adm signal and we set limits on the dm-induced isotropic gamma-ray signal. ourlimits are competitive for dm particle masses up to tens of tev and, indeed,are the strongest limits derived from fermi lat data at tev energies. this ispossible thanks to the new fermi lat igrb measurement, which now extends up toan energy of 820 gev. we quantify uncertainties in detail and show thepotential this type of search offers for testing the wimp paradigm with acomplementary and truly cosmological probe of dm particle signals.

1501.06054	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the fermi large  area telescope	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei (agns) detected by the fermi-lat(3lac) is presented. it is based on the third fermi-lat catalog (3fgl) ofsources detected between 100 mev and 300 gev with a test statistic (ts) greaterthan 25, between 2008 august 4 and 2012 july 31. the 3lac includes 1591 agnslocated at high galactic latitudes (|b|&gt;10{\deg}), a 71% increase over thesecond catalog based on 2 years of data. there are 28 duplicate associations,thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3fgl catalog areagns. most of them (98%) are blazars. about half of the newly detected blazarsare of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficientquality to determine the strength of their emission lines. based on theirgamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split betweenflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) and bl~lacs. the most abundant detectedbl~lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (hsp) type. about 50% of the bl~lacshave no measured redshifts. a few new rare outliers (hsp-fsrqs andhigh-luminosity hsp bl~lacs) are reported. the general properties of the 3lacsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. the fraction of 3lacblazars in the total population of blazars listed in bzcat remainsnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the bzcat-blazar radio, optical andx-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazarscould eventually shine in gamma rays at lat-detection levels. the energy-fluxdistributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement withextrapolation from earlier catalogs.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1503.03483	the low-frequency radio catalog of flat spectrum sources	a well known property of the gamma-ray sources detected by cos-b in the1970s, by the compton gamma-ray observatory in the 1990s and recently by thefermi observations is the presence of radio counterparts, in particular forthose associated to extragalactic objects. this observational evidence is thebasis of the radio-gamma-ray connection established for the class of activegalactic nuclei known as blazars. in particular, the main spectral property ofthe radio counterparts associated with gamma-ray blazars is that they show aflat spectrum in the ghz frequency range. our recent analysis dedicated tosearch blazar-like candidates as potential counterparts for the unidentifiedgamma-ray sources (ugss) allowed us to extend the radio-gamma-ray connection inthe mhz regime. we also showed that below 1 ghz blazars maintain flat radiospectra. thus on the basis of these new results, we assembled a low-frequencyradio catalog of flat spectrum sources built by combining the radioobservations of the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss) and of thewesterbork in the southern hemisphere (wish) catalog with those of the nraovery large array sky survey (nvss). this could be used in the future to searchfor new, unknown blazar-like counterparts of the gamma-ray sources. first wefound nvss counterparts of wsrt radio sources and then we selected flatspectrum radio sources according to a new spectral criterion specificallydefined for radio observations performed below 1 ghz. we also described themain properties of the catalog listing 28358 radio sources and their logn-logsdistributions. finally a comparison with with the green bank 6-cm radio sourcecatalog has been performed to investigate the spectral shape of thelow-frequency flat spectrum radio sources at higher frequencies.

0809.2180	the two integral x-ray transients igr j17091--3624 and igr j17098--3628:  a multi-wavelength long term campaign	igr j17091-3624 and igr j17098-3628 are two x-ray transients discovered byintegral and classified as possible black hole candidates (bhcs). we presenthere the results obtained from the analysis of multi-wavelength data setscollected by different instruments from 2005 until the end of 2007 on bothsources. igr j17098-3628 has been regularly detected by integral and rxte overthe entire period of the observational campaign; it was also observed withpointed observations by xmm and swift/xrt in 2005 and 2006 and exhibited fluxvariations not linked with the change of any particular spectral features. igrj17091-3624 was initially in quiescence (after a period of activity between2003 april and 2004 april) and it was then detected again in outburst in thexrt field of view during a swift observation of igr j17098--3628 on 2007 july9. the observations during quiescence provide an upper limit to the 0.2-10 kevluminosity, while the observations in outburst cover the transition from thehard to the soft state. moreover, we obtain a refined x-ray position for igrj17091-3624 from the swift/xrt observations during the outburst in 2007. thenew position is inconsistent with the previously proposed radio counterpart. weidentify in vla archive data a compact radio source consistent with the newx-ray position and propose it as the radio counterpart of the x-ray transient.
