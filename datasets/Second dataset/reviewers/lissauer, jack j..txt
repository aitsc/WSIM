0903.4737	n-body simulations of growth from 1 km planetesimals at 0.4 au	we present n-body simulations of planetary accretion beginning with 1 kmradius planetesimals in orbit about a 1 solar mass star at 0.4 au. the initialdisk of planetesimals contains too many bodies for any current n-body code tointegrate; therefore, we model a sample patch of the disk. although thisgreatly reduces the number of bodies, we still track in excess of 10^5particles. we consider three initial velocity distributions and monitor thegrowth of the planetesimals. the masses of some particles increase by more thana factor of 100. additionally, the escape speed of the largest particle growsconsiderably faster than the velocity dispersion of the particles, suggestingimpending runaway growth, although no particle grows large enough to detachitself from the power law size-frequency distribution. these results are ingeneral agreement with previous statistical and analytical results. we computerotation rates by assuming conservation of angular momentum around the centerof mass at impact and that merged planetesimals relax to spherical shapes. atthe end of our simulations, the majority of bodies that have undergone at leastone merger are rotating faster than the breakup frequency. this implies thatthe assumption of completely inelastic collisions (perfect accretion), which ismade in most simulations of planetary growth at sizes 1 km and above, isinappropriate. our simulations reveal that, subsequent to the number ofparticles in the patch having been decreased by mergers to half its initialvalue, the presence of larger bodies in neighboring regions of the disk maylimit the validity of simulations employing the patch approximation.

0911.3699	planetary formation and evolution revealed with a saturn entry probe:  the importance of noble gases	the determination of saturn's atmospheric noble gas abundances are criticalto understanding the formation and evolution of saturn, and giant planets ingeneral. these measurements can only be performed with an entry probe. a saturnprobe will address whether enhancement in heavy noble gases, as was found injupiter, are a general feature of giant planets, and their ratios will be apowerful constraint on how they form. the helium abundance will show the extentto which helium has phase separated from hydrogen in the planet's deepinterior. jupiter's striking neon depletion may also be tied to its heliumdepletion, and must be confirmed or refuted in saturn. together with jupiter'smeasured atmospheric helium abundance, a consistent evolutionary theory forboth planets, including "helium rain" will be possible. we will then be able tocalibrate the theory of the evolution of all giant planets, includingexoplanets. in addition, high pressure h/he mixtures under giant planetconditions are an important area of condensed matter physics that are beyondthe realm of experiment.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1005.4420	exchange of ejecta between telesto and calypso: tadpoles, horseshoes,  and passing orbits	we have numerically integrated the orbits of ejecta from telesto and calypso,the two small trojan companions of saturn's major satellite tethys. ejecta werelaunched with speeds comparable to or exceeding their parent's escape velocity,consistent with impacts into regolith surfaces. we find that the fates ofejecta fall into several distinct categories, depending on both the speed anddirection of launch.  the slowest ejecta follow sub-orbital trajectories and re-impact their sourcemoon in less than one day. slightly faster debris barely escape their parent'shill sphere and are confined to tadpole orbits, librating about tethys'triangular lagrange points l4 (leading, near telesto) or l5 (trailing, nearcalypso) with nearly the same orbital semi-major axis as tethys, telesto, andcalypso. these ejecta too eventually re-impact their source moon, but with amedian lifetime of a few dozen years. those which re-impact within the firstten years or so have lifetimes near integer multiples of 348.6 days (half thetadpole period).  still faster debris with azimuthal velocity components &gt;~ 10 m/s enterhorseshoe orbits which enclose both l4 and l5 as well as l3, but which avoidtethys and its hill sphere. these ejecta impact either telesto or calypso atcomparable rates, with median lifetimes of several thousand years. however,they cannot reach tethys itself; only the fastest ejecta, with azimuthalvelocities &gt;~ 40 m/s, achieve "passing orbits" which are able to encountertethys. tethys accretes most of these ejecta within several years, but some 1 %of them are scattered either inward to hit enceladus or outward to strikedione, over timescales on the order of a few hundred years.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1102.0543	architecture and dynamics of kepler's candidate multiple transiting  planet systems	about one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in thefirst four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems. thereare 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8with four, and one each with five and six. we characterize the dynamicalproperties of these candidate multi-planet systems. the distribution ofobserved period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs areneither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. nonetheless, there aresmall but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both inresonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularlynear the 2:1 resonance. we find that virtually all candidate systems arestable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radiusrelationship. several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority ofthese multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. using the observedmultiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systemsthat matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number ofsingly-transiting systems. we provide constraints on the true multiplicity andmutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing apopulation of systems with multiple super-earth-size and neptune-size planetswith low to moderate mutual inclinations.

1102.0544	transit timing observations from kepler: i. statistical analysis of the  first four months	the architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraintson models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation oforbital eccentricities and inclinations. nasa's kepler mission has identified1235 transiting planet candidates (borcuki et al 2011). the method of transittiming variations (ttvs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetarysystems (holman et al. 2010; lissauer et al. 2011a). we perform a transittiming analysis of the kepler planet candidates. we find that at least ~12% ofplanet candidates currently suitable for ttv analysis show evidence suggestiveof ttvs, representing at least ~65 ttv candidates. in all cases, the time spanof observations must increase for ttvs to provide strong constraints on planetmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multipletransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). wefind that the fraction of planet candidates showing ttvs in this data set doesnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates perstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with asingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. weanticipate that kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems withmultiple transiting planet candidates via ttvs. thus, ttvs will provide apowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbitaldynamics of low-mass planets. if kepler observations were extended to at leastsix years, then ttvs would provide much more precise constraints on thedynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitiveto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-typestars.

1102.0547	the distribution of transit durations for kepler planet candidates and  implications for their orbital eccentricities	doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits witha wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planetformation. the discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by nasa's keplermission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution ofsmall exoplanets. measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is onlypractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to studythe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transitdurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). weanalyze the transit duration distribution of kepler planet candidates. we findthat for host stars with t_eff &gt; 5100 k we cannot invert this to infer theeccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possiblesystematics in the host star densities. with this limitation in mind, wecompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule outextreme distributions. if we assume a rayleigh eccentricity distribution forkepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of0.1-0.25 for host stars with t_eff &lt; 5100 k. we compare the transit durationdistribution for different subsets of kepler planet candidates and discusstentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. high-precisionspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will berequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results ofsystematic errors in stellar radii. finally, we identify planet candidates thatmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

1102.0605	kepler's first rocky planet: kepler-10b	nasa's kepler mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency ofearth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of sun-like stars. the missionreached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rockyplanet, kepler-10b. two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemerist[bjd]=2454964.57375+n*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris t[bjd]=2454971.6761+n*45.29485 days.statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established theviability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-upobservations. forty precision doppler measurements were used to confirm thatthe short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. the parent staris bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. photometry was collected at1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsationfrequencies. modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of thefundamental stellar properties. kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5gyr) but otherwise sun-like main sequence star with teff=5627 +/- 44 k,mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 msun, and rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 rsun. physical modelssimultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision dopplermeasurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of kepler-10b thatspeak to its rocky composition: mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 mearth, rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036rearth, and density=8.8 +/- 2.9 gcc. kepler-10b is the smallest transitingexoplanet discovered to date.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1106.2807	formation and structure of low density exo-neptunes	kepler has found hundreds of neptune-size (2-6 r_earth) planet candidateswithin 0.5 au of their stars. the nature of the vast majority of these planetsis not known because their masses have not been measured. using theoreticalmodels of planet formation, evolution and structure, we explore the range ofminimum plausible masses for low-density exo-neptunes. we focus on highlyirradiated planets with t_eq&gt;=500k. we consider two separate formation pathwaysfor low-mass planets with voluminous atmospheres of light gases: core nucleatedaccretion and outgassing of hydrogen from dissociated ices. we show thatneptune-size planets at t_eq=500k with masses as small as a few times that ofearth can plausibly be formed core nucleated accretion coupled with subsequentinward migration. we also derive a limiting low-density mass-radius relationfor rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes but no surface water. rockyplanets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes typically have computed radii wellbelow 3 r_earth. for both planets with h/he envelopes from core nucleatedaccretion and planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes, we employ planetinterior models to map the range of planet mass--envelope mass--equilibriumtemperature parameter space that is consistent with neptune-size planet radii.atmospheric mass loss mediates which corners of this parameter space arepopulated by actual planets and ultimately governs the minimum plausible massat a specified transit radius. we find that kepler's 2-6 r_earth planetcandidates at t_eq=500--1000k could potentially have masses less than ~4m_earth. although our quantitative results depend on several assumptions, ourqualitative finding that warm neptune-size planets can have massessubstantially smaller than those given by interpolating the masses and radii ofplanets within our solar system is robust.

1109.1561	the kepler-19 system: a transiting 2.2 r_earth planet and a second  planet detected via transit timing variations	we present the discovery of the kepler-19 planetary system, which we firstidentified from a 9.3-day periodic transit signal in the kepler photometry.from high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effectivetemperature teff=5541 \pm 60 k, a metallicity [fe/h]=-0.13 \pm 0.06, and asurface gravity log(g)=4.59 \pm 0.10. we combine the estimate of teff and[fe/h] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometriclight curve to deduce a stellar mass of m_star = 0.936 \pm 0.040 m_sun and astellar radius of r_star = 0.850 \pm 0.018 r_sun. we rule out the possibilitythat the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by firstidentifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape ofthe light curve. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more than threeorders of magnitude more likely than a blend. the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure atransit depth with spitzer at 4.5 {\mu}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent withthe depth measured in the kepler optical bandpass of 567\pm6 ppm. we determinea physical radius of the planet kepler-19b of r_p = 2.209 \pm 0.048 r_earth.from radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on theplanet mass of 20.3 m_earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 gcm^-3. we report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from apredicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additionalperturbing body in the system. we cannot uniquely determine the orbitalparameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match theamplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the hoststar's radial velocity limits. however, the perturber in these mechanisms hasperiod &lt;160 days and mass &lt;6 m_jup, confirming its planetary nature askepler-19c.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.1892	transit timing observations from kepler: vi. transit timing variation  candidates in the first seventeen months from polynomial models	transit timing variations provide a powerful tool for confirming andcharacterizing transiting planets, as well as detecting non-transiting planets.we report the results an updated ttv analysis for 1481 planet candidates(borucki et al. 2011; batalha et al. 2012) based on transit times measuredduring the first sixteen months of kepler observations. we present 39 strongttv candidates based on long-term trends (2.8% of suitable data sets). wepresent another 136 weaker ttv candidates (9.8% of suitable data sets) based onexcess scatter of ttv measurements about a linear ephemeris. we anticipate thatseveral of these planet candidates could be confirmed and perhaps characterizedwith more detailed ttv analyses using publicly available kepler observations.for many others, kepler has observed a long-term ttv trend, but an extendedkepler mission will be required to characterize the system via ttvs. we findthat the occurrence rate of planet candidates that show ttvs is significantlyincreased (~68%) for planet candidates transiting stars with multipletransiting planet candidate when compared to planet candidates transiting starswith a single transiting planet candidate.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5415	transit timing observations from kepler: iv. confirmation of 4 multiple  planet systems by simple physical models	eighty planetary systems of two or more planets are known to orbit starsother than the sun. for most, the data can be sufficiently explained bynon-interacting keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of thesesystems have not been observed. here we present 4 sets of lightcurves from thekepler spacecraft, which each show multiple planets transiting the same star.departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates theplanets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match theforcing frequency of the other planet. this confirms that these objects are inthe same system. next we limit their masses to the planetary regime byrequiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. finally, wereport dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for theplanets' masses and eccentricities. as the timespan of timing data increases,dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,even in cases for which high-precision doppler follow-up is impractical.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1202.6328	architecture of kepler's multi-transiting systems: ii. new  investigations with twice as many candidates	we report on the orbital architectures of kepler systems having multipleplanet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first sixquarters of kepler data and reported by batalha et al. (2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1206.4695	rapid dynamical chaos in an exoplanetary system	we report on the long-term dynamical evolution of the two-planet kepler-36system, which we studied through numerical integrations of initial conditionsthat are consistent with observations of the system. the orbits are chaoticwith a lyapunov time of only ~10 years. the chaos is a consequence of aparticular set of orbital resonances, with the inner planet orbiting 34 timesfor every 29 orbits of the outer planet. the rapidity of the chaos is due tothe interaction of the 29:34 resonance with the nearby first order 6:7resonance, in contrast to the usual case in which secular terms in thehamiltonian play a dominant role. only one contiguous region of phase space,accounting for ~4.5% of the sample of initial conditions studied, correspondsto planetary orbits that do not show large scale orbital instabilities on thetimescale of our integrations (~200 million years). the long-lived subset ofthe allowed initial conditions are those that satisfy the hill stabilitycriterion by the largest margin. any successful theory for the formation ofthis system will need to account for why its current state is so close tounstable regions of phase space.

1207.5804	alignment of the stellar spin with the orbits of a three-planet system	the sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, whichis presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseousdisk. for exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is notguaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may bemisaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magneticinteractions or torques from neighbouring stars. indeed, isolated 'hotjupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. here we report ananalysis of transits of planets over starspots on the sun-like star kepler-30,and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellarequator. furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a fewdegrees. this configuration is similar to that of our solar system, andcontrasts with the isolated hot jupiters. the orderly alignment seen in thekepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems thatexperienced disruptive dynamical interactions. should this be corroborated byobservations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-diskmisalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities ofhot jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin ofhot jupiters.

1305.0980	deuterium burning in massive giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs  formed by core-nucleated accretion	formation of bodies near the deuterium-burning limit is considered bydetailed numerical simulations according to the core-nucleated giant planetaccretion scenario. the objects, with heavy-element cores in the range 5-30mearth, are assumed to accrete gas up to final masses of 10-15 jupiter masses(mjup). after the formation process, which lasts 1-5 myr and which ends with a'cold-start', low-entropy configuration, the bodies evolve at constant mass upto an age of several gyr. deuterium burning via proton capture is included inthe calculation, and we determined the mass, m50, above which more than 50% ofthe initial deuterium is burned. this often-quoted borderline between giantplanets and brown dwarfs is found to depend only slightly on parameters, suchas core mass, stellar mass, formation location, solid surface density in theprotoplanetary disk, disk viscosity, and dust opacity. the values for m50 fallin the range 11.6-13.6 mjup, in agreement with previous determinations that donot take the formation process into account. for a given opacity law during theformation process, objects with higher core masses form more quickly. theresult is higher entropy in the envelope at the completion of accretion,yielding lower values of m50. for masses above m50, during thedeuterium-burning phase, objects expand and increase in luminosity by 1 to 3orders of magnitude. evolutionary tracks in the luminosity-versus-time diagramare compared with the observed position of the companion to beta pictoris.

1310.2642	koi-152's low density planets	koi-152 is among the first known systems of multiple transiting planetarycandidates (steffen et al. 2010) ranging in size from 3.5 to 7 times the sizeof the earth, in a compact configuration with orbital periods near a 1:2:4:6chain of commensurability, from 13.5 days to 81.1 days. all four planetsexhibit transit timing variations with periods that are consistent with thedistance of each planet to resonance with its neighbors. we perform a dynamicalanalysis of the system based on transit timing measurements over 1282 days of\textit{kepler} photometry. stellar parameters are obtained with a combinationof spectral classification and the stellar density constraints provided bylight curve analysis and orbital eccentricity solutions from our dynamicalstudy. our models provide tight constraints on the masses of all fourtransiting bodies, demonstrating that they are planets and that they orbit thesame star. all four of koi-152's transiting planets have low densities giventheir sizes, consistent with other studies of compact multiplanet transitingsystems. the largest of the four, koi-152.01, has the lowest bulk density yetdetermined amongst sub-saturn mass planets.

1401.4195	masses, radii, and orbits of small kepler planets: the transition from  gaseous to rocky planets	we report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 keplerstars. there are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detectedthrough transits and 7 revealed by precise doppler measurements of the hoststars. based on an analysis of the kepler brightness measurements, along withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities for allof the transiting planets (41 of 42 have a false-positive probability under1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. most of the transiting planetsare smaller than 3x the size of earth. for 16 planets, the doppler signal wassecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. for theother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limitsto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rockycomposition. we identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting amostly rocky interior for them. indeed, the only planets that are compatiblewith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 r_earth. larger planetsevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (h, he, and h2o).

1402.6352	validation of kepler's multiple planet candidates. ii: refined  statistical framework and descriptions of systems of special interest	we extend the statistical analysis of lissauer et al.

1403.5084	the effect of planets beyond the ice line on the accretion of volatiles  by habitable-zone rocky planets	models of planet formation have shown that giant planets have a large impacton the number, masses and orbits of terrestrial planets that form. in addition,they play an important role in delivering volatiles from material that formedexterior to the snow-line (the region in the disk beyond which water ice cancondense) to the inner region of the disk where terrestrial planets canmaintain liquid water on their surfaces. we present simulations of the latestages of terrestrial planet formation from a disk of protoplanets around asolar-type star, and we include a massive planet (from 1 earth mass to 1jupiter mass) in jupiter's orbit at ~5.2 au in all but one set of simulations.two initial disk models are examined with the same mass distribution and totalinitial water content, but with different distributions of water content. wecompare the accretion rates and final water mass fraction of the planets thatform. remarkably, all of the planets that formed in our simulations withoutgiant planets were water-rich, showing that giant planet companions are notrequired to deliver volatiles to terrestrial planets in the habitable zone. incontrast, an outer planet at least several times the mass of earth may beneeded to clear distant regions from debris truncating the epoch of frequentlarge impacts. observations of exoplanets from radial velocity surveys suggestthat outer jupiter-like planets may be scarce, therefore the results presentedhere suggest the number of habitable planets that reside in our galaxy may bemore than previously thought.

1405.7305	growth of jupiter: enhancement of core accretion by a voluminous  low-mass envelope	we present calculations of the early stages of the formation of jupiter viacore nucleated accretion and gas capture. the core begins as a seed body ofabout 350 kilometers in radius and orbits in a swarm of planetesimals whoseinitial radii range from 15 meters to 50 kilometers. the evolution of the swarmaccounts for growth and fragmentation, viscous and gravitational stirring, andfor drag-assisted migration and velocity damping. during this evolution, lessthan 9% of the mass is in planetesimals smaller than 1 kilometer in radius; &lt;~25% is in planetesimals with radii between 1 and 10 kilometers; and &lt; ~7% isin bodies with radii larger than 100 kilometers. gas capture by the coresubstantially enhances the size-dependent cross-section of the planet foraccretion of planetesimals. the calculation of dust opacity in the planet'senvelope accounts for coagulation and sedimentation of dust particles releasedas planetesimals are ablated. the calculation is carried out at an orbitalsemi-major axis of 5.2 au and the initial solids' surface density is 10 g/cm^2at that distance. the results give a core mass of nearly 7.3 earth masses(mearth) and an envelope mass of approximately 0.15 mearth after about 4e5years, at which point the envelope growth rate surpasses that of the core. thesame calculation without the envelope yields a core of only about 4.4 mearth.

1406.0151	the transiting exoplanet survey satellite	the transiting exoplanet survey satellite (tess) will search for planetstransiting bright and nearby stars. tess has been selected by nasa for launchin 2017 as an astrophysics explorer mission. the spacecraft will be placed intoa highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the earth. during its two-yearmission, tess will employ four wide-field optical ccd cameras to monitor atleast 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with i = 4-13 for temporary drops inbrightness caused by planetary transits. each star will be observed for aninterval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star'secliptic latitude. the longest observing intervals will be for stars near theecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations withthe james webb space telescope. brightness measurements of preselected targetstars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recordedevery 30 min. tess stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed bythe pioneering kepler mission. this will make tess planets easier tocharacterize with follow-up observations. tess is expected to find more than athousand planets smaller than neptune, including dozens that are comparable insize to the earth. public data releases will occur every four months, invitingimmediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. the tess legacy willbe a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets,which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.

1410.7444	dynamical evolution of the earth-moon progenitors - whence theia?	we present integrations of a model solar system with five terrestrial planets(beginning ~30-50 myr after the formation of primitive solar system bodies) inorder to determine the preferred regions of parameter space leading to a giantimpact that resulted in the formation of the moon. our results indicate whichchoices of semimajor axes and eccentricities for theia (the proto-moon) at thisepoch can produce a late giant impact, assuming that mercury, venus, and marsare near the current orbits. we find that the likely semimajor axis of theia,at the epoch when our simulations begin, depends on the assumed mass ratio ofearth-moon progenitors (8/1, 4/1, or 1/1). the low eccentricities of theterrestrial planets are most commonly produced when the progenitors havesimilar semimajor axes at the epoch when our integrations commence.additionally, we show that mean motion resonances among the terrestrial planetsand perturbations from the giant planets can affect the dynamical evolution ofthe system leading to a late giant impact.

1506.07067	the mass of the mars-sized exoplanet kepler-138 b from transit timing	extrasolar planets that pass in front of their host star (transit) cause atemporary decrease in the apparent brightness of the star once per orbit,providing a direct measure of the planet's size and orbital period. in somesystems with multiple transiting planets, the times of the transits aremeasurably affected by the gravitational interactions between neighbouringplanets. in favorable cases, the departures from keplerian orbits implied bythe observed transit times permit planetary masses to be measured, which is keyto determining bulk densities. characterizing rocky planets is particularlydifficult, since they are generally smaller and less massive than gaseousplanets. thus, few exoplanets near earth's size have had their masses measured.here we report the sizes and masses of three planets orbiting kepler-138, astar much fainter and cooler than the sun. we measure the mass of themars-sized inner planet based on on the transit times of its neighbour andthereby provide the first density measurement for an exoplanet smaller thanearth. the middle and outer planets are both slightly larger than earth. themiddle planet's density is similar to that of earth, while the outer planet isless than half as dense, implying that it contains a greater portion of lowdensity components such as h2o and/or h2.

1512.07090	neptune's dynamic atmosphere from kepler k2 observations: implications  for brown dwarf light curve analyses	observations of neptune with the kepler space telescope yield a 49-day lightcurve with 98% coverage at a 1-minute cadence. a significant signature in thelight curve comes from discrete cloud features. we compare results extractedfrom the light curve data with contemporaneous disk-resolved imaging of neptunefrom the keck 10-meter telescope at 1.65 microns and hubble space telescopevisible imaging acquired 9 months later. this direct comparison validates thefeature latitudes assigned to the k2 light curve periods based on neptune'szonal wind profile, and confirms observed cloud feature variability. althoughneptune's clouds vary in location and intensity on short and long time scales,a single large discrete storm seen in keck imaging dominates the k2 and hubblelight curves; smaller or fainter clouds likely contribute to short-termbrightness variability. the k2 neptune light curve, in conjunction with ourimaging data, provides context for the interpretation of current and futurebrown dwarf and extrasolar planet variability measurements. in particular wesuggest that the balance between large, relatively stable, atmospheric featuresand smaller, more transient, clouds controls the character of substellaratmospheric variability. atmospheres dominated by a few large spots may showinherently greater light curve stability than those which exhibit a greaternumber of smaller features.

0705.3444	terrestrial planet formation in binary star systems	a binary star system is the most common result of the star formation process,and binary companions can disrupt both the formation of terrestrial planets andtheir long term prospects for stability. we present results from a large set ofnumerical simulations of the final stages of terrestrial planet formation -from moon- to mars-sized planetary embryos to planets - in main-sequence binarystar systems. we examine planetary accretion around both stars ('p-type'circumbinary orbits) or individual stars ('s-type' orbits) in binary systems,including terrestrial planet formation around each star in alpha centauri ab,the closest binary star system to the sun. for comparison, we also simulateplanetary growth from the same initial disk placed in the sun-jupiter-saturnsystem and also around the sun with neither giant planets nor a stellarcompanion perturbing the system. our simulations show that giant and stellarcompanions not only truncate the disk, but hasten the accretion process bystirring up the planetary embryos to higher eccentricities and inclinations.terrestrial planets similar to those in our solar system formed aroundindividual stars in simulations with the binary periastron (closest approach)greater than about 5 au. terrestrial planet growth within circumbinary diskswas uninhibited around inner binary star systems with binary apastrons (maximumseparation) less than ~0.2 au. results from our simulations can be scaled fordifferent stellar and disk parameters. approximately 50 - 60% of binary starsystems - from contact binaries to separations of nearly a parsec - satisfythese constraints. given that the galaxy contains more than 100 billion starsystems, a large number of systems remain habitable based on the dynamicconsiderations of this research.

astro-ph;0309142	mapping the circumstellar environment of t tauri with fluorescent h_2  emission	we have obtained three long-slit, far uv spectra of the pre-main sequencesystem t tauri. these hst/stis spectra show a strong and variable on-sourcespectrum composed of both fluoresced h_2 and stellar chromospheric lines.extended h_2 emission is seen up to 10" from the t tau system. the on-sourceand extended h_2 are both pumped by h i lyman alpha. the on-source h_2 ispumped by the red wing of a broad, self-absorbed ly-alpha line, while theprogressions seen in the extended gas are pumped from near line center. thissuggests that the extended h_2 is pumped locally, and not by the stellarly-alpha line. the h_2 to the north and west coincides with the evacuatedcavity bounded by the optical reflection nebulosity; to the south the extendedh_2 coincides with the hh 255 outflow from the embedded infrared companion ttau s. the spatial profile of the extended gas shows a prominent dip coincidentwith the position of t tau s. this may be absorption by a disk associated witht tau s. there is no evidence for absorption by a disk surrounding t tau nlarge enough to obscure t tau s.

0809.1418	formation of jupiter and conditions for accretion of the galilean  satellites	we present an overview of the formation of jupiter and its associatedcircumplanetary disk. jupiter forms via a combination of planetesimal accretionand gravitational accumulation of gas from the surrounding solar nebula. theformation of the circumjovian gaseous disk, or subnebula, straddles thetransitional stage between runaway gas accretion and jupiter's eventualisolation from the solar disk. this isolation, which effectively signals thetermination of jupiter's accretion, takes place as jupiter opens a deep gas gapin the solar nebula, or the solar nebula gas dissipates. we describe theconditions for accretion of the galilean satellites, including the timescalesfor their formation, and mechanisms for their survival, all within the contextof key constraints for satellite formation models. the environment in which theregular satellites form is tied to the timescale for circumplanetary diskdispersal, which depends on the nature and persistence of turbulence. in thecase that subnebula turbulence decays as gas inflow wanes, we present a novelmechanism for satellite survival involving gap opening by the largestsatellites. on the other hand, assuming that sustained turbulence drivessubnebula evolution on a short timescale compared to the satellite formationtimescale, we review a model that emphasizes collisional processes to explainsatellite observations. we briefly discuss the mechanisms by which solids maybe delivered to the circumplanetary disk. however, we expect that planetesimaldelivery mechanisms likely provide the bulk of material for satelliteaccretion.

astro-ph;0607222	terrestrial planet formation surrounding close binary stars	disk material has been observed around both components of some young closebinary star systems. it has been shown that if planets form at the right placeswithin such disks, they can remain dynamically stable for very long times.herein, we numerically simulate the late stages of terrestrial planet growth incircumbinary disks around 'close' binary star systems with stellar separationsbetween 0.05 au and 0.4 au and binary eccentricities up to 0.8. in eachsimulation, the sum of the masses of the two stars is 1 solar mass, and giantplanets are included. our results are statistically compared to a set of planetformation simulations in the sun-jupiter-saturn system that begin withessentially the same initial disk of protoplanets. the planetary systems formedaround binaries with apastron distances less than ~ 0.2 au are very similar tothose around single stars, whereas those with larger maximum separations tendto be sparcer, with fewer planets, especially interior to 1 au. we also provideformulae that can be used to scale results of planetary accretion simulationsto various systems with different total stellar mass, disk sizes, andplanetesimal masses and densities.

astro-ph;0701266	terrestrial planet formation around individual stars within binary star  systems	we calculate herein the late stages of terrestrial planet accumulation arounda solar type star that has a binary companion with semimajor axis larger thanthe terrestrial planet region. we perform more than one hundred simulations tosurvey binary parameter space and to account for sensitive dependence oninitial conditions in these dynamical systems. as expected, sufficiently widebinaries leave the planet formation process largely unaffected. as a roughapproximation, binary stars with periastron $q_b &gt; 10$ au have minimal effecton terrestrial planet formation within $\sim 2$ au of the primary, whereasbinary stars with $q_b \la$ 5 au restrict terrestrial planet formation towithin $\sim$ 1 au of the primary star. given the observed distribution ofbinary orbital elements for solar type primaries, we estimate that about 40 --50 percent of the binary population is wide enough to allow terrestrial planetformation to take place unimpeded. the large number of simulations allows forus to determine the distribution of results -- the distribution of plausibleterrestrial planet systems -- for effectively equivalent starting conditions.we present (rough) distributions for the number of planets, their masses, andtheir orbital elements.

0810.5186	models of jupiter's growth incorporating thermal and hydrodynamic  constraints	[abridged] we model the growth of jupiter via core nucleated accretion,applying constraints from hydrodynamical processes that result from thedisk-planet interaction. we compute the planet's internal structure using ahenyey-type stellar evolution code. the planet's interactions with theprotoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-d hydrodynamic simulations. previousmodels of jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to beapproximately one hill sphere radius, rhill. however, 3-d hydrodynamicsimulations show that only gas within 0.25rhill remains bound to the planet,with the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of theprotoplanetary disk. therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outerboundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reachthe portion of the flow not bound to the planet. we find that the smallerradius increases the time required for planetary growth by ~5%. thermalpressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times asmassive as earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereashydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. within amoderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass isabout equal to the mass of saturn. in a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limitsto accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. toaccount for disk dissipation, we perform some of our simulations of jupiter'sgrowth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on a timescale of3myr. according to our simulations, proto-jupiter's distended andthermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's currentretinue of irregular satellites as advocated by pollack et al. (1979).
