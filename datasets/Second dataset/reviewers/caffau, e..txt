0903.3406	the solar photospheric nitrogen abundance. analysis of atomic  transitions with 3d and 1d model atmospheres	context: in recent years, the solar chemical abundances have been studied inconsiderable detail because of discrepant values of solar metallicity inferredfrom different indicators, i.e., on the one hand, the "sub-solar" photosphericabundances resulting from spectroscopic chemical composition analyses with theaid of 3d hydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere, and, on the otherhand, the high metallicity inferred by helioseismology. aims: afterinvestigating the solar oxygen abundance using a co5bold 3d hydrodynamicalsolar model in previous work, we undertake a similar approach studying thesolar abundance of nitrogen, since this element accounts for a significantfraction of the overall solar metallicity, z. method: we used a selection ofatomic spectral lines to determine the solar nitrogen abundance, relying mainlyon equivalent width measurements in the literature. we investigate theinfluence on the abundance analysis, of both deviations from localthermodynamic equilibrium ("nlte effects") and photospheric inhomogeneities("granulation effects"). results: we recommend use of a solar nitrogenabundance of a(n)=7.86+-0.12 whose error bar reflects the line-to-line scatter.conclusion: the solar metallicity implied by the co5bold-based nitrogen andoxygen abundances is in the range 0.0145&lt;= z &lt;= 0.0167. this result is a steptowards reconciling photospheric abundances with helioseismic constraints on z.our most suitable estimates are z=0.0156 and z/x=0.0213.

0903.4174	first stars xii. abundances in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars,and  comparison with the giants	context:the detailed chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor (emp) starsare key guides to understanding the early chemical evolution of the galaxy.most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experiencedinternal mixing later. aims: we aim to compare the results for giants with new,accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 emp turnoff stars.methods:vlt/uves spectra at r ~45,000 and s/n~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) areanalysed with osmarcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrum code to deriveabundances for c, mg, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, co, ni, zn, sr, and ba. results:for ca, ni, sr, and ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sampleof emp giants, at all metallicities. however, our abundances of c, sc, ti, cr,mn and co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. mg and siabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [mg/fe] values are slightly revised),while zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [fe/h] (6 starsonly). conclusions:for c, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have anastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomingsin the analysis. approximate computations of granulation (3d) effects yieldsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is anunlikely explanation, except perhaps for c, cr, and mn. nlte computations forna and al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike thelte results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements aswell. meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data forgalactic chemical evolution models.

0909.0983	lithium in the globular cluster ngc 6397: evidence for dependence on  evolutionary status	most globular clusters are believed to host a single stellar populations.they can thus be considered a good place to study the spite plateau and probefor possible evolutionary modifications of the li content. we want to determinethe li content of subgiant (sg) and main sequence (ms) stars of the old,metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397. this work was aimed not only at studyingpossible li abundance variations but to investigate the cosmological lidiscrepancy. here, we present flames/giraffe observations of a sample of 84 sgand 79 ms stars in ngc 6397 selected in a narrow range of b-v colour and,therefore, effective temperatures. we determine both teff and a(li) using 3dhydrodynamical model atmospheres for all the ms and sg stars of the sample. wefind a significant difference in the li abundance between sg stars and msstars, the sg stars having an a(li) higher by almost 0.1 dex on average. wealso find a decrease in the a(li) with decreasing teff, both in ms and sgstars, albeit with a significantly different slope for the two classes ofstars. this suggests that the lithium abundance in these stars is, indeed,altered by some process, which is teff-dependent. the li abundance patternobserved in ngc 6397 is different from what is found among field stars, castingsome doubt on the use of globular cluster stars as representative of populationii with respect to the li abundance. none of the available theories of lidepletion appears to satisfactorily describe our observations.

0909.1010	3d molecular line formation in dwarf carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars	we present a detailed analysis of the carbon and nitrogen abundances of twodwarf carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars: sdss j1349-0229 and sdssj0912+0216. we also report the oxygen abundance of sdss j1349-0229. these starsare metal-poor, with [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, and were selected from our ongoing surveyof extremely metal-poor dwarf candidates from the sloan digital skysurvey(sdss). the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances rely on molecular lineswhich form in the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere. it is known thatconvection in metal-poor stars induces very low temperatures which are notpredicted by `classical' 1d stellar atmospheres. to obtain the correcttemperature structure, one needs full 3d hydrodynamical models. using co5bold3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres and the linfor3d line formation code,molecular lines of ch, nh, oh and c2 were computed, and 3d carbon, nitrogen andoxygen abundances were determined. the resulting carbon abundances werecompared to abundances derived using atomic ci lines in 1d lte and nlte. thereis not a good agreement between the carbon abundances determined from c2 bandsand from the ch band, and molecular lines do not agree with the atomic cilines. although this may be partly due to uncertainties in the transitionprobabilities of the molecular bands it certainly has to do with thetemperature structure of the outer layers of the adopted model atmosphere. weexplore the influence of the 3d model properties on the molecular abundancedetermination. in particular, the choice of the number of opacity bins used inthe model calculations and its subsequent effects on the temperature structureand molecular line formation is discussed.

0910.2305	lithium abundances of main sequence and sub-giant stars in the globular  cluster ngc 6397	we present flames/giraffe spectroscopy obtained at the very large telescope(vlt). using these observations we have been able for the first time to observethe li i doublet in the main sequence stars of a globular cluster. we alsoobserved li in a sample of sub-giant stars of the same b-v colour. our finalsample is composed of 84 sg stars and 79 ms stars. in spite of the fact that sgand ms span the same temperature range we find that the equivalent widths ofthe li i doublet in sg stars are systematically larger than those in ms stars,suggesting a higher li content among sg stars. this is confirmed by ourquantitative analysis which makes use of both 1d and 3d model atmospheres. wefind that sg stars show, on average, a li abundance higher by 0.1 dex than msstars. we also detect a positive slope of li abundance with effectivetemperature, the higher the temperature the higher the li abundance, both forsg and ms stars, although the slope is slightly steeper for ms stars. theseresults provide an unambigous evidence that the li abundance changes withevolutionary status. the physical mechanisms that contribute to this are notyet clear, since none of the proposed models seem to describe accurately theobservations. whether such mechanism can explain the cosmological lithiumproblem, is still an open question.

0910.4730	effects of granulation on neutral copper resonance lines in metal-poor  stars	we make use of three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to investigatethe effects of granulation on the cu i lines of mult. 1 in the near uv, at324.7 nm and 327.3 nm. these lines remain strong even at very low metallicityand provide the opportunity to study the chemical evolution of cu in themetal-poor populations. we find very strong granulation effects on these lines.in terms of abundances the neglect of such effects can lead to an overestimateof the a(cu) by as much as 0.8 dex in dwarf stars. comparison of ourcomputations with stars in the metal-poor globular clusters ngc 6752 and ngc6397, show that there is a systematic discrepancy between the copper abundancesderived from mult. 2 in to stars and those derived in giant stars of the samecluster from the lines of mult. 2 at at 510.5 nm and 587.2 nm. we conclude thatthe cu i resonance lines are not reliable indicators of cu abundance and webelieve that an investigations of departures from lte is mandatory to make useof these lines.

0910.4733	solar abundances and granulation effects	the solar abundances have undergone a major downward revision in the lastdecade, reputedly as a result of employing 3d hydrodynamical simulations tomodel the inhomogeneous structure of the solar photosphere. the very low oxygenabundance advocated by asplund et al. (2004), a(o)=8.66, together with thedownward revision of the carbon and nitrogen abundances, has created seriousproblems for solar models to explain the helioseismic measurements. in aneffort to contribute to the dispute we have re-derived photospheric abundancesof several elements independently of previous analysis. we applied astate-of-the art 3d (co5bold) hydrodynamical simulation of the solargranulation as well as different 1d model atmospheres for the line by linespectroscopic abundance determinations. the analysis is based on both standarddisc-centre and disc-integrated spectral atlases; for oxygen we acquired inaddition spectra at different heliocentric angles. the derived abundances arethe result of equivalent width and/or line profile fitting of the availableatomic lines. we discuss the different granulation effects on solar abundancesand compare our results with previous investigations. according to ourinvestigations hydrodynamical models are important in the solar abundancedetermination, but are not responsible for the recent downward revision in theliterature of the solar metallicity.

0910.5917	6li in metal-poor halo stars: real or spurious?	the presence of convective motions in the atmospheres of metal-poor halostars leads to systematic asymmetries of the emergent spectral line profiles.since such line asymmetries are very small, they can be safely ignored forstandard spectroscopic abundance analysis. however, when it comes to thedetermination of the 6li/7li isotopic ratio, q(li)=n(6li)/n(7li), the intrinsicasymmetry of the 7li line must be taken into account, because its signature isessentially indistinguishable from the presence of a weak 6li blend in the redwing of the 7li line. in this contribution we quantity the error of theinferred 6li/7li isotopic ratio that arises if the convective line asymmetry isignored in the fitting of the lithium blend at 6707 a. our conclusion is that6li/7li ratios derived by asplund et al. (2006), using symmetric line profiles,must be reduced by typically dq(li) ~ 0.015. this diminishes the number ofcertain 6li detections from 9 to 4 stars or less, casting some doubt on theexistence of a 6li plateau.

0911.4251	accuracy of spectroscopy-based radioactive dating of stars	combined spectroscopic abundance analyses of stable and radioactive elementscan be applied for deriving stellar ages. the achievable precision depends onfactors related to spectroscopy, nucleosynthesis, and chemical evolution. wequantify the uncertainties arising from the spectroscopic analysis, and comparethese to the other error sources. we derive formulae for the age uncertaintiesarising from the spectroscopic abundance analysis, and apply them tospectroscopic and nucleosynthetic data compiled from the literature for the sunand metal-poor stars. we obtained ready-to-use analytic formulae of the ageuncertainty for the cases of stable+unstable and unstable+unstable chronometerpairs, and discuss the optimal relation between to-be-measured age and meanlifetime of a radioactive species. application to the literature data indicatesthat, for a single star, the achievable spectroscopic accuracy is limited toabout +/- 20% for the foreseeable future. at present, theoretical uncertaintiesin nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models form the precision bottleneck.for stellar clusters, isochrone fitting provides a higher accuracy thanradioactive dating, but radioactive dating becomes competitive when applied tomany cluster members simultaneously, reducing the statistical errors by afactor sqrt(n). spectroscopy-based radioactive stellar dating would benefitfrom improvements in the theoretical understanding of nucleosynthesis andchemical evolution. its application to clusters can provide strong constraintsfor nucleosynthetic models.

1001.3274	convection and 6li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars	based on 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the co5bold codeand 3d non-lte (nlte) line formation calculations, we study the effect of theconvection-induced line asymmetry on the derived 6li abundance for a range ineffective temperature, gravity, and metallicity covering the stars of theasplund et al. (2006) sample. when the asymmetry effect is taken into accountfor this sample of stars, the resulting 6li/7li ratios are reduced by about1.5% on average with respect to the isotopic ratios determined by asplund etal. (2006). this purely theoretical correction diminishes the number ofsignificant 6li detections from 9 to 4 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3sigma criterion). in view of this result the existence of a 6li plateau appearsquestionable. a careful reanalysis of individual objects by fitting theobserved lithium 6707 a doublet both with 3d nlte and 1d lte synthetic lineprofiles confirms that the inferred 6li abundance is systematically lower whenusing 3d nlte instead of 1d lte line fitting. nevertheless, halo stars withunquestionable 6li detection do exist even if analyzed in 3d-nlte, the mostprominent example being hd 84937.

1005.3754	galactic evolution of oxygen: oh lines in 3d hydrodynamical model  atmospheres	the measurement of oxygen lines in metal-poor unevolved stars, in particularnear-uv oh lines, can provide invaluable information on the properties of theearly galaxy. near-uv oh lines constitute an important tool to derive oxygenabundances in metal-poor dwarf stars. therefore, it is important to correctlymodel the line formation of oh lines, especially in metal-poor stars, where 3dhydrodynamical models commonly predict cooler temperatures than plane-parallelhydrostatic models in the upper photosphere. we have made use of a grid of 523d hydrodynamical model atmospheres for dwarf stars computed using the codeco5bold, extracted from the more extended cifist grid. the 52 models cover theeffective temperature range 5000-6500k, the surface gravity range 3.5-4.5 andthe metallicity range -3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0. we determine 3d-lte abundance corrections inall the 52 3d models for several oh lines and fei lines of different excitationpotentials. these 3d-lte corrections are generally negative reaching values ofroughly -1 dex (for the oh 3167 with excitation potential of approximately 1ev) for the higher temperatures and surface gravities. we apply these 3d-ltecorrections to the individual o abundances, derived from oh lines, of a samplethe metal-poor dwarf stars reported in israelian et al.(1998, 2001) andboesgaard et al.(1999), by interpolating the stellar parameters of the dwarfsin the grid of 3d-lte corrections. the new 3d-lte [o/fe] ratio still keeps asimilar trend as the 1d-lte, i.e, increasing towards lower [fe/h] values. weapplied 1d-nlte corrections to 3d fei abundances and we still see an increasing[o/fe] ratio towards lower metallicites. however, the galactic [o/fe] ratiomust be revisited once 3d-nlte corrections become available for oh and fe linesfor a grid of 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres.

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

1107.2657	the galactic evolution of phosphorus	as a galaxy evolves, its chemical composition changes and the abundanceratios of different elements are powerful probes of the underlying evolutionaryprocesses. phosphorous is an element whose evolution has remained quite elusiveuntil now, because it is difficult to detect in cool stars. the infrared weak pi lines of the multiplet 1, at 1050-1082 nm, are the most reliable indicatorsof the presence of phosphorus. the availability of crires at vlt has permittedaccess to this wavelength range in stellar spectra.we attempt to measure thephosphorus abundance of twenty cool stars in the galactic disk. the spectra areanalysed with one-dimensional model-atmospheres computed in local thermodynamicequilibrium (lte). the line formation computations are performed assuming lte.the ratio of phosphorus to iron behaves similarly to sulphur, increasingtowards lower metallicity stars. its ratio with respect to sulphur is roughlyconstant and slightly larger than solar, [p/s]=0.10+- 0.10. we succeed intaking an important step towards the understanding of the chemical evolution ofphosphorus in the galaxy. however, the observed rise in the p/fe abundanceratio is steeper than predicted by galactic chemical evolution model modeldeveloped by kobayashi and collaborators. phosphorus appears to evolvedifferently from the light odd-z elements sodium and aluminium. the constantvalue of [p/s] with metallicity implies that p production is insensitive to theneutron excess, thus processes other than neutron captures operate. we suggestthat proton captures on 30si and alpha captures on $27al are possibilities toinvestigate. we see no clear distinction between our results for stars withplanets and stars without any detected planet.

1108.0138	lithium and sodium in the globular cluster m4. detection of a li-rich  dwarf star: preservation or pollution?	context. the abundance inhomogeneities of light elements observed in globularclusters (gcs), and notably the ubiquitous na-o anti-correlation, are generallyinterpreted as evidence that gcs comprise several generations of stars. thereis an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars which produce theinhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is away to shed new light on this problem. aims. we aim at investigating the li andna content of the gc m 4, that is known to have a well defined na-oanti-correlation. methods. we obtained moderate resolution (r=17 000-18 700)spectra for 91 main sequence (ms)/sub-giant branch stars of m 4 with thegiraffe spectrograph at the flames/vlt eso facility. using model atmospheresanalysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. results. we detect a weakli-na anti-correlation among un-evolved ms stars. one star in the sample, #37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance a(li)=2.87, compatible withcurrent estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. conclusions. the shallowslope found for the li-na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced inparallel to sodium. this evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature,suggests that the high lithium abundance of star # 37934 may originate bypollution from a previous generations of stars. the recent detection of ali-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster ngc 6397 may alsopoint in this direction. still, no clear cut evidence is available against apossible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star # 37934.

1109.0992	x-shooter gto: chemical analysis of a sample of emp candidates	context: extremely metal-poor stars (emp) are very rare objects that hold intheir atmospheres the fossil record of the chemical composition of the earlyphases of galactic evolution. finding these objects and determining theirchemical composition provides important constraints on these early phases.aims: using a carefully designed selection method, we chose a sample ofcandidate emp stars from the low resolution spectra of the sloan digital skysurvey and observed them with x-shooter at the vlt to confirm theirmetallicities and determine abundances for as many elements as possible.method: the x-shooter spectra are analysed by means of one-dimensional,plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. corrections for the granulationeffects are computed using co5bold hydrodynamical simulations. results: all thecandidates are confirmed to be emp stars, proving the efficiency of ourselection method within about 0.5 dex. the chemical composition of this sampleis compatible with those of brighter samples, suggesting that the stars in thegalactic halo are well mixed. conclusions these observations show that it isfeasible to observe, in a limited amount of time, a large sample of about onehundred stars among emp candidates selected from the sdss. such a size ofsample will allow us, in particular, to confirm or refute the existence of avertical drop in the galactic halo metallicity distribution function around[fe/h] ~ -3.5.

1112.3824	chemical evolution of the milky way: the origin of phosphorus	context. recently, for the first time the abundance of p has been measured indisk stars. this provides the opportunity of comparing the observed abundanceswith predictions from theoretical models. aims. we aim at predicting thechemical evolution of p in the milky way and compare our results with theobserved p abundances in disk stars in order to put constraints on the pnucleosynthesis. methods. to do that we adopt the two-infall model of galacticchemical evolution, which is a good model for the milky way, and compute theevolution of the abundances of p and fe. we adopt stellar yields for theseelements from different sources. the element p should have been formed mainlyin type ii supernovae. finally, fe is mainly produced by type ia supernovae.results. our results confirm that to reproduce the observed trend of [p/fe] vs.[fe/h] in disk stars, p is formed mainly in massive stars. however, none of theavailable yields for p can reproduce the solar abundance of this element. inother words, to reproduce the data one should assume that massive stars producemore p than predicted by a factor of ~ 3. conclusions. we conclude that all theavailable yields of p from massive stars are largely underestimated and thatnucleosynthesis calculations should be revised. we also predict the [p/fe]expected in halo stars.

1203.2607	a primordial star in the heart of the lion	context: the discovery and chemical analysis of extremely metal-poor starspermit a better understanding of the star formation of the first generation ofstars and of the universe emerging from the big bang. aims: we report the studyof a primordial star situated in the centre of the constellation leo (sdssj102915+172027). method: the star, selected from the low resolution-spectrum ofthe sloan digital sky survey, was observed at intermediate (with x-shooter atvlt) and at high spectral resolution (with uves at vlt). the stellar parameterswere derived from the photometry. the standard spectroscopic analysis based on1d atlas models was completed by applying 3d and non-lte corrections. results:an iron abundance of [fe/h]=--4.89 makes sdss j102915+172927 one of the lowest[fe/h] stars known. however, the absence of measurable c and n enhancementsindicates that it has the lowest metallicity, z&lt;= 7.40x10^{-7} (metal-massfraction), ever detected. no oxygen measurement was possible. conclusions: thediscovery of sdss j102915+172927 highlights that low-mass star formationoccurred at metallicities lower than previously assumed. even lower metallicitystars may yet be discovered, with a chemical composition closer to thecomposition of the primordial gas and of the first supernovae.

1203.2612	an extremely primitive halo star	the early universe had a chemical composition consisting of hydrogen, heliumand traces of lithium1, almost all other elements were created in stars andsupernovae. the mass fraction, z, of elements more massive than helium, iscalled "metallicity". a number of very metal poor stars have been found some ofwhich, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen andoxygen. for theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of starswith metallicities lower than z=1.5e-5, it has been suggested that low massstars (m&lt;0.8m\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form untilthe interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated tolie in the range 1.5e-8\leqz\leq1.5e-6, although competing theories claimingthe contrary do exist. here we report the chemical composition of a star with avery low z\leq6.9e-7 (4.5e-5 of that of the sun) and a chemical pattern typicalof classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment ofcarbon, nitrogen and oxygen. this shows that low mass stars can be formed atvery low metallicity. lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicityextension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. lithiumdepletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperaturesabove two million k in its history, which points to rather particular formationcondition or internal mixing process, for low z stars.

1203.3124	barium abundance in red giants of ngc 6752. non-local thermodynamic  equilibrium and three-dimensional effects	(abridged) aims: we study the effects related to departures from non-localthermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) and homogeneity in the atmospheres of redgiant stars in galactic globular cluster ngc 6752, to assess their influence onthe formation of ba ii lines. methods: one-dimensional (1d) local thermodynamicequilibrium (lte) and 1d nlte barium abundances were derived using classical 1datlas stellar model atmospheres. the three-dimensional (3d) lte abundances wereobtained for 8 red giants on the lower rgb, by adjusting their 1d lteabundances using 3d-1d abundance corrections, i.e., the differences between theabundances obtained from the same spectral line using the 3d hydrodynamical(co5bold) and classical 1d (lhd) stellar model atmospheres. results: the mean1d barium-to-iron abundance ratios derived for 20 giants are &lt;[ba/fe]&gt;_{1dnlte} = 0.05 \pm0.06 (stat.) \pm0.08 (sys.). the 3d-1d abundance correctionobtained for 8 giants is small (~+0.05 dex), thus leads to only minoradjustment when applied to the mean 1d nlte barium-to-iron abundance ratio forthe 20 giants, &lt;[ba/fe]&gt;_{3d+nlte} = 0.10 \pm0.06(stat.) \pm0.10(sys.). theintrinsic abundance spread between the individual cluster stars is small andcan be explained in terms of uncertainties in the abundance determinations.conclusions: deviations from lte play an important role in the formation ofbarium lines in the atmospheres of red giants studied here. the role of 3dhydrodynamical effects should not be dismissed either, even if the obtained3d-1d abundance corrections are small. this result is a consequence of subtlefine-tuning of individual contributions from horizontal temperaturefluctuations and differences between the average temperature profiles in the 3dand 1d model atmospheres: owing to the comparable size and opposite sign, theircontributions nearly cancel each other.

1204.1641	chemical abundances of distant extremely metal-poor unevolved stars	aims: the purpose of our study is to determine the chemical composition of asample of 16 candidate extremely metal-poor (emp) dwarf stars, extracted fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). there are two main purposes: in the firstplace to verify the reliability of the metallicity estimates derived from thesdss spectra; in the second place to see if the abundance trends found for thebrighter nearer stars studied previously also hold for this sample of fainter,more distant stars. methods: we used the uves at the vlt to obtainhigh-resolution spectra of the programme stars. the abundances were determinedby an automatic analysis with the mygisfos code, with the exception of lithium,for which the abundances were determined from the measured equivalent widths ofthe li i resonance doublet. results: all candidates are confirmed to be empstars, with [fe/h]&lt;= -3.0. the chemical composition of the sample of stars issimilar to that of brighter and nearer samples. we measured the lithiumabundance for 12 stars and provide stringent upper limits for three otherstars, for a fourth star the upper limit is not significant, owing to the lowsignal-to noise ratio of the spectrum. the "meltdown" of the spite plateau isconfirmed, but some of the lowest metallicity stars of the sample lie on theplateau. conclusions: the concordance of the metallicities derived fromhigh-resolution spectra and those estimated from the sdss spectra suggests thatthe latter may be used to study the metallicity distribution of the halo. theabundance pattern suggests that the halo was well mixed for all probedmetallicities and distances. the fact that at the lowest metallicities we findstars on the spite plateau suggests that the meltdown depends on at leastanother parameter, besides metallicity.

1205.4846	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in red-giant stars: evidences for  non-adiabatic effects using corot observations	a growing number of solar-like oscillations has been detected in red giantstars thanks to corot and kepler space-crafts. the seismic data gathered bycorot on red giant stars allow us to test mode driving theory in physicalconditions different from main-sequence stars. using a set of 3d hydrodynamicalmodels representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars, wecomputed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (pmax). assuming adiabaticpulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surfacestratification comes from the 3d hydrodynamical models, we computed the modeamplitude in terms of surface velocity. this was converted into intensityfluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or anon-adiabatic one. from l and m (the luminosity and mass), the energy supplyrate pmax is found to scale as (l/m)^2.6 for both main-sequence and red giantstars, extending previous results. the theoretical amplitudes in velocityunder-estimate the doppler velocity measurements obtained so far from theground for red giant stars by about 30%. in terms of intensity, the theoreticalscaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation resultsin an under-estimation by a factor of about 2.5 with respect to the corotseismic measurements. on the other hand, using the non-adiabaticintensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with thecorot data. the theoretical amplitudes remain 40% below, however, the corotmeasurements. our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannotbe simply extended from main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensityon the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giantstars are important and cannot be neglected. we discuss possible reasons forthe remaining differences.

1206.2239	6li detection in metal-poor stars: can 3d model atmospheres solve the  second lithium problem?	the presence of 6li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars is usuallyinferred from the detection of a subtle extra depression in the red wing of the7li doublet line at 670.8 nm. however, the intrinsic line asymmetry caused byconvective flows in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishablefrom the asymmetry produced by a weak 6li blend on a (presumed) symmetric 7liprofile. previous determinations of the 6li/ 7li isotopic ratio based on 1dmodel atmospheres, ignoring the convection-induced line asymmetry, musttherefore be considered as upper limits. by comparing synthetic 1d lte and 3dnon-lte line profiles of the li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differentialeffect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6li abundance as afunction of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. as expected, wefind that the asymmetry effect systematically reduces the resulting 6li/7liratios. depending on the stellar parameters, the 3d-1d offset in 6li/7li rangesbetween -0.005 and -0.020. when this purely theoretical correction is takeninto account for the asplund 2006 sample of stars, the number of significant6li detections decreases from 9 to 5 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3sigma criterion).  we also present preliminary results of a re-analysis of high-resolution, highs/n spectra of individual metal-poor turn-off stars, to see whether the "secondlithium problem" actually disappears when accounting properly for convectionand non-lte line formation in 3d stellar atmospheres. out of 8 stars, hd84937seems to be the only significant (2 sigma) detection of 6li. in view of ourresults, the existence of a 6li plateau appears questionable.

1301.3703	convective line shifts for the gaia rvs from the cifist 3d model  atmosphere grid	to derive space velocities of stars along the line of sight from wavelengthshifts in stellar spectra requires accounting for a number of second-ordereffects. for most stars, gravitational redshifts, convective blueshifts, andtransverse stellar motion are the dominant contributors. we provide theoreticalcorrections for the net velocity shifts due to convection expected for themeasurements from the gaia radial velocity spectrometer (rvs). we used a set ofthree-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface convectioncomputed with co5bold to calculate spectra of late-type stars in the gaia rvsrange and to infer the net velocity offset that convective motions will inducein radial velocities derived by cross-correlation. the net velocity shiftsderived by cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectralresolution of the observations. convective shifts for gaia rvs observations areless than 0.1 km/s for late-k-type stars, and they increase with stellar mass,reaching about 0.3 km/s or more for early f-type dwarfs. this tendency is theresult of an increase with effective temperature in both temperature andvelocity fluctuations in the line-forming region. our simulations also indicatethat the net rvs convective shifts can be positive (i.e. redshifts) in somecases. overall, the blueshifts weaken slightly with increasing surface gravity,and are enhanced at low metallicity. gravitational redshifts amount up to 0.7km/s and dominate convective blueshifts for dwarfs, but become much weaker forgiants.

(1999). we also presentfull 3d-lte line formation calculations for some selected iron lines in thesolar and metal-poor 4480/2/-3 models and nlte calculations with thecorresponding spatial and temporal average &lt;3d&gt; models. the use of the &lt;3d&gt;models is justified only for particular fe i lines in particular physicalconditions. our nlte calculations reproduce well the centre-to-limb variationof the solar fe i 7780 a line, but they are unsuccessful for fe i 6151 a. themetal-poor &lt;3d&gt; model was found to be adequite for the strong fe i 5166 a (eexc= 0) line, but inadequite in all other investigated cases.

1303.1791	carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars: the most pristine objects?	carbon-enhanced metal poor stars (cemp) form a significant proportion of themetal-poor stars, their origin is not well understood. three very metal-poorc-rich turnoff stars were selected from the sdss survey, observed with the esovlt (uves) to precisely determine the element abundances. in turnoff stars(unlike giants) the carbon abundance has not been affected by mixing with deeplayers and is therefore easier to interpret. the analysis was performed with 1dlte static model atmospheres. when available, non-lte corrections were appliedto the classical lte abundances. the 3d effects on the ch and cn molecularbands were computed using hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar atmosphere(co5bold) and are found to be very important. to facilitate a comparison withprevious results, only 1d abundances are used in the discussion. the abundances(or upper limits) of the elements enable us to place these stars in differentcemp classes. the carbon abundances confirm the existence of a plateau at a(c)=8.25 for [fe/h] \geq -3.4. the most metal-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt; -3.4) havesignificantly lower carbon abundances, suggesting a lower plateau at a(c)\approx 6.5. detailed analyses of a larger sample of very low metallicitycarbon-rich stars are required to confirm (or refute) this possible secondplateau and specify the behavior of the cemp stars at very low metallicity.

1303.2016	oxygen spectral line synthesis: 3d non-lte with co5bold hydrodynamical  model atmospheres	in this work we present first results of our current project aimed atcombining the 3d hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere approach with non-lte (nlte)spectral line synthesis for a number of key chemical species. we carried out afull 3d-nlte spectrum synthesis of the oxygen ir 777 nm triplet, using amodified and improved version of our nlte3d package to calculate departurecoefficients for the atomic levels of oxygen in a co5bold 3d hydrodynamicalsolar model atmosphere. spectral line synthesis was subsequently performed withthe linfor 3d code. in agreement with previous studies, we find that the linesof the oxygen triplet produce deeper cores under nlte conditions, due to thediminished line source function in the line forming region. this means that thesolar oxygen ir 777 nm lines should be stronger in nlte, leading to negative 3dnlte-lte abundance corrections. qualitatively this result would supportprevious claims for a relatively low solar oxygen abundance. finally, weoutline several further steps that need to be taken in order to improve thephysical realism and numerical accuracy of our current 3d-nlte calculations.

1305.3441	the influence of convection on the atmospheric structures and observable  properties of red giant stars	during the recent years significant progress has been made in the modeling ofred giant atmospheres with the aid of 3d hydrodynamical model atmosphere codes.in this contribution we provide an overview of selected results obtained inthis context by utilizing 3d hydrodynamical co5bold stellar model atmospheres.hydrodynamical simulations show that convective motions lead to significantdifferences in the atmospheric structures of red giants with respect to thosepredicted by the classical 1d model atmospheres. results of these simulationsalso show that in certain cases 1d models fail to reproduce even the averageproperties of the 3d hydrodynamical models, such as p-t profiles. largehorizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3d model atmospheres, as well asdifferences between the temperature profiles of the average &lt;3d&gt; and 1d models,lead to large discrepancies in the strengths of spectral lines predicted by the3d and 1d model atmospheres. this is especially important in models at lowestmetallicities ([m/h]&lt;-2.0) where the 3d-1d abundance differences may reach (oreven exceed) -0.6 dex for lines of neutral atoms and molecules. we also discussseveral simplifications and numerical aspects involved in the present 3dhydrodynamical modeling of red giant atmospheres, and briefly address severalissues where urgent progress may be needed.

1307.2810	granulation properties of giants, dwarfs, and white dwarfs from the  cifist 3d model atmosphere grid	3d model atmospheres for giants, dwarfs, and white dwarfs, computed with theco5bold code and part of the cifist grid, have been used for spectroscopic andasteroseismic studies. unlike existing plane-parallel 1d structures, thesesimulations predict the spatially and temporally resolved emergent intensity sothat granulation can be analysed, which provides insights on how convectiveenergy transfer operates in stars. the wide range of atmospheric parameters ofthe cifist 3d simulations (3600 &lt; teff (k) &lt; 13,000 and 1 &lt; log g &lt; 9) allowsthe comparison of convective processes in significantly different environments.we show that the relative intensity contrast is correlated with both the machand peclet numbers in the photosphere. the horizontal size of granules variesbetween 3 and 10 times the local pressure scale height, with a tightcorrelation between the factor and the mach number of the flow. given thatconvective giants, dwarfs, and white dwarfs cover the same range of mach andpeclet numbers, we conclude that photospheric convection operates in a verysimilar way in those objects.

1309.1488	stellar granulation as seen in disk-integrated intensity. ii.  theoretical scaling relations compared with observations	a large set of stars observed by corot and kepler shows clear evidence forthe presence of a stellar background, which is interpreted to arise fromsurface convection, i.e., granulation. these observations show that thecharacteristic time-scale (tau_eff) and the root-mean-square (rms) brightnessfluctuations (sigma) associated with the granulation scale as a function of thepeak frequency (nu_max) of the solar-like oscillations. we aim at providing atheoretical background to the observed scaling relations based on a modeldeveloped in the companion paper. we computed for each 3d model the theoreticalpower density spectrum (pds) associated with the granulation as seen indisk-integrated intensity on the basis of the theoretical model. for each pdswe derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with thetheoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the keplermeasurements. we derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma,which show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations. inaddition, we show that these quantities also scale as a function of theturbulent mach number (ma) estimated at the photosphere. the theoreticalscaling relations for tau_eff and sigma match the observations well on a globalscale. our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observedvariations of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max. it also highlights the importantrole of ma in controlling the properties of the stellar granulation. however,the observations made with kepler on a wide variety of stars cannot confirm thedependence of our scaling relations on ma. measurements of the granulationbackground and detections of solar-like oscillations in a statisticallysufficient number of cool dwarf stars will be required for confirming thedependence of the theoretical scaling relations with ma.

1309.4913	x-shooter gto: evidence for a population of extremely metal-poor,  alpha-poor stars	the extremely metal-poor stars are the direct descendants of the firstgeneration stars. they carry the chemical signature of the pristine universe atthe time they formed, shortly after the big bang. we aim to derive informationabout extremely metal-poor stars from their observed spectra. four extremelymetal-poor stars were selected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) andobserved during the guaranteed observing time of x-shooter. the x-shooterspectra were analysed using an automatic code, mygisfos, which is based on atraditional analysis method. it makes use of a synthetic grid computed fromone-dimensional, plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. the lowmetallicity derived from the sdss spectra is confirmed here. two kinds of starsare found. two stars are confirmed to be extremely metal-poor, with no evidenceof any enhancement in carbon. the two other stars are strongly enhanced incarbon. we could not derive iron abundance for one of them, while [ca/h] isbelow -4.5. two of the stars are members of the rare population of extremelymetal-poor stars low in alpha elements.

1310.6058	isotope spectroscopy	the measurement of isotopic ratios provides a privileged insight both intonucleosynthesis and into the mechanisms operating in stellar envelopes, such asgravitational settling. in this article, we give a few examples of how isotopicratios can be determined from high-resolution, high-quality stellar spectra. weconsider examples of the lightest elements, h and he, for which the isotopicshifts are very large and easily measurable, and examples of heavier elementsfor which the determination of isotopic ratios is more difficult. the presenceof 6li in the stellar atmospheres causes a subtle extra depression in the redwing of the 7li 670.7 nm doublet which can only be detected in spectra of thehighest quality. but even with the best spectra, the derived $^6$li abundancecan only be as good as the synthetic spectra used for their interpretation. itis now known that 3d non-lte modelling of the lithium spectral line profiles isnecessary to account properly for the intrinsic line asymmetry, which isproduced by convective flows in the atmospheres of cool stars, and can mimicthe presence of 6li. we also discuss briefly the case of the carbon isotopicratio in metal-poor stars, and provide a new determination of the nickelisotopic ratios in the solar atmosphere.

1310.6963	topos: i. survey design and analysis of the first sample	the metal-weak tail of the metallicity distribution function (mdf) of thegalactic halo stars contains crucial information on the formation mode of thefirst generation of stars. to determine this observationally, it is necessaryto observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. we present here theturn-off primordial stars survey (topos) that is conducted as an eso largeprogramme at the vlt. this project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand theformation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weaktail of the halo mdf below [m/h]=-3.5. in particular, we aim at determining thecritical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for theformation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of theelements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massivefirst stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the timewhen the galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of c-enhanced extremelymetal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. the largenumber of stars observed in the sdss provides a good sample of candidates ofstars at extremely low metallicity. candidates with turn-off colours down tomagnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of sdss by meansof an automated procedure. x-shooter has the potential of performing thenecessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities andabundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. we here present thestellar parameters of the first set of stars. the nineteen stars range in ironabundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the sun. two stars have a highradial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear tobe marginally bound to the galaxy and are possibly accreted from anothergalaxy.

1310.7791	three-dimensional hydrodynamical co5bold model atmospheres of red giant  stars. iii. line formation in the atmospheres of giants located close to the  base of rgb	we utilize state-of-the-art 3d hydrodynamical and classical 1d stellar modelatmospheres to study the influence of convection on the formation properties ofvarious atomic and molecular spectral lines in the atmospheres of four redgiant stars, located close to the base of the red giant branch, rgb($t_{\mathrm eff}\approx5000$ k, $\log g=2.5$), and characterized by fourdifferent metallicities, [m/h] = 0.0, -1.0, -2.0, -3.0. the role of convectionin the spectral line formation is assessed with the aid of abundancecorrections, i.e., the differences in abundances predicted for a givenequivalent width of a particular spectral line with the 3d and 1d modelatmospheres. we find that for lines of certain neutral atoms the abundancecorrections strongly depend both on metallicity of a given model atmosphere andthe line excitation potential. while abundance corrections for all lines ofboth neutral and ionized elements tend to be small at solar metallicity, forlines of neutral elements with low ionization potential and low-to-intermediate$\chi$ they quickly increase with decreasing metallicity, reaching in theirextremes to -0.6...-0.8 dex. in all such cases the large abundance correctionsare due to horizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3d hydrodynamical models.abundance corrections of molecular lines are very sensitive to metallicity ofthe underlying model atmosphere and may be larger (in absolute value) than -0.5dex at [m/h] = -3.0 (-1.5 dex in the case of co). we also find that anapproximate treatment of scattering in the 3d model calculations leads to theabundance corrections that are altered by less than ~0.1 dex, both for atomicand molecular (co) lines, with respect to the model where scattering is treatedas true absorption throughout the entire atmosphere, with the largestdifferences for the resonance and low-excitation lines.

1311.5566	mygisfos: an automated code for parameter determination and detailed  abundance analysis in cool stars	the current and planned high-resolution, high-multiplexity stellarspectroscopic surveys, as well as the swelling amount of under-utilized datapresent in public archives have led to an increasing number of efforts toautomate the crucial but slow process to retrieve stellar parameters andchemical abundances from spectra. we present mygisfos, a code designed toderive atmospheric parameters and detailed stellar abundances from medium -high resolution spectra of cool (fgk) stars. we describe the general structureand workings of the code, present analyses of a number of well studied starsrepresentative of the parameter space mygisfos is designed to cover, andexamples of the exploitation of mygisfos very fast analysis to assessuncertainties through montecarlo tests. mygisfos aims to reproduce a``traditional'' manual analysis by fitting spectral features for differentelements against a precomputed grid of synthetic spectra. fe i and fe ii linescan be employed to determine temperature, gravity, microturbulence, andmetallicity by iteratively minimizing the dependence of fe i abundance fromline lower energy and equivalent width, and imposing fe i - fe ii ionizationequilibrium. once parameters are retrieved, detailed chemical abundances aremeasured from lines of other elements. mygisfos replicates closely the resultsobtained in similar analyses on a set of well known stars. it is also quitefast, performing a full parameter determination and detailed abundance analysisin about two minutes per star on a mainstream desktop computer. currently, itspreferred field of application are high-resolution and/or large spectralcoverage data (e.g uves, x-shooter, harps, sophie).

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1409.3153	oxygen in the early galaxy: oh lines as tracers of oxygen abundance in  extremely metal-poor giant stars	oxygen is a powerful tracer element of galactic chemical evolution.unfortunately, only a few oxygen lines are available in theultraviolet-infrared stellar spectra for the reliable determination of itsabundance. moreover, oxygen abundances obtained using different spectral linesoften disagree significantly. in this contribution we therefore investigatewhether the inadequate treatment of convection in 1d hydrostatic modelatmospheres used in the abundance determinations may be responsible for thisdisagreement. for this purpose, we used vlt crires spectra of three emp giants,as well as 3d hydrodynamical co$^5$bold and 1d hydrostatic lhd modelatmospheres, to investigate the role of convection in the formation of infrared(ir) oh lines. our results show that the presence of convection leads tosignificantly stronger ir oh lines. as a result, the difference in the oxygenabundance determined from ir oh lines with 3d hydrodynamical and classical 1dhydrostatic model atmospheres may reach -0.2 ... -0.3 dex. in case of the threeemp giants studied here, we obtain a good agrement between the 3d lte oxygenabundances determined by us using vibrational-rotational ir oh lines in thespectral range of 1514-1626 nm, and oxygen abundances determined from forbidden[o i] 630 nm line in previous studies.

1506.00931	the photospheric solar oxygen project: iii. investigation of the  centre-to-limb variation of the 630nm [oi]-nii blend	the solar photospheric abundance of oxygen is still a matter of debate. forabout ten years some determinations have favoured a low oxygen abundance whichis at variance with the value inferred by helioseismology. among the oxygenabundance indicators, the forbidden line at 630nm has often been considered themost reliable even though it is blended with a nii line. in papers i and paperii of this series we reported a discrepancy in the oxygen abundance derivedfrom the 630nm and the subordinate [oi] line at 636nm in dwarf stars, includingthe sun. here we analyse several, in part new, solar observations of the thecentre-to-limb variation of the spectral region including the blend at 630nm inorder to separate the individual contributions of oxygen and nickel. we analyseintensity spectra observed at different limb angles in comparison with lineformation computations performed on a co5bold 3d hydrodynamical simulation ofthe solar atmosphere. the oxygen abundances obtained from the forbidden line atdifferent limb angles are inconsistent if the commonly adopted nickel abundanceof 6.25 is assumed in our local thermodynamic equilibrium computations. with aslightly lower nickel abundance, a(ni)~6.1, we obtain consistent fitsindicating an oxygen abundance of a(o)=8.73+/-0.05. at this value thediscrepancy with the subordinate oxygen line remains. the derived value of theoxygen abundance supports the notion of a rather low oxygen abundance in thesolar hotosphere. however, it is disconcerting that the forbidden oxygen linesat 630 and 636nm give noticeably different results, and that the nickelabundance derived here from the 630nm blend is lower than expected from othernickel lines.

1506.03615	chemical abundances of giant stars in the crater stellar system	we obtained spectra for two giants of crater (crater j113613-105227 andcrater j113615-105244) using x-shooter at the vlt. the spectra have beenanalysed with the mygisfos code using a grid of synthetic spectra computed fromone dimensional, local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) model atmospheres.effective temperature and surface gravity have been derived from photometrymeasured from images obtained by the dark energy survey. the radial velocitiesare 144.3+-4.0 km/s for crater j113613-105227 and and 134.1+-4.0 km/s forcrater j113615-105244. the metallicities are [fe/h]=-1.73 and [fe/h]=-1.67,respectively. beside the iron abundance we could determine abundances for nineelements: na, mg, ca, ti, v, cr, mn, ni and ba. for na and ba we took intoaccount deviations from lte, since the corrections are significant. theabundance ratios are similar in the two stars and resemble those of galacticstars of the same metallicity. on the deep photometric images we could detectseveral stars that lie to the blue of the turn-off. conclusions heading(optional), leave it empty if necessary the radial velocities imply that bothstars are members of the crater stellar system. the difference in velocitybetween the two taken at face value, implies a velocity dispersion &gt; 3.7 km/sat 95% confidence level. our spectroscopic metallicities are in excellentagreement with that determined by previous investigations using photometry. ourdeep photometry and the spectroscopic metallicity imply an age of 7 gyr for themain population of the system. the stars to the blue of the turn-off can beinterpreted as a younger population, of the same metallicity and an age of 2.2gyr. finally, spatial and kinematical parameters support the idea that thissystem is associated to the galaxies leo~iv and leo~v. all the observationsfavour the interpretation of crater as a dwarf galaxy.

1507.07472	grid of theoretical nlte equivalent widths of four ba ii lines and  barium abundance in cool stars	we present a grid of computed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nlte)equivalent widths (ew) and nlte abundance corrections for four ba ii lines:4554, 5853, 6141, and 6496 a. the grid can be useful in deriving the nltebarium abundance in stars having parameters in the following ranges: effectivetemperature from 4000 k to 6500 k, surface gravity log g from 0 to 5,microturbulent velocity 0 km s^-1 to 3 km s^-1, metallicity [fe/h] from -2 to+0.5, and [ba/fe] from -0.4 to +0.6. the nlte abundance can be either derivedby ew interpolation (using the observed ba ii line ew) or by using the nltecorrection applied to a previously determined lte abundance. ba ii lineequivalent widths and the nlte corrections were calculated using the updatedmulti code and the ba ii atomic model that was previously applied to determinethe nlte barium abundance in different types of stars. the grid is availableon-line through the web, and we find that the grid ba nlte corrections arealmost as accurate as direct nlte profile fitting (to within 0.05-0.08 dex).for the weakest ba ii line (5853 a) the lte abundances almost agree with thenlte abundances, whereas the other three ba ii lines, 4554, 6141, and 6496 a,need nlte corrections even at the highest metallicities tested here. the 4554 aline is extremely strong and should not be used for abundance analysis above[fe/h]= -1. furthermore, we tested the impact of different model atmospheresand spectrum synthesis codes and found average differences of 0.06 dex and 0.09dex, respectively, for all four lines. at these metallicities we find anaverage delta nlte of +/-0.1 dex for the three useful ba lines for subsolarcool dwarfs.

1508.02714	stellar science from a blue wavelength range - a possible design for the  blue arm of 4most	from stellar spectra, a variety of physical properties of stars can bederived. in particular, the chemical composition of stellar atmospheres can beinferred from absorption line analyses. these provide key information on largescales, such as the formation of our galaxy, down to the small-scalenucleosynthesis processes that take place in stars and supernovae. by extendingthe observed wavelength range toward bluer wavelengths, we optimize suchstudies to also include critical absorption lines in metal-poor stars, andallow for studies of heavy elements (z&gt;38) whose formation processes remainpoorly constrained. in this context, spectrographs optimized for observing bluewavelength ranges are essential, since many absorption lines at redderwavelengths are too weak to be detected in metal-poor stars. this means thatsome elements cannot be studied in the visual-redder regions, and importantscientific tracers and science cases are lost. the present era of large publicsurveys will target millions of stars. here we describe the requirementsdriving the design of the forthcoming survey instrument 4most, a multi-objectspectrograph commissioned for the eso vista 4m-telescope. we focus here onhigh-density, wide-area survey of stars and the science that can be achievedwith high-resolution stellar spectroscopy. scientific and technicalrequirements that governed the design are described along with a thorough lineblending analysis. for the high-resolution spectrograph, we find that asampling of &gt;2.5 (pixels per resolving element), spectral resolution of 18000or higher, and a wavelength range covering 393-436 nm, is the mostwell-balanced solution for the instrument. a spectrograph with thesecharacteristics will enable accurate abundance analysis (+/-0.1 dex) in theblue and allow us to confront the outlined scientific questions.

1508.03487	the photospheric solar oxygen project: iv. 3d-nlte investigation of the  777 nm triplet lines	the solar photospheric oxygen abundance is still widely debated. adopting thesolar chemical composition based on the "low" oxygen abundance, as determinedwith the use of three-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamical model atmospheres,results in a well-known mismatch between theoretical solar models andhelioseismic measurements that is so far unresolved. we carry out anindependent redetermination of the solar oxygen abundance by investigating thecenter-to-limb variation of the oi ir triplet lines at 777 nm in different setsof spectra with the help of detailed synthetic line profiles based on 3dhydrodynamical co5bold model atmospheres and 3d non-lte line formationcalculations with nltetd. the idea is to simultaneously derive the oxygenabundance,a(o), and the scaling factor sh that describes the cross-sections forinelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen relative the classical drawinformula. the best fit of the center-to-limb variation of the triplet linesachieved with the co5bold 3d solar model is clearly of superior qualitycompared to the line profile fits obtained with standard 1d model atmospheres.our best estimate of the 3d non-lte solar oxygen abundance is a(o) = 8.76 +/-0.02, with the scaling factor sh in the range between 1.2 and 1.8. all 1dnon-lte models give much lower oxygen abundances, by up to -0.15 dex. this ismainly a consequence of the assumption of a $\mu$-independent microturbulence.

1510.00300	surface-effect corrections for solar-like oscillations using 3d  hydrodynamical simulations	the space-borne missions have provided us with a wealth of high-qualityobservational data that allows for seismic inferences of stellar interiors.this requires the computation of precise and accurate theoretical frequencies,but imperfect modeling of the uppermost stellar layers introduces systematicerrors. to overcome this problem, an empirical correction has been introducedby kjeldsen et al. (2008, apj, 683, l175) and is now commonly used for seismicinferences. nevertheless, we still lack a physical justification allowing forthe quantification of the surface-effect corrections. we used a grid of thesesimulations computed with the co$^5$bold code to model the outer layers ofsolar-like stars. upper layers of the corresponding 1d standard models werethen replaced by the layers obtained from the horizontally averaged 3d models.the frequency differences between these patched models and the 1d standardmodels were then calculated using the adiabatic approximation and allowed us toconstrain the kjeldsen et al. power law, as well as a lorentzian formulation.we find that the surface effects on modal frequencies depend significantly onboth the effective temperature and the surface gravity. we further provide thevariation in the parameters related to the surface-effect corrections usingtheir power law as well as a lorentzian formulation. scaling relations betweenthese parameters and the elevation (related to the mach number) is alsoprovided. the lorentzian formulation is shown to be more robust for the wholefrequency spectrum, while the power law is not suitable for the frequencyshifts in the frequency range above $\nu_{\rm max}$.

1510.06396	giano y-band spectroscopy of dwarf stars: phosphorus, sulphur, and  strontium abundances	in recent years a number of poorly studied chemical elements, such asphosphorus, sulphur, and strontium, have received special attention asimportant tracers of the galactic chemical evolution. by exploiting thecapabilities of the infrared echelle spectrograph giano mounted at thetelescopio nazionale galileo, we acquired high resolution spectra of fourgalactic dwarf stars spanning the metallicity range between about one-third andtwice the solar value. we performed a detailed feasibility study about theeffectiveness of the p, s, and sr line diagnostics in the y band between 1.03and 1.10 microm. accurate chemical abundances have been derived usingone-dimensional model atmospheres computed in local thermodynamic equilibrium(lte). we computed the line formation assuming lte for p, while we performednon-lte analysis to derive s and sr abundances. we were able to derivephosphorus abundance for three stars and an upper limit for one star, while weobtained the abundance of sulphur and strontium for all of the stars. we find[p/fe] and [s/fe] abundance ratios consistent with solar-scaled or slightlydepleted values, while the [sr/fe] abundance ratios are more scattered (by+/-0.2 dex) around the solar-scaled value. this is fully consistent withprevious studies using both optical and infrared spectroscopy. we verified thathigh-resolution, y-band spectroscopy as provided by giano is a powerful tool tostudy the chemical evolution of p, s, and sr in dwarf stars.

1512.08999	lithium spectral line formation in stellar atmospheres. the impact of  convection and nlte effects	different simplified approaches are used to account for the non-localthermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) effects with 3d hydrodynamical modelatmospheres. in certain cases, chemical abundances are derived in 1d nlte andcorrected for the 3d effects by adding 3d-1d lte abundance corrections (3d+nlteapproach). alternatively, average &lt;3d&gt; model atmospheres are sometimes used tosubstitute for the full 3d hydrodynamical models.  we tested whether the results obtained using these simplified schemes (i.e.,3d+nlte, &lt;3d&gt; nlte) may reproduce those derived using the full 3d nltecomputations. the tests were made using 3d hydrodynamical co5bold modelatmospheres of the main sequence (ms), main sequence turn-off (to), subgiant(sgb), and red giant branch (rgb) stars, all at [m/h]=0.0 and -2.0. our goalwas to investigate the role of 3d and nlte effects on the formation of the670.8 nm lithium line by assessing strengths of synthetic 670.8 nm lineprofiles, computed using 3d/1d nlte/lte approaches.  our results show that li 670.8 nm line strengths obtained using differentmethodologies differ only slightly in most of the models at solar metallicity.however, the line strengths predicted with the 3d nlte and 3d+nlte approachesbecome significantly different at subsolar metallicities. at [m/h]=-2.0, thismay lead to (3d nlte)-(3d+nlte) differences in the predicted lithium abundanceof ~0.46 and ~0.31 dex in the to and rgb stars, respectively. on the otherhand, nlte line strengths computed with the average &lt;3d&gt; and 1d modelatmospheres are similar to those obtained with the full 3d nlte approach forms, to, sgb, and rgb stars, at all metallicities; 3d-&lt;3d&gt; and 3d-1d differencesin the predicted abundances are always less than ~0.04 dex and ~0.08 dex,respectively. however, neither of the simplified approaches can reliablysubstitute 3d nlte spectral synthesis when precision is required.

astro-ph;0103234	an astrophysical oscillator strength for the sii 94.7 nm resonance line  and s abundances in dlas	by using uv spectra for the o star hd 93521 taken with the orfeus ii echellespectrograph, we determine an ``astrophysical'' f value for the sii 94.7 nmline: f = 0.00498 (+0.00172)(-0.00138), error at 1 sigma level.this is almost afactor of 30 smaller than the guessed value found in the kurucz database(f=0.1472), which was up to now the only one available for this transition. weuse our ``astrophysical'' f to investigate the s abundance in two dampedly-alpha absorption systems (dlas) observed with uves at the eso 8.2m kueyentelescope. in the case of the absorber at zabs=3.02486 towards qso 0347-3819 wefind a sulphur column density which is consistent, within errors, with thatdetermined by centurion et al by means of the 125.9 nm line, thus providing anexternal check on the accuracy of our f value. for the damped absorber atzabs=4.4680 towards br j0307-4945 we determine a high value of the s abundance,which, however, is probably the result of blending with ly-alpha forest lines.

astro-ph;0406265	lambda boo stars with composite spectra	we examine the large sample of lambda boo candidates collected in table 1 ofgerbaldi et al. (2003) to see how many of them show composite spectra. of the132 lambda boo candidates we identify 22 which definitely show compositespectra and 15 more for which there are good reasons to suspect a compositespectrum. the percentage of lambda boo candidates with composite spectra istherefore &gt; 17 and possibly considerably higher. for such stars the lambda booclassification should be reconsidered taking into account the fact that theirspectra are composite. we argue that some of the underabundances reported inthe literature may simply be the result of the failure to consider thecomposite nature of the spectra. this leads to the legitimate suspicion thatsome, if not all, the lambda boo candidates are not chemically peculiar at all.a thorough analysis of even a single one of the lambda boo candidates withcomposite spectra, in which the composite nature of the spectrum is dulyconsidered, which would demonstrate that the chemical peculiarities persist,would clear the doubt we presently have that the stars with composite spectramay not be lambda boo at all.

astro-ph;0504463	sulphur abundances in terzan 7	we present here the first measurements of sulphur abundances in extragalacticstars. we make use of high resolution spectra, obtained with uves at the eso8.2 m kueyen telescope, of three giants of the globular cluster terzan 7, whichbelongs to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. we measure the sulphur abundancesusing the lines of s i multiplet 1. the s/fe ratios for all three stars arenearly solar, thus considerably lower than what is found in galactic stars ofcomparable iron content ([fe/h] ~ -0.50). this finding is in keeping with theabundances of other alpha-chain elements in this cluster and in sagittarius andother dsphs in general. these low alpha-chain elements to iron ratios suggestthat sagittarius and its globular clusters have experienced a low or burstingstar-formation rate. our sulphur abundances imply &lt;\log (s/o)&gt; = -1.61 which iscomparable to what is found in many h ii regions of similar oxygen content, andis slightly lower than the solar value (log (s/o)sun = -1.51). these are alsothe first measurements of sulphur abundances in a globular cluster, thus adirect comparison of terzan 7 and galactic globular clusters is not possibleyet. however our analysis suggests that the lines of s i multiplet 1 should bemeasurable for other globular clusters at least down to a metallicity ~ -1.5.
