0704.1191	five intermediate-period planets from the n2k sample	we report the detection of five jovian mass planets orbiting high metallicitystars. four of these stars were first observed as part of the n2k program andexhibited low rms velocity scatter after three consecutive observations.however, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal thepresence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days toa few years. hd 11506 is a g0v star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a3.85 year orbit. hd 17156 is a g0v star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 dayorbit. the eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for aplanet with a relatively short period. the orbital period for this planetplaces it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have beendetected. hd 125612 is a g3v star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4year orbit. hd 170469 is a g5iv star with a planet of \msini = 0.67 \mjup in a3.13 year orbit. hd 231701 is an f8v star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142day orbit. all of these stars have supersolar metallicity. three of the fivestars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightnessvariability. a transit search conducted for hd 17156 was negative but coveredonly 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

0904.3146	a quasi-stationary solution to gliese 436b's eccentricity	we investigate the possibility that the large orbital eccentricity of thetransiting neptune-mass planet gliese 436b is maintained in the face of tidaldissipation by a second planet in the system. we find that the currentlyobserved configuration can be understood if gliese 436b and a putativecompanion have evolved to a quasi-stationary fixed point in which the planets'orbital apses are co-linear and in which secular variations in the orbitaleccentricities of the two planets have been almost entirely damped out. weadopt an octopole-order secular theory based on a legendre expansion in thesemi-major axis ratio to delineate well-defined regions of (p_c, m_c, e_c)space that can be occupied by a perturbing companion. we incorporate theevolutionary effect of tidal dissipation into our secular model of the system,and solve the resulting initial value problems for a large sample of theallowed configurations. we then polish the stationary configurations derivedfrom secular theory with full numerical integrations. we present our results inthe form of candidate companion planets to gliese 436b. for these candidates,radial velocity half-amplitudes, k_c, are of order 3 m/s, and the maximumamplitude of orbit-to-orbit transit timing variations are of order delta t=1 sto delta t=5s. for the particular example case of a perturber with orbitalperiod, p_c=40 d, mass, m_c=8.5 m_earth, and eccentricity, e_c=0.58, we confirmour semi-analytic calculations with a full numerical 3-body integration of theorbital decay that includes tidal damping and spin evolution. additionally, wediscuss the possibility of many-perturber stationary configurations, utilizingmodified laplace-lagrange secular theory.

0907.5019	determination of the interior structure of transiting planets in  multiple-planet systems	tidal dissipation within a short-period transiting extrasolar planetperturbed by a companion object can drive orbital evolution of the system to aso-called tidal fixed point, in which the apsidal lines of the transitingplanet and its perturber are aligned, and for which variations in the orbitaleccentricities of both planet and perturber are damped out. significantcontributions to the apsidal precession rate are made by the secularplanet-planet interaction, by general relativity, and by the gravitationalquadropole fields created by the transiting planet's tidal and rotationaldistortions. the fixed-point orbital eccentricity of the inner planet istherefore a strong function of the planet's interior structure. we illustratethese ideas in the specific context of the recently discovered hat-p-13exo-planetary system, and show that one can already glean important insightsinto the physical properties of the inner transiting planet. we presentstructural models of the planet, which indicate that its observed radius can bemaintained for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core massand tidal energy dissipation in the interior. we use an octopole-order seculartheory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the inner planet'seccentricity, on its tidal love number. we find that the currently measuredeccentricity, implies 0.116 &lt; k2_{b} &lt; 0.425, 0 m_{earth}&lt;m_{core}&lt;120m_{earth}$, and q_{b} &lt; 300,000. improved measurement of the eccentricity willsoon allow for far tighter limits to be placed on all three of thesequantities, and will provide an unprecedented probe into the interior structureof an extrasolar planet.

1005.5396	systemic: a testbed for characterizing the detection of extrasolar  planets. ii. numerical approaches to the transit timing inverse problem	transit timing variations - deviations from strict periodicity betweensuccessive passages of a transiting planet - can be used to probe the structureand dynamics of multiple-planet systems. in this paper, we examine prospectsfor numerically solving the so-called inverse problem, the determination of theorbital elements of a perturbing body from the transit timing variations itinduces. we assume that the planetary systems under examination have a limitednumber of doppler velocity measurements, and show that a more extensive radialvelocity characterization with precision comparable to the semiamplitude of theperturber may remove degeneracies in the solution. we examine severalconfigurations of interest, including (1) a prototypical non-resonant system,modeled after hd40307 b and c, which contains multiple super-earth massplanets, (2) a hypothetical system containing a transiting giant planet with aterrestrial-mass companion trapped in low-order mean motion resonance, and (3)the hat-p-13 system, in which forced precession by an outer perturbing bodythat is well characterized by doppler radial velocity measurements can giveinsight into the interior structure of a perturbing planet, and for which thedetermination of mutual inclination between the transiting planet and itsperturber is a key issue.

1006.2850	a physically-motivated photometric calibration of m dwarf metallicity	the location of m dwarfs in the v-k_s--m_ks color-magnitude diagram (cmd) hasbeen shown to correlate with metallicity. we demonstrate that previousempirical photometric calibrations of m dwarf metallicity exploiting thiscorrelation systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at theextremes of their range. we improve upon previous calibrations in three ways.we use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of f and g dwarfsfrom the geneva-copehnagen survey (gcs) to infer the mean metallicity of mdwarfs in the solar neighborhood, we use theoretical models of m dwarfinteriors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on m dwarfs inthe v-k_s--m_ks cmd, and we base our final calibration purely onhigh-resolution spectroscopy of fgk primaries with m dwarf companions. as aresult, we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in thecalibration sample than previous photometric calibrations. wenon-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that m dwarfsthat host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the v-k_s--m_ks planepopulated by metal-rich m dwarfs. we find that the probability p thatplanet-hosting m dwarfs are distributed across the v-k_s--m_ks cmd in the sameway as field m dwarfs is p = 0.06 +/- 0.008. interestingly, the subsample of mdwarfs that host neptune and sub-neptune mass planets may also bepreferentially located in the region of the v-k_s--m_ks plane populated byhigh-metallicity m dwarfs. the probability of this occurrence by chance is p =0.40 +/- 0.02, and this observation hints that low-mass planets may be morelikely to be found around metal-rich m dwarfs. an increased rate of low-massplanet occurrence around metal-rich m dwarfs would be a natural consequence ofthe core-accretion model of planet formation.

1009.2212	a scientometric prediction of the discovery of the first potentially  habitable planet with a mass similar to earth	the search for a habitable extrasolar planet has long interested scientists,but only recently have the tools become available to search for such planets.in the past decades, the number of known extrasolar planets has ballooned intothe hundreds, and with it the expectation that the discovery of the firstearth-like extrasolar planet is not far off. here we develop a novel metric ofhabitability for discovered planets, and use this to arrive at a prediction forwhen the first habitable planet will be discovered. using a bootstrap analysisof currently discovered exoplanets, we predict the discovery of the firstearth-like planet to be announced in the first half of 2011, with the likeliestdate being early may 2011. our predictions, using only the properties ofpreviously discovered exoplanets, accord well with external estimates for thediscovery of the first potentially habitable extrasolar planet, and highlightsthe the usefulness of predictive scientometric techniques to understand thepace of scientific discovery in many fields.

1011.1019	warm spitzer photometry of the transiting exoplanets corot-1 and corot-2  at secondary eclipse	we measure secondary eclipses of the hot giant exoplanets corot-1 at 3.6 and4.5 microns, and corot-2 at 3.6 microns, both using warm spitzer. we find thatthe warm spitzer mission is working very well for exoplanet science. forconsistency of our analysis we also re-analyze archival cryogenic spitzer datafor secondary eclipses of corot-2 at 4.5 and 8 microns. we compare the totaldata for both planets, including optical eclipse measurements by the corotmission, and ground-based eclipse measurements at 2 microns, to existingmodels. both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4.5 than at 3.6 microns,which is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion. the spectrumof corot-1 is best reproduced by a 2460k blackbody, due either to a highaltitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance, or an isothermalregion in the planetary atmosphere. the spectrum of corot-2 is unusual becausethe 8 micron contrast is anomalously low. non-inverted atmospheres couldpotentially produce the corot-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emissionfrom co at 4.5 microns, caused by tidal-induced mass loss. however, theviability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannotbe more than about 30-percent larger than the planet's transit radius, based onthe ingress and egress times at eclipse. an alternative possibility to accountfor the spectrum of corot-2 is an additional opacity source that acts stronglyat wavelengths less than 5 microns, heating the upper atmosphere while allowingthe deeper atmosphere seen at 8 microns to remain cooler. we obtain a similarresult as gillon et al. for the phase of the secondary eclipse of corot-2,implying an eccentric orbit with e*cos(omega)=-0.0030 +/- 0.0004.

(2010). we also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of thesecondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0.0024,which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain thisplanet's inflated radius.

1101.5827	on the anomalous radii of the transiting extrasolar planets	we present a systematic evaluation of the agreement between the observedradii of 90 well-characterized transiting extrasolar giant planets and theircorresponding model radii. our model radii are drawn from previously publishedcalculations of core-less giant planets that have attained their asymptoticradii, and which have been tabulated for a range of planet masses andequilibrium temperatures. (we report a two-dimensional polynomial fittingfunction that accurately represents the models). as expected, the model radiiprovide a statistically significant improvement over a null hypothesis that thesizes of giant planets are completely independent of mass and effectivetemperature. as is well known, however, fiducial models provide an insufficientexplanation; the planetary radius anomalies are strongly correlated withplanetary equilibrium temperature. we find that the radius anomalies have abest-fit dependence, ${\cal r}\propto t_{\rm eff}^{\alpha}$, with$\alpha=1.4\pm0.6$. incorporating this relation into the model radii leads tosubstantially less scatter in the radius correlation. the extra temperaturedependence represents an important constraint on theoretical models for hotjupiters. using simple scaling arguments, we find support for the hypothesis ofbatygin and stevenson (2010) that this correlation can be attributed to aplanetary heating mechanism that is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic couplingbetween the planetary magnetic field and near-surface flow that is accompaniedby ohmic dissipation at adiabatic depth. additionally, we find that thetemperature dependence is likely too strong to admit kinetic heating as theprimary source of anomalous energy generation within the majority of theobserved transiting planets.

1102.0274	resolving the sin(i) degeneracy in low-mass multi-planet systems	long-term orbital evolution of multi-planet systems under tidal dissipationoften converges to a stationary state, known as the tidal fixed point. thefixed point is characterized by a lack of oscillations in the eccentricitiesand apsidal alignment among the orbits. quantitatively, the nature of the fixedpoint is dictated by mutual interactions among the planets as well asnon-keplerian effects. we show that if a roughly coplanar system hosts a hot,sub-saturn mass planet, and is tidally relaxed, separation of planet-planetinteractions and non-keplerian effects in the equations of motion leads to adirect determination of the true masses of the planets. consequently, a"snap-shot" observational determination of the orbital state resolves thesin(i) degeneracy, and opens up a direct avenue towards identification of thetrue lowest-mass exo-planets detected. we present an approximate, as well as ageneral, mathematical framework for computation of the line of sightinclination of secular systems, and apply our models illustratively to the 61vir system. we conclude by discussing the observability of planetary systems towhich our method is applicable and we set our analysis into a broader contextby presenting a current summary of the various possibilities for determiningthe physical properties of planets from observations of their orbital states.

1106.6043	kepler exoplanet candidate host stars are preferentially metal rich	we find that kepler exoplanet candidate (ec) host stars are preferentiallymetal-rich, including the low-mass stellar hosts of small-radius ecs. the lastobservation confirms a tentative hint that there is a correlation between themetallicity of low-mass stars and the presence of low-mass and small-radiusexoplanets. in particular, we compare the j-h--g-r color-color distribution ofkepler ec host stars with a control sample of dwarf stars selected from the~150,000 stars observed during q1 and q2 of the kepler mission but with nodetected planets. we find that at j-h = 0.30 characteristic of solar-typestars, the average g-r color of stars that host giant ecs is 4-sigma redderthan the average color of the stars in the control sample. at the same time,the average g-r color of solar-type stars that host small-radius ecs isindistinguishable from the average color of the stars in the control sample. inaddition, we find that at j-h = 0.62 indicative of late k dwarfs, the averageg-r color of stars that host small-radius ecs is 4-sigma redder than theaverage color of the stars in the control sample. these offsets are unlikely tobe caused by differential reddening, age differences between the twopopulations, or the presence of giant stars in the control sample. stellarmodels suggest that the first color offset is due to a 0.2 dex enhancement in[fe/h] of the giant ec host population at m_star = 1 m_sun, while sloanphotometry of m 67 and ngc 6791 suggests that the second color offset is due toa similar [fe/h] enhancement of the small-radius ec host population at m_star =0.7 m_sun. these correlations are a natural consequence of the core-accretionmodel of planet formation.

0711.2106	hydrodynamic simulations of unevenly irradiated jovian planets	we employ a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic model to simulate upperatmospheric dynamics on extrasolar giant planets. our model is well-suited tosimulate the dynamics of the atmospheres of planets with high orbitaleccentricity that are subject to widely-varying irradiation conditions. weidentify six such planets, with eccentricities between $e=0.28$ and $e=0.93$and semimajor axes ranging from $a=0.0508$ a.u. to $a=0.432$ a.u., asparticularly interesting objects for study. for each of these planets, wedetermine the temperature profile and resulting infrared light curves in the8-$\mu$m spitzer bands. especially notable are the results for hd 80606b, whichhas the largest eccentricity ($e=0.9321$) of any known planet, and hat-p-2b,which transits its parent star, so that its physical properties arewell-constrained. despite the variety of orbital parameters, the atmosphericdynamics of these eccentric planets display a number of interesting commonproperties. in all cases, the atmospheric response is primarily driven by theintense irradiation at periastron. the resulting expansion of heated airproduces high-velocity turbulent flow, including long-lived circumpolarvortices. additionally, a superrotating acoustic front develops on someplanets; the strength of this disturbance depends on both the eccentricity andthe temperature gradient resulting from uneven heating. the specifics of theresulting infrared light curves depend strongly on the orbital geometry. weshow, however, that the variations on hd 80606 b and hat-p-2b should be readilydetectable at 4.5 and 8 $\mu$m using the spitzer space telescope. indeed, thesetwo objects present the most attractive observational targets of all knownhigh-$e$ exoplanets.

1302.5084	orbital phase variations of the eccentric giant planet hat-p-2b	we present the first secondary eclipse and phase curve observations for thehighly eccentric hot jupiter hat-p-2b in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 \mu m bandsof the spitzer space telescope. the 3.6 and 4.5 \mu m data sets span an entireorbital period of hat-p-2b, making them the longest continuous phase curveobservations obtained to date and the first full-orbit observations of a planetwith an eccentricity exceeding 0.2. we present an improved non-parametricmethod for removing the intrapixel sensitivity variations in spitzer data at3.6 and 4.5 \mu m that robustly maps position-dependent flux variations. wefind that the peak in planetary flux occurs at 4.39+/-0.28, 5.84+/-0.39, and4.68+/-0.37 hours after periapse passage with corresponding maxima in theplanet/star flux ratio of 0.1138%+/-0.0089%, 0.1162%+/-0.0080%, and0.1888%+/-0.0072% in the 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 \mu m bands respectively. we compareour measured secondary eclipse depths to the predictions from a one-dimensionalradiative transfer model, which suggests the possible presence of a transientday side inversion in hat-p-2b's atmosphere near periapse. we also deriveimproved estimates for the system parameters, including its mass, radius, andorbital ephemeris. our simultaneous fit to the transit, secondary eclipse, andradial velocity data allows us to determine the eccentricity and argument ofperiapse of hat-p-2b's orbit with a greater precision than has been achievedfor any other eccentric extrasolar planet. we also find evidence for along-term linear trend in the radial velocity data. this trend suggests thepresence of another substellar companion in the hat-p-2 system, which couldhave caused hat-p-2b to migrate inward to its present-day orbit via the kozaimechanism.

1408.3650	the random walk of high frequency trading	this paper builds a model of high-frequency equity returns by separatelymodeling the dynamics of trade-time returns and trade arrivals. our maincontributions are threefold. first, we characterize the distributional behaviorof high-frequency asset returns both in ordinary clock time and in trade time.we show that when controlling for pre-scheduled market news events, trade-timereturns of the highly liquid near-month e-mini s&amp;p 500 futures contract arewell characterized by a gaussian distribution at very fine time scales. second,we develop a structured and parsimonious model of clock-time returns bysubordinating a trade-time gaussian distribution with a trade arrival processthat is associated with a modified markov-switching multifractal duration(msmd) model. this model provides an excellent characterization ofhigh-frequency inter-trade durations. over-dispersion in this distribution ofinter-trade durations leads to leptokurtosis and volatility clustering inclock-time returns, even when trade-time returns are gaussian. finally, we useour model to extrapolate the empirical relationship between trade rate andvolatility in an effort to understand conditions of market failure. our modelsuggests that the 1,200 km physical separation of financial markets in chicagoand new york/new jersey provides a natural ceiling on systemic volatility andmay contribute to market stability during periods of extremely heavy trading.

0805.1681	turbulence in extrasolar planetary systems implies that mean motion  resonances are rare	this paper considers the effects of turbulence on mean motion resonances inextrasolar planetary systems and predicts that systems rarely survive in aresonant configuration. a growing number of systems are reported to be inresonance, which is thought to arise from the planet migration process. ifplanets are brought together and moved inward through torques produced bycircumstellar disks, then disk turbulence can act to prevent planets fromstaying in a resonant configuration. this paper studies this process throughnumerical simulations and via analytic model equations, where both approachesinclude stochastic forcing terms due to turbulence. we explore how theamplitude and forcing time intervals of the turbulence affect the maintenanceof mean motion resonances. if turbulence is common in circumstellar disksduring the epoch of planet migration, with the amplitudes indicated by currentmhd simulations, then planetary systems that remain deep in mean motionresonance are predicted to be rare. more specifically, the fraction of resonantsystems that survive over a typical disk lifetime of 1 myr is of order 0.01. ifmean motion resonances are found to be common, their existence would placetight constraints on the amplitude and duty cycle of turbulent fluctuations incircumstellar disks. these results can be combined by expressing the expectedfraction of surviving resonant systems in the approximate form p_b = c /n_{orb}^{1/2}, where the dimensionless parameter c = 10 - 50 and where n_{orb}is the number of orbits for which turbulence is active.

astro-ph;0102126	astronomical engineering: a strategy for modifying planetary orbits	the sun's gradual brightening will seriously compromise the earth's biospherewithin ~ 1e9 years. if earth's orbit migrates outward, however, the biospherecould remain intact over the entire main-sequence lifetime of the sun. in thispaper, we explore the feasibility of engineering such a migration over a longtime period. the basic mechanism uses gravitational assists to (in effect)transfer orbital energy from jupiter to the earth, and thereby enlarges theorbital radius of earth. this transfer is accomplished by a suitableintermediate body, either a kuiper belt object or a main belt asteroid. theobject first encounters earth during an inward pass on its initial highlyelliptical orbit of large (~ 300 au) semimajor axis. the encounter transfersenergy from the object to the earth in standard gravity-assist fashion bypassing close to the leading limb of the planet. the resulting outboundtrajectory of the object must cross the orbit of jupiter; with proper timing,the outbound object encounters jupiter and picks up the energy it lost toearth. with small corrections to the trajectory, or additional planetaryencounters (e.g., with saturn), the object can repeat this process over manyencounters. to maintain its present flux of solar energy, the earth mustexperience roughly one encounter every 6000 years (for an object mass of 1e22g). we develop the details of this scheme and discuss its ramifications.

astro-ph;0308406	type i planetary migration with mhd turbulence	this paper examines how type i planet migration is affected by the presenceof turbulent density fluctuations in the circumstellar disk. for type imigration, the planet does not clear a gap in the disk and its secular motionis driven by torques generated by the wakes it creates in the surrounding diskfluid. mhd turbulence creates additional density perturbations thatgravitationally interact with the planet and can dominate the torques producedby the migration mechanism itself. this paper shows that conventional type imigration can be readily overwhelmed by turbulent perturbations and hence theusual description of type i migration should be modified in locations where themagnetorotational instability is active. in general, the migrating planet doesnot follow a smooth inward trned, but rather exhibits a random walk throughphase space. our main conclusion is that mhd turbulence will alter the timescales for type i planet migration and -- because of chaos -- requires the timescales to be described by a distribution of values.

astro-ph;0310084	detection of intermediate-period transiting planets with a network of  small telescopes: transitsearch.org	we describe a project (transitsearch.org) currently attempting to discovertransiting intermediate-period planets orbiting bright parent stars, and wesimulate that project's performance. the discovery of such a transit would bean important astronomical advance, bridging the critical gap in understandingbetween hd209458b and jupiter. however, the task is made difficult byintrinsically low transit probabilities and small transit duty cycles. thisproject's efficient and economical strategy is to photometrically monitor starsthat are known (from radial velocity surveys) to bear planets, using a networkof widely-spaced observers with small telescopes. these observers, eachindividually capable of precision (1%) differential photometry, monitorcandidates during the time windows in which the radial velocity solutionpredicts a transit if the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees. we usemonte carlo techniques to simulate the performance of this network, performingsimulations with different configurations of observers in order to optimizecoordination of an actual campaign. our results indicate that transitsearch.orgcan reliably rule out or detect planetary transits within the current catalogof known planet-bearing stars. a distributed network of skilled amateurastronomers and small college observatories is a cost-effective method fordiscovering the small number of transiting planets with periods in the range10d &lt; p &lt; 200d that orbit bright (v &lt; 11) stars.

astro-ph;0404383	photoevaporation of circumstellar disks due to external fuv radiation in  stellar aggregates	when stars form in small groups (n = 100 - 500 members), their circumstellardisks are exposed to little euv radiation but a great deal of fuv radiationfrom massive stars in the group. this paper calculates mass loss rates forcircumstellar disks exposed to external fuv radiation. previous work treatedlarge disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius exceedsthe critical radius (supercritical disks) where the sound speed in the fuvheated layer exceeds the escape speed. this paper shows that significant massloss still takes place for subcritical systems. some of the gas extends beyondthe disk edge (above the disk surface) to larger distances where thetemperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. theevaporation rate is a sensitive function of the stellar mass and disk radius,which determine the escape speed, and the external fuv flux, which determinesthe temperature structure of the flow. disks around red dwarfs are readilyevaporated and shrink to disk radii of 15 au on short time scales (10 myr) whenexposed to moderate fuv fields with $g_0$ = 3000. although disks around solartype stars are more durable, these disks shrink to 15 au in 10 myr for intensefuv radiation fields with $g_0$ = 30,000; such fields exist in the central 0.7pc of a cluster with n = 4000 stars. if our solar system formed in the presenceof such strong fuv radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why neptuneand uranus in our solar system are gas poor, whereas jupiter and saturn are gasrich. this mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production ofkuiper belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficientlylarge clusters, such as the hyades, especially for disks associated with lowmass stars.

astro-ph;0510237	the n2k consortium. iv. new temperatures and metallicities for 100,000+  fgk dwarfs	we have created a framework to facilitate the construction of specializedtarget lists for radial velocity surveys that are biased toward stars that (1)possess planets and (2) are easiest to observe with current detectiontechniques. we use a procedure that uniformly estimates fundamental stellarproperties of tycho 2 stars, with errors, using spline functions of broadbandphotometry and proper motion found in hipparcos/tycho 2 and 2mass. we provideestimates of temperature and distance for 2.4 million tycho 2 stars that lacktrigonometric distances. for stars that appear to be fgk dwarfs according toestimated temperature and absolute magnitude, we also derive [fe/h] andidentify unresolved binary systems with mass ratios between 1.25 and 3. ourspline function models are trained on the unique valenti &amp; fischer (2005) set,composed of 1000 dwarfs with precise stellar parameters estimated from hiresspectroscopy. for fgk dwarfs with v photometric error less than 0.05magnitudes, or v &lt; 9, our temperature model gives a one-sigma error of+58.7/-65.9 k and our metallicity model gives a one-sigma error of +0.13/-0.14dex. our estimates of distance and spectral type enable us to isolate 354,822tycho 2 dwarfs, 321,996 of which are absent from hipparcos, with giant andsubgiant contamination at 2.6% and 7.2%, respectively. 2,500 of these fgkdwarfs are bright (v &lt; 9.0) and metal-rich ([fe/h] &gt; 0.2). our metallicityestimates have been used to identify targets for n2k (fischer et al. 2005), alarge-scale radial velocity search for hot jupiters, which has published thedetection of 4 hot jupiters with one transit. the broadband filtering outlinedhere is the first screening tier for n2k; the second tier is a low-resolutionspectroscopy program headed by s.e. robinson (astro-ph/0510150).

astro-ph;0601656	silicon and nickel enrichment in planet-host stars: observations and  implications for the core-accretion theory of planet formation	we present evidence that stars with planets exhibit statistically significantsilicon and nickel enrichment over the general metal-rich population. we alsopresent simulations which predict silicon enhancement of planet hosts withinthe context of the core-accretion hypothesis for giant planet formation.because silicon and oxygen are both alpha elements, [si/fe] traces [o/fe], sothe silicon enhancement in planet hosts predicts that these stars areoxygen-rich as well. we present new numerical simulations of planet formationby core accretion that establish the timescale on which a jovian planet reachesrapid gas accretion, t_rga, as a function of solid surface density sigma_solid:(t_rga / 1 myr) = (sigma_solid / 25.0 g cm^{-2})^{-1.44}. this relation enablesus to construct monte carlo simulations that predict the fraction of star-disksystems that form planets as a function of [fe/h], [si/fe], disk mass, outerdisk radius and disk lifetime. our simulations reproduce both the knownplanet-metallicity correlation and the planet-silicon correlation reported inthis paper. the simulations predict that 16% of solar-type stars formjupiter-mass planets, in agreement with 12% predicted from extrapolation of theobserved planet frequency-semimajor axis distribution. although a simpleinterpretation of core accretion predicts that the planet-silicon correlationshould be much stronger than the planet-nickel correlation, we observe the samedegree of silicon and nickel enhancement in planet hosts. if this resultpersists once more planets have been discovered, it might indicate a complexityin the chemistry of planet formation beyond the simple accumulation of solidsin the core accretion theory.

astro-ph;0604348	the n2k consortium vi: doppler shifts without templates and three new  short-period planets	we present a modification to the iodine cell doppler technique thateliminates the need for an observed stellar template spectrum. for a giventarget star, we iterate toward a synthetic template spectrum beginning with anexisting spectrum of a similar star. we then perturb the shape of thisfirst-guess template to match the program observation of the target star takenthrough an iodine cell. the elimination of a separate template observationsaves valuable telescope time, a feature that is ideally suited for thequick-look strategy employed by the ``next 2000 stars'' (n2k) planet searchprogram. tests using keck/hires spectra indicate that synthetic templates yielda short-term precision of 3 m/s and a long-term, run-to-run precision of 5 m/s.we used this new doppler technique to discover three new planets: a 1.5 mjupplanet in a 2.1375 d orbit around hd 86081; a 0.71 mjup planet in circular,26.73 d orbit around hd 224693; and a saturn-mass planet in an 18.179 d orbitaround hd 33283. the remarkably short period of hd 86081b bridges the gapbetween the extremely short-period planets detected in the ogle survey and the16 doppler-detected hot jupiters (p &lt; 15 d), which have an orbital perioddistribution that piles up at about three days. we have acquired photometricobservations of two of the planetary host stars with the automated photometrictelescopes at fairborn observatory. hd 86081 and hd 224693 both lack detectablebrightness variability on their radial velocity periods, supportingplanetary-reflex motion as the cause of the radial velocity variability. hd86081 shows no evidence of planetary transits in spite of a 17.6% transitprobability.

astro-ph;0606346	effects of secular interactions in extrasolar planetary systems	this paper studies the effects of dynamical interactions among the planets inobserved extrasolar planetary systems, including hypothetical additionalbodies, with a focus on secular perturbations. these interactions cause theeccentricities of the planets to explore a distribution of values over timescales that are long compared to observational time baselines, but shortcompared to the age of the systems. the same formalism determines theeccentricity forcing of hypothetical test bodies (terrestrial planets) in thesesystems and we find which systems allow for potentially habitable planets. suchplanets would be driven to nonzero orbital eccentricity and we derive thedistribution of stellar flux experienced by the planets over the course oftheir orbits. the general relativistic corrections to secular interactiontheory are included in the analysis and such effects are important in systemswith close planets ($\sim$4 day orbits). some extrasolar planetary systems(e.g., upsilon andromedae) can be used as a test of general relativity, whereasin other systems, general relativity can be used to constrain the systemparameters (e.g., $\sin i \gta 0.93$ for hd160691). for the case of hotjupiters, we discuss how the absence of observed eccentricity implies theabsence of companion planets.

astro-ph;0702700	observational consequences of hydrodynamic flows on hot jupiters	we use a grid-based shallow water model to simulate the atmospheric dynamicsof the transiting hot jupiter hd 209458b. under the usual assumption that theplanet is in synchronous rotation with zero obliquity, a steady state isreached with a well-localized cold spot centered 76 degrees east of theantistellar point. this represents a departure from predictions made byprevious simulations in the literature that used the shallow water formalism;we find that the disagreement is explained by the factor of 30 shorterradiative timescale used in our model. we also examine the case that the planetis in cassini state 2, in which the expected obliquity is ~90 degrees. underthese circumstances, a periodic equilibrium is reached, with the temperatureslightly leading the solar forcing. using these temperature distributions, wecalculate disk-integrated bolometric infrared light curves from the planet. thelight curves for the two models are surprisingly similar, despite largedifferences in temperature patterns in the two cases. in the zero-obliquitycase, the intensity at the minimum is 66% of the maximum intensity, with theminimum occuring 72 degrees ahead of transit. in the high-obliquity case, theminimum occurs 54 degrees ahead of transit, with an intensity of 58% of themaximum.

astro-ph;9704125	machos, white dwarfs, and the age of the universe	(abridged abstract) a favored interpretation of recent microlensingmeasurements towards the large magellanic cloud implies that a large fraction(i.e. 10--50%) of the mass of the galactic halo is composed of white dwarfs. wecompare model white dwarf luminosity functions to the data from theobservational surveys in order to determine a lower bound on the age of anysubstantial white dwarf halo population (and hence possibly on the age of theuniverse). we compare various theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions, inwhich we vary hese three parameters, with the abovementioned survey results.  from this comparison, we conclude that if white dwarfs do indeed constitutemore than 10% of the local halo mass density, then the universe must be atleast 10 gyr old for our most extreme allowed values of the parameters. when weuse cooling curves that account for chemical fractionation and more likelyvalues of the imf and the bolometric correction, we find tighter limits: awhite dwarf macho fraction of 10% (30%) requires a minimum age of 14 gyr (15.5gyr). our analysis also indicates that the halo white dwarfs almost certainlyhave helium-dominated atmospheres.
