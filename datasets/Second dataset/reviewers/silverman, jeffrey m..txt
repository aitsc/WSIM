0902.2794	sn 2008ha: an extremely low luminosity and extremely low energy  supernova	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well asoptical spectra of the peculiar supernova (sn) 2008ha. sn 2008ha had a very lowpeak luminosity, reaching only m_v = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only~2000 km/s near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy perunit mass of ejecta. spectroscopically, sn 2008ha is a member of the sn2002cx-like class of sne, a peculiar subclass of sne ia; however, sn 2008ha isthe most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower linevelocities than the typical member, which is already ~2 mag fainter and hasline velocities ~5000 km/s smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal snia. sn 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantlyshorter than either sn 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal sne ia (~19.5days). the bolometric light curve of sn 2008ha indicates that sn 2008ha peakedat l_peak = (9.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^40 ergs/s, making sn 2008ha perhaps the leastluminous sn ever observed. from its peak luminosity and rise time, we inferthat sn 2008ha generated (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3 m_sun of 56ni, had a kineticenergy of ~2 x 10^48 ergs, and ejected 0.15 m_sun of material. we classifythree new (and one potential) members of the sn 2002cx-like class, expandingthe sample to 14 (and one potential) members. the host-galaxy morphologydistribution of the class is consistent with that of sne ia, ib, ic, and ii.several models for generating low-luminosity sne can explain the observationsof sn 2008ha; however, if a single model is to describe all sn 2002cx-likeobjects, either electron capture in ne-mg white dwarfs causing a core collapse,or deflagration of c-o white dwarfs with sn 2008ha being a partial deflagrationand not unbinding the progenitor star, are preferred. abridged.

0906.2200	spectral evolution of the extraordinary type iin supernova 2006gy	we present a detailed analysis of the extremely luminous type iin supernovasn2006gy using spectra obtained between days 36 and 237 after explosion. wederive the temporal evolution of the effective temperature, radius, expansionspeeds, and bolometric luminosity, as well as the progenitor wind density andtotal swept-up mass overtaken by the shock. sn2006gy can be interpreted in thecontext of shock interaction with a dense csm, but with quite extreme valuesfor the csm mass of 20 msun and an explosion kinetic energy of at least 5e51erg. a key difference between sn2006gy and other sneiin is that, owing to itslarge csm mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. at earlytimes, h-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, andphotons diffuse out through the opaque csm. the pivotal transition to opticallythin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in theblackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell. from theevolution of pre-shock velocities, we deduce that the csm was ejected by theprogenitor in a 1e49 erg precursor event 8yr before explosion. the large csmmass rules out models involving stars with initial masses around 10msun. withthe full mass budget, even massive m_zams=30-40 msun progenitor stars areinadequate. at roughly solar metallicity, substantial mass loss probablyoccurred during the star's life, so sn 2006gy's progenitor is more consistentwith lbv eruptions or pulsational pair-instability ejections in stars withinitial masses above 100 msun. this requires significant revision to currentparadigms of massive-star evolution.

0907.1083	variable sodium absorption in a low-extinction type ia supernova	recent observations have revealed that some type ia supernovae exhibitnarrow, time-variable na i d absorption features. the origin of the absorbingmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gasin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implicationsfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. we present the third detection ofsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopyof the type ia supernova sn 2007le from keck and the het. the data span ~3months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. we find thatone component of the na d absorption lines strengthened significantly withtime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. thechanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier timeswhen the uv flux from the sn peaks. as with sn 2006x, we detect no change inthe ca ii h&amp;k lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effectsimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.unlike the previous two sne exhibiting variable absorption, sn 2007le is nothighly reddened (e_b-v = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar ratherthan interstellar absorption. photoionization models show that the data areconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pcfrom the explosion. these results broadly support the single-degeneratescenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass lossfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellargas. we also present tentative evidence for narrow halpha emission associatedwith the sn, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.[abridged]

0707.0393	supernovae in the subaru deep field: an initial sample, and type ia  rate, out to redshift 1.6	large samples of high-redshift supernovae (sne) are potentially powerfulprobes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and sn physics. we presentinitial results from a new deep sn survey, based on re-imaging in the r, i', z'bands, of the 0.25 deg2 subaru deep field (sdf), with the 8.2-m subarutelescope and suprime-cam. in a single new epoch consisting of two nights ofobservations, we have discovered 33 candidate sne, down to a z'-band magnitudeof 26.3 (ab). we have measured the photometric redshifts of the sn hostgalaxies, obtained keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,and classified the sne using the bayesian photometric algorithm of poznanski etal. (2007) that relies on template matching. after correcting for biases in theclassification, 55% of our sample consists of type ia supernovae and 45% ofcore-collapse sne. the redshift distribution of the sne ia reaches z ~ 1.6,with a median of z ~ 1.2. the core-collapse sne reach z ~ 1.0, with a median ofz ~ 0.5. our sn sample is comparable to the hubble space telescope/goods sampleboth in size and redshift range. the redshift distributions of the sne in thesdf and in goods are consistent, but there is a trend (which requiresconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z sne ia in the sdf. thistrend is also apparent when comparing the sn ia rates we derive to those basedon goods data. our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift thatcould be tracking the star-formation rate. additional epochs on this field,already being obtained, will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds, anddetermine whether or not there is a decline in the sn ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

0908.0003	the lick agn monitoring project: broad-line region radii and black hole  masses from reverberation mapping of hbeta	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun and also the well-studied nearby activegalactic nucleus (agn) ngc 5548. nine of the objects in the sample (includingngc 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during themonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between thecontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broadhbeta emission. we present here the light curves for the objects in this sampleand the subsequent hbeta time lags for the nine objects where thesemeasurements were possible. the hbeta lag time is directly related to the sizeof the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured widthof the hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determinethe virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine agns. theabsolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalizationderived by onken et al. we also examine the time lag response as a function ofvelocity across the hbeta line profile for six of the agns. the analysis offour leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function ofvelocity. however, sbs 1116+583a exhibits a symmetric time lag response aroundthe line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-lineregion (blr) clouds, and arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is mosteasily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. further investigationwill be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical modelsof the blr by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.

0909.4792	discovery of precursor lbv outbursts in two recent optical transients:  the fitfully variable missing links ugc 2773-ot and sn 2009ip	we present progenitor-star detections, light curves, and optical spectra ofsn2009ip and the 2009 optical transient in ugc2773 (u2773-ot), which were notgenuine sne. precursor variability in the decade before outburst indicates thatboth of the progenitor stars were lbvs. their pre-outburst light curvesresemble the s doradus phases that preceded giant eruptions of eta carinae andsn1954j (v12 in ngc2403), with intermediate progenitor luminosities. hstdetections a decade before discovery indicate that the sn2009ip and u2773-otprogenitors were supergiants with likely initial masses of 50-80 msun and$\ga$20 msun, respectively. both outbursts had spectra befitting known lbvs,although in different physical states. sn 2009ip exhibited a hot lbv spectrumwith characteristic speeds of 550 km/s, plus faster material up to 5000 km/s,resembling the slow homunculus and fast blast wave of eta carinae. u2773-otshows a forest of narrow absorption and emission lines comparable to that of sdor in its cool state, plus [caii] emission and an ir excess indicative ofdust, similar to sn2008s and n300-ot. [caii] emission is probably tied to adusty pre-outburst environment, and not the outburst mechanism. sn2009ip andu2773-ot may provide a critical link between historical lbv eruptions, whileu2773-ot may provide a link between lbvs and sn2008s and n300-ot. futuresearches will uncover more examples of precursor lbv variability of this kind,providing key clues that may help unravel the instability driving lbvs.

0912.0263	sn 2006bt: a perplexing, troublesome, and possibly misleading type ia  supernova	sn 2006bt displays characteristics unlike those of any other known type iasupernova (sn ia). we present optical light curves and spectra of sn 2006btwhich demonstrate the peculiar nature of this object. sn 2006bt has broad,slowly declining light curves indicative of a hot, high-luminosity sn, butlacks a prominent second maximum in the i band as do low-luminosity sne ia. itsspectra are similar to those of low-luminosity sne ia, containing features thatare only present in cool sn photospheres. light-curve fitting methods suggestthat sn 2006bt is reddened by a significant amount of dust; however, itoccurred in the outskirts of its early-type host galaxy and has no strong na dabsorption in any of its spectra, suggesting a negligible amount of host-galaxydust absorption. c ii is possibly detected in our pre-maximum spectra, but at amuch lower velocity than other elements. the progenitor was likely very old,being a member of the halo population of a galaxy that shows no signs of recentstar formation. sne ia have been very successfully modeled as a one-parameterfamily, and this is fundamental to their use as cosmological distanceindicators. sn 2006bt is a challenge to that picture, yet its relatively normallight curves allowed sn 2006bt to be included in cosmological analyses. wegenerate mock sn ia datasets which indicate that contamination by similarobjects will both increase the scatter of a sn ia hubble diagram andsystematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters. however, spectraand rest-frame i-band light curves should provide a definitive way to identifyand eliminate such objects.

0912.2465	large late-time asphericities in three type iip supernovae	type ii-plateau supernovae (sne iip) are the results of the explosions of redsupergiants and are the most common subclass of core-collapse supernovae. pastobservations have shown that the outer layers of the ejecta of sne iip arelargely spherical, but the degree of asphericity increases toward the core. wepresent evidence for high degrees of asphericity in the inner cores of threerecent sne iip (sne 2006my, 2006ov, and 2007aa), as revealed by late-timeoptical spectropolarimetry. the three objects were all selected to have verylow interstellar polarization (isp), which minimizes the uncertainties in ispremoval and allows us to use the continuum polarization as a tracer ofasphericity. the three objects have intrinsic continuum polarizations in therange of 0.83-1.56% in observations taken after the end of the photometricplateau, with the polarization dropping to almost zero at the wavelengths ofstrong emission lines. our observations of sn 2007aa at earlier times, taken onthe photometric plateau, show contrastingly smaller continuum polarizations(~0.1%). the late-time h-alpha and [o i] line profiles of sn 2006ov providefurther evidence for asphericities in the inner ejecta. such high corepolarizations in very ordinary core-collapse supernovae provide furtherevidence that essentially all core-collapse supernova explosions are highlyaspherical, even if the outer parts of the ejecta show only small deviationsfrom spherical symmetry.

0708.0140	optical and near-infrared observations of the highly reddened, rapidly  expanding type ia supernova 2006x in m100	we present extensive optical (ubvri), near-infrared (jk) light curves andoptical spectroscopy of the type ia supernova (sn) 2006x in the nearby galaxyngc 4321 (m100). our observations suggest that either sn 2006x has anintrinsically peculiar color evolution, or it is highly reddened [e(b -v)_{host} = 1.42+/-0.04 mag] with r_v = 1.48+/-0.06, much lower than thecanonical value of 3.1 for the average galactic dust. sn 2006x also has one ofthe highest expansion velocities ever published for a sn ia. compared with theother sne ia we analyzed, sn 2006x has a broader light curve in the u band, amore prominent bump/shoulder feature in the v and r bands, a more pronouncedsecondary maximum in the i and near-infrared bands, and a remarkably smallerlate-time decline rate in the b band. the b - v color evolution shows anobvious deviation from the lira-phillips relation at 1 to 3 months aftermaximum brightness. at early times, optical spectra of sn 2006x displayedstrong, high-velocity features of both intermediate-mass elements (si, ca, ands) and iron-peak elements, while at late times they showed a relatively bluecontinuum, consistent with the blue u-b and b-v colors at similar epochs. alight echo and/or the interaction of the sn ejecta and its circumstellarmaterial may provide a plausible explanation for its late-time photometric andspectroscopic behavior. using the cepheid distance of m100, we derive a hubbleconstant of 72.7+/-8.2 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}(statistical) from the normalizeddereddened luminosity of sn 2006x. we briefly discuss whether abnormal dust isa universal signature for all sne ia, and whether the most rapidly expandingobjects form a subclass with distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1010.3718	luminous blue variable eruptions and related transients: diversity of  progenitors and outburst properties	we present new light curves and spectra for a number of extragalactic opticaltransients or "sn impostors" related to giant eruptions of lbvs, and we providea comparative discussion of lbv-like giant eruptions known to date. new datainclude photometry and spectroscopy of sne1999bw, 2000ch, 2001ac, 2002bu,2006bv, and 2010dn. sn2010dn resembles sn2008s and ngc 300-ot, whereas sn2002bushows spectral evolution from a normal lbv at early times to a twin of thesecooler transients at late times. sn2008s, ngc300-ot, and sn2010dn appear to bespecial cases of a broader eruptive phenomenon where the progenitor star wasenshrouded by dust. examining the full sample, sn impostors have range oftimescales from a day to decades, potentially suffering multiple eruptions. theupper end of the luminosity distribution overlaps with the least luminous sne.the low end of the luminosity distribution is poorly defined, and a distinctionbetween various eruptions is not entirely clear. we discuss observational cluesconcerning winds or shocks as the relevant mass-loss mechanism, and we evaluatepossible ideas for physical mechanisms. although examples of these eruptionsare sufficient to illustrate their diversity, their statistical distributionwill benefit greatly from upcoming transient surveys. based on the distributionof eruptions, we propose that sn1961v was not a member of this class ofimpostors, but was instead a true core-collapse sniin preceded by a giant lbveruption.

1011.2063	evidence for an fu orionis-like outburst from a classical t tauri star	we present pre- and post-outburst observations of the new fu orionis-likeyoung stellar object ptf 10qpf (also known as lkha 188-g4 and hbc 722). priorto this outburst, lkha 188-g4 was classified as a classical t tauri star on thebasis of its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a k8-typephotosphere, and its photometric variability. the mid-infrared spectral indexof lkha 188-g4 indicates a class ii-type object. lkha 188-g4 exhibited a steadyrise by ~1 mag over ~11 months starting in aug. 2009, before a subsequent moreabrupt rise of &gt; 3 mag on a time scale of ~2 months. observations taken duringthe eruption exhibit the defining characteristics of fu orionis variables: (i)an increase in brightness by &gt; 4 mag, (ii) a bright optical/near-infraredreflection nebula appeared, (iii) optical spectra are consistent with a gsupergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being halphawhich is characterized by a p cygni profile, (iv) near-infrared spectraresemble those of late k--m giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen inthe molecular bands of co and h_2o, and (v) outflow signatures in h and he areseen in the form of blueshifted absorption profiles. lkha 188-g4 is the firstmember of the fu orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infraredspectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. the association of theptf 10qpf outburst with the previously identified classical t tauri star lkha188-g4 (hbc 722) provides strong evidence that fu orionis-like eruptionsrepresent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered byinstabilities in the disk. the early identification of ptf 10qpf as an fuorionis-like variable will enable detailed photometric and spectroscopicobservations during its post-outburst evolution for comparison with other knownoutbursting objects.

1011.4150	a massive progenitor of the luminous type iin supernova 2010jl	the bright, nearby, recently discovered supernova sn2010jl is a member of therare class of relatively luminous type~iin events. here we report archival hstobservations of its host galaxy ugc5189a taken roughly 10yr prior to explosion,as well as early-time optical spectra of the sn. the hst images reveal abright, blue point source at the position of the sn, with an absolute magnitudeof -12.0 in the f300w filter. if it is not just a chance alignment, the sourceat the sn position could be (1) a massive young (less than 6 myr) star clusterin which the sn resided, (2) a quiescent, luminous blue star with an apparenttemperature around 14,000k, (3) a star caught during a bright outburst akin tothose of lbvs, or (4) a combination of option 1 and options 2 or 3. although wecannot confidently choose between these possibilities with the present data,any of them imply that the progenitor of sn2010jl had an initial mass above30msun. this reinforces mounting evidence that many sne iin result from verymassive stars, that massive stars can produce visible sne without collapsingquietly to black holes, and that massive stars can retain their h envelopesuntil shortly before explosion. standard stellar evolution models fail toaccount for these observed properties.

1101.1298	peculiar type ii supernovae from blue supergiants	the vast majority of type ii supernovae (sne) are produced by red supergiants(rsgs), but sn 1987a revealed that blue supergiants (bsgs) can produce membersof this class as well, albeit with some peculiar properties. this best studiedevent revolutionized our understanding of sne, and linking it to the bulk oftype ii events is essential. we present here optical photometry andspectroscopy gathered for sn 2000cb, which is clearly not a standard type ii snand yet is not a sn 1987a analog. the light curve of sn 2000cb is reminiscentof that of sn 1987a in shape, with a slow rise to a late optical peak, but onsubstantially different time scales. spectroscopically, sn 2000cb resembles anormal sn ii but with ejecta velocities that far exceed those measured for sn1987a or normal sne ii, above 18000 km/s for h-alpha at early times. the redcolours, high velocities, late photometric peak, and our modeling of thisobject all point toward a scenario involving the high-energy explosion of asmall-radius star, most likely a bsg, producing 0.1 solar masses of ni-56.adding a similar object to the sample, sn 2005ci, we derive a rate of about 2%of the core-collapse rate for this loosely defined class of bsg explosions.

0709.1472	constraints on circumstellar material around the type ia supernova  2007af	patat et al. recently inferred the existence of circumstellar material arounda normal type ia supernova (sn) for the first time, finding time-variable na id absorption lines in the spectrum of sn 2006x. we present high-resolutionspectroscopy of the bright sn ia 2007af at three epochs and search forvariability in any of the na d absorption components. over the time range from4 days before to 24 days after maximum light, we find that the host-galaxy na dlines appear to be of interstellar rather than circumstellar origin and do notvary down to the level of 18 ma (column density of 2 x 10^11 cm^-2). we limitany circumstellar absorption lines to be weaker than ~10 ma (6 x 10^10 cm^-2).for the case of material distributed in spherically symmetric shells of radius~10^16 cm surrounding the progenitor system, we place an upper limit on theshell mass of ~(3 x 10^-8)/x msun, where x is the na ionization fraction. wealso show that sn 2007af is a photometrically and spectroscopically normal snia. assuming that the variable na d lines in sn 2006x came from circumstellarmatter, we therefore conclude that either there is a preferred geometry for thedetection of variable absorption components in type ia supernovae, or sn 2007afand sn 2006x had different types of progenitor systems.

1103.0779	ptf10iya: a short-lived, luminous flare from the nuclear region of a  star-forming galaxy	we present the discovery and characterisation of ptf10iya, a short-lived (dt~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (m_g ~ -21mag) transient source found by the palomar transient factory. theultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by ablackbody with t ~ 1-2 x 10^4 k and peak bolometric luminosity l_bb ~ 1-5 x10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). acomparable amount of energy is radiated in the x-ray band that appears toresult from a distinct physical process. the location of ptf10iya is consistentwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than1.2 kpc. at first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of thecharacteristic "big blue bump" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of manyactive galactic nuclei (agns). however, emission-line diagnostics of the hostgalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show noevidence for agn-like activity. we therefore consider whether the tidaldisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole mayaccount for our observations. though with limited temporal information,ptf10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early"super-eddington" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 m_sun blackhole. regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, thelarge luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxiescan transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the eddington limit; many suchoutbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

1104.5012	a spitzer survey for dust in type iin supernovae	recent observations suggest that type iin supernovae (sne iin) may exhibitlate-time (&gt;100 days) infrared (ir) emission from warm dust more than othertypes of core-collapse sne. mid-ir observations, which span the peak of thethermal spectral energy distribution, provide useful constraints on theproperties of the dust and, ultimately, the circumstellar environment,explosion mechanism, and progenitor system. due to the low sn iin rate (&lt;10% ofall core-collapse sne), few ir observations exist for this subclass. thehandful of isolated studies, however, show late-time ir emission from warm dustthat, in some cases, extends for five or six years post-discovery. whileprevious spitzer/irac surveys have searched for dust in sne, none have targetedthe type iin subclass. this article presents results from a warm spitzer/iracsurvey of the positions of all 68 known sne iin within a distance of 250 mpcbetween 1999 and 2008 that have remained unobserved by spitzer more than 100days post-discovery. the detection of late-time emission from ten targets(~15%) nearly doubles the database of existing mid-ir observations of sne iin.although optical spectra show evidence for new dust formation in some cases,the data show that in most cases the likely origin of the mid-ir emission ispre-existing dust, which is continuously heated by optical emission generatedby ongoing circumstellar interaction between the forward shock andcircumstellar medium. furthermore, an emerging trend suggests that these snedecline at ~1000--2000 days post-discovery once the forward shock overruns thedust shell. the mass-loss rates associated with these dust shells areconsistent with luminous blue variable (lbv) progenitors.

1106.2897	the progenitor of supernova 2011dh/ptf11eon in messier 51	we have identified a luminous star at the position of supernova (sn)2011dh/ptf11eon, in pre-sn archival, multi-band images of the nearby, nearlyface-on galaxy messier 51 (m51) obtained by the hubble space telescope with theadvanced camera for surveys. this identification has been confirmed, to thehighest available astrometric precision, using a keck-ii adaptive-optics image.the available early-time spectra and photometry indicate that the sn is astripped-envelope, core-collapse type iib, with a more compact progenitor(radius ~1e11 cm) than was the case for the well-studied sn iib 1993j. we inferthat the extinction to sn 2011dh and its progenitor arises from a low galacticforeground contribution, and that the sn environment is of roughly solarmetallicity. the detected object has absolute magnitude m_v^0 ~ -7.7 andeffective temperature ~6000 k. the star's radius, ~1e13 cm, is more extendedthan what has been inferred for the sn progenitor. we speculate that thedetected star is either an unrelated star very near the position of the actualprogenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor's companion in a mass-transferbinary system. the position of the detected star in a hertzsprung-russelldiagram is consistent with an initial mass of 17--19 msun. the light of thisstar could easily conceal, even in the ultraviolet, the presence of a stripped,compact, very hot (~1e5 k), nitrogen-rich wolf-rayet star progenitor.

1108.2869	systematic blueshift of line profiles in the type iin supernova 2010jl:  evidence for post-shock dust formation?	type iin sne show spectral evidence for strong interaction between theirblast wave and dense circumstellar material (csm) around the progenitor star.sn2010jl was the brightest core-collapse sn in 2010, and it was a type iinexplosion with strong csm interaction. andrews et al. recently reportedevidence for an ir excess in sn2010jl, indicating either new dust formation orthe heating of csm dust in an ir echo. here we report multi-epoch spectra ofsn2010jl that reveal the tell-tale signature of new dust formation:emission-line profiles becoming systematically more blueshifted as the red sideof the line is blocked by increasing extinction. the effect is seen clearly inthe intermediate-width (400--4000 km/s) component of h$\alpha$ beginningroughly 30d after explosion. moreover, we present near-ir spectra demonstratingthat the asymmetry in the hydrogen-line profiles is wavelength dependent,appearing more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. this evidence suggests thatnew dust grains had formed quickly in the post-shock shell of sn 2010jl arisingfrom csm interaction. since the observed dust temperature has been attributedto an ir echo and not to new dust, either (1) ir excess emission at $\lambda &lt;5 \mu$m is not a particularly sensitive tracer of new dust formation in sne, or(2) some assumptions about expected dust temperatures might require furtherstudy. lastly, we discuss one possible mechanism other than dust that mightlead to increasingly blueshifted line profiles in sneiin, although thewavelength dependence of the asymmetry argues against this hypothesis in thecase of sn2010jl.

1109.1593	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe/ptf11kly	type ia supernovae (sne) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology,owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship betweenlight-curve shape and peak brightness. the precision distance measurementsenabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe,now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of amysterious "dark" energy. general consensus holds that type ia sne result fromthermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (wd) in a binary system; however,little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physicalproperties of the progenitor system. here we make use of extensive historicalimaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, the closest sn iadiscovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-lightluminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits onother sn ia progenitors. this directly rules out luminous red giants and thevast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the explodingwhite dwarf. any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than3.5 times the mass of the sun. these observations favour a scenario where theexploding wd of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, accreted matter either from another wd, orby roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1208.5900	discovery and early multi-wavelength measurements of the energetic type  ic supernova ptf12gzk: a massive-star explosion in a dwarf host galaxy	we present the discovery and extensive early-time observations of the type icsupernova (sn) ptf12gzk. our finely sampled light curves show a rise of 0.8magwithin 2.5hr. power-law fits [f(t)\sim(t-t_0)^n] to these data constrain theexplosion date to within one day. we cannot rule out the expected quadraticfireball model, but higher values of n are possible as well for larger areas inthe fit parameter space. our bolometric light curve and a dense spectralsequence are used to estimate the physical parameters of the exploding star andof the explosion. we show that the photometric evolution of ptf12gzk is slowerthan that of most sne ic, and its high ejecta velocities (~30,000km/s four daysafter explosion) are closer to the observed velocities of broad-lined sne icassociated with gamma-ray bursts (grbs) than to the observed velocities innormal type ic sne. the high velocities are sustained through the sn earlyevolution, and are similar to those of grb-sne when the sn reach peakmagnitude. by comparison with the spectroscopically similar sn 2004aw, wesuggest that the observed properties of ptf12gzk indicate an initial progenitormass of 25-35 solar mass and a large (5-10e51 erg) kinetic energy, close to theregime of grb-sn properties. the host-galaxy characteristics are consistentwith grb-sn hosts, and not with normal sn ic hosts as well, yet this sn doesnot show the broad lines over extended periods of time that are typical ofbroad-line type ic sne.

1209.0821	sn 2011ht: confirming a class of interacting supernovae with plateau  light curves (type iin-p)	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the type iin supernova (sn) 2011ht,identified previously as a sn impostor. the light curve exhibits an abrupttransition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau to a steep bolometric decline.leading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits signs ofinteraction with circumstellar material (csm), in the form of relatively narrowp-cygni features of h i and he i superimposed on broad lorentzian wings. forthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening p-cygniprofiles of fe ii, ca ii, and h-alpha. by day 147, after the plateau has ended,the sn entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbiddentransitions of [o i], [o ii], and [ca ii] over a weak continuum. at this stage,the light curve exhibits a low luminosity that is comparable to thatsub-luminous type ii-p supernovae, and a relatively fast visual-wavelengthdecline that is significantly steeper than the co-56 decay rate. however, thetotal bolometric decline, including the ir luminosity, is consistent with co-56decay, and implies a low ni-56 mass of ~0.01 m(sun). we therefore characterizesn 2011ht as a bona-fide core-collapse sn very similar to the peculiar sne iin1994w and 2009kn. these three sne define a subclass, which are type iin basedon their spectrum, but that also exhibit well-defined plateaus and produce lowni-56 yields. we therefore suggest type iin-p as a name for this subclass.possible progenitors of sne iin-p, consistent with the available data, include8-10 m(sun) stars, which undergo core collapse as a result of electron captureafter a brief phase of enhanced mass loss, or more massive m&gt;25 m(sun)progenitors, which experience substantial fallback of the metal-richradioactive ejecta. in either case, the energy radiated by these three sneduring their plateau must be dominated by csm interaction (abridged).

1209.6320	the unprecedented 2012 outburst of sn 2009ip: a luminous blue variable  becomes a true supernova	some reports of supernova (sn) discoveries turn out not to be truecore-collapse explosions. one such case was sn 2009ip, which was recognized tobe a luminous blue variable (lbv) eruption. this source had a massive hotprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence ofpre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2ndoutburst in 2010. this same source rebrightened again in 2012, and earlyspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting anotherlbv-like eruption. we present new photometry and spectroscopy of sn 2009ip,indicating that it has transitioned into a true sn. the most striking discoveryin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited balmerlines with very broad p-cygni profiles characteristic of normal type iisupernovae (sne ii), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in sne iin andlbvs. emission components have fwhm 8000 km/s, while the p-cygni absorptioncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. these velocities aretypical of sne ii, but have never been associated with emission lines from anonterminal lbv-like eruption. initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemedfainter than that of normal sne. however, after a brief period of fading, thesource quickly brightened again to m_r=-17.5 mag over a couple days. the broadlines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the earlyoptically thick phases of sne iin. two weeks later the source leveled off near-18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum asthe source faded. we conclude that the 2012 outburst of sn 2009ip was theresult of a true core-collapse sn iin that occured when the progenitor star wasin an lbv-like outburst phase, and where the sn was initially faint and thenrapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged).

1210.0020	late time radio emission from x-ray selected tidal disruption events	we present new observations with the karl g. jansky very large array of sevenx-ray-selected tidal disruption events (tdes). the radio observations werecarried out between 9 and 22 years after the initial x-ray discovery, and,thus, probe the late-time formation of relativistic jets and jet interactionswith the interstellar medium in these systems. we detect a compact radio sourcein the nucleus of the galaxy ic 3599 and a compact radio source that is apossible counterpart to rx j1420.4+5334. we find no radio counterparts for fiveother sources with flux density upper limits between 51 and 200 microjy (3sigma). if the detections truly represent late radio emission associated with atde, then our results suggest that a fraction &gt;~ 10% of x-ray-detected tdes areaccompanied by relativistic jets. we explore several models for producing lateradio emission, including interaction of the jet with gas in the circumnuclearenvironment (blast wave model), and emission from the core of the jet itself.upper limits on the radio flux density from archival observations suggest thatthe jet formation may have been delayed for years after the tde, possiblytriggered by the accretion rate dropping below a critical threshold of ~10^{-2} -- 10^{-3} mdot_edd. the non-detections are also consistent with thisscenario; deeper radio observations can determine whether relativistic jets arepresent in these systems. the emission from rx j1420.4+5334 is also consistentwith the predictions of the blast wave model, however the radio emission fromic 3599 is substantially underluminous, and its spectral slope is too flat,relative to the blast wave model expectations. future radio monitoring of ic3599 and rx j1420.4+5334 will help to better constrain the nature of the jetsin these systems.

1303.7234	late-time spectral observations of the strongly interacting type ia  supernova ptf11kx	ptf11kx was a type ia supernova (sn ia) that showed time-variable absorptionfeatures, including saturated ca ii h&amp;k lines that weakened and eventually wentinto emission. the strength of the emission component of h{\alpha} increased,implying that the sn was undergoing significant interaction with itscircumstellar medium (csm). these features were blueshifted slightly and showeda p-cygni profile, likely indicating that the csm was directly related to, andprobably previously ejected by, the progenitor system itself. these and otherobservations led dilday et al. (2012) to conclude that ptf11kx came from asymbiotic nova progenitor like rs oph. in this work we extend the spectralcoverage of ptf11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. thesespectra of ptf11kx are dominated by h{\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000km/s), strong ca ii emission features (~10,000 km/s wide), and a blue"quasi-continuum" due to many overlapping narrow lines of fe ii. emission fromoxygen, he i, and balmer lines higher than h{\alpha} is weak or completelyabsent at all epochs, leading to large observed h{\alpha}/h{\beta} intensityratios. the broader (~2000 km/s) h{\alpha} emission appears to increase instrength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently decreases significantly alongwith the ca ii emission. our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility ofnewly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the redwing of h{\alpha}. during the same epochs, multiple narrow emission featuresfrom the csm temporally vary in strength. the weakening of the h{\alpha} and caii emission at late times is possible evidence that the sn ejecta haveovertaken the majority of the csm and agrees with models of other stronglyinteracting sne ia. the varying narrow emission features, on the other hand,may indicate that the csm is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells.

1304.0248	late-time circumstellar interaction in a spitzer selected sample of type  iin supernovae	type iin supernovae (sne iin) are a rare (&lt; 10%) subclass of core-collapsesne that exhibit relatively narrow emission lines from a dense, pre-existingcircumstellar medium (csm). in 2009, a warm spitzer survey observed 30 sne iindiscovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 sne at distances out to 175 mpc withunreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 yearspost-discovery. for this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggestthe presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/x-ray emissioncontinuously generated by ongoing csm interaction. here we presentmulti-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 sne iin and thewell-studied type iin sn 2010jl. a recent epoch of spitzer observations revealsongoing mid-infrared emission from nine of the sne in this sample. we alsodetect three of the sne in archival wise data, in addition to sne 1987a,2004dj, and 2008iy. for at least five of the sne in the sample, optical and/orx-ray emission confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing csminteraction. the two spitzer nondetections are consistent with the forwardshock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places upperlimits on the dust-shell size. the optical and infrared observations confirmthe radiative heating model and constrain a number of model parameters,including progenitor mass-loss characteristics. all of the sne in this sampleexperienced an outburst on the order of tens to hundreds of years prior to thesn explosion followed by periods of less intense mass loss. although allevidence points to massive progenitors, the variation in the data highlightsthe diversity in sn iin progenitor evolution. while these observations do notidentify a particular progenitor system, they demonstrate that future,coordinated, multi-wavelength campaigns can constrain theoretical mass-lossmodels.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1304.4236	discovery of a cosmological, relativistic outburst via its rapidly  fading optical emission	we report the discovery by the palomar transient factory (ptf) of thetransient source ptf11agg, which is distinguished by three primarycharacteristics: (1) bright, rapidly fading optical transient emission; (2) afaint, blue quiescent optical counterpart; and (3) an associated year-long,scintillating radio transient. we argue that these observed properties areinconsistent with any known class of galactic transients, and instead suggest acosmological origin. the detection of incoherent radio emission at suchdistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence ofrelativistic ejecta. the observed properties are all consistent with thepopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), marking the first timesuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of ahigh-energy trigger. we searched for possible high-energy counterparts toptf11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. we thereforeconsider three possible scenarios to account for a grb-like afterglow without ahigh-energy counterpart: an "untriggered" grb (lack of satellite coverage), an"orphan" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a "dirty fireball" (suppressedhigh-energy emission). the observed optical and radio light curves appearinconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglowmodels. the simplest explanation, then, is that ptf11agg is a normal, on-axislong-duration grb for which the associated high-energy emission was simplymissed. however, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitousdiscovery by ptf and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). while notdefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that ptf11agg may represent a new, morecommon (&gt; 4 times the on-axis grb rate at 90% confidence) class of relativisticoutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.

(2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1406.2828	optical observations of the type ic supernova 2007gr in ngc 1058 and  implications for the properties of its progenitor	we present extensive optical observations of the normal type ic supernova(sn) 2007gr, spanning from about one week before maximum light to more than oneyear thereafter. the optical light and color curves of sn 2007gr are verysimilar to those of the broad-lined type ic sn 2002ap, but the spectra showremarkable differences. the optical spectra of sn 2007gr are characterized byunusually narrow lines, prominent carbon lines, and slow evolution of the linevelocity after maximum light. the earliest spectrum (taken at t=-8 days) showsa possible signature of helium (he~i 5876 at a velocity of ~19,000 km s{-1}).moreover, the larger intensity ratio of the [o i] 6300 and 6364 lines inferredfrom the early nebular spectra implies a lower opacity of the ejecta shortlyafter the explosion. these results indicate that sn 2007gr perhaps underwent aless energetic explosion of a smaller-mass wolf-rayet star (~ 8--9 msun) in abinary system, as favored by an analysis of the progenitor environment throughpre-explosion and post-explosion hubble space telescope images. in the nebularspectra, asymmetric double-peaked profiles can be seen in the [o~i] 6300 andmg~i] 4571 lines. we suggest that the two peaks are contributed by theblueshifted and rest-frame components. the similarity in velocity structure andthe different evolution of the strength of the two components favor anaspherical explosion with the ejecta distributed in a torus or disk-likegeometry, but inside the ejecta the o and mg have different distributions.

1408.1430	exploring the spectral diversity of low-redshift type ia supernovae  using the palomar transient factory	we present an investigation of the optical spectra of 264 low-redshift (z &lt;0.2) type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the palomar transient factory,an untargeted transient survey. we focus on velocity and pseudo-equivalentwidth measurements of the si ii 4130, 5972, and 6355 a lines, as well those ofthe ca ii near-infrared (nir) triplet, up to +5 days relative to the sn b-bandmaximum light. we find that a high-velocity component of the ca ii nir tripletis needed to explain the spectrum in ~95 per cent of sne ia observed before -5days, decreasing to ~80 per cent at maximum. the average velocity of the ca iihigh-velocity component is ~8500 km/s higher than the photospheric component.we confirm previous results that sne ia around maximum light with a largercontribution from the high-velocity component relative to the photosphericcomponent in their ca ii nir feature have, on average, broader light curves andlower ca ii nir photospheric velocities. we find that these relations aredriven by both a stronger high-velocity component and a weaker contributionfrom the photospheric ca ii nir component in broader light curve sne ia. weidentify the presence of c ii in very-early-time sn ia spectra (before -10days), finding that &gt;40 per cent of sne ia observed at these phases show signsof unburnt material in their spectra, and that c ii features are more likely tobe found in sne ia having narrower light curves.

1408.2651	twins for life? a comparative analysis of the type ia supernovae 2011fe  and 2011by	the nearby type ia supernovae (sne ia) 2011fe and 2011by had nearly identicalphotospheric phase optical spectra, light-curve widths, and photometriccolours, but at peak brightness sn 2011by reached a fainter absolute magnitudein all optical bands and exhibited lower flux in the near-ultraviolet (nuv).based on those data, foley &amp; kirshner (2013) argue that the progenitors of sne2011by and 2011fe were supersolar and subsolar, respectively, and that sn2011fe generated 1.7 times the amount of 56ni as sn 2011by. with this work, weextend the comparison of these sne ia to 10 days before and 300 days aftermaximum brightness with new spectra and photometry. we show that the nebularphase spectra of sne 2011fe and 2011by are almost identical, and do not supporta factor of 1.7 difference in 56ni mass. instead, we find it plausible that thetully-fisher distance for sn 2011by is an underestimate, in which case thesesne ia may have reached similar peak luminosity, formed similar amounts of56ni, and had lower metallicity progenitors than previously estimated.regardless of the true distance to sn 2011by, we find that the relativeprogenitor metallicity difference remains well supported by their disparity innuv flux, which we show to be even stronger at pre-maximum epochs --- althoughcontributions from differences in total ejecta mass, viewing angle, orprogenitor density cannot be ruled out. we also demonstrate that, independentof distance modulus, sn 2011by exhibits a late-time luminosity excess thatcannot be explained by a light echo, but is more likely to be the result ofgreater energy trapping by the nucleosynthetic products of sn 2011by.

1408.6239	on the nature of type ia-csm supernovae: optical and near-infrared  spectra of sn 2012ca and sn 2013dn	a growing subset of type ia supernovae (sne ia) show evidence for unexpectedinteraction with a dense circumstellar medium (sne ia-csm). the precise natureof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguitiesarising from a strong contribution from the csm interaction. late-time spectraoffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomessufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. to date,few high-quality spectra of this kind exist. here we report on the late-timeoptical and infrared spectra of the sne~ia-csm 2012ca and 2013dn. these sneia-csm spectra exhibit low [fe iii]/[fe ii] ratios and strong [ca ii] at lateepochs. such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-chandrasekhar-mass(sc) candidate sn 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisationstate due to high densities, although the broad fe features admittedly showsimilarities to the blue "quasi-continuum" observed in some core-collapse sneibn and iin. neither sn 2012ca nor any of the other sne ia-csm show evidencefor broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra. similar to theinteracting type iin sn 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation lines areidentified in sn 2012ca, including [s iii], [ar iii], [ar x], [fe viii], [fex], and possibly [fe xi]. the total bolometric energy output does not exceed10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.all of these observations taken together suggest that sne ia-csm are moreconsistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, althoughdetailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm theseresults.

1409.0058	reverberation mapping of the kepler-field agn ka1858+4850	ka1858+4850 is a narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy at redshift 0.078 and is amongthe brightest active galaxies monitored by the kepler mission. we have carriedout a reverberation mapping campaign designed to measure the broad-line regionsize and estimate the mass of the black hole in this galaxy. we obtained 74epochs of spectroscopic data using the kast spectrograph at the lick 3-mtelescope from february to november of 2012, and obtained complementary v-bandimages from five other ground-based telescopes. we measured the h-beta lightcurve lag with respect to the v-band continuum light curve using bothcross-correlation techniques (ccf) and continuum light curve variabilitymodeling with the javelin method, and found rest-frame lags of lag_ccf = 13.53(+2.03, -2.32) days and lag_javelin = 13.15 (+1.08, -1.00) days. the h-betaroot-mean-square line profile has a width of sigma_line = 770 +/- 49 km/s.combining these two results and assuming a virial scale factor of f = 5.13, weobtained a virial estimate of m_bh = 8.06 (+1.59, -1.72) x 10^6 m_sun for themass of the central black hole and an eddington ratio of l/l_edd ~ 0.2. we alsoobtained consistent but slightly shorter emission-line lags with respect to thekepler light curve. thanks to the kepler mission, the light curve ofka1858+4850 has among the highest cadences and signal-to-noise ratios evermeasured for an active galactic nucleus; thus, our black hole mass measurementwill serve as a reference point for relations between black hole mass andcontinuum variability characteristics in active galactic nuclei.

0804.0042	sn 2006tf: precursor eruptions and the optically thick regime of  extremely luminous type iin supernovae	sn2006tf is the third most luminous sn discovered so far, after sn2005ap andsn2006gy. sn2006tf is valuable because it provides a link between two regimes:(1) luminous type iin supernovae powered by emission directly from interactionwith circumstellar material (csm), and (2) the most extremely luminous snewhere the csm interaction is so optically thick that energy must diffuse outfrom an opaque shocked shell. as sn2006tf evolves, it slowly transitions fromthe second to the first regime as the clumpy shell becomes more porous. thislink suggests that the range in properties of the most luminous sne is largelydetermined by the density and speed of h-rich material ejected shortly beforethey explode. the total energy radiated by sn2006tf was at least 7e50 ergs. ifthe bulk of this luminosity came from the thermalization of shock kineticenergy, then the star needs to have ejected ~18 msun in the 4-8 yr before corecollapse, and another 2-6 msun in the decades before that. a type ia explosionis therefore excluded. from the h-alpha emission-line profile, we derive ablast-wave speed of 2,000 km/s that does not decelerate, and from the narrow pcygni absorption from pre-shock gas we deduce that the progenitor's wind speedwas ~190 km/s. this is reminiscent of the wind speeds of lbvs, but not of rsgsor wr stars. we propose that like sn2006gy, sn2006tf marked the death of a verymassive star that retained its h envelope until the end of its life, andsuffered extreme lbv-like mass loss in the decades before it exploded.

1412.4767	ultraviolet spectroscopy of type iib supernovae: diversity and the  impact of circumstellar material	we present new hubble space telescope (hst) multi-epoch ultraviolet (uv)spectra of the bright type iib sn 2013df, and undertake a comprehensive anal-ysis of the set of four type iib supernovae for which hst uv spectra areavailable (sn 1993j, sn 2001ig, sn 2011dh, and sn 2013df). we find strongdiversity in both continuum levels and line features among these objects. weuse radiative-transfer models that fit the optical part of the spectrum well,and find that in three of these four events we see a uv continuum flux excess,apparently unaffected by line absorption. we hypothesize that this emissionoriginates above the photosphere, and is related to interaction withcircumstel- lar material (csm) located in close proximity to the sn progenitor.in contrast, the spectra of sn 2001ig are well fit by single-temperaturemodels, display weak continuum and strong reverse-fluorescence features, andare similar to spectra of radioactive 56ni-dominated type ia supernovae. acomparison of the early shock-cooling components in the observed light curveswith the uv continuum levels which we assume trace the strength of csminteraction suggests that events with slower cooling have stronger csmemission. the radio emission from events having a prominent uv excess isperhaps consistent with slower blast-wave velocities, as expected if theexplosion shock was slowed down by the csm that is also responsible for thestrong uv, but this connection is currently speculative as it is based on onlya few events.

1501.02820	ptf11iqb: cool supergiant mass loss that bridges the gap between type  iin and normal supernovae	ptf11iqb was initially classified as a typeiin event caught very early afterexplosion. it showed narrow wolf-rayet (wr) spectral features on day 2, but thenarrow emission weakened quickly and the spectrum morphed to resemble those oftypes ii-l and ii-p. at late times, halpha emission exhibited a complex,multipeaked profile reminiscent of sn1998s. in terms of spectroscopicevolution, we find that ptf11iqb was a near twin of sn~1998s, although withweaker interaction with circumstellar material (csm) at early times, andstronger csm interaction at late times. we interpret the spectral changes ascaused by early interaction with asymmetric csm that is quickly (by day 20)enveloped by the expanding sn ejecta photosphere, but then revealed again afterthe end of the plateau when the photosphere recedes. the light curve can bematched with a simple model for weak csm interaction added to the light curveof a normal sn~ii-p. this plateau requires that the progenitor had an extendedh envelope like a red supergiant, consistent with the slow progenitor windspeed indicated by narrow emission. the cool supergiant progenitor issignificant because ptf11iqb showed wr features in its early spectrum ---meaning that the presence of such wr features in an early sn spectrum does notnecessarily indicate a wr-like progenitor. [abridged] overall, ptf11iqb bridgessne~iin with weaker pre-sn mass loss seen in sne ii-l and ii-p, implying acontinuum between these types.

1502.00646	constraining the progenitor companion of the nearby type ia sn 2011fe  with a nebular spectrum at +981 days	we present an optical nebular spectrum of the nearby type ia supernova2011fe, obtained 981 days after explosion. sn 2011fe exhibits little evolutionsince the +593 day optical spectrum, but there are several curious aspects inthis new extremely late-time regime. we suggest that the persistence of the$\sim5800$~\aa\ feature is due to na i d, and that a new emission feature at$\sim7300$~\aa\ may be [ca ii]. also, we discuss whether the new emissionfeature at $\sim6400$~\aa\ might be [fe i] or the high-velocity hydrogenpredicted by mazzali et al. the nebular feature at 5200~\aa\ exhibits a linearvelocity evolution of $\sim350$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$ per 100 days from at least+220 to +980 days, but the line's shape also changes in this time, suggestingthat line blending contributes to the evolution. at $\sim 1000$ days afterexplosion, flux from the sn has declined to a point where contribution from aluminous secondary could be detected. in this work we make the firstobservational tests for a post-impact remnant star and constrain itstemperature and luminosity to $t \gtrsim 10^4$ $\rm k$ and $l \lesssim 10^4$$\rm l_{\odot}$. additionally, we do not see any evidence for narrow h$\alpha$emission in our spectrum. we conclude that observations continue to stronglyexclude many single-degenerate scenarios for sn 2011fe.

1502.07278	high-velocity features of calcium and silicon in the spectra of type ia  supernovae	"high-velocity features" (hvfs) are spectral features in type ia supernovae(sne ia) that have minima indicating significantly higher (by greater thanabout 6000 km/s) velocities than typical "photospheric-velocity features"(pvfs). the pvfs are absorption features with minima indicating typicalphotospheric (i.e., bulk ejecta) velocities (usually ~9000-15,000 km/s nearb-band maximum brightness). in this work we undertake the most in-depth studyof hvfs ever performed. the dataset used herein consists of 445 low-resolutionoptical and near-infrared (nir) spectra (at epochs up to 5 d past maximumbrightness) of 210 low-redshift sne ia that follow the "phillips relation." aseries of gaussian functions is fit to the data in order to characterisepossible hvfs of ca ii h&amp;k, si ii {\lambda}6355, and the ca ii nir triplet. thetemporal evolution of the velocities and strengths of the pvfs and hvfs ofthese three spectral features is investigated, as are possible correlationswith other sn ia observables. we find that while hvfs of ca ii are regularlyobserved (except in underluminous sne ia, where they are never found), hvfs ofsi ii {\lambda}6355 are significantly rarer, and they tend to exist at theearliest epochs and mostly in objects with large photospheric velocities. it isalso shown that stronger hvfs of si ii {\lambda}6355 are found in objects thatlack c ii absorption at early times and that have red ultraviolet/opticalcolours near maximum brightness. these results lead to a self-consistentconnection between the presence and strength of hvfs of si ii {\lambda}6355 andmany other mutually correlated sn~ia observables, including photosphericvelocity.

1506.08844	spectropolarimetry of sn 2011dh in m51: geometric insights on a type iib  supernova progenitor and explosion	we present seven epochs of spectropolarimetry of the type iib supernova (sn)2011dh in m51, spanning 86 days of its evolution. the first epoch was obtained9 days after the explosion, when the photosphere was still in the depletedhydrogen layer of the stripped-envelope progenitor. continuum polarization issecurely detected at the level of p~0.5% through day 14 and appears to diminishby day 30, which is different from the prevailing trends suggested by studiesof other core-collapse sne. time-variable modulations in p and position angleare detected across p-cygni line features. h-alpha and hei polarization peakafter 30 days and exhibit position angles roughly aligned with the earliercontinuum, while oi and caii appear to be geometrically distinct. we discussseveral possibilities to explain the evolution of the continuum and linepolarization, including the potential effects of a tidally deformed progenitorstar, aspherical radioactive heating by fast-rising plumes of ni-56 from thecore, oblique shock breakout, or scattering by circumstellar material. whilethese possibilities are plausible and guided by theoretical expectations, theyare not unique solutions to the data. the construction of more detailedhydrodynamic and radiative-transfer models that incorporate complex asphericalgeometries will be required to further elucidate the nature of the polarizedradiation from sn 2011dh and other type iib supernovae.
