0903.1843	the runaway white dwarf lp400-22 has a companion	we report the detection of a radial velocity companion to the extremely lowmass white dwarf lp400-22. the radial velocity of the white dwarf showsvariations with a semi-amplitude of 119 km/s and a 0.98776 day period, whichimplies a companion mass of m &gt; 0.37 msun. the optical photometry rules out amain sequence companion. thus the invisible companion is another white dwarf ora neutron star. using proper motion measurements and the radial velocity of thebinary system, we find that it has an unusual galactic orbit. lp400-22 ismoving away from the galactic center with a velocity of 396 km/s, which is verydifficult to explain by supernova runaway ejection mechanisms. dynamicalinteractions with a massive black hole like that in the galactic center can inprinciple explain its peculiar velocity, if the progenitor was a triple starsystem comprised of a close binary and a distant tertiary companion. untilbetter proper motions become available, we consider lp400-22 to be most likelya halo star with a very unusual orbit.

0907.5567	runaway stars, hypervelocity stars, and radial velocity surveys	runaway stars ejected from the galactic disk populate the halo of the milkyway. to predict the spatial and kinematic properties of runaways, we injectstars into a galactic potential, compute their trajectories through the galaxy,and derive simulated catalogs for comparison with observations. runaways have aflattened spatial distribution, with higher velocity stars at galacticlatitudes less than 30 degrees. due to their shorter stellar lifetimes, massiverunaway stars are more concentrated towards the disk than low mass runaways.bound (unbound) runaways that reach the halo probably originate from distancesof 6--12 kpc (10--15 kpc) from the galactic center, close to the estimatedorigin of the unbound runaway star hd 271791. because runaways are brighter andhave smaller velocities than hypervelocity stars (hvss), radial velocitysurveys are unlikely to confuse runaway stars with hvss. we estimate that atmost 1 runaway star contaminates the current sample. we place an upper limit of2% on the fraction of a-type main sequence stars ejected as runaways.

0910.2242	velocity dispersion profile of the milky way halo	we present a spectroscopic sample of 910 distant halo stars from thehypervelocity star survey from which we derive the velocity dispersion profileof the milky way halo. the sample is a mix of 74% evolved horizontal branchstars and 26% blue stragglers. we estimate distances to the stars usingobserved colors, metallicities, and stellar evolution tracks. our samplecontains twice as many objects with r&gt;50 kpc as previous surveys. we computethe velocity dispersion profile in two ways: with a parametric method based ona milky way potential model, and with a non-parametric method based on thecaustic technique originally developed to measure galaxy cluster mass profiles.the resulting velocity dispersion profiles are remarkably consistent with thosefound by two independent surveys based on other stellar populations: the milkyway halo exhibits a mean decline in radial velocity dispersion of -0.38+-0.12km/s/kpc over 15&lt;r&lt;75 kpc. this measurement is a useful basis for calculatingthe total mass and mass distribution of the milky way halo.

0911.0936	a spitzer search for substellar companions to low mass white dwarfs	the formation scenarios for single low-mass (m &lt; 0.45 msol) white dwarfsinclude enhanced mass loss from a metal-rich progenitor star or a commonenvelope phase of a solar-like star with a close-in massive planet or a browndwarf. both scenarios suggest that low-mass white dwarfs may have planets.here, we present a spitzer irac search for substellar and planetary masscompanions to 14 low-mass white dwarfs. one of our targets, hs 1653+7753,displays near- and mid-infrared flux excess. however, follow-up mmtobservations show that this excess is due to a nearby resolved source, which ismostly likely a background object. another target, pg 2257+162, shows fluxexcess compatible with a late-type stellar companion. we do not detectsubstellar companions to any of the remaining targets. in addition, eight ofthese stars do not show any radial velocity variations, ruling out stellar masscompanions including other white dwarfs. we conclude that a significantfraction of the low-mass white dwarfs in our sample do not have stellar ormassive brown dwarf companions.

0911.1781	the discovery of binary white dwarfs that will merge within 500 myr	we present radial velocity observations of four extremely low-mass (0.2 msol)white dwarfs. all four stars show peak-to-peak radial velocity variations of540 - 710 km/s with 1.0 - 5.9 hr periods. the optical photometry rules outmain-sequence companions. in addition, no milli-second pulsar companions aredetected in radio observations. thus the invisible companions are most likelywhite dwarfs. two of the systems are the shortest period binary white dwarfsyet discovered. due to the loss of angular momentum through gravitationalradiation, three of the systems will merge within 500 myr. the remaining systemwill merge within a hubble time. the mass functions for three of the systemsimply companions more massive than 0.46 msol; thus those are carbon/oxygen corewhite dwarfs. the unknown inclination angles prohibit a definitive conclusionabout the future of these systems. however, the chance of a supernova ia eventis only 1% to 5%. these systems are likely to form single r coronae borealisstars, providing evidence for a white dwarf + white dwarf merger mechanism forthese unusual objects. one of the systems, sdss j105353.89+520031.0 has a 70%chance of having a low-mass white dwarf companion. this system will probablyform a single helium-enriched subdwarf o star. all four white dwarf systemshave unusal mass ratios of &lt; 0.2-0.8 that may also lead to the formation of amcvn systems.

1004.0958	visitors from the halo: 11 gyr old white dwarfs in the solar  neighborhood	we report the discovery of three nearby old halo white dwarf candidates inthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss), including two stars in a common propermotion binary system. these candidates are selected from our 2800 square degreeproper motion survey on the bok and u.s. naval observatory flagstaff station1.3m telescopes, and they display proper motions of 0.4-0.5 arcsec/yr.follow-up mmt spectroscopy and near-infrared photometry demonstrate that allthree objects are hydrogen-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs with teff = 3700 -4100 k. for average mass white dwarfs, these temperature estimates correspondto cooling ages of 9-10 gyr, distances of 70-80 pc, and tangential velocitiesof 140-200 km/s. based on the uvw space velocities, we conclude that they mostlikely belong to the halo. furthermore, the combined main-sequence and whitedwarf cooling ages are 10-11 gyr. along with sdss j1102+4113, they are theoldest field white dwarfs currently known. these three stars represent only asmall fraction of the halo white dwarf candidates in our proper motion survey,and they demonstrate that deep imaging surveys like the pan-starrs and largesynoptic survey telescope should find many old thick disk and halo white dwarfsthat can be used to constrain the age of the galactic thick disk and halo.

1005.2619	the mass profile of the galaxy to 80 kpc	the hypervelocity star survey presents the currently largest sample of radialvelocity measurements of halo stars out to 80 kpc. we apply spherical jeansmodeling to these data in order to derive the mass profile of the galaxy. werestrict the analysis to distances larger than 25 kpc from the galactic center,where the density profile of halo stars is well approximated by a single powerlaw with logarithmic slope between -3.5 and -4.5. with this restriction, wealso avoid the complication of modeling a flattened galactic disk. in the range25 &lt; r &lt; 80 kpc, the radial velocity dispersion declines remarkably little; arobust measure of its logarithmic slope is between -0.05 and -0.1. the circularvelocity profile also declines remarkably little with radius. the allowed rangeof v_c(80 kpc) lies between 175 and 231 km/s, with the most likely value 193km/s. compared with the value at the solar location, the galactic circularvelocity declines by less than 20% over an order of magnitude in radius. such aflat profile requires a massive and extended dark matter halo. the massenclosed within 80 kpc is 6.9(+3.0-1.2) 10^11 msun. our sample of radialvelocities is large enough that the biggest uncertainty in the mass is notstatistical but systematic, dominated by the density slope and anisotropy ofthe tracer population. further progress requires modeling observed datasetswithin realistic simulations of galaxy formation.

1112.1919	identifying star streams in the milky way halo	we develop statistical methods for identifying star streams in the halo ofthe milky way galaxy that exploit observed spatial and radial velocitydistributions. within a great circle, departures of the observed spatialdistribution from random provide a measure of the likelihood of a potentialstar stream. comparisons between the radial velocity distribution within agreat circle and the radial velocity distribution of the entire sample alsomeasure the statistical significance of potential streams. the radialvelocities enable construction of a more powerful joint statistical test foridentifying star streams in the milky way halo. applying our method to halostars in the hypervelocity star (hvs) survey, we detect the sagittarius streamat high significance. great circle counts and comparisons with theoreticalmodels suggest that the sagittarius stream comprises 10% to 17% of the halostars in the hvs sample. the population of blue stragglers and blue horizontalbranch stars varies along the stream and is a potential probe of thedistribution of stellar populations in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy prior todisruption.

1203.3543	mmt hypervelocity star survey. ii. five new unbound stars	we present the discovery of five new unbound hypervelocity stars (hvss) inthe outer milky way halo. using a conservative estimate of galactic escapevelocity, our targeted spectroscopic survey has now identified 16 unbound hvssas well as a comparable number of hvss ejected on bound trajectories. agalactic center origin for the hvss is supported by their unbound velocities,the observed number of unbound stars, their stellar nature, their ejection timedistribution, and their galactic latitude and longitude distribution. otherproposed origins for the unbound hvss, such as runaway ejections from the diskor dwarf galaxy tidal debris, cannot be reconciled with the observations. anintriguing result is the spatial anisotropy of hvss on the sky, which possiblyreflects an anisotropic potential in the central 10-100 pc region of thegalaxy. further progress requires measurement of the spatial distribution ofhvss over the southern sky. our survey also identifies seven b supergiantsassociated with known star-forming galaxies; the absence of b supergiantselsewhere in the survey implies there are no new star-forming galaxies in oursurvey footprint to a depth of 1-2 mpc.

1211.1022	discovery of pulsations, including possible pressure modes, in two new  extremely low mass, he-core white dwarfs	we report the discovery of the second and third pulsating extremely low masswhite dwarfs (wds), sdss j111215.82+111745.0 (hereafter j1112) and sdssj151826.68+065813.2 (hereafter j1518). both have masses &lt; 0.25 msun andeffective temperatures below 10,000 k, establishing these putatively he-corewds as a cooler class of pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere wds (davs, or zz cetistars). the short-period pulsations evidenced in the light curve of j1112 mayalso represent the first observation of acoustic (p-mode) pulsations in any wd,which provide an exciting opportunity to probe this wd in a complimentary waycompared to the long-period g-modes also present. j1112 is a teff = 9590 +/-140 k and log(g) = 6.36 +/- 0.06 wd. the star displays sinusoidal variabilityat five distinct periodicities between 1792-2855 s. in this star we also seeshort-period variability, strongest at 134.3 s, well short of expected g-modesfor such a low-mass wd. the other new pulsating wd, j1518, is a teff = 9900 +/-140 k and log(g) = 6.80 +/- 0.05 wd. the light curve of j1518 is highlynon-sinusoidal, with at least seven significant periods between 1335-3848 s.consistent with the expectation that elm wds must be formed in binaries, thesetwo new pulsating he-core wds, in addition to the prototype sdssj184037.78+642312.3, have close companions. however, the observed variabilityis inconsistent with tidally induced pulsations and is so far best explained bythe same hydrogen partial-ionization driving mechanism at work in classicc/o-core zz ceti stars.

1306.4024	discovery of an ultramassive pulsating white dwarf	we announce the discovery of the most massive pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere(da) white dwarf (wd) ever discovered, gd 518. model atmosphere fits to theoptical spectrum of this star show it is a 12,030 +/- 210 k wd with a log(g) =9.08 +/- 0.06, which corresponds to a mass of 1.20 +/- 0.03 msun. stellarevolution models indicate that the progenitor of such a high-mass wd endured astable carbon-burning phase, producing an oxygen-neon-core wd. the discovery ofpulsations in gd 518 thus offers the first opportunity to probe the interior ofa wd with a possible oxygen-neon core. such a massive wd should also besignificantly crystallized at this temperature. the star exhibitsmulti-periodic luminosity variations at timescales ranging from roughly 425-595s and amplitudes up to 0.7%, consistent in period and amplitude with theobserved variability of typical zz ceti stars, which exhibit non-radial g-modepulsations driven by a hydrogen partial ionization zone. successfullyunraveling both the total mass and core composition of gd 518 provides a uniqueopportunity to investigate intermediate-mass stellar evolution, and canpossibly place an upper limit to the mass of a carbon-oxygen-core wd, which inturn constrains sne ia progenitor systems.

1406.3346	a new gravitational wave verification source	we report the discovery of a detached 20 min orbital period binary whitedwarf. wd0931+444 (sdss j093506.93+441106.9) was previously classified as a wd+ m dwarf system based on its optical spectrum. our time-resolved opticalspectroscopy observations obtained at the 8m gemini and 6.5m mmt revealpeak-to-peak radial velocity variations of 400 km/s every 20 min for the wd,but no velocity variations for the m dwarf. in addition, high-speed photometryfrom the mcdonald 2.1m telescope shows no evidence of variability nor evidenceof a reflection effect. an m dwarf companion is physically too large to fitinto a 20 min orbit. thus, the orbital motion of the wd is almost certainly dueto an invisible wd companion. the m dwarf must be either an unrelatedbackground object or the tertiary component of a hiearchical triple system.wd0931+444 contains a pair of wds, a 0.32 msol primary and a &gt;0.14 msolsecondary, at a separation of &gt;0.19 rsol. after j0651+2844, wd0931+444 becomesthe second-shortest period detached binary wd currently known. the two wds willlose angular momentum through gravitational wave radiation and merge in &lt;9 myr.the log h ~ -22 gravitational wave strain from wd0931+444 is strong enough tomake it a verification source for gravitational wave missions in themilli-hertz frequency range, e.g. the evolved laser interferometer spaceantenna (elisa), bringing the total number of known elisa verification sourcesto nine.

astro-ph;0210605	a detailed thermal analysis of the binospec spectrograph	refractive optics in astronomical instruments are potentially sensitive totemperature gradients and temperature transients. this sensitivity arises fromthermally dependent refractive indices, lens spacings, and lens dimensions. wehave therefore undertaken a detailed thermal analysis of binospec, a wide-fieldoptical spectrograph under development for the converted mmt. our goals are topredict the temperature gradients that will be present in the binospec opticsand structure under realistic operating conditions and to determine how designchoices affect these gradients. we begin our analysis by deriving thermal timeconstants for instrument subassemblies. we then generate a low-resolutionfinite difference model of the entire instrument and high-resolution models ofsensitive subassemblies. this approach to thermal analysis is applicable to avariety of other instruments. we use measurements of the ambient temperature inthe converted mmt's dome to model binospec's thermal environment. duringmoderate conditions we find that the binospec lens groups develop 0.14 c axialand radial temperature gradients and that lens groups of different mass develop0.5 c temperature differences; these numbers are doubled for the extremeconditions. internal heat sources do not significantly affect these results;heat flow from the environment dominates. the instrument must be periodicallyopened to insert new aperture masks, but we find that the resulting temperaturegradients and thermal stresses in the optics are small. image shifts at thedetector caused by thermal deflections of the binospec optical bench structureare approx 0.1 pixel/hr. we conclude that the proposed binospec design hasacceptable thermal properties, and briefly discuss design changes to furtherreduce temperature gradients.

astro-ph;0505328	the century survey galactic halo project ii: global properties and the  luminosity function of field blue horizontal branch stars	we discuss a 175 deg^2 spectroscopic survey for blue horizontal branch (bhb)stars in the galactic halo. we use the two micron all sky survey (2mass) andthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to select bhb candidates, and find that the2mass and sdss color-selection is 38% and 50% efficient, respectively, for bhbstars. our samples include one likely run-away b7 star 6 kpc below the galacticplane. the global properties of the bhb samples are consistent with membershipin the halo population: the median metallicity is [fe/h]=-1.7, the velocitydispersion is 108 km/s, and the mean galactic rotation of the bhb stars3&lt;|z|&lt;15 kpc is -4 +- 30 km/s. we discuss the theoretical basis of the preston,shectman &amp; beers m_v-color relation for bhb stars, and conclude that intrinsicshape of the bhb m_v-color relation results from the physics of stars on thehorizontal branch. we calculate the luminosity function for the field bhb starsamples using the efstathiou, ellis, &amp; peterson maximum-likelihood method whichis unbiased by density variations. the field bhb luminosity function exhibits asteep rise at bright luminosities, a peak between 0.8 &lt; m_v &lt; 1.0, and a tailat faint luminosities. we compare the field bhb luminosity functions with theluminosity functions derived from sixteen different globular cluster bhbs.kolmogorov-smirnov tests suggest that field bhb stars and bhb stars in globularclusters share a common distribution of luminosities, with the exception ofglobular clusters with extended bhbs.

astro-ph;0601580	a successful targeted search for hypervelocity stars	hypervelocity stars (hvss) travel with velocities so extreme that dynamicalejection from a massive black hole is their only suggested origin. followingour discovery of the first hvs, we have undertaken a dedicated survey for morehvss in the galactic halo and present here the resulting discovery of two newhvss: sdss j091301.0+305120 and sdss j091759.5+672238, traveling with galacticrest-frame velocities at least +558+-12 and +638+-12 km/s, respectively.assuming the hvss are b8 main sequence stars, they are at distances ~75 and ~55kpc, respectively, and have travel times from the galactic center consistentwith their lifetimes. the existence of two b8 hvss in our 1900 deg^2 survey,combined with the yu &amp; tremaine hvs rate estimates, is consistent with hvssdrawn from a standard initial mass function but inconsistent with hvs drawnfrom a truncated mass function like the one in the top-heavy arches cluster.the travel times of the five currently known hvss provide no evidence for aburst of hvss from a major in-fall event at the galactic center in the last\~160 myr.

astro-ph;0604111	hypervelocity stars. i. the spectroscopic survey	we discuss our targeted search for hypervelocity stars (hvss), starstraveling with velocities so extreme that dynamical ejection from a massiveblack hole is their only suggested origin. our survey, now half complete, hassuccessfully identified a total of four probable hvss plus a number of otherunusual objects. here we report the most recently discovered two hvss: sdssj110557.45+093439.5 and possibly sdss j113312.12+010824, traveling withgalactic rest-frame velocities at least +508+-12 and +418+-10 km/s,respectively. the other late b-type objects in our survey are consistent with apopulation of post main-sequence stars or blue stragglers in the galactic halo,with mean metallicity [fe/h]=-1.3 and velocity dispersion 108+-5 km/s.interestingly, the velocity distribution shows a tail of objects with largepositive velocities that may be a mix of low-velocity hvss and high-velocityrunaway stars. our survey also includes a number of da white dwarfs withunusually red colors, possibly extremely low mass objects. two of our objectsare b supergiants in the leo a dwarf, providing the first spectroscopicevidence for star formation in this dwarf galaxy within the last ~30 myr.

astro-ph;0608159	hypervelocity stars: predicting the spectrum of ejection velocities	the disruption of binary stars by the tidal field of the black hole in thegalactic center can produce the hypervelocity stars observed in the halo. weuse numerical models to simulate the full spectrum of observable velocities ofstars ejected into the halo by this binary disruption process. our modelincludes a range of parameters for binaries with 3-4 m_solar primaries,consideration of radial orbits of the ejected stars through an approximate massdistribution for the galaxy, and the impact of stellar lifetimes. we calculatethe spectrum of ejection velocities and reproduce previous results for the meanejection velocity at the galactic center. the model predicts that the fullpopulation of ejected stars includes both the hypervelocity stars withvelocities large enough to escape from the galaxy and a comparable number ofejected, but bound, stars of the same stellar type. the predicted median speedsof the population of ejected stars as a function of distance in the halo areconsistent with current observations. combining the model with the data alsoshows that interesting constraints on the properties of binaries in thegalactic center and on the mass distribution in the galaxy can be obtained evenwith modest samples of ejected stars.

astro-ph;0609246	sdss 0809+1729: connections between extremely metal poor galaxies and  gamma ray burst hosts	we discuss the serendipitous discovery of an extremely metal poor galaxy,sdss 0809+1729, classified as a star in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).the galaxy has a redshift z = 0.0441 and a b-band absolute magnitude m_b =-17.1. with a metallicity of log(o/h)+12~7.44 or ~1/20 solar, this galaxy isamong the 10 most metal poor emission-line galaxies known. sdss 0809+1729 is ablue compact galaxy (bcg) with a stellar age of ~4.5 myr, a star formation rateof 0.18 msun/yr, and a large gas-phase electron density ~367/cm^3. similarvalues of these parameters are common among other extremely metal poorgalaxies, including izw18. sdss 0809+1729 is, however, unusual among bcgsbecause it lies in the same region of the luminosity-metallicity diagram as thetwo lowest metallicity long duration gamma ray burst (grb) hosts. for a givenb-band luminosity, both nearby grb hosts and sdss 0809+1729 have systematicallylower metallicities than dwarf irregulars, the majority of bcgs, and normalstar-forming galaxies. because the star formation properties of sdss 0809+1729are similar to nearby long duration grb hosts, sdss 0809+1729 may be apotential grb host. identification of larger samples of similar extremely metalpoor objects may provide important insights into the conditions required toproduce long duration grbs.

0811.2008	do the nearby bhb stars belong to the thick disk or the halo?	we study the milky way region z&lt;3.0 kpc, where the thick disk and inner halooverlap, by using the kinematics of local blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars(within 1 kpc) and new samples of bhb stars and a-type stars from the centurysurvey. we derive galactic u,v,w velocities for these bhb and a-type starsamples using proper motions from the nomad catalog. the mean velocities andthe velocity dispersions of the bhb samples (z&lt;3 kpc) are characteristic of thehalo, while those of the century survey a-type stars are characteristic of thethick disk. there is no evidence from our samples that the bhb stars rotatewith the thick disk in the region z&lt;3 kpc. nearly a third of the nearby localrr lyrae stars have disk kinematics and are more metal-rich than [fe/h]~-1.only a few percent of the century survey bhb stars have these properties. onlyone nearby bhb star (hd 130201) is likely to be such a disk star but selectionbased on high proper motions will have tended to exclude such stars from thelocal sample. the scale height derived from a sample of local rr lyrae starsagrees with that of the century survey bhb stars. the local samples of bhbstars and metal-weak red giants are too incomplete for a similar comparison.
