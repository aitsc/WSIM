0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0902.1812	the discovery of an m4+t8.5 binary system	we report the discovery of a t8.5 dwarf, which is a companion to the m4 dwarfwolf 940. at a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 au. the m4 primarydisplays no halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of west etal. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 gyr. weak halphaabsorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limitof 6 gyr. we apply the relations of bonfils et al for v-ks and m_ks todetermine the metallicity, [fe/h] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for wolf~940a, and byextension the t8.5 secondary, wolf 940b. we have obtained jhk niri spectroscopyand jhkl' photometry of wolf 940b, and use these data, in combination withtheoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18e-16 wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(l*/lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. using the ageconstraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of baraffe etal. we determine teff = 570 +/- 25k and log g = 4.75-5.00 for wolf940b, basedon its bolometric luminosity. this represents the first determination of theseproperties for a t8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of t-dwarfspectral models. this object represents the first system containing a t8+ dwarffor which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compareits spectra with those of the latest very cool bt-settl models. this clearlydemonstrates that the use of the (w_j,k/j) spectral ratios (used previously toconstrain teff and log g) would have over-estimated teff by ~100k.

0706.3548	the impact of stellar oscillations on doppler velocity planet searches	we present a quantitative investigation of the effect of stellar oscillationson doppler velocity planet searches. using data from four asteroseismologicalobservation campaigns, we find a power law relationship between the noiseimpact of these oscillations on doppler velocities and both theluminosity-to-mass of the target stars, and observed integration times.including the impact of oscillation jitter should improve the quality ofkeplerian fits to doppler velocity data. the scale of the effect theseoscillations have on doppler velocity measurements is smaller than thatproduced by stellar activity, but is most significant for giant and subgiantstars, and at short integration times (i.e. less than a few minutes). suchshort observation times tend to be used only for very bright stars. however,since it is these very same stars that tend to be targeted for the highestprecision observations, as planet searches probe to lower and lower planetmasses, oscillation noise for these stars can be significant and needs to beaccounted for in observing strategies.

0906.4619	the frequency of low-mass exoplanets	we report first results from the anglo-australian telescope rocky planetsearch - an intensive, high-precision doppler planet search targeting low-massexoplanets in contiguous 48 night observing blocks. on this run we targeted 24bright, nearby and intrinsically stable sun-like stars selected from theanglo-australian planet search's main sample. these observations have alreadydetected one low-mass planet reported elsewhere (hd16417b), and here wereconfirm the detection of hd4308b. further, we have monte-carlo simulated thedata from this run on a star-by-star basis to produce robust detectionconstraints. these simulations demonstrate clear differences in the exoplanetdetectability functions from star to star due to differences in sampling, dataquality and intrinsic stellar stability. they reinforce the importance ofstar-by-star simulation when interpreting the data from doppler planetsearches. the simulations indicate that for some of our target stars we aresensitive to close-orbiting planets as small as a few earth masses. the twolow-mass planets present in our 24 star sample indicate that the exoplanetminimum mass function at low masses is likely to be a flat alpha ~ -1 (fordn/dm proportional to m^alpha) and that between 15+/-10% (at alpha=-0.3) and48+/-34% (at alpha=-1.3) of stars host planets with orbital periods of lessthan 16 days and minimum masses greater than 3 mearth.

1001.0762	mid-infrared photometry of cold brown dwarfs: diversity in age, mass and  metallicity	we present spitzer irac photometry of twelve very late-type t dwarfs; ninehave [3.6], [4.5], [5.8] and [8.0] photometry and three have [3.6] and [4.5]photometry only. we investigate trends with type and color for the planning andinterpretation of surveys for the coldest t or y dwarfs. brown dwarfs witheffective temperature (t_eff) below 700k emit more than half their flux atwavelengths beyond 3um, and the ratio of the mid-infrared flux to thenear-infrared flux becomes very sensitive to t_eff. the color h-[4.5] is a goodindicator of t_eff with a relatively weak dependence on metallicity andgravity. conversely, the colors h-k and [4.5]-[5.8] are sensitive tometallicity and gravity. thus near- and mid-infrared photometry provide usefulindicators of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs, and if temperatureand gravity are known, then mass and age can be determined from evolutionarymodels. there are twelve dwarfs known with h-[4.5]&gt;3.0, and 500&lt; t_eff k &lt; 800,which we examine in detail. the ages of these dwarfs range from very young(0.1-1.0 gyr) to relatively old (3-12 gyr). the mass range is possibly as lowas 5 jupiter masses to up to 70 jupiter masses. the metallicities also span alarge range, from [m/h] -0.3 to [m/h] +0.3. the small number of t8-t9 dwarfsfound in the ukirt infrared deep sky survey to date appear to be mostly younglow-mass dwarfs. extensions to the mid-infrared space missions warm-spitzer andwise are desirable in order to obtain the vital mid-infrared data for coldbrown dwarfs, and to discover more of these rare objects.

1001.4393	the discovery of a very cool binary system	we report the discovery of a very cool d/sdl7+t7.5p common proper motionbinary system, sdss j1416+13ab, found by cross-matching the ukidss large areasurvey data release 5 against the sloan digital sky survey data release 7. thed/sdl7 is blue in j-h and h-k and has other features suggestive oflow-metallicity and/or high gravity. the t7.5p displays spectral peculiarityseen before in earlier type dwarfs discovered in ukidss las dr4, and referredto as ch4-j-early peculiarity. we suggest that ch4-j-early peculiarity arisesfrom low-metallicity and/or high-gravity, and speculate as to its use forclassifying t dwarfs. ukidss and follow-up ukirt/wfcam photometry shows the tdwarf to have the bluest near infrared colours yet seen for such an object withh-k = -1.31+/-0.17. warm spitzer irac photometry shows the t dwarf to haveextremely red h-[4.5] = 4.86+/-0.04, which is the reddest yet seen for asubstellar object. the lack of parallax measurement for the pair limits ourability to estimate parameters for the system. however, applying a conservativedistance estimate of 5-15 pc suggests a projected separation in range 45-135au. by comparing h-k:h-[4.5] colours of the t dwarf to spectral models weestimate that teff = 500 k and [m/h]~-0.30, with log g ~ 5.0. this suggests amass of ~30 mjupiter for the t dwarf and an age of ~10 gyr for the system. theprimary would then be a 75mjupiter object with log g ~ 5.5 and a relativelydust-free teff ~ 1500k atmosphere. given the unusual properties of the systemwe caution that these estimates are uncertain. we eagerly await parallaxmeasurements and high-resolution imaging which will constrain the parametersfurther.

1011.1125	the effect of m dwarf starspot activity on low-mass planet detection  thresholds	in light of the growing interest in searching for low mass, rocky planets, weinvestigate the impact of starspots on radial velocity searches for earth-massplanets in orbit about m dwarf stars. since new surveys targeting m dwarfs willlikely be carried out at infrared wavelengths, a comparison between v and yband starspot induced jitter is made, indicating a reduction of up to an orderof magnitude when observing in the y band. the exact reduction in jitter isdependent on the photosphere to spot contrast ratio, with greater improvementsat smaller contrasts. we extrapolate a model used to describe solar spotdistributions to simulate the spot patterns that we expect to find on m dwarfs.under the assumption that m dwarfs are near or fully convective, we randomlyplace starspots on the stellar surface, simulating different levels of spotcoverage. line profiles, distorted by spots are derived and are used toinvestigate the starspot induced jitter. by making assumptions about the degreeof spot activity, detection limits for earth-mass planets in habitable zonesare simulated for between 10 and 500 observation epochs. we find that &lt;= 50epochs are required to detect 1 - 2 mearth planets (with &lt; 1 per cent falsealarm probability) orbiting slowly rotating 0.1 and 0.2 msun stars. thissensitivity decreases when typical rotation velocities and activity levels foreach stellar mass/spectral type are considered. no detections of below 20mearth planets are expected for &lt;= 500 observations for the most active starswith vsini &gt;= 20 km/s and dark spots.

1211.5288	j band variability of m dwarfs in the wfcam transit survey	we present an analysis of the photometric variability of m dwarfs in thewfcam transit survey. although periodic lightcurve variability in low massstars is generally dominated by photospheric star spot activity, m dwarfvariability in the j band has not been as thoroughly investigated as at visiblewavelengths. spectral type estimates for a sample of over 200,000 objects aremade using spectral type-colour relations, and over 9600 dwarfs (j&lt;17) withspectral types later than k7 were found. the light curves of the late-typesample are searched for periodicity using a lomb-scargle periodogram analysis.a total of 68 periodic variable m dwarfs are found in the sample with periodsranging from 0.16 days to 90.33 days, with amplitudes in the range of ~0.009 to~0.115 in the j band. we simulate active m dwarfs with a range oflatitude-independent spot coverages and estimate a periodically variablefractions of 1-3 per cent for stars where spots cover more than 10 per cent ofthe star's surface. our simulated spot distributions indicate that operating inthe j band, where spot contrast ratios are minimised, enables variability inonly the most active of stars to be detected. these findings affirm thebenefits of using the $j$ band for planetary transit searches compared tovisible bands. we also serendipitously find a \delta j&gt;0.2 mag flaring eventfrom an m4v star in our sample.

1303.3336	observing strategies for the detection of jupiter analogs	to understand the frequency, and thus the formation and evolution, ofplanetary systems like our own solar system, it is critical to detectjupiter-like planets in jupiter-like orbits. for long-term radial-velocitymonitoring, it is useful to estimate the observational effort required toreliably detect such objects, particularly in light of severe competition forlimited telescope time. we perform detailed simulations of observationalcampaigns, maximizing the realism of the sampling of a set of simulatedobservations. we then compute the detection limits for each campaign toquantify the effect of increasing the number of observational epochs andvarying their time coverage. we show that once there is sufficient timebaseline to detect a given orbital period, it becomes less effective to addfurther time coverage -- rather, the detectability of a planet scales roughlyas the square root of the number of observations, independently of the numberof orbital cycles included in the data string. we also show that no noise flooris reached, with a continuing improvement in detectability at the maximumnumber of observations n=500 tested here.

1311.3617	is it possible to detect planets around young active g and k dwarfs?	theoretical predictions suggest that the distribution of planets in veryyoung stars could be very different to that typically observed in gyr oldsystems that are the current focus of radial velocity surveys. however, thedetection of planets around young stars is hampered by the increased stellaractivity associated with young stars, the signatures of which can bias thedetection of planets. in this paper we place realistic limitations on thepossibilities for detecting planets around young active g and k dwarfs. themodels of stellar activity based on tomographic imaging of the g dwarf hd141943 and the k1 dwarf ab dor and also include contributions from plage andmany small random starspots. our results show that the increased stellaractivity levels present on young solar-type stars strongly impacts thedetection of earth-mass and jupiter mass planets and that the degree ofactivity jitter is directly correlated with stellar \vsinis. we also show thatfor g and k dwarfs, the distribution of activity in individual stars is moreimportant than the differences in induced radial velocities as a function ofspectral type. we conclude that jupiter mass planets can be detected close-inaround fast-rotating young active stars, neptune-mass planets around moderaterotators and that super-earths are only detectable around very slowly rotatingstars. the effects of an increase in stellar activity jitter by observingyounger stars can be compensated for by extending the observational base-lineto at least 100 epochs.

[fe/h]abundances are determined using a custom chi^2 fitting procedure within a largegrid of kurucz model atmospheres. the chromospheric activities were determinedby measuring the amount of emission in the cores of the strong caii hk lines.the sample of metallicities has been compared to other [fe/h] determinationsand was found to agree with these at the +/-0.05 dex level for spectroscopicvalues and at the +/-0.1 dex level for photometric values. the distribution ofchromospheric activities is found to be described by a bimodal distribution,agreeing well with the conclusions from other works. also an analysis ofmaunder minimum status was attempted and it was found that 6+/-4 stars in thesample could be in a maunder minimum phase of their evolution and hence the sunshould only spend a few per cent of its main sequence lifetime in maunderminimum.

0804.3354	beyond the iron peak: r- and s-process elemental abundances in stars  with planets	we present elemental abundances of 118 stars (28 of which are knownextrasolar planetary host stars) observed as part of the anglo-australianplanet search. abundances of o, mg, cr, y, zr, ba, nd and eu (along withpreviously published abundances for c and si) are presented. this study is oneof the first to specifically examine planetary host stars for the heavyelements produced by neutron capture reactions. we find that the host stars arechemically different to both the standard solar abundance and non-host stars inall elements studied, with enrichments over non-host stars ranging from 0.06dex (for o) to 0.11 dex (for cr and y). such abundance trends are in agreementwith other previous studies of field stars and lead us to conclude that thechemical anomalies observed in planetary host stars are the result of normalgalactic chemical evolution processes. based on this observation, we concludethat the observed chemical traits of planetary host stars are primordial inorigin, coming from the original nebula and not from a ``pollution'' processoccurring during or after formation and that planet formation occurs naturallywith the evolution of stellar material.

1502.05223	analysis of combined radial velocities and activity of bd+20 1790:  evidence supporting the existence of a planetary companion	this paper presents the simultaneous bayesian analysis of the radial velocityand activity indices for the k5ve active star bd+20 1790, that was proposed tohost a close-in massive planet by hern\'an-obispo et al. (2010). the bayesiananalysis supports the hypothesis of a planetary companion. we present a neworbital solution after removing the two main contributions to the stellarjitter, one that varies with the photometric period and another that varieswith the synodic period of the star+planet system. we use a new method todetermine these jitter components, considering them as a second and thirdsignals in the system. a discussion on possible magneticstar-planet-interaction is included, based on the bayesian analysis of theactivity indices. we propose two possible sources for flare events of thisstar: one related to the geometry of the system and the relative movement ofthe star+planet, and a second one purely stochastic source that is related tothe evolution of stellar active regions. also, we observe for the first timethe magnetic field of the star, from spectropolarimetric data.

1502.06503	49 new t dwarfs identified using methane imaging	we present the discovery of 49 new photometrically classified t dwarfs fromthe combination of large infrared and optical surveys combined with follow-uptng photometry. we used multi-band infrared and optical photometry from theukirt and sloan digital sky surveys to identify possible brown dwarfcandidates, which were then confirmed using methane filter photometry. we havedefined a new photometric conversion between ch4s - ch4l colour and spectraltype for t4 to t8 brown dwarfs based on a part of the sample that has beenfollowed up using methane photometry and spectroscopy. using methanedifferential photometry as a proxy for spectral type for t dwarfs has proved tobe a very efficient technique. of a subset of 45 methane selected brown dwarfsthat were observed spectroscopically, 100% were confirmed as t dwarfs. futuredeep imaging surveys will produce large samples of faint brown dwarfcandidates, for which spectroscopy will not be feasible. when broad wavelengthcoverage is unavailable, methane imaging offers a means to efficiently classifycandidates from such surveys using just a pair of near-infrared images.

1503.04715	methane and ammonia in the near-infrared spectra of late t dwarfs	analysis of t dwarfs using model atmospheres has been hampered by the absenceof reliable line lists for methane and ammonia. newly computed high temperatureline lists for both of these important molecules are now available, so it istimely to investigate the appearance of the various absorption features in tdwarfs in order to better understand their atmospheres and validate the newline lists. we present high quality r~5000 gemini/nifs 1.0-2.4 microns spectraof the t8 standard 2mass 0415-0935 and the t9 standard ugps 0722-0540. we usethese spectra to identify numerous methane and ammonia features not previouslyseen and we discuss the implications for our understanding of t dwarfatmospheres. among our results, we find that ammonia is the dominant opacitysource between ~1.233-1.266 microns in ugps 0722-0540, and we tentativelyidentify several absorption features in this wavelength range in the t9'sspectrum which may be due entirely to ammonia opacity. our results also suggestthat water rather than methane is the dominant opacity source in the red halfof the j-band of the t8 dwarf. water appears to be the main absorber in thiswavelength region in the t9 dwarf until ~1.31 microns, when methane starts todominate.

1503.05082	a large spectroscopic sample of l and t dwarfs from ukidss las: peculiar  objects, binaries, and space density	we present the spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of late-m, l, and tdwarfs from ukidss. using the yjhk photometry from ulas and the red-opticalphotometry from sdss we selected a sample of 262 brown dwarf candidates and wefollowed-up 196 of them using x-shooter on the vlt. the large wavelengthcoverage (0.30-2.48 $\mu$m) and moderate resolution (r~5000-9000) of x-shooterallowed us to identify peculiar objects including 22 blue l dwarfs, 2 blue tdwarfs, and 2 low gravity m dwarfs. using a spectral indices-based technique weidentified 27 unresolved binary candidates, for which we determined thespectral type of the potential components via spectral deconvolution. thespectra allowed us to measure the equivalent width of the prominent absorptionfeatures and to compare them to atmospheric models. cross-correlating thespectra with a radial velocity standard, we measured the radial velocity forour targets, and we determined the distribution of the sample, which is centredat -1.7$\pm$1.2 km s$^{-1}$ with a dispersion of 31.5 km s$^{-1}$. using ourresults we estimated the space density of field brown dwarfs and compared itwith the results of numerical simulations. depending on the binary fraction, wefound that there are (0.85$\pm$0.55) x 10$^{-3}$ to (1.00$\pm$0.64) x 10$^{-3}$objects per cubic parsec in the l4-l6.5 range, (0.73$\pm$0.47) x 10$^{-3}$ to(0.85$\pm$0.55) x 10$^{-3}$ objects per cubic parsec in the l7-t0.5 range, and(0.74$\pm$0.48) x 10$^{-3}$ to (0.88$\pm$0.56) x 10$^{-3}$ objects per cubicparsec in the t1-t4.5 range. there seem to be an excess of objects in the l/ttransition with respect to the late t dwarfs, a discrepancy that could beexplained assuming a higher binary fraction than expected for the l/ttransition, or that objects in the high-mass end and low-mass end of thisregime form in different environments, i.e. following different imfs.

1509.05284	starspot distributions on fully convective m dwarfs: implications for  radial velocity planet searches	since m4.5 - m9 dwarfs exhibit equatorial rotation velocities of order 10km/s on average, radial velocity surveys targeting this stellar population willlikely need to find methods to effectively remove starspot jitter. we presentthe first high resolution doppler images of the m4.5 dwarf, gj 791.2a, and them9 dwarf, lp 944-20. the time series spectra of both objects reveal numerousline profile distortions over the rotation period of each star which weinterpret as starspots. the transient distortions are modelled withspot/photosphere contrast ratios that correspond to model atmospheretemperature differences of tphot-tspot = 200 and 300 k. gj 791.2a is a fullyconvective star with vsini = 35.1 km/s. although we find more starspotstructure at high latitudes, we reconstruct spots at a range of phases andlatitudes with a mean spot filling of ~3%. lp 944-20 is one of the brightestknown late-m dwarfs, with spectral type m9v and vsini = 30.8 km/s. its spectraltime series exhibits two dominant transient line distortions that arereconstructed as high latitude spots, while a mean spot filling factor of only1.5% is found. the occurrence of low-contrast spots at predominantly highlatitudes, which we see in both targets here, is in general likely to beresponsible for the low amplitude photometric variability seen in late-mdwarfs. for gj 791.2a, the radial velocities induced by the starspot featuresyield an rms velocity variability of 138 m/s, which can be reduced by a factorof 1.9 using our reconstructed surface brightness distributions.

astro-ph;0412165	the prospects for finding brown dwarfs in eclipsing binary systems and  measuring brown dwarf properties	we present the results of a simulation to investigate the prospects ofmeasuring mass, age, radius, metallicity and luminosity data for brown dwarfsin fully eclipsing binary systems around late k and early m dwarfs identifiedby ultra-wide-field transit surveys. these surveys will monitor approximately amillion k and m dwarfs at a level sufficient to detect transits of lowluminosity companions. we look at the current observational evidence for suchsystems, and suggest that about 1% of late k and early-mid m dwarfs could havea very close bd companion. with this assumption, and using the superwasptransit survey as an example, our simulation predicts that 400 brown dwarfs infully eclipsing binary systems could be discovered. all of these eclipsingbinaries could yield accurate brown dwarf mass and radius measurements. byinferring the brown dwarf effective temperature distribution, assuming auniform age spread and an alpha=0.5 companion brown dwarf mass function, thesimulation estimates that brown dwarf brightness could also be measurable (atthe 10% level) for about 60 of these binary systems from the secondary eclipse.irradiation of the brown dwarfs will be below the 10% level for about 70% ofthese systems, meaning that the measured brown dwarf brightnesses shouldgenerally be the same as those of free-floating counterparts. the predicted agedistribution of the primaries is dominated by young systems, and about 20binaries could be younger than 1gyr. we suggest that many of these young binarysystems will be members of ``kinematic moving groups'', allowing their ages tobe accurately constrained.

astro-ph;0603320	finding benchmark brown dwarfs to probe the imf as a function of time	using a simulated disk brown dwarf (bd) population, we find that new largearea infrared surveys are expected to identify enough bds covering wide enoughmass--age ranges to potentially measure the mass function down to ~0.03mo, andthe bd formation history out to 10 gyr, at a level capable of establishing ifbd formation follows star formation. we suggest these capabilities are bestrealised by spectroscopic calibration of bd properties (teff, g and [m/h])which, when combined with a measured luminosity and an evolutionary model cangive bd mass and age relatively independent of bd atmosphere models. suchcalibration requires an empirical understanding of how bd spectra are affectedby variations in these properties, and thus the identification and study of"benchmark bds" whose age and composition can be established independently. weidentify the best sources of benchmark bds as young open cluster members,moving group members, and wide (&gt;1000au) bd companions to both subgiant starsand high mass white dwarfs (wds). we have used 2mass to measure a wide l dwarfcompanion fraction of 2.7(+0.7/-0.5)%, which equates to a bd companion fractionof 34(+9/-6)% for an alpha~1 companion mass function. using this value wesimulate populations of wide bd binaries, and estimate that 80(+21/-14)subgiant--bd binaries, and 50(+13/-10) benchmark wd--bd binaries could beidentified using current and new facilities. the wd--bd binaries should all beidentifiable using the large area survey component of ukidss combined withsloan. discovery of the subgiant--bd binaries will require a nir imagingcampaign around a large (~900) sample of hipparcos subgiants. if identified,spectral studies of these benchmark brown dwarfs could reveal the spectralsensitivities across the teff, g and [m/h] space probed by new surveys.

astro-ph;0611658	four new exoplanets and hints of additional substellar companions to  exoplanet host stars	we present four new exoplanets: hip 14810 b &amp; c, hd 154345 b, and hd 187123c. the two planets orbiting hip 14810, from the n2k project, have masses of 3.9and 0.76 m_jup. we have searched the radial velocity time series of 90 knownexoplanet systems and found new residual trends due to additional, long periodcompanions. two stars known to host one exoplanet have sufficient curvature inthe residuals to a one planet fit to constrain the minimum mass of the outercompanion to be substellar: hd 68988 c with 8 m_jup &lt; m sini &lt; 20 m_jup and hd187123 c with 3 m_jup &lt; msini &lt; 7 m_jup$, both with p &gt; 8 y. we have alsosearched the velocity residuals of known exoplanet systems for prospectivelow-amplitude exoplanets and present some candidates. we discuss techniques forconstraining the mass and period of exoplanets in such cases, and forquantifying the significance of weak rv signals. we also present two substellarcompanions with incomplete orbits and periods longer than 8 y: hd 24040 b andhd 154345 b with m sini &lt; 20 m_jup and m sini &lt; 10 m_jup, respectively.

astro-ph;0702534	two t dwarfs from the ukidss early data release	we report on the first ultracool dwarf discoveries from the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) large area survey early data release (las edr), inparticular the discovery of t dwarfs which are fainter and more distant thanthose found using the 2mass and sdss surveys. we aim to show that ourmethodologies for searching the ~27 sq degs of the las edr are successful forfinding both l and t dwarfs $via$ cross-correlation with the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) dr4 release. while the area searched so far is small, the numbersof objects found shows great promise for near-future releases of the las andgreat potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. ultracool dwarfs areselected by combinations of their yjh(k) ukidss colours and sdss dr4 z-j andi-z colours, or, lower limits on these red optical/infrared colours in the caseof dr4 dropouts. after passing visual inspection tests, candidates have beenfollowed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.our main result is the discovery following ch4 imaging and spectroscopy of at4.5 dwarf, ulasj 1452+0655, lying ~80pc distant. a further t dwarf candidate,ulasj 1301+0023, has very similar ch4 colours but has not yet been confirmedspectroscopically. we also report on the identification of a brighter l0 dwarf,and on the selection of a list of las objects designed to probe for t-likedwarfs to the survey j-band limit. our findings indicate that the combinationof the ukidss las and sdss surveys provide an excellent tool for identifying land t dwarfs down to much fainter limits than previously possible. ourdiscovery of one confirmed and one probable t dwarf in the edr is consistentwith expectations from the previously measured t dwarf density on the sky.

0810.1589	selection functions in doppler planet searches	we present a preliminary analysis of the sensitivity of anglo-australianplanet search data to the orbital parameters of extrasolar planets. to do so,we have developed new tools for the automatic analysis of large-scalesimulations of doppler velocity planet search data. one of these tools is the2-dimensional keplerian lomb-scargle periodogram, that enables thestraightforward detection of exoplanets with high eccentricities (something thestandard lomb-scargle periodogram routinely fails to do). we used thistechnique to re-determine the orbital parameters of hd20782b, with one of thehighest known exoplanet eccentricities (e=0.97+/-0.01). we also derive a set ofdetection criteria that do not depend on the distribution functions of fittedkeplerian orbital parameters (which we show are non-gaussian with pronounced,extended wings). using these tools, we examine the selection functions inorbital period, eccentricity and planet mass of anglo-australian planet searchdata for three planets with large-scale monte carlo-like simulations. we findthat the detectability of exoplanets declines at high eccentricities. however,we also find that exoplanet detectability is a strong function ofepoch-to-epoch data quality, number of observations, and period sampling. thisstrongly suggests that simple parametrisations of the detectability ofexoplanets based on "whole-of-survey" metrics may not be accurate. we havederived empirical relationships between the uncertainty estimates for orbitalparameters that are derived from least-squares keplerian fits to oursimulations, and the true 99% limits for the errors in those parameters, whichare larger than equivalent gaussian limits by factors of 5-10.
