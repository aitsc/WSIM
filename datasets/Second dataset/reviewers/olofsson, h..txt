0902.2347	co in oh/ir stars close to the galactic centre	aims: a pilot project has been carried out to measure circumstellar coemission from three oh/ir stars close to the galactic centre. the intention wasto find out whether it would be possible to conduct a large-scale survey formass-loss rates using, for example, the atacama large millimeter array (alma).such a survey would increase our understanding of the evolution of the galacticbulge.  methods: two millimetre-wave instruments were used: the nobeyama millimeterarray at 115 ghz and the submillimeter array at 230 ghz. an interferometer isnecessary as a `spatial filter' in this region of space because of theconfusion with interstellar co emission.  results: towards two of the stars, co emission was detected with positionsand radial velocities coinciding within the statistical errors with thecorresponding data of the associated oh sources. however, for one of the starsthe line profile is not what one expects for an unresolved expandingcircumstellar envelope. we believe that this co envelope is partially resolvedand that this star therefore is a foreground star not belonging to the bulge.  conclusions: the results of the observations have shown that it is possibleto detect line profiles of circumstellar co from late-type stars both withinand in the direction of the galactic bulge. alma will be able to detect coemission in short integrations with sensitivity sufficient to estimatemass-loss rates from a large number of such stars.

0903.1672	circumstellar molecular line emission from s-type agb stars: mass-loss  rates and sio abundances	the main aim is to derive reliable mass-loss rates and circumstellar sioabundances for a sample of 40 s-type agb stars based on new multi-transitionalco and sio radio line observations. in addition, the results are compared toprevious results for m-type agb stars and carbon stars to look for trends withchemical type. the circumstellar envelopes are assumed to be sphericallysymmetric and formed by a constant mass-loss rate. the mass-loss rates areestimated from fitting the co observations using a non-local, non-lte radiativetransfer code. once the physical properties of the circumstellar envelopes aredetermined, the same radiative transfer code is used to model the observed siolines in order to derive circumstellar abundances and the sizes of the sioline-emitting regions. we have estimated mass-loss rates of 40 s-type agb starsand find that the derived mass-loss rates have a distribution that resemblesthose previously derived for similar samples of m-type agb stars and carbonstars. the estimated mass-loss rates also correlate well with the correspondingexpansion velocity. in all, this indicates that the mass loss is driven by thesame mechanism in all three chemical types of agb stars. in addition, we haveestimated the circumstellar fractional abundance of sio relative to h2 in 26 ofthe sample s-type agb stars. the derived sio abundances are, on average, aboutan order of magnitude higher than predicted by stellar atmosphere thermalequilibrium chemistry, indicating that non-equilibrium chemical processesdetermines the abundance of sio in the circumstellar envelope. moreover, acomparison with the results for m-type agb stars and carbon stars show that fora certain mass-loss rate, the circumstellar sio abundance seems independent(although with a large scatter) of the c/o-ratio.

0707.0944	the abundance of sis in circumstellar envelopes around agb stars	new sis multi-transition (sub-)millimetre line observations of a sample ofagb stars with varying photospheric c/o-ratios and mass-loss rates arepresented. a combination of low- and high-energy lines are important inconstraining the circumstellar distribution of sis molecules. a detailedradiative transfer modelling of the observed sis line emission is performed,including the effect of thermal dust grains in the excitation analysis. we findthat the circumstellar fractional abundance of sis in these environments has astrong dependence on the photospheric c/o-ratio as expected from chemicalmodels. the carbon stars (c/o&gt;1) have a mean fractional abundance of 3.1e-6,about an order of magnitude higher than found for the m-type agb stars (c/o&lt;1)where the mean value is 2.7e-7. these numbers are in reasonable agreement withphotospheric lte chemical models. sis appears to behave similar to sio in termsof photodissociation in the outer part of the circumstellar envelope. incontrast to previous results for the related molecule sio, there is no strongcorrelation of the fractional abundance with density in the cse, as would bethe case if freeze-out onto dust grains were important. however, possibletime-variability of the line emission in the lower j transitions and thesensitivity of the line emission to abundance gradients in the inner part ofthe cse may mask a correlation with the density of the wind. there areindications that the sis fractional abundance could be significantly highercloser to the star which, at least in the case of m-type agb stars, wouldrequire non-equilibrium chemical processes.

0912.2673	the detached dust and gas shells around the carbon star u ant	context: geometrically thin, detached shells of gas have been found around ahandful of carbon stars. --aims: previous observations of scattered stellarlight in the circumstellar medium around the carbon star u ant were takenthrough filters centred on the resonance lines of k and na. these observationscould not separate the scattering by dust and atoms. the aim of this paper isto remedy this situation. --methods: we have obtained polarization data onstellar light scattered in the circumstellar medium around u ant throughfilters which contain no strong lines, making it possible to differentiatebetween the two scattering agents. kinematic, as well as spatial, informationon the gas shells were obtained through high-resolution echelle spectrographobservations of the ki and nad lines. --results: we confirm the existence oftwo detached shells around u ant. the inner shell (at a radius of approx 43"and a width of approx 2") consists mainly of gas, while the outer shell (at aradius of approx 50" and a width of approx 7") appears to consist exclusivelyof dust. both shells appear to have an over-all spherical geometry. the gasshell mass is estimated to be 2x10^-3 m(sun), while the mass of the dust shellis estimated to be 5x10^-5 m(sun). the derived expansion velocity, from the kiand nad lines, of the gas shell, 19.5 km/s, agrees with that obtained from coradio line data. the inferred shell age is 2700 years. there is structure, e.g.in the form of arcs, inside the gas shell, but it is not clear whether theseare due to additional shells. --conclusions: our results support the hypothesisthat the observed geometrically thin, detached shells around carbon stars arethe results of brief periods of intense mass loss, probably associated withthermal pulses, and subsequent wind-wind interactions.

1003.0362	high-resolution hst/acs images of detached shells around carbon stars	aims: the detached shells carry information on their formation process, aswell as on the small-scale structure of the circumstellar medium around agbstars due to the absence of significant line-of-sight confusion. methods: theyoungest detached shells, those around the carbon stars r scl and u cam, arestudied here in great detail in scattered stellar light with the advancedsurvey camera on the hubble space telescope. quantitative results are derivedassuming optically thin dust scattering. results: the detached dust shellsaround r scl and u cam are found to be consistent with an overall sphericalsymmetry. they have radii of 19.2" (corresponding to a linear size of 8x10^16cm) and 7.7" (5x10^16 cm), widths of 1.2" (5x10^15 cm) and 0.6" (4x10^15 cm),and dust masses of 3x10^-6 and 3x10^-7 m(sun), respectively. the dynamical agesof the r scl and u cam shells are estimated to be 1700 and 700 yr,respectively, and the shell widths correspond to time scales of 100 and 50 yr,respectively. small-scale structure in the form of less than arcsec-sizedclumps is clearly seen in the images of the r scl shell. average clump dustmasses are estimated to be about 2x10^-9 m(sun). comparisons with co lineinterferometer data show that the dust and gas shells coincide spatially,within the errors (&lt;=1" for u cam and approx. 2" for r scl). conclusions: theresults are consistent with the interpretation of geometrically thin gas anddust shells formed by a mass-loss eruption during a he-shell flash, and whereinteraction with a previous wind plays a role as well. clumpy structure ispresent in the r scl shell, possibly as a consequence of the mass loss itself,but more likely as a consequence of instabilities in the expanding shell.

1007.0905	polarisation observations of vy canis majoris water vapour 5{32}-4{41}  620.701 ghz maser emission with hifi	context: water vapour maser emission from evolved oxygen-rich stars remainspoorly understood. additional observations, including polarisation studies andsimultaneous observation of different maser transitions may ultimately lead togreater insight. aims: we have aimed to elucidate the nature and structure ofthe vy cma water vapour masers in part by observationally testing a theoreticalprediction of the relative strengths of the 620.701 ghz and the 22.235 ghzmaser components of ortho water vapour. methods: in its high-resolution mode(hrs) the herschel heterodyne instrument for the infrared (hifi) offers afrequency resolution of 0.125 mhz, corresponding to a line-of-sight velocity of0.06 km/s, which we employed to obtain the strength and linear polarisation ofmaser spikes in the spectrum of vy cma at 620.701 ghz. simultaneous groundbased observations of the 22.235 ghz maser with the max-planck-institut f\"urradioastronomie 100-meter telescope at effelsberg, provided a ratio of 620.701ghz to 22.235 ghz emission. results:we report the first astronomical detectionto date of water vapour maser emission at 620.701 ghz. in vy cma both the620.701 and the 22.235 ghz polarisation are weak. at 620.701 ghz the maserpeaks are superposed on what appears to be a broad emission component, jointlyejected asymmetrically from the star. we observed the 620.701 ghz emission attwo epochs 21 days apart, both to measure the potential direction of linearlypolarised maser components and to obtain a measure of the longevity of thesecomponents. although we do not detect significant polarisation levels in thecore of the line, they rise up to approximately 6% in its wings.

1007.1235	discovery of water vapour in the carbon star v cygni from observations  with herschel/hifi	we report the discovery of water vapour toward the carbon star v cygni. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the1(11) - 0(00) para-water transition at 1113.3430 ghz in the upper sideband ofthe band 4b receiver. the observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,but with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and theintegrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \pm 0.17 k km/s. this detection ofthermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of waterin carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-richagb star, the first having been obtained by the submillimeter wave astronomysatellite toward irc+10216. for an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,the observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) e-5 earthmasses per year and a water abundance relative to h2 of ~ (2-5) e-6. this valueis a factor of at least 1e+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance ina carbon-rich environment, and - as in irc+10216 - raises the intriguingpossibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation oforbiting comets or dwarf planets. however, observations of the single lineobserved to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatialdistribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations ofadditional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of theh2o-emitting zone, and the h2o ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to placeimportant constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.

1007.1413	herschel/hifi deepens the circumstellar nh3 enigma	circumstellar envelopes (cses) of a variety of evolved stars have been foundto contain ammonia (nh3) in amounts that exceed predictions from conventionalchemical models by many orders of magnitude. the observations reported herewere performed in order to better constrain the nh3 abundance in the cses offour, quite diverse, oxygen-rich stars using the nh3 ortho j_k = 1_0 - 0_0ground-state line. we used the heterodyne instrument for the far infraredaboard herschel to observe the nh3 j_k = 1_0 - 0_0 transition near 572.5 ghz,simultaneously with the ortho-h2o j_ka,kc = 1_1,0 -1_0,1 transition, toward vycma, oh 26.5+0.6, irc+10420, and ik tau. we conducted non-lte radiativetransfer modeling with the goal to derive the nh3 abundance in these objects'cses. for the latter two stars, very large array imaging of nh3radio-wavelength inversion lines were used to provide further constraints,particularly on the spatial extent of the nh3-emitting regions. results. wefind remarkably strong nh3 emission in all of our objects with the nh3 lineintensities rivaling those obtained for the ground state h2o line. the nh3abundances relative to h2 are very high and range from 2 x 10-7 to 3 x 10-6 forthe objects we have studied. our observations confirm and even deepen thecircumstellar nh3 enigma. while our radiative transfer modeling does not yieldsatisfactory fits to the observed line profiles, it leads to abundanceestimates that confirm the very high values found in earlier studies. new waysto tackle this mystery will include further herschel observations of more nh3lines and imaging with the expanded very large array.

1007.1536	a hifi preview of warm molecular gas around chi cyg : first detection of  h2o emission toward an s-type agb star	a set of new, sensitive, and spectrally resolved, sub-millimeter lineobservations are used to probe the warm circumstellar gas around the s-type agbstar chi cyg. the observed lines involve high rotational quantum numbers,which, combined with previously obtained lower-frequency data, make it possibleto study in detail the chemical and physical properties of, essentially, theentire circumstellar envelope of chi cyg. the data were obtained using the hifiinstrument aboard herschel, whose high spectral resolution provides valuableinformation about the line profiles. detailed, non-lte, radiative transfermodelling, including dust radiative transfer coupled with a dynamical model,has been performed to derive the temperature, density, and velocity structureof the circumstellar envelope. we report the first detection of circumstellarh2o rotational emission lines in an s-star. using the high-j co lines to derivethe parameters for the circumstellar envelope, we modelled both the ortho- andpara-h2o lines. our modelling results are consistent with the velocitystructure expected for a dust-driven wind. the derived total h2o abundance(relative to h2) is (1.1 +/- 0.2)e-5, much lower than that in o-rich stars. thederived ortho-to-para ratio of 2.1 +/- 0.6 is close to the high-temperatureequilibrium limit, consistent with h2o being formed in the photosphere.

1007.1570	herschel/hifi observations of high-j co transitions in the  protoplanetary nebula crl618	we performed herschel/hifi observations of several co lines in thefar-infrared/sub-mm in the protoplanetary nebula crl618. the high spectralresolution provided by hifi allows measurement of the line profiles. since thedynamics and structure of the nebula is well known from mm-wave interferometricmaps, it is possible to identify the contributions of the different nebularcomponents (fast bipolar outflows, double shells, compact slow shell) to theline profiles. the observation of these relatively high-energy transitionsallows an accurate study of the excitation conditions in these components,particularly in the warm ones, which cannot be properly studied from thelow-energy lines.  the 12co j=16-15, 10-9, and 6-5 lines are easily detected in this source.13co j=10-9 and 6-5 are also detected. wide profiles showing spectacular linewings have been found, particularly in 12co 16-15. other lines observedsimultaneously with co are also shown. our analysis of the co high-jtransitions, when compared with the existing models, confirms the very lowexpansion velocity of the central, dense component, which probably indicatesthat the shells ejected during the last agb phases were driven by radiationpressure under a regime of maximum transfer of momentum. no contribution of thediffuse halo found from mm-wave data is identified in our spectra, because ofits low temperature. we find that the fast bipolar outflow is quite hot, muchhotter than previously estimated; for instance, gas flowing at 100 km/s musthave a temperature higher than ~ 200 k. probably, this very fast outflow, witha kinematic age &lt; 100 yr, has been accelerated by a shock and has not yetcooled down. the double empty shell found from mm-wave mapping must also berelatively hot, in agreement with the previous estimate.

1011.2070	imaging the circumstellar dust distribution around agb stars	stellar light from an agb star is scattered by the circumstellar dust andpolarized in the direction perpendicular to the source. therefore, images ofcircumstellar envelopes around agb stars in polarized light traces the dustdistribution and can be used to search for asymmetries, and to achieve a betterunderstanding of the mechanisms at play when agb stars are transformed intoplanetary nebulae. the polcor instrument is a combined imager, polarimeter, andcoronograph providing images with an angular resolution down to 0.2". we haveused it to map the dust distribution around three agb stars: w aql, and thedetached shell sources dr ser, and u cam. w aql is a binary and we findindications of a bi-polar dust distribution around the star. the observationsof the latter two sources clearly reveal the detached shells, likely the resultof a brief, strongly enhanced mass-loss rate during the late evolution of thesestars. mapping the detached shells gives us clues to the symmetry of the massloss and important evolutionary processes.

1210.3030	unexpectedly large mass loss during the thermal pulse cycle of the red  giant r sculptoris!	the asymptotic giant branch star r sculptoris is surrounded by a detachedshell of dust and gas. the shell originates from a thermal pulse during whichthe star undergoes a brief period of increased mass loss. it has hitherto beenimpossible to constrain observationally the timescales and mass-loss propertiesduring and after a thermal pulse - parameters that determine the lifetime onthe asymptotic giant branch and the amount of elements returned by the star.here we report observations of co emission from the circumstellar envelope andshell around r sculptoris with an angular resolution of 1.3 arcsec. what washitherto thought to be only a thin, spherical shell with a clumpy structure, isrevealed to contain a spiral structure. spiral structures associated withcircumstellar envelopes have been seen previously, from which it was concludedthat the systems must be binaries. using the data, combined with hydrodynamicsimulations, we conclude that r sculptoris is a binary system that underwent athermal pulse approximately 1800 years ago, lasting approximately 200 years.about 0.003 msun of mass was ejected at a velocity of 14.3 km s-1 and at a rateapproximately 30 times higher than the prepulse mass-loss rate. this shows thatapproximately 3 times more mass is returned to the interstellar medium duringand immediately after a pulse than previously thought.

1403.2892	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel - i. the co envelope	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars lose their envelopes by means of astellar wind whose driving mechanism is not understood well. characterizing thecomposition and thermal and dynamical structure of the outflow providesconstraints that are essential for understanding agb evolution, including therate of mass loss and isotopic ratios.  we modeled the co emission from the wind of the low mass-loss rateoxygen-rich agb star w hya using data obtained by the hifi, pacs, and spireinstruments onboard the herschel space observatory and ground-based telescopes.$^{12}$co and $^{13}$co lines are used to constrain the intrinsic$^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio from resolved hifi lines.  the acceleration of the outflow up to about 5.5 km/s is quite slow and can berepresented by a beta-type velocity law with index 5. beyond this point,acceleration up the terminal velocity of 7 km/s is faster. using the j=10-9,9-8, and 6-5 transitions, we find an intrinsic $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio of$18\pm10$ for w hya, where the error bar is mostly due to uncertainties in the$^{12}$co abundance and the stellar flux around 4.6 $\mu$m. to match thelow-excitation co lines, these molecules need to be photo-dissociated at about500 stellar radii. the radial dust emission intensity profile measured by pacsimages at 70 $\mu$m shows substantially stronger emission than our modelpredicts beyond 20 arcsec.  the initial slow acceleration of the wind implies inefficient wind driving inthe lower part of the envelope. the final injection of momentum in the windmight be the result of an increase in the opacity thanks to the latecondensation of dust species. the derived intrinsic isotopologue ratio for whya is consistent with values set by the first dredge-up and suggestive of aninitial mass of 2 m$_\odot$ or more. however, the uncertainty in themain-sequence mass derived based on this isotopologic ratio is large.

1405.6404	the 12co/13co ratio in agb stars of different chemical type-connection  to the 12c/13c ratio and the evolution along the agb	the aim of this paper is to investigate the evolution of the 12c/13c ratioalong the agb through the circumstellar 12co/13co ratio. this is the first timea sample including a significant number of m- and s-type stars is analysedtogether with a carbon-star sample of equal size, making it possible toinvestigate trends among the different types and establish evolutionaryeffects. the circumstellar 12co/13co abundance ratios are estimated through adetailed radiative transfer analysis of single-dish radio line emissionobservations. first, the 12co radiative transfer is solved, assuming anabundance (dependent on the chemical type of the star), to give the physicalparameters of the gas, i.e. mass-loss rate, gas expansion velocity, and gastemperature distribution. then, the 13co radiative transfer is solved using theresults of the 12co model giving the 13co abundance. finally, the 12co/13coabundance ratio is calculated. the circumstellar 12co/13co abundance ratiodiffers between the three spectral types. this is consistent with what isexpected from stellar evolutionary models assuming that the spectral typesconstitute an evolutionary sequence; however, this is the first time this hasbeen shown observationally for a relatively large sample covering all threespectral types. the median value of the 13co abundance in the innercircumstellar envelope is 1.6x10^-5, 2.3x10^-5, and 3.0x10^-5 for the m-type,s-type, and carbon stars of the sample, respectively, corresponding to12co/13co abundance ratios of 13, 26, and 34, respectively. interestingly, theabundance ratio spread of the carbon stars is much larger than for the m- ands-type stars, even when excluding j-type carbon stars, in line with what couldbe expected from evolution on the agb. we find no correlation between theisotopologue ratio and the mass-loss rate, as would be expected if bothincrease as the star evolves.

1408.1825	detailed modelling of the circumstellar molecular line emission of the  s-type agb star w aquilae	s-type agb stars have a c/o ratio which suggests that they are transitionobjects between oxygen-rich m-type stars and carbon-rich c-type stars. as such,their circumstellar compositions of gas and dust are thought to be sensitive totheir precise c/o ratio, and it is therefore of particular interest to examinetheir circumstellar properties.  we present new herschel hifi and pacs sub-millimetre and far-infrared lineobservations of several molecular species towards the s-type agb star w aql. weuse these observations, which probe a wide range of gas temperatures, toconstrain the circumstellar properties of w aql, including mass-loss rate andmolecular abundances. we used radiative transfer codes to model thecircumstellar dust and molecular line emission to determine circumstellarproperties and molecular abundances. we assumed a spherically symmetricenvelope formed by a constant mass-loss rate driven by an accelerating wind.our model includes fully integrated h2o line cooling as part of the solution ofthe energy balance. we detect circumstellar molecular lines from co, h2o, sio,hcn, and, for the first time in an s-type agb star, nh3. the radiative transfercalculations result in an estimated mass-loss rate for w aql of 4.0e-6 msolyr-1 based on the 12co lines. the estimated 12co/13co ratio is 29, which is inline with ratios previously derived for s-type agb stars. we find an h2oabundance of 1.5e-5, which is intermediate to the abundances expected for m andc stars, and an ortho/para ratio for h2o that is consistent with formation atwarm temperatures. we find an hcn abundance of 3e-6, and, although no cn linesare detected using hifi, we are able to put some constraints on the abundance,6e-6, and distribution of cn in w aql's circumstellar envelope usingground-based data. we find an sio abundance of 3e-6, and an nh3 abundance of1.7e-5, confined to a small envelope.

1409.0396	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel. ii. the molecular envelope of w  hya	the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass ina stellar wind. understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellarwinds of agb stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products ofnucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining agb evolution and predicting thechemical evolution of galaxies. in a previous paper we have constrained thestructure of the outflowing envelope of w hya using spectral lines of the$^{12}$co molecule. here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set ofh$_{2}$o and $^{28}$sio lines observed by the three instruments on boardherschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfercode. the oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$sio abundance profile can beconnected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formationat the base of the stellar wind, respectively. the modelling of h$_{2}$o and$^{28}$sio confirms the properties of the envelope model of w hya derived from$^{12}$co lines. we find an h$_2$o ortho-to-para ratio of2.5\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an agb wind. theo$^{16}$/o$^{17}$ ratio indicates that w hya has an initial mass of about 1.5m$_\odot$. although the ortho- and para-h$_{2}$o lines observed by hifi appearto trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocityof $0.7\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the hifi lines of both spin isomers and thoseof $^{28}$sio well. the ortho- and para-h$_2^{16}$o and $^{28}$sio abundancesrelative to h$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \times10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. assuming a solarsilicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$sio line emission model is consistent withabout one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.

1505.05750	herschel observations of extreme oh/ir stars - the isotopic ratios of  oxygen as a sign-post for the stellar mass	aim: the late stages of stellar evolution are mainly governed by the mass ofthe stars. low- and intermediate-mass stars lose copious amounts of mass duringthe asymptotic giant branch (agb) which obscure the central star making itdifficult to study the stellar spectra and determine the stellar mass. in thisstudy, we present observational data that can be used to determine lower limitsto the stellar mass. method: spectra of nine heavily reddened agb stars takenby the herschel space observatory display numerous molecular emission lines.the strongest emission lines are due to h2o. we search for the presence ofisotopologues of h2o in these objects. result: we detected the 16o and 17oisotopologues of water in these stars, but lines due to h2^{18}o are absent.the lack of 18o is predicted by a scenario where the star has undergonehot-bottom burning which preferentially destroys 18o relative to 16o and 17o.from stellar evolution calculations, this process is thought to occur when thestellar mass is above 5 msun for solar metallicity. hence, observations ofdifferent isotopologues of h2o can be used to help determine the lower limit tothe initial stellar mass. conclusion: from our observations, we deduce thatthese extreme oh/ir stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses of &gt;= 5 msun.their high mass-loss rates of ~ 1.0e-4 msun/yr may affect the enrichment of theinterstellar medium and the overall chemical evolution of our galaxy.

1512.01350	a detailed view of the gas shell around r sculptoris with alma	thermal pulses are fundamental to the chemical evolution of agb stars andtheir circumstellar envelopes. a further consequence of thermal pulses is theformation of detached shells of gas and dust around the star. we aim todetermine the physical properties of the detached gas shell around rsculptoris, in particular the shell mass and temperature, and to constrain theevolution of the mass-loss rate during and after a thermal pulse. we analyseco(1-0), co(2-1), and co(3-2) emission, observed by. the spatial resolution ofthe alma data allows us to separate the detached shell emission from theextended emission inside the shell. we perform radiative transfer modelling ofboth components to determine the shell properties and the post-pulse mass-lossproperties. the alma data show a gas shell with a radius of 19.5" expanding at14.3km/s. the different scales probed by the alma cycle 0 array show that theshell must be entirely filled with gas, contrary to the idea of a detachedshell. the comparison to single-dish spectra and radiative transfer modellingconfirms this. we derive a shell mass of 4.5e-3 msun with a temperature of 50k.typical timescales for thermal pulses imply a pulse mass-loss rate of 2.3e-5msun/yr. for the post-pulse mass-loss rate, we find evidence for a gradualdecline of the mass-loss rate, with an average value of 1.6e-5 msun/yr. thetotal amount of mass lost since the last thermal pulse is 0.03 msun, a factorfour higher compared to classical models, with a sharp decline in mass-lossrate immediately after the pulse. we find that the mass-loss rate after athermal pulse has to decline more slowly than generally expected from models ofthermal pulses. this may cause the star to lose significantly more mass duringa thermal pulse cycle, which affects the chemical evolution of the star and theinterstellar medium.

astro-ph;0101477	models of circumstellar molecular radio line emission: mass loss rates  for a sample of bright carbon stars	using a detailed radiative transfer analysis, combined with an energy balanceequation for the gas, we have performed extensive modelling of circumstellar coradio line emission from a large sample of optically bright carbon stars. wedetermine some of the basic parameters that characterize circumstellarenvelopes (cses), e.g., the stellar mass loss rate, the gas expansion velocity,and the kinetic temperature structure of the gas.  the derived mass loss rates span almost four orders of magnitude, from 5e-9up to 2e-5 solar masses per year, with the median mass loss rate being 3e-7solar masses per year. we estimate that the estimated mass loss rates aretypically accurate to 50% within the adopted circumstellar model. the physicalconditions prevailing in the cses vary considerably over such a large range ofmass loss rates. among other things, it appears that the dust-to-gas mass ratioand/or the dust properties change with the mass loss rate. we find that themass loss rate and the gas expansion velocity are well correlated, and thatboth of them clearly depend on the pulsational period and (with larger scatter)the stellar luminosity. moreover, the mass loss rate correlates weakly with thestellar effective temperature, in the sense that the cooler stars tend to havehigher mass loss rates, but there seems to be no correlation with the stellarc/o-ratio. we conclude that the mass loss rate increases with increased regularpulsation and/or luminosity, and that the expansion velocity increases as aneffect of increasing mass loss rate (for low mass loss rates) and luminosity.

astro-ph;0206172	mass loss rates of a sample of irregular and semiregular m-type  agb-variables	we have determined mass loss rates and gas expansion velocities for a sampleof 69 m-type irregular (irv; 22 objects) and semiregular (srv; 47 objects)agb-variables using a radiative transfer code to model their circumstellar coradio line emission. we believe that this sample is representative for the masslosing stars of this type. the (molecular hydrogen) mass loss rate distributionhas a median value of 2.0e-7 solar masses per year. m-type irvs and srvs with amass loss rate in excess of 5e-7 solar masses per year must be very rare, andamong these mass losing stars the number of sources with mass loss rates belowa few 10e-8 solar masses per year must be small. we find no significantdifference between the irvs and the srvs in terms of their mass losscharacteristics. among the srvs the mass loss rate shows no dependence on theperiod. likewise the mass loss rate shows no correlation with the stellartemperature. the gas expansion velocity distribution has a median of 7.0 km/s.the mass loss rate and the gas expansion velocity correlate well, a result inline with theoretical predictions for an optically thin, dust-driven wind. ingeneral, the model produces line profiles which acceptably fit the observedones.  we have compared the results of this m-star sample with a similar c-starsample analysed in the same way. the mass loss rate characteristics are verysimilar for the two samples. on the contrary, the gas expansion velocitydistributions are clearly different. in particular, the number of low-velocitysources is much higher in the m-star sample. we found no example of the sharplydouble-peaked co line profile, which is evidence of a large, detached co-shell,among the m-stars. about 10% of the c-stars show this phenomenon.

astro-ph;0209526	molecular abundances in carbon-rich circumstellar envelopes	we present a millimetre molecular line survey of seven high mass loss ratecarbon stars in both the northern and southern skies. a total of 196 emissionlines (47 transitions) from 24 molecular species were detected. the observed coemission is used to determine mass-loss rates and the physical structure of thecircumstellar envelope, such as the density and temperature structure, using adetailed radiative transfer analysis. this enables abundances for the remainingmolecular species to be determined. the derived abundances generally varybetween the sources by no more than a factor of five indicating thatcircumstellar envelopes around carbon stars with high mass-loss rates havesimilar chemical compositions. however, there are some notable exceptions. themost striking difference between the abundances are reflecting the spread inthe 12c/13c-ratio of about an order of magnitude between the sample stars,mainly reflecting the results of nucleosynthesis. the abundance of sio alsoshows a variation of more than an order of magnitude between the sources and ison the average more than an order of magnitude more abundant than predictedfrom photospheric chemistry in thermal equilibrium. the over abundance of siois consistent with dynamical modelling of the stellar atmosphere and the innerparts of the wind where a pulsation-driven shock has passed. this scenario ispossibly further substantiated by the relatively low amount of cs present inthe envelopes. the chemistry occurring in the outer envelope is consistent withcurrent photochemical models.

astro-ph;0302179	`thermal' sio radio line emission towards m-type agb stars: a probe of  circumstellar dust formation and dynamics	an extensive radiative transfer analysis of circumstellar sio `thermal' radioline emission from a large sample of m-type agb stars has been performed. thesample contains 18 irregulars of type lb (irv), 7 and 34 semiregulars of typesra and srb (srv), respectively, and 12 miras. new observational material,which contains data in several sio rotational lines in the ground vibrationalstate, is presented for the irv/srvs. the detection rate was about 60%. siofractional abundances have been determined through radiative transfermodelling. the abundance distribution of the irv/srv sample has a median valueof 8e-6. the high mass loss rate miras have a bimodal abundance distribution, alow abundance group (on average 4e-7) and a high abundance group (on average7e-6). the derived sio abundances are in all cases well below the abundanceexpected from stellar atmosphere chemistry, on average by a factor of ten. inaddition, there is a trend of decreasing sio abundance with increasing massloss rate. this is interpreted in terms of depletion of sio molecules by theformation of silicate grains in the circumstellar envelopes, with an efficiencywhich increases with the mass loss rate. the sio and co radio line profilesdiffer in shape. in general, the dominating part of the sio profiles arenarrower than the co profiles, but they have low-intensity wings which coverthe full velocity range of the co profile. this is interpreted (as has beendone also by others) as due to the influence of gas acceleration in the regionwhich produces a significant fraction of the sio line emission. finally, anumber of sources which have peculiar co line profiles are discussed from thepoint of view of their sio line properties.

astro-ph;0309767	australia telescope compact array imaging of circumstellar hcn line  emission from r scl	we present radio-interferometric observations of hcn j=1-0 line emission fromthe carbon star r scl, obtained with the interim 3-mm receivers of theaustralia telescope compact array. the emission is resolved into a centralsource with a gaussian fwhm of ~1 arcsec, which we identify as the present massloss envelope. using a simple photodissociation model and constraints fromsingle-dish hcn spectra, we argue that the present mass-loss rate is low, ~2 x10^{-7} msol/yr, supporting the idea that r scl had to experience a briefepisode of intense mass loss in order to produce the detached co shell at ~10arcsec radius inferred from single-dish observations. detailed radiativetransfer modelling yields an abundance of hcn relative to h_2, of ~10^{-5} inthe present-day wind. there appears to be a discrepancy between model resultsobtained with higher transition single-dish data included and those from thej=1-0 interferometer data alone, in that the interferometer data suggest asmaller envelope size and larger hcn abundance than the single-dish data. thelack of hcn in the detached shell is consistent with the rapidphotodissociation of hcn into cn as it expands away from the star.

astro-ph;0404243	probing the inner wind of agb stars: interferometric observations of sio  millimetre line emission from the oxygen-rich stars r dor and l2 pup	high angular resolution australia telescope compact array (atca) observationsof sio `thermal' millimetre line emission towards the two oxygen-rich, low massloss rate agb stars r dor and l2 pup are presented. in both cases the emissionis resolved with an overall spherical symmetry. detailed radiative transfermodelling of the sio line emission has been performed, and the comparisonbetween observations and models are conducted in the visibility plane,maximizing the sensitivity. the excitation analysis suggests that the abundanceof sio is as high as 4e-5 in the inner part of the wind, close to the predictedvalues from stellar atmosphere models. beyond a radius of ~ 1e15 cm the sioabundance is significantly lower, about 3e-6, until it decreases strongly at aradius of about 3e15 cm. this is consistent with a scenario where sio firstfreezes out onto dust grains, and then eventually becomes photodissociated bythe interstellar uv-radiation field. in these low expansion velocity sourcesthe turbulent broadening of the lines plays an important role in the lineformation. micro-turbulent velocity widths in the range 1.1-1.5 km/s result ina very good reproduction of the observed line shapes even if the gas expansionvelocity is kept constant. this, combined with the fact that the sio and colines are well fitted using the same gas expansion velocity (to within 5-10%),suggest that the envelope acceleration occurs close to the stellar photosphere,within 20-30 stellar radii.

astro-ph;0503245	properties of detached shells around carbon stars: evidence of  interacting winds	the nature of the mechanism responsible for producing the spectacular,geometrically thin, spherical shells found around some carbon stars has been anenigma for some time. based on extensive radiative transfer modelling of bothco line emission and dust continuum radiation for all objects with knowndetached molecular shells, we present compelling evidence that these shellsshow clear signs of interaction with a surrounding medium. the derived massesof the shells increase with radial distance from the central star while theirvelocities decrease. a simple model for interacting winds indicate that themass-loss rate producing the faster moving wind has to be almost two orders ofmagnitudes higher (~10^-5 solar masses per year) than the slower agb wind (afew 10^-7 solar masses per year) preceding this violent event. at the sametime, the present-day mass-loss rates are very low indicating that the epoch ofhigh mass-loss rate was relatively short, on the order of a few hundred years.this, together with the number of sources exhibiting this phenomenon, suggestsa connection with he-shell flashes (thermal pulses). we report the detection ofa detached molecular shell around the carbon star dr ser, as revealed from newsingle-dish co (sub-)millimetre line observations. the properties of the shellare similar to those characterising the young shell around u cam.
