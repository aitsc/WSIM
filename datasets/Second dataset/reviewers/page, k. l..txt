0902.0301	optical and x-ray observations of m31n 2007-12b: an extragalactic  recurrent nova with a detected progenitor?	we report combined optical and x-ray observations of nova m31n 2007-12b.optical spectroscopy obtained 5 days after the 2007 december outburst showsevidence of very high ejection velocities (fwhm h$\alpha \simeq 4500$ kms$^{-1}$). in addition, swift x-ray data show that m31n 2007-12b is associatedwith a super-soft source (sss) which appeared between 21 and 35 dayspost-outburst and turned off between then and day 169. our analysis impliesthat $m_{\rm wd} \ga 1.3 $m$_{\odot}$ in this system. the optical light curve,spectrum and x-ray behaviour are consistent with those of a recurrent nova.hubble space telescope observations of the pre-outburst location of m31n2007-12b reveal the presence of a coincident stellar source with magnitude andcolor very similar to the galactic recurrent nova rs ophiuchi at quiescence,where the red giant secondary dominates the emission. we believe that this isthe first occasion on which a nova progenitor system has been identified inm31. however, the greatest similarities of outburst optical spectrum and sssbehaviour are with the supposed galactic recurrent nova v2491 cygni. apreviously implied association of m31n 2007-12b with nova m31n 1969-08a isshown to be erroneous and this has important lessons for future searches forrecurrent novae in extragalactic systems. overall, we show that suitablecomplementary x-ray and optical observations can be used not only to identifyrecurrent nova candidates in m31, but also to determine subtypes and importantphysical parameters of these systems. prospects are therefore good forextending studies of recurrent novae into the local group with the potential toexplore in more detail such important topics as their proposed link to type iasupernovae.

0902.2199	swift x-ray and uv monitoring of the classical nova v458 vul (nova vul  2007)	we describe the highly variable x-ray and uv emission of v458 vul (nova vul2007), observed by swift between 1 and 422 days after outburst. initiallybright only in the uv, v458 vul became a variable hard x-ray source due tooptically thin thermal emission at kt=0.64 kev with an x-ray band unabsorbedluminosity of 2.3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} during days 71-140. the x-ray spectrum atthis time requires a low fe abundance (0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.1} solar), consistentwith a suzaku measurement around the same time. on day 315 we find a new x-rayspectral component which can be described by a blackbody with temperature ofkt=23^{+9}_{-5} ev, while the previous hard x-ray component has declined by afactor of 3.8. the spectrum of this soft x-ray component resembles thosetypically seen in the class of supersoft sources (sss) which suggests that thenova ejecta were starting to clear and/or that the wd photosphere is shrinkingto the point at which its thermal emission reaches into the x-ray band. we finda high degree of variability in the soft component with a flare rising by anorder of magnitude in count rate in 0.2 days. in the following observations ondays 342.4-383.6, the soft component was not seen, only to emerge again on day397. the hard component continued to evolve, and we found an anticorrelationbetween the hard x-ray emission and the uv emission, yielding a spearman rankprobability of 97%. after day 397, the hard component was still present, wasvariable, and continued to fade at an extremely slow rate but could not beanalysed owing to pile up contamination from the bright sss component.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0909.5109	swift/xrt monitoring of the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j18483-0311 for an entire orbital period	igr j18483-0311 is an x-ray pulsar with transient x-ray activity, belongingto the new class of high mass x-ray binaries called supergiant fast x-raytransients. this system is one of the two members of this class, together withigr j11215-5952, where both the orbital (18.52d) and spin period (21s) areknown. we report on the first complete monitoring of the x-ray activity alongan entire orbital period of a supergiant fast x-ray transient. these swiftobservations, lasting 28d, cover more than one entire orbital phaseconsecutively. they are a unique data-set, which allows us to constrain thedifferent mechanisms proposed to explain the nature of this new class of x-raytransients. we applied the new clumpy wind model for blue supergiants developedby ducci et al. (2009), to the observed x-ray light curve. assuming aneccentricity of e=0.4, the x-ray emission from this source can be explained interms of the accretion from a spherically symmetric clumpy wind, composed ofclumps with different masses, ranging from 10^{18}g to 5x 10^{21}g.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1004.2919	discovery of the nearby long, soft grb 100316d with an associated  supernova	we report the swift discovery of nearby long, soft gamma-ray burst grb100316d, and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy andassociated supernova. we derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb-sn. we study the extremelyunusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to x-ray spectroscopy, andfind that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition toa synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. the x-ray light curvehas a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. the host is a bright,blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south, vlt andhst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. wecompare and contrast the x-ray emission and host galaxy of grb 100316d to asubsample of grb-sne. grb 100316d is unlike the majority of grb-sne in itsx-ray evolution, but resembles rather grb 060218, and we find that these twoevents have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.comparison of the host galaxies of grb-sne demonstrates, however, that there isa great diversity in the environments in which grb-sne can be found. grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample ofspectroscopically confirmed grb-sne, from which a better understanding of longgrb progenitors and the grb--sn connection can be gleaned.

1004.5099	grb 090926a and bright late-time fermi lat grb afterglows	grb 090926a was detected by both the gbm and lat instruments on-board thefermi gamma-ray space telescope. swift follow-up observations began ~13 hoursafter the initial trigger. the optical afterglow was detected for nearly 23days post trigger, placing it in the long lived category. the afterglow is ofparticular interest due to its brightness at late times, as well as thepresence of optical flares at t0+10^5 s and later, which may indicate late-timecentral engine activity. the lat has detected a total of 16 grbs; 9 of thesebursts, including grb 090926a, also have been observed by swift. of the 9 swiftobserved lat bursts, 6 were detected by uvot, with 5 of the bursts havingbright, long-lived optical afterglows. in comparison, swift has been operatingfor 5 years and has detected nearly 500 bursts, but has only seen ~30% ofbursts with optical afterglows that live longer than 10^5 s. we have calculatedthe predicted gamma-ray fluence, as would have been seen by the bat on-boardswift, of the lat bursts to determine whether this high percentage oflong-lived optical afterglows is unique, when compared to bat-triggered bursts.we find that, with the exception of the short burst grb 090510a, the predictedbat fluences indicate the lat bursts are more energetic than 88% of all swiftbursts, and also have brighter than average x-ray and optical afterglows.

0708.1383	grb 070311: a direct link between the prompt emission and the afterglow	we present prompt gamma-ray, early nir/optical, late optical and x-rayobservations of the peculiar grb 070311 discovered by integral, in order togain clues on the mechanisms responsible for the prompt gamma-ray pulse as wellas for the early and late multi-band afterglow of grb 070311. we fitted withempirical functions the gamma-ray and optical light curves and scaled theresult to the late time x-rays. the h-band light curve taken by rem shows twopulses peaking 80 and 140 s after the peak of the gamma-ray burst and possiblyaccompanied by a faint gamma-ray tail. remarkably, the late optical and x-rayafterglow underwent a major rebrightening between 3x10^4 and 2x10^5 s after theburst with an x-ray fluence comparable with that of the prompt emissionextrapolated in the same band. notably, the time profile of the laterebrightening can be described as the combination of a time-rescaled version ofthe prompt gamma-ray pulse and an underlying power law. this result supports acommon origin for both prompt and late x-ray/optical afterglow rebrightening ofgrb 070311 within the external shock scenario. the main fireball would beresponsible for the prompt emission, while a second shell would produce therebrightening when impacting the leading blastwave in a refreshed shock(abridged).

1007.2185	the unusual x-ray emission of the short swift grb 090515: evidence for  the formation of a magnetar?	the majority of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to originate fromthe merger of compact binary systems collapsing directly to form a black hole.however, it has been proposed that both sgrbs and long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)may, on rare occasions, form an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) prior tofinal collapse. grb 090515, detected by the swift satellite was extremelyshort, with a t_90 of 0.036 +/- 0.016 s, and had a very low fluence of 2 x10^-8 erg cm^-2 and faint optical afterglow. despite this, the 0.3 - 10 kevflux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a sgrb by the swift x-raytelescope (xrt). the x-ray light curve showed an unusual plateau and steepdecay, becoming undetectable after ~500 s. this behaviour is similar to thatobserved in some long bursts proposed to have magnetars contributing to theiremission. in this paper, we present the swift observations of grb 090515 andcompare it to other gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the swift sample. additionally,we present optical observations from gemini, which detected an afterglow ofmagnitude 26.4 +/- 0.1 at t+ 1.7 hours after the burst. we discuss potentialcauses of the unusual 0.3 - 10 kev emission and suggest it might be energyinjection from an unstable millisecond pulsar. using the duration and flux ofthe plateau of grb 090515, we place constraints on the millisecond pulsar spinperiod and magnetic field.

0708.3553	a study of the prompt and afterglow emission of the short grb 061201	our knowledge of the intrinsic properties of short duration gamma-ray burstshas relied, so far, only upon a few cases for which the estimate of thedistance and an extended, multiwavelength monitoring of the afterglow have beenobtained. we carried out multiwavelength observations of the short grb 061201aimed at estimating its distance and studying its properties. we performed aspectral and timing analysis of the prompt and afterglow emission and discussthe results in the context of the standard fireball model. a clear temporalbreak was observed in the x-ray light curve about 40 minutes after the bursttrigger. we find that the spectral and timing behaviour of the x-ray afterglowis consistent with a jet origin of the observed break, although the opticaldata can not definitively confirm this and other scenarios are possible. nounderlying host galaxy down to r~26 mag was found after fading of the opticalafterglow. thus, no secure redshift could be measured for this burst. thenearest galaxy is at z=0.111 and shows evidence of star formation activity. wediscuss the association of grb 061201 with this galaxy and with the aco s 995galaxy cluster, from which the source is at an angular distance of 17'' and8.5', respectively. we also test the association with a possible undetected,positionally consistent galaxy at z~1. in all these cases, in the jetinterpretation, we find a jet opening angle of 1-2 degrees.

1010.6212	a statistical comparison of the optical/uv and x-ray afterglows of  gamma-ray bursts using the swift ultra-violet optical and x-ray telescopes	we present the systematic analysis of the uvot and xrt light curves for asample of 26 swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs). by comparing the optical/uv andx-ray light curves, we found that they are remarkably different during thefirst 500s after the bat trigger, while they become more similar during themiddle phase of the afterglow, i.e. between 2000s and 20000s. if we takeliterally the average properties of the sample, we find that the mean temporalindices observed in the optical/uv and x-rays after 500s are consistent with aforward-shock scenario, under the assumptions that electrons are in the slowcooling regime, the external medium is of constant density and the synchrotroncooling frequency is situated between the optical/uv and x-ray observing bands.while this scenario describes well the averaged observed properties, someindividual grb afterglows require different or additional assumptions, such asthe presence of late energy injection. we show that a chromatic break (a breakin the x-ray light curve that is not seen in the optical) is present in theafterglows of 3 grbs and demonstrate evidence for chromatic breaks in a further4 grbs. the average properties of these breaks cannot be explained in terms ofthe passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the observed bands,nor a simple change in the external density. it is difficult to reconcilechromatic breaks in terms of a single component outflow and instead, morecomplex jet structure or additional emission components are required.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1105.2717	from x-ray dips to eclipse: witnessing disk reformation in the recurrent  nova usco	the 10th recorded outburst of the recurrent eclipsing nova usco was observedsimultaneously in x-ray, uv, and optical by xmm-newton on days 22.9 and 34.9after outburst. two full passages of the companion in front of the nova ejectawere observed, witnessing the reformation of the accretion disk. on day 22.9,we observed smooth eclipses in uv and optical but deep dips in the x-ray lightcurve which disappeared by day 34.9, then yielding clean eclipses in all bands.x-ray dips can be caused by clumpy absorbing material that intersects the lineof sight while moving along highly elliptical trajectories. cold material fromthe companion could explain the absence of dips in uv and optical light. thedisappearance of x-ray dips before day 34.9 implies significant progress in theformation of the disk. the x-ray spectra contain photospheric continuumemission plus strong emission lines, but no clear absorption lines. bothcontinuum and emission lines in the x-ray spectra indicate a temperatureincrease from day 22.9 to day 34.9. we find clear evidence in the spectra andlight curves for thompson scattering of the photospheric emission from thewhite dwarf. photospheric absorption lines can be smeared out during scatteringin a plasma of fast electrons. we also find spectral signatures of resonantline scattering that lead to the observation of the strong emission lines.their dominance could be a general phenomenon in high-inclination systems suchas cal87.

1105.3015	an unusual stellar death on christmas day	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most dramatic examples of massivestellar deaths, usually as- sociated with supernovae (woosley et al. 2006).they release ultra-relativistic jets producing non-thermal emission throughsynchrotron radiation as they interact with the surrounding medium (zhang etal. 2004). here we report observations of the peculiar grb 101225a (the"christmas burst"). its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long and followedby a bright x-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual opticalcounterpart. during the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as anexpanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistentwith a faint supernova, emerged. we determine its distance to 1.6 gpc byfitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the opticalemission with a grb-supernova template. deep optical observations may haverevealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. our proposed progenitor is a heliumstar-neutron star merger that underwent a common envelope phase expelling itshydrogen envelope. the resulting explosion created a grb-like jet which getsthermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material and thuscreating the observed black-body, until finally the emission from the supernovadominated. an alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutronstar in the galaxy (campana et al. 2011).

1106.2824	swift observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs  ophiuchi: iii. x-ray spectral modelling	following the swift x-ray observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrentnova rs ophiuchi, we developed hydrodynamical models of mass ejection fromwhich the forward shock velocities were used to estimate the ejecta mass andvelocity. in order to further constrain our model parameters, here we presentsynthetic x-ray spectra from our hydrodynamical calculations which we compareto the swift data. an extensive set of simulations was carried out to find amodel which best fits the spectra up to 100 days after outburst. we find a goodfit at high energies but require additional absorption to match the low energyemission. we estimate the ejecta mass to be in the range (2-5) x 10^{-7} solarmasses and the ejection velocity to be greater than 6000 km/s (and probablycloser to 10,000 km/s). we also find that estimates of shock velocity derivedfrom gas temperatures via standard model fits to the x-ray spectra are muchlower than the true shock velocities.

1108.5049	recovering swift-xrt energy resolution through ccd charge trap mapping	the x-ray telescope on board the swift satellite for gamma-ray burstastronomy has been exposed to the radiation of the space environment sincelaunch in november 2004. radiation causes damage to the detector, with thegeneration of dark current and charge trapping sites that result in thedegradation of the spectral resolution and an increase of the instrumentalbackground. the swift team has a dedicated calibration program with the goal ofrecovering a significant proportion of the lost spectroscopic performance.calibration observations of supernova remnants with strong emission lines areanalysed to map the detector charge traps and to derive position-dependentcorrections to the measured photon energies. we have achieved a substantialrecovery in the xrt resolution by implementing these corrections in an updatedversion of the swift xrt gain file and in corresponding improvements to theswift xrt heasoft software. we provide illustrations of the impact of theenhanced energy resolution, and show that we have recovered most of thespectral resolution lost since launch.

1109.6019	is cgcs 5926 a symbiotic x-ray binary?	we here report on multiwavelength (x-ray to optical) followup observations ofcarbon star cgcs 5926. these were motivated by the fact that this star ispositionally coincident with a faint x-ray emitting object belonging to therosat catalog of sources, thus suggesting a possible symbiotic x-ray binary(syxb) nature for it. our spectrophotometric optical data confirm the giantcarbon star nature of the object and allow us to classify its spectral type asc(6,2). this classification places cgcs 5926 at a distance of about 5 kpc fromearth. bvrcic photometry of the star shows that it displays a variability ofabout 0.3 mag on timescales of months, with the star getting bluer when itsbrightness increases. our photometric data indicate a periodicity of 151 days,which we explain as due to radial pulsations of cgcs 5926 on the basis of itsglobal characteristics. the source is not detected at x-rays with swift/xrtdown to a 0.3-10 kev band luminosity of around 3e32 erg/s. this nondetection isapparently in contrast with the rosat data; however we show that, even if theprobability that cgcs 5926 can be a syxb appears quite low, the presentinformation does not completely rule out such a possibility, while it makesother interpretations even more unlikely if we assume that the rosat detectionwas real. this issue might thus be settled by future, more sensitive,observations at high energies.

1110.6224	swift x-ray observations of classical novae. ii. the super soft source  sample	the swift grb satellite is an excellent facility for studying novae. itsrapid response time and sensitive x-ray detector provides an unparalleledopportunity to investigate the previously poorly sampled evolution of novae inthe x-ray regime. this paper presents swift observations of 52galactic/magellanic cloud novae. we included the xrt (0.3-10 kev) x-rayinstrument count rates and the uvot (1700-8000 angstroms) filter photometry.also included in the analysis are the publicly available pointed observationsof 10 additional novae the x-ray archives. this is the largest x-ray sample ofgalactic/magellanic cloud novae yet assembled and consists of 26 novae withsuper soft x-ray emission, 19 from swift observations. the data set shows thatthe faster novae have an early hard x-ray phase that is usually missing inslower novae. the super soft x-ray phase occurs earlier and does not last aslong in fast novae compared to slower novae. all the swift novae withsufficient observations show that novae are highly variable with rapidvariability and different periodicities. in the majority of cases, nuclearburning ceases less than 3 years after the outburst begins. previousrelationships, such as the nuclear burning duration vs. t_2 or the expansionvelocity of the eject and nuclear burning duration vs. the orbital period, areshown to be poorly correlated with the full sample indicating that additionalfactors beyond the white dwarf mass and binary separation play important rolesin the evolution of a nova outburst. finally, we confirm two optical phenomenathat are correlated with strong, soft x-ray emission which can be used tofurther increase the efficiency of x-ray campaigns.

0710.3727	a universal grb photon energy-peak luminosity relation	the energetics and emission mechanism of grbs are not well understood. herewe demonstrate that the instantaneous peak flux or equivalent isotropic peakluminosity, l_iso ergs s^-1, rather than the integrated fluence or equivalentisotropic energy, e_iso ergs, underpins the known high-energy correlations.using new spectral/temporal parameters calculated for 101 bursts with redshiftsfrom batse, bepposax, hete-ii and swift we describe a parameter space whichcharacterises the apparently diverse properties of the prompt emission. we showthat a source frame characteristic-photon-energy/peak luminosity ratio, k_z,can be constructed which is constant within a factor of 2 for all burstswhatever their duration, spectrum, luminosity and the instrumentation used todetect them. the new parameterization embodies the amati relation but indicatesthat some correlation between e_peak and e_iso follows as a direct mathematicalinference from the band function and that a simple transformation of e_iso tol_iso yields a universal high energy correlation for grbs. the existence of k_zindicates that the mechanism responsible for the prompt emission from all grbsis probably predominantly thermal.

1112.3965	swift follow-up observations of unclassified asca sources	we present swift follow-up observations of a sample of 35 unclassified faintx-ray sources drawn from the asca galactic centre and plane surveys. our shortpointed xrt observations allow detections down to a limiting 0.3-10 kev flux of~1e-13 erg cm-2 s-1, which translates into a luminosity of ~1e33 erg s-1 for anassumed distance of d=8 kpc. the brightest source in our sample reaches amaximum 0.3-10 kev luminosity of ~2e36 (d/8kpc)^2 erg s-1 during ourobservations. we detect 16 (46%) of the asca sources with the xrt, while 19were not detected during our program. since we are probing the faint end of theasca source populations, we expect a large fraction of the non-detections to bedue to the eddington bias. this is strengthened by the fact that we find theobserved xrt count rates to be predominantly lower than expected based on thereported asca intensities. investigation of the asca properties and long-termx-ray variability leads us to conclude that the non-detections likely includetwo spurious asca detections and three objects that are variable or transientx-ray sources. for the 16 xrt-detected sources we obtain positional accuraciesof ~2-4", which significantly improves upon their asca uncertainties of ~1'. weuse the x-ray spectra and variability to characterise these objects. mostappear to be faint, persistent x-ray emitters that have highly absorbedspectra. based on their x-ray properties we identify three accreting compactobjects: one confirmed (ax j1754.2-2754) and one candidate (ax j1538.3-5541)x-ray binary, and one possible magnetically accreting white dwarf (axj1620.1-5002). furthermore, we use the improved positions of xrt-detectedsources to search for counterparts in simultaneously obtained swift/uvot imagesand possible associations with cataloged sources at various wavelengths. thisreveals three possible main sequence stars amongst our sample.

1207.1444	a search for thermal x-ray signatures in gamma-ray bursts i: swift  bursts with optical supernovae	the x-ray spectra of gamma-ray bursts can generally be described by anabsorbed power law. the landmark discovery of thermal x-ray emission inaddition to the power law in the unusual grb 060218, followed by a similardiscovery in grb 100316d, showed that during the first thousand seconds aftertrigger the soft x-ray spectra can be complex. both the origin and prevalenceof such spectral components still evade understanding, particularly after thediscovery of thermal x-ray emission in the classical grb 090618. possibly mostimportantly, these three objects are all associated with optical supernovae,begging the question of whether the thermal x-ray components could be a resultof the grb-sn connection, possibly in the shock breakout. we thereforeperformed a search for blackbody components in the early swift x-ray spectra of11 grbs that have or may have associated optical supernovae, accuratelyrecovering the thermal components reported in the literature for grbs 060218,090618 and 100316d. we present the discovery of a cooling blackbody in grb101219b/sn2010ma, and in four further grb-sne we find an improvement in the fitwith a blackbody which we deem possible blackbody candidates due tocase-specific caveats. all the possible new blackbody components we report lieat the high end of the luminosity and radius distribution. grb 101219b appearsto bridge the gap between the low-luminosity and the classical grb-sne withthermal emission, and following the blackbody evolution we derive an expansionvelocity for this source of order 0.4c. we discuss potential origins for thethermal x-ray emission in our sample, including a cocoon model which we findcan accommodate the more extreme physical parameters implied by many of ourmodel fits.

0711.3753	swift captures the spectrally evolving prompt emission of grb 070616	the origins of gamma-ray burst prompt emission are currently not wellunderstood and in this context long, well-observed events are particularlyimportant to study. we present the case of grb 070616, analysing theexceptionally long-duration multipeaked prompt emission, and later afterglow,captured by all the instruments on-board swift and by suzaku wam. the highenergy light curve remained generally flat for several hundred seconds beforegoing into a steep decline. spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearlytaking place throughout the prompt emission, beginning at 285 s after thetrigger and extending to 1200 s. we track the movement of the spectral peakenergy, whilst observing a softening of the low energy spectral slope. thesteep decline in flux may be caused by a combination of this strong spectralevolution and the curvature effect. we investigate origins for the spectralevolution, ruling out a superposition of two power laws and considering insteadan additional component dominant during the late prompt emission. we alsodiscuss origins for the early optical emission and the physics of theafterglow. the case of grb 070616 clearly demonstrates that both broadbandcoverage and good time resolution are crucial to pin down the origins of thecomplex prompt emission in grbs.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1407.6944	searching for highly obscured agn in the xmm-newton serendipitous source  catalog	the majority of active galactic nuclei (agn) are obscured by large amounts ofabsorbing material that makes them invisible at many wavelengths. x-rays, giventheir penetrating power, provide the most secure way for finding these agn. thexmm-newton serendipitous source catalog is the largest catalog of x-ray sourcesever produced; it contains about half a million detections. these sources aremostly agn. we have derived x-ray spectral fits for very many 3xmm-dr4 sources($\gtrsim$ 114 000 observations, corresponding to $\sim$ 77 000 uniquesources), which contain more than 50 source photons per detector. here, we usea subsample of $\simeq$ 1000 agn in the footprint of the sdss area (covering120 deg$^2$) with available spectroscopic redshifts. we searched for highlyobscured agn by applying an automated selection technique based on x-rayspectral analysis that is capable of efficiently selecting agn. the selectionis based on the presence of either a) flat rest-frame spectra; b) flat observedspectra; c) an absorption turnover, indicative of a high rest-frame columndensity; or d) an fe k$\alpha$ line with an equivalent width &gt; 500 ev. we found81 highly obscured candidate sources. subsequent detailed manual spectral fitsrevealed that 28 of them are heavily absorbed by column densities higher than10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. of these 28 agn, 15 are candidate compton-thick agn on thebasis of either a high column density, consistent within the 90% confidencelevel with n$_{\rm h}$ $&gt;$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, or a large equivalent width(&gt;500 ev) of the fe k$\alpha$ line. another six are associated withnear-compton-thick agn with column densities of $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. a combination of selection criteria a) and c) for low-qualityspectra, and a) and d) for medium- to high-quality spectra, pinpoint highlyabsorbed agn with an efficiency of 80%.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1509.04004	swift detection of the super-swift switch-on of the super-soft phase in  nova v745 sco (2014)	v745 sco is a recurrent nova, with the most recent eruption occurring infebruary 2014. v745 sco was first observed by swift a mere 3.7 hr after theannouncement of the optical discovery, with the super-soft x-ray emission beingdetected around four days later and lasting for only ~two days, making it boththe fastest follow-up of a nova by swift and the earliest switch-on ofsuper-soft emission yet detected. such an early switch-on time suggests acombination of a very high velocity outflow and low ejected mass and, togetherwith the high effective temperature reached by the super-soft emission, a highmass white dwarf (&gt;1.3 m_sun). the x-ray spectral evolution was followed froman early epoch where shocked emission was evident, through the entirety of thesuper-soft phase, showing evolving column density, emission lines, absorptionedges and thermal continuum temperature. uv grism data were also obtainedthroughout the super-soft interval, with the spectra showing mainly emissionlines from lower ionization transitions and the balmer continuum in emission.v745 sco is compared with both v2491 cyg (another nova with a very shortsuper-soft phase) and m31n 2008-12a (the most rapidly recurring nova yetdiscovered). the longer recurrence time compared to m31n 2008-12a could be dueto a lower mass accretion rate, although inclination of the system may alsoplay a part. nova v745 sco (2014) revealed the fastest evolving super-softsource phase yet discovered, providing a detailed and informative dataset forstudy.

astro-ph;0210140	serendipitous agn in the xmm-newton fields of markarian 205 and qso  0130-403	the x-ray spectra of serendipitously observed agn in the xmm-newton fields ofmrk 205 and qso 0130-403 are analysed. the sample consists of 23 objects, noneof which is detected at radio frequencies, with a median x-ray luminosity of ~4 x 10^44 erg s^-1 and redshifts ranging from ~0.1 to just over 3. the meanphoton index was found to be 1.89 +/- 0.04. in contrast to past asca and rosatobservations of high-redshift radio-loud quasars, we find little evidence forexcess intrinsic absorption in these radio-quiet objects, with only threesources requiring a column density in excess of the galactic value. comparingthe measured spectral indices over the redshift range, we also find there is nox-ray spectral evolution of qsos with time, up to redshift 3. within the samplethere is no evidence for evolution of the optical to x-ray spectral index,alpha-ox, with redshift, the mean value being -1.66 +/- 0.04. however, uponcomparing the values from the bright quasar survey at low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)and high redshift qsos detected by chandra (z &gt; 4), a slight steepening ofalpha-ox is noted for the more distant objects. in most of the sources there isno significant requirement for a soft excess, although a weak thermal component(&lt; 10% of lx) cannot be excluded. there is an indication of spectral flattening(by delta gamma=0.2) at higher energies (&gt; 3 kev, qso rest frame) for thesample as a whole. this is consistent with the presence of a compton reflectioncomponent in these radio-quiet agn, with the scattering medium (such as anaccretion disc or molecular torus) occupying a solid angle of 2 pi steradiansto the x-ray source.

astro-ph;0210288	a simultaneous xmm-newton and bepposax observation of the archetypal  broad line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548	we report the spectral analysis of a long xmm-newton observation of thewell-studied, moderate luminosity broad line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548. thesource was at an historically average brightness and we find the hard (3-10kev) spectrum can be well fitted by a power law of photon index gamma ~ 1.75,together with reflection. the only feature in the hard x-ray spectrum is anarrow emission line near 6.4 kev, with an equivalent width of ~ 60 ev. theenergy and strength of this line is consistent with fluorescence from `neutral'iron distant from the central continuum source. we find no evidence for a broadfe k line, with an upper limit well below previous reports, suggesting theinner accretion disc is now absent or highly ionised. the addition ofsimultaneous bepposax data allows the analysis to be extended to 200 kev,yielding important constraints on the total reflection. extrapolation of thehard x-ray power law down to 0.3 kev shows a clear `soft excess' below ~ 0.7kev. after due allowance for the effects of a complex warm absorber, measuredwith the xmm-newton rgs, we find the soft excess is better described as asmooth upward curvature in the continuum flux below ~ 2 kev. the soft excesscan be modelled either by comptonised thermal emission or by enhancedreflection from the surface of a highly ionised disc.

astro-ph;0302151	fe k emission and absorption features in xmm-newton spectra of mkn 766 -  evidence for reprocessing in flare ejecta	we report on the analysis of a long xmm-newton epic observation in 2001 mayof the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy mkn 766. the 3-11 kev spectrum exhibits amoderately steep power law continuum, with a broad emission line at ~6.7 kev,probably blended with a narrow line at ~6.4 kev, and a broad absorption troughabove ~8.7 kev. we identify both broad spectral features with reprocessing inhe-like fe. an earlier xmm-newton observation of mkn 766 in 2000 may, when thesource was a factor ~2 fainter, shows a similar broad emission line, but with aslightly flatter power law and absorption at a lower energy. in neitherobservation do we find a requirement for the previously reported broad 'redwing' to the line and hence of reflection from the innermost accretion disc.more detailed examination of the longer xmm-newton observation reveals evidencefor rapid spectral variability in the fe k band, apparently linked with theoccurrence of x-ray 'flares'. a reduction in the emission line strength andincreased high energy absorption during the x-ray flaring suggests that thesetransient effects are due to highly ionised ejecta associated with the flares.simple scaling from the flare avalanche model proposed for the luminous qso pds456 (reeves etal. 2002) confirms the feasibility of coherent flaring being thecause of the strong peaks seen in the x-ray light curve of \mkn.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

astro-ph;0510566	swift and optical observations of grb 050401	we present the results of the analysis of gamma-ray and x-ray data of grb050401 taken with the swift satellite, together with a series of ground-basedfollow-up observations. the swift x-ray light curve shows a clear break atabout 4900 seconds after the grb. the decay indices before and after the breakare consistent with a scenario of continuous injection of radiation from the'central engine' of the grb to the fireball. alternatively, this behaviourcould result if ejecta are released with a range of lorentz factors with theslower shells catching up the faster at the afterglow shock position. the twoscenarios are observationally indistinguishable. the grb 050401 afterglow isquite bright in the x-ray band but weak in the optical, with an optical tox-ray flux ratio similar to those of 'dark bursts'. we detect a significantamount of absorption in the x-ray spectrum, with n_h = (1.7 +/- 0.2) x 10^22cm^-2 at a redshift of z=2.9, which is typical of a dense circumbust medium.such high column density implies an unrealistic optical extinction of 30magnitudes if we adopt the galactic extinction law, which would not consistentwith optical detection of the afterglow. this suggests that the extinction lawis different from the galactic one.

astro-ph;0510677	swift observations of the x-ray bright grb 050315	this paper discusses swift observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 050315(z=1.949) from 80 s to 10 days after the onset of the burst. the x-ray lightcurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.however, both the prompt hard x-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the bat)and the first ~ 300 s of x-ray emission (observed by the xrt) can be explainedby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. extrapolating the batlight curve into the xrt band suggests the rapidly decaying, early x-rayemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strongsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray emission may be relatedto the simple temporal and spectral character of this x-ray rich grb. theprompt (bat) spectrum was a steep down to 15 kev, and appeared to continuethrough the xrt bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with theamati relation. following the initial steep decline the x-ray afterglow did notfade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index ofalpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.the apparent `plateau' in the x-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep x-ray lightcurves revealed by swift. if the second afterglow break is identified with ajet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying e_gamma&gt; 10^50 erg.

astro-ph;0512358	grb 050911: a black hole - neutron star merger or a naked grb	grb 050911, discovered by the swift burst alert telescope, was not seen 4.6hr later by the swift x-ray telescope, making it one of the very few x-raynon-detections of a gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow at early times. thegamma-ray light-curve shows at least three peaks, the first two of which (~t_0- 0.8 and t_0 + 0.2 s, where t_0 is the trigger time) were short, each lasting0.5 s. this was followed by later emission 10-20 s post-burst. the upper limiton the unabsorbed x-ray flux was 1.7 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (integrating 46 ksof data taken between 11 and 18 september), indicating that the decay must havebeen rapid. all but one of the long bursts detected by swift were above thislimit at ~4.6 hr, whereas the afterglows of short bursts became undetectablemore rapidly. deep observations with gemini also revealed no optical afterglow12 hr after the burst, down to r=24.0 (5-sigma limit). we speculate that grb050911 may have been formed through a compact object (black hole-neutron star)merger, with the later outbursts due to a longer disc lifetime linked to alarge mass ratio between the merging objects. alternatively, the burst may haveoccured in a low density environment, leading to a weak, or non-existent,forward shock - the so-called 'naked grb' model.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;0601173	x-ray flare in xrf 050406: evidence for prolonged engine activity	we present observations of xrf 050406, the first burst detected by swiftshowing a flare in its x-ray light curve. during this flare, which peaks att_peak ~210s after the bat trigger, a flux variation of (delta f)/f~6 in a veryshort time (delta t)/t_peak&lt;&lt;1 was observed. its measured fluence in the 0.2-10kev band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the promptfluence. we present indications of spectral variations during the flare. weargue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies thatthe central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power withrespect to the prompt emission. the x-ray light curve flattens to a veryshallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supportscontinued central engine activity at late times. this burst is classified as anx-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 kevband, e_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significantflux above ~50 kev and a peak energy e_p&lt;15 kev. xrf 050406 is one of the firstexamples of a well-studied x-ray light curve of an xrf. we show that the mainafterglow characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of normal grbs. inparticular, x-ray flares superimposed on a power-law light curve have now beenseen in both xrfs and grbs. this indicates that a similar mechanism may be atwork for both kinds of events.

astro-ph;0602142	testing the curvature effect and internal origin of gamma-ray burst  prompt emissions and x-ray flares with swift data	the x-ray light curves of many gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) have a very steep-decay component (tail) following theprompt gamma-rays in the early phase and have some erratic flares occurring ata time from ~10^2 up to ~10^5 seconds. based on the assumption that these tailsand flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors aredominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present aself-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36prompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 grb xrt light curves. our results showthat the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flaresare usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission orthe corresponding x-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation ofthe internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and x-ray flares. ourresults indicate that each x-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of centralengine activity and the grb central engine remains active after the promptemission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the grb trigger (e.g. grb050502b &amp; grb 050724). this challenges the conventional central engine modelsand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. we further show thatthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the grbduration. we also identify a minority group of grbs whose combined bat-xrtlight curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between theprompt emission and the afterglow. these grbs may have an external origin forboth the prompt emission and the afterglow.

astro-ph;0701087	the prompt to late-time multiwavelength analysis of grb 060210	we present our analysis of the multiwavelength photometric &amp; spectroscopicobservations of grb 060210 and discuss the results in the overall context ofcurrent grb models. all available optical data underwent a simultaneoustemporal fit, while x-ray and gamma-ray observations were analysed temporally &amp;spectrally. the results were compared to each other and to possible grb models.the x-ray afterglow is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with abreak at 7.4 hours. the late optical afterglow has a well constrained singlepower-law index which has a value between the two x-ray indices, though it doesagree with a single power-law fit to the x-ray. an evolution of the hardness ofthe high-energy emission is demonstrated and we imply a minimum host extinctionfrom a comparison of the extrapolated x-ray flux to that measured in theoptical. we find that the flaring gamma-ray and x-ray emission is likely due tointernal shocks while the flat optical light curve at that time is due to theexternal shock. the late afterglow is best explained by a cooling break betweenthe optical and x-rays and continued central engine activity up to the time ofthe break. the required collimation corrected energy of ~ 2x10^52 erg, while atthe high end of the known energy distribution, is not unprecedented.

astro-ph;0701825	2003--2005 integral and xmm-newton observations of 3c 273	the aim of this paper is to study the evolution of the broadband spectrum ofone of the brightest and nearest quasars 3c 273.  we analyze the data obtained during quasi-simultaneous integral and xmmmonitoring of the blazar 3c 273 in 2003--2005 in the uv, x-ray and softgamma-ray bands and study the results in the context of the long-term evolutionof the source.  the 0.2-100 kev spectrum of the source is well fitted by a combination of asoft cut-off power law and a hard power law. no improvement of the fit isachieved if one replaces the soft cut-off power law by either a blackbody, or adisk reflection model. during the observation period the source has reached thehistorically softest state in the hard x-ray domain with a photon index$\gamma=1.82\pm 0.01$. comparing our data with available archived x-ray datafrom previous years, we find a secular evolution of the source toward softerx-ray emission (the photon index has increased by $\delta\gamma\simeq 0.3-0.4$over the last thirty years). we argue that existing theoretical models have tobe significantly modified to account for the observed spectral evolution of thesource.

astro-ph;0702220	swift observations of grb 070110: an extraordinary x-ray afterglow  powered by the central engine	we present a detailed analysis of swift multi-wavelength observations of grb070110 and its remarkable afterglow. the early x-ray light curve, interpretedas the tail of the prompt emission, displays a spectral evolution already seenin other gamma-ray bursts. the optical afterglow shows a shallow decay up to ~2d after the burst, which is not consistent with standard afterglow models. themost intriguing feature is a very steep decay in the x-ray flux at ~20 ks afterthe burst, ending an apparent plateau. the abrupt drop of the x-ray light curverules out an external shock as the origin of the plateau in this burst andimplies long-lasting activity of the central engine. the temporal and spectralproperties of the plateau phase point towards a continuous central engineemission rather than the episodic emission of x-ray flares. we suggest that theobserved x-ray plateau is powered by a spinning down central engine, possibly amillisecond pulsar, which dissipates energy at an internal radius beforedepositing energy into the external shock.

astro-ph;0702262	grb 050822: detailed analysis of an xrf observed by swift	we report on the temporal and spectral characteristics of the early x-rayemission from the grb 050822 as observed by swift. this burst is likely to bean xrf showing major x-ray flares in its xrt light-curve. the quality of thedata allows a detailed spectral analysis of the early afterglow in the x-rayband. during the x-ray flares, a positive correlation between the count rateand the spectral hardness (i.e. the higher the count rate, the harder thespectrum) is clearly seen for the x-ray flares. this behaviour, similar to thatseen for gamma-ray pulses, indicates that the energy peak of the spectrum is inthe xrt energy band and it moves towards lower energies with time. we showevidence for the possible detection of the emergence of the forward-shockemission, produced at a radius larger than 4x10^16 cm in the case of a cbmafterglow model (a formation region clearly different from that producing theprompt emission). finally, we show that the null detection of a jet break up tot_0 + 4x10^6 s in the x-ray light curve of this xrf can be understood: i) ifthe jet seen on-axis is uniform with a large opening angle theta &gt; 20 degrees);or ii) if the jet is a structured gaussian-like jet with the line-of-sightoutside the bright gaussian core.

astro-ph;0702371	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: temporal properties and morphology	we present the first systematic investigation of the morphological and timingproperties of flares in grbs observed by swift/xrt. we consider a large sampledrawn from all grbs detected by swift, integral and hete-2 prior to 2006 jan31, which had an xrt follow-up and which showed significant flaring. our sampleof 33 grbs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69flares. the strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clearanti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time ofoccurrence. fitting each x-ray flare with a gaussian model, we find that themean ratio of the width and peak time is &lt;delta t / t &gt; = 0.13+/-0.10, albeitwith a large scatter. late flares at times &gt; 2000 seconds have long durations,delta t&gt;300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.we further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulsesdetected in the prompt phase by bat and the number of x-ray flares detected byxrt, finding no correlation. however, we find that the distribution ofintensity ratios between successive bat prompt pulses and that betweensuccessive xrt flares is the same, an indication of a common origin forgamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares. all evidence indicates that flares areindeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standardfireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.while all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flaresmay also be explained by refreshed shocks. however, 10 can only be explained byprolonged activity of the central engine.

0810.1180	multiple flaring activity in the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j08408-4503 observed with swift	igr j08408-4503 is a supergiant fast x-ray transient discovered in 2006 witha confirmed association with a o8.5ib(f) supergiant star, hd 74194. we reporton the analysis of two outbursts caught by swift/bat on 2006 october 4 and 2008july 5, and followed up at softer energies with swift/xrt. the 2008 xrt lightcurve shows a multiple-peaked structure with an initial bright flare thatreached a flux of ~1e-9 erg/cm2/s (2-10 kev), followed by two equally brightflares within 75 ks. the spectral characteristics of the flares differdramatically, with most of the difference, as derived via time-resolvedspectroscopy, being due to absorbing column variations. we observe a gradualdecrease of the nh, derived with a fit using absorbed power law model, as timepasses. we interpret these nh variations as due to an ionization effectproduced by the first flare, resulting in a significant decrease in themeasured column density towards the source. the durations of the flares, aswell as the times of the outbursts suggest that the orbital period is ~35 days,if the flaring activity is interpreted within the framework of the sidoli et al2007 model with the outbursts triggered by the neutron star passage inside anequatorial wind inclined with respect to the orbital plane.

0810.2023	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the evolving shock in the 2006  outburst of rs ophiuchi	the evolution of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi wasfollowed with 12 x-ray grating observations with chandra and xmm-newton. wepresent detailed spectral analyses using two independent approaches. from thebest dataset, taken on day 13.8 after outburst, we reconstruct the temperaturedistribution and derive elemental abundances. we find evidence for at least twodistinct temperature components on day 13.8 and a reduction of temperature withtime. the x-ray flux decreases as a power-law, and the power-law index changesfrom -5/3 to -8/3 around day 70 after outburst. this can be explained bydifferent decay mechanisms for the hot and cool components. the decay of thehot component and the decrease in temperature are consistent with radiativecooling, while the decay of the cool component can be explained by theexpansion of the ejecta. we find overabundances of n and of alpha-elements,which could either represent the composition of the secondary that provides theaccreted material or that of the ejecta. the n overabundance indicatescno-cycled material. from comparisons to abundances for the secondary takenfrom the literature, we conclude that 20-40% of the observed nitrogen couldoriginate from the outburst. the overabundance of the alpha-elements is nottypical for stars of the spectral type of the secondary in the rs oph system,and white dwarf material might have been mixed into the ejecta. however, nodirect measurements of the alpha-elements in the secondary are available, andthe continuous accretion may have changed the observable surface composition.

0810.2107	detection of the high z grb 080913 and its implications on progenitors  and energy extraction mechanisms	aims: we present multiwavelength observations of one of the most distantgamma-ray bursts detected so far, grb 080913. based on these observations, weconsider whether it could be classified as a short-duration grb and discuss theimplications for the progenitor nature and energy extraction mechanisms.  methods: multiwavelength x-ray, near ir and millimetre observations were madebetween 20.7 hours and 16.8 days after the event.  results: whereas a very faint afterglow was seen at the 3.5m caha telescopein the nir, the x-ray afterglow was clearly detected in both swift andxmm-newton observations. an upper limit is reported in the mm range. we havemodeled the data assuming a collimated $\theta_0$ $\gtrsim$ 3$^\circ$ blastwave with an energy injection at 0.5 days carrying $5\sim 10^{52}$ erg orapproximately 12 times the initial energy of the blast wave. we find that grb080913 shares many of the gamma-ray diagnostics with the more recent burst grb090423 for being classified as short had they ocurred at low redshift. if theprogenitor were a compact binary merger, it is likely composed by a ns and bh.the blandford-znajek (bz) mechanism is the preferred one to extract energy fromthe central, maximally-rotating bh. both the magnetic field close to the eventhorizon (b) and the bh mass ($m_{bh}$) are restricted within a relativelynarrow range, such that $(b / 3\times 10^{16} \rm{g}) (m_{bh} / 7 m_\odot) \sim1$. similar constraints on the central bh hold for collapsar-like progenitorsystems if the bz-mechanism works for the system at hand.

0706.0669	the two-component afterglow of swift grb 050802	this paper investigates grb 050802, one of the best examples of a it swiftgamma-ray burst afterglow that shows a break in the x-ray lightcurve, while theoptical counterpart decays as a single power-law. this burst has an opticallybright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectralrange of the uvot on-board swift. observations began with the xrt and uvottelescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. thex-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. theoptical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_o = 0.82 +/- 0.03throughout the observation. the x-ray data on their own are consistent with thebreak at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. modelling the opticalto x-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow cannot be produced by the same component as the x-ray emission at late times,ruling out a single component afterglow. we therefore considered two-componentjet models and find that the x-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by amodel in which both components are energy injected for the duration of theobserved afterglow and the x-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in thenarrow component. this bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide forinterpreting the surprising finding of swift that bursts seldom displayachromatic jet breaks.

0811.4246	modelling the spectral response of the swift-xrt ccd camera: experience  learnt from in-flight calibration	(abbreviated) we show that the xrt spectral response calibration wascomplicated by various energy offsets in photon counting (pc) and windowedtiming (wt) modes related to the way the ccd is operated in orbit (variation intemperature during observations, contamination by optical light from the sunlitearth and increase in charge transfer inefficiency). we describe how theseeffects can be corrected for in the ground processing software. we show thatthe low-energy response, the redistribution in spectra of absorbed sources, andthe modelling of the line profile have been significantly improved since launchby introducing empirical corrections in our code when it was not possible touse a physical description. we note that the increase in cti became noticeablein june 2006 (i.e. 14 months after launch), but the evidence of a more seriousdegradation in spectroscopic performance (line broadening and change in thelow-energy response) due to large charge traps (i.e. faults in the si crystal)became more significant after march 2007. we describe efforts to handle suchchanges in the spectral response. finally, we show that the commanded increasein the substrate voltage from 0 to 6v on 2007 august 30 reduced the darkcurrent, enabling the collection of useful science data at higher ccdtemperature (up to -50c). we also briefly describe the plan to recalibrate thexrt response files at this new voltage.

0812.3662	methods and results of an automatic analysis of a complete sample of  swift-xrt observations of grbs	we present a homogeneous x-ray analysis of all 318 gamma ray bursts detectedby the x-ray telescope on the swift satellite up to 2008 july 23; thisrepresents the largest sample of x-ray grb data published to date. in sections2--3 we detail the methods which the swift-xrt team has developed to producethe enhanced positions, light curves, hardness ratios and spectra presented inthis paper. software using these methods continues to create such products forall new grbs observed by the swift-xrt. we also detail web-based tools allowingusers to create these products for any object observed by the xrt, not justgrbs. in sections 4--6 we present the results of our analysis of grbs,including probability distribution functions of the temporal and spectralproperties of the sample. we demonstrate evidence for a consistent underlyingbehaviour which can produce a range of light curve morphologies, and attempt tointerpret this behaviour in the framework of external forward shock emission.we find several difficulties, in particular that reconciliation of our datawith the forward shock model requires energy injection to continue for days toweeks.
