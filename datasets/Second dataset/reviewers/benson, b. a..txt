0902.2131	multi-frequency imaging of the galaxy cluster abell 2163 using the  sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we used the apex-sz and laboca bolometer cameras on the apex telescope to mapthe decrement of the sunyaev-zeldovich effect at 150 ghz and the increment at345 ghz toward the galaxy cluster abell 2163. the sze images were used to modelthe radial density and temperature distribution of the icm, and to derive thegas mass fraction in the cluster under the assumption of hydrostaticequilibrium. we used the isothermal beta model to fit the szedecrement/increment radial profiles. we performed a simple, non-parametricde-projection of the radial density and temperature profiles, in conjunctionwith xmm-newton x-ray data, under the simplifying assumption of sphericalsymmetry. we combined the peak sze signals derived in this paper with publishedsze measurements of this cluster to derive the cluster line-of-sight bulkvelocity and the central comptonization, using priors on the icm temperature.we find that the best-fit isothermal model to the sze data is consistent withthe icm properties implied by the x-ray data, particularly inside the central 1mpc radius. although the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and sphericalsymmetry may not be optimal for this complex system, the results obtained underthese assumptions are consistent with x-ray and weak-lensing measurements. thisshows the applicability of the simple joint sze and x-ray de-projectiontechnique described in this paper for clusters with a wide range of dynamicalstates.

0911.2444	sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster profiles measured with the south pole  telescope	we present sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters obtained with the south pole telescope. the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) cluster signals are measured at 150 ghz, and concurrent 220 ghz data areused to reduce astrophysical contamination. radial profiles are computed usinga technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. inseveral clusters, significant sz decrements are detected out to a substantialfraction of the virial radius. the profiles are fit to the beta model and to ageneralized nfw pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe theiraverage behavior. we find model parameters that are consistent with previousstudies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized nfw model. bothmodels fit the spt data comparably well, and both are consistent with theaverage sz profile out to the virial radius. the integrated compton-y parametery_sz is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent andmodel-independent techniques, and the results are compared to x-ray estimatesof cluster parameters. we find that y_sz scales with y_x and gas mass with lowscatter. since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, ourresults point to a tight mass-observable relation for the spt cluster survey.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

0912.4315	angular power spectra of the millimeter wavelength background light from  dusty star-forming galaxies with the south pole telescope	we use data from the first 100 square-degree field observed by the south poletelescope (spt) in 2008 to measure the angular power spectrum of temperatureanisotropies contributed by the background of dusty star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) at millimeter wavelengths. from the auto and cross-correlation of 150and 220 ghz spt maps, we significantly detect both poisson distributed and, forthe first time at millimeter wavelengths, clustered components of power from abackground of dsfgs. the spectral indices between 150 and 220 ghz of thepoisson and clustered components are found to be 3.86 +- 0.23 and 3.8 +- 1.3respectively, implying a steep scaling of the dust emissivity index beta ~ 2.the poisson and clustered power detected in spt, blast (at 600, 860, and 1200ghz), and spitzer (1900 ghz) data can be understood in the context of a simplemodel in which all galaxies have the same graybody spectrum with dustemissivity index of beta = 2 and dust temperature t_d = 34 k. in this model,half of the 150 ghz background light comes from redshifts greater than 3.2. wealso use the spt data to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich power spectrum at l = 3000 of 13 uk^2 at 95% confidence.

0912.4317	measurements of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  the south pole telescope	we report cosmic microwave background (cmb) power spectrum measurements fromthe first 100 sq. deg. field observed by the south pole telescope (spt) at 150and 220 ghz. on angular scales where the primary cmb anisotropy is dominant,ell ~&lt; 3000, the spt power spectrum is consistent with the standard lambdacdmcosmology. on smaller scales, we see strong evidence for a point sourcecontribution, consistent with a population of dusty, star-forming galaxies.after we mask bright point sources, anisotropy power on angular scales of 3000&lt; ell &lt; 9500 is detected with a signal-to-noise &gt; 50 at both frequencies. wecombine the 150 and 220 ghz data to remove the majority of the point sourcepower, and use the point source subtracted spectrum to detectsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) power at 2.6 sigma. at ell=3000, the sz power in thesubtracted bandpowers is 4.2 +/- 1.5 uk^2, which is significantly lower thanthe power predicted by a fiducial model using wmap5 cosmological parameters.this discrepancy may suggest that contemporary galaxy cluster modelsoverestimate the thermal pressure of intracluster gas. alternatively, thisresult can be interpreted as evidence for lower values of sigma8. when combinedwith an estimate of the kinetic sz contribution, the measured sz amplitudeshifts sigma8 from the primary cmb anisotropy derived constraint of 0.794 +/-0.028 down to 0.773 +/- 0.025. the uncertainty in the constraint on sigma8 fromthis analysis is dominated by uncertainties in the theoretical modelingrequired to predict the amplitude of the sz power spectrum for a given set ofcosmological parameters.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1012.4788	improved constraints on cosmic microwave background secondary  anisotropies from the complete 2008 south pole telescope data	we report measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) powerspectrum from the complete 2008 south pole telescope (spt) data set. we analyzetwice as much data as the first spt power spectrum analysis, using an improvedcosmological parameter estimator which fits multi-frequency models to the spt150 and $220\,$ghz bandpowers. we find an excellent fit to the measuredbandpowers with a model that includes lensed primary cmb anisotropy, secondarythermal (tsz) and kinetic (ksz) sunyaev-zel'dovich anisotropies, unclusteredsynchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. in addition tomeasuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, thedata primarily constrain a linear combination of the ksz and tsz anisotropycontributions at $150\,$ghz and $\ell=3000$: $d^{tsz}_{3000} +0.5\,d^{ksz}_{3000} = 4.5\pm 1.0 \,\mu{\rm k}^2$. the 95% confidence upperlimits on secondary anisotropy power are $d^{tsz}_{3000} &lt; 5.3\,\mu{\rm k}^2$and $d^{ksz}_{3000} &lt; 6.5\,\mu{\rm k}^2$. we also consider the potentialcorrelation of dusty and tsz sources, and find it incapable of relaxing the tszupper limit. these results increase the significance of the lower than expectedtsz amplitude previously determined from spt power spectrum measurements. wefind that models including non-thermal pressure support in groups and clusterspredict tsz power in better agreement with the spt data. combining the tszpower measurement with primary cmb data halves the statistical uncertainty on$\sigma_8$. however, the preferred value of $\sigma_8$ varies significantlybetween tsz models. improved constraints on cosmological parameters from tszpower spectrum measurements require continued progress in the modeling of thetsz power.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1111.0932	a measurement of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  two years of south pole telescope observations	we present the first three-frequency south pole telescope (spt) cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) power spectra. the band powers presented here coverangular scales 2000 &lt; ell &lt; 9400 in frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and220 ghz. at these frequencies and angular scales, a combination of the primarycmb anisotropy, thermal and kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effects, radiogalaxies, and cosmic infrared background (cib) contributes to the signal. wecombine planck and spt data at 220 ghz to constrain the amplitude and shape ofthe cib power spectrum and find strong evidence for non-linear clustering. weexplore the sz results using a variety of cosmological models for the cmb andcib anisotropies and find them to be robust with one exception: allowing forspatial correlations between the thermal sz effect and cib significantlydegrades the sz constraints. neglecting this potential correlation, we find thethermal sz power at 150 ghz and ell = 3000 to be 3.65 +/- 0.69 muk^2, and setan upper limit on the kinetic sz power to be less than 2.8 muk^2 at 95%confidence. when a correlation between the thermal sz and cib is allowed, weconstrain a linear combination of thermal and kinetic sz power: d_{3000}^{tsz}+ 0.5 d_{3000}^{ksz} = 4.60 +/- 0.63 muk^2, consistent with earliermeasurements. we use the measured thermal sz power and an analytic, thermal szmodel calibrated with simulations to determine sigma8 = 0.807 +/- 0.016.modeling uncertainties involving the astrophysics of the intracluster mediumrather than the statistical uncertainty in the measured band powers are thedominant source of uncertainty on sigma8 . we also place an upper limit on thekinetic sz power produced by patchy reionization; a companion paper uses theselimits to constrain the reionization history of the universe.

1112.4215	frequency multiplexed squid readout of large bolometer arrays for cosmic  microwave background measurements	a technological milestone for experiments employing transition edge sensor(tes) bolometers operating at sub-kelvin temperature is the deployment ofdetector arrays with 100s--1000s of bolometers. one key technology for sucharrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many sensorssimultaneously on the same set of wires. this paper describes afrequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for anddeployed on the apex-sz and south pole telescope millimeter wavelengthreceivers. in this system, the detector array is divided into modules of sevendetectors, and each bolometer within the module is biased with a unique ~mhzsinusoidal carrier such that the individual bolometer signals are wellseparated in frequency space. the currents from all bolometers in a module aresummed together and pre-amplified with superconducting quantum interferencedevices (squids) operating at 4 k. room-temperature electronics demodulate thecarriers to recover the bolometer signals, which are digitized separately andstored to disk. this readout system contributes little noise relative to thedetectors themselves, is remarkably insensitive to unwanted microphonicexcitations, and provides a technology pathway to multiplexing larger numbersof sensors.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1309.5381	inflation physics from the cosmic microwave background and large scale  structure	fluctuations in the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) and the large-scale distribution of matter in the universeeach contain clues about the nature of the earliest moments of time. the nextgeneration of cmb and large-scale structure (lss) experiments are poised totest the leading paradigm for these earliest moments---the theory of cosmicinflation---and to detect the imprints of the inflationary epoch, therebydramatically increasing our understanding of fundamental physics and the earlyuniverse.  a future cmb experiment with sufficient angular resolution and frequencycoverage that surveys at least 1% of the sky to a depth of 1 uk-arcmin candeliver a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio that will either result in a5-sigma measurement of the energy scale of inflation or rule out alllarge-field inflation models, even in the presence of foregrounds and thegravitational lensing b-mode signal. lss experiments, particularlyspectroscopic surveys such as the dark energy spectroscopic instrument, willcomplement the cmb effort by improving current constraints on running of thespectral index by up to a factor of four, improving constraints on curvature bya factor of ten, and providing non-gaussianity constraints that are competitivewith the current cmb bounds.

1309.5388	exploiting cross correlations and joint analyses	in this report, we present a wide variety of ways in which information frommultiple probes of dark energy may be combined to obtain additional informationnot accessible when they are considered separately. fundamentally, because allmajor probes are affected by the underlying distribution of matter in theregions studied, there exist covariances between them that can provideinformation on cosmology. combining multiple probes allows for more accurate(less contaminated by systematics) and more precise (since there iscosmological information encoded in cross-correlation statistics) measurementsof dark energy. the potential of cross-correlation methods is only beginning tobe realized. by bringing in information from other wavelengths, thecapabilities of the existing probes of dark energy can be enhanced andsystematic effects can be mitigated further. we present a mixture of work inprogress and suggestions for future scientific efforts. given the scope offuture dark energy experiments, the greatest gains may only be realized withmore coordination and cooperation between multiple project teams; we recommendthat this interchange should begin sooner, rather than later, to maximizescientific gains.

1309.7044	robust quantification of galaxy cluster morphology using asymmetry and  central concentration	we present a novel quantitative scheme of cluster classification based on themorphological properties that are manifested in x-ray images. we use aconventional radial surface brightness concentration parameter (c_{sb}) asdefined previously by others, and a new asymmetry parameter, which we define inthis paper. our asymmetry parameter, which we refer to as photon asymmetry($a_{phot}), was developed as a robust substructure statistic for clusterobservations with only a few thousand counts. to demonstrate that photonasymmetry exhibits better stability than currently popular power ratios andcentroid shifts, we artificially degrade the x-ray image quality by: (a) addingextra background counts, (b) eliminating a fraction of the counts, (c)increasing the width of the smoothing kernel, and (d) simulating clusterobservations at higher redshift. the asymmetry statistic presented here has asmaller statistical uncertainty than competing substructure parameters,allowing for low levels of substructure to be measured with confidence.a_{phot} is less sensitive to the total number of counts than competingsubstructure statistics, making it an ideal candidate for quantifyingsubstructure in samples of distant clusters covering wide range ofobservational s/n. additionally, we show that the asymmetry-concentrationclassification separates relaxed, cool core clusters frommorphologically-disturbed mergers, in agreement with by-eye classifications.our algorithms, freely available as python scripts(https://github.com/ndaniyar/aphot) are completely automatic and can be used torapidly classify galaxy cluster morphology for large numbers of clusterswithout human intervention.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1410.0025	x-ray cavities in a sample of 83 spt-selected clusters of galaxies:  tracing the evolution of agn feedback in clusters of galaxies out to z=1.2	x-ray cavities are key tracers of mechanical (or radio mode) heating arisingfrom the active galactic nuclei (agn) in brightest cluster galaxies. we reporton a survey for x-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2)clusters of galaxies selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature in thesouth pole telescope data. based on chandra x-ray images, we find a total of 6clusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistentwith the picture of radio jets inflating x-ray cavities in the intraclustermedium. the majority of these detections are of relatively low significance andrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. further, due to thelimitations of chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (&lt;10 kpc),unresolved x-ray cavities at high (z&gt;0.5) redshift. despite these limitations,our results suggest that the power generated by agn feedback in brightestcluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of theuniverse (&gt;7 gyrs at z=0.8). on average, the detected x-ray cavities havepowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.integrating over 7 gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in thebrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9m_sun ofmaterial to power these outflows. this level of accretion indicates thatsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,in the quasar era, but at late times as well. we also find that x-ray cavitiesat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 kev per particle into thehot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.this value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, breakself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1412.7823	baryon content of massive galaxy clusters (0.57 &lt; z &lt; 1.33)	we study the stellar, brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) and intracluster medium(icm) masses of 14 south pole telescope (spt) selected galaxy clusters withmedian redshift $z=0.9$ and median mass $m_{500}=6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. weestimate stellar masses for each cluster and bcg using six photometric bandsspanning the range from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared observed with thevlt, hst and spitzer. the icm masses are derived from chandra and xmm-newtonx-ray observations, and the virial masses are derived from the sptsunyaev-zel'dovich effect signature.  at $z=0.9$ the bcg mass $m_{\star}^{\textrm{bcg}}$ constitutes $0.12\pm0.01$%of the halo mass for a $6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$ cluster, and this fractionfalls as $m_{500}^{-0.58\pm0.07}$. the cluster stellar mass function has acharacteristic mass $m_{0}=10^{11.0\pm0.1}m_{\odot}$, and the number ofgalaxies per unit mass in clusters is larger than in the field by a factor$1.65\pm0.2$. both results are consistent with measurements on group scales andat lower redshift. we combine our spt sample with previously published samplesat low redshift that we correct to a common initial mass function and forsystematic differences in virial masses. we then explore mass and redshifttrends in the stellar fraction (fstar), the icm fraction (ficm), the coldbaryon fraction (fc) and the baryon fraction (fb). at a pivot mass of$6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$ and redshift $z=0.9$, the characteristic values arefstar=$1.1\pm0.1$%, ficm=$9.6\pm0.5$%, fc=$10.4\pm1.2$% and fb=$10.7\pm0.6$%.these fractions all vary with cluster mass at high significance, indicatingthat higher mass clusters have lower fstar and fc and higher ficm and fb. whenaccounting for a 15% systematic virial mass uncertainty, there is nostatistically significant redshift trend at fixed mass in these baryonfractions.

1503.02315	measurements of sub-degree b-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave  background from 100 square degrees of sptpol data	we present a measurement of the $b$-mode polarization power spectrum (the$bb$ spectrum) from 100 $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of sky observed with sptpol, apolarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the south poletelescope. the observations used in this work were taken during 2012 and early2013 and include data in spectral bands centered at 95 and 150 ghz. we reportthe $bb$ spectrum in five bins in multipole space, spanning the range $300 \le\ell \le 2300$, and for three spectral combinations: 95 ghz $\times$ 95 ghz, 95ghz $\times$ 150 ghz, and 150 ghz $\times$ 150 ghz. we subtract small ($&lt; 0.5\sigma$ in units of statistical uncertainty) biases from these spectra andaccount for the uncertainty in those biases. the resulting power spectra areinconsistent with zero power but consistent with predictions for the $bb$spectrum arising from the gravitational lensing of $e$-mode polarization. if weassume no other source of $bb$ power besides lensed $b$ modes, we determine apreference for lensed $b$ modes of $4.9 \sigma$. after marginalizing overtensor power and foregrounds, namely polarized emission from galactic dust andextragalactic sources, this significance is $4.3 \sigma$. fitting for a singleparameter, $a_\mathrm{lens}$, that multiplies the predicted lensed $b$-modespectrum, and marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, we find$a_\mathrm{lens} = 1.08 \pm 0.26$, indicating that our measured spectra areconsistent with the signal expected from gravitational lensing. the datapresented here provide the best measurement to date of the $b$-mode powerspectrum on these angular scales.

1508.05941	deep chandra, hst-cos, and megacam observations of the phoenix cluster:  extreme star formation and agn feedback on hundred kiloparsec scales	we present new ultraviolet, optical, and x-ray data on the phoenix galaxycluster (spt-clj2344-4243). deep optical imaging reveals previously-undetectedfilaments of star formation, extending to radii of ~50-100 kpc in multipledirections. combined uv-optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy reveals amassive (2x10^9 msun)), young (~4.5 myr) population of stars, consistent with atime-averaged star formation rate of 610 +/- 50 msun/yr. we report a strongdetection of ovi(1032,1038) which appears to originate primarily inshock-heated gas, but may contain a substantial contribution (&gt;1000 msun/yr)from the cooling intracluster medium. we confirm the presence of deep x-raycavities in the inner ~10 kpc, which are amongst the most extreme examples ofradio-mode feedback detected to date, implying jet powers of 2-7 x10^45 erg/s.we provide evidence that the agn inflating these cavities may have onlyrecently transitioned from "quasar-mode" to "radio-mode", and may currently beinsufficient to completely offset cooling. a model-subtracted residual x-rayimage reveals evidence for prior episodes of strong radio-mode feedback atradii of ~100 kpc, with extended "ghost" cavities indicating a prior epoch offeedback roughly 100 myr ago. this residual image also exhibits significantasymmetry in the inner ~200 kpc (0.15r500), reminiscent of infalling coolclouds, either due to minor mergers or fragmentation of the cooling icm. takentogether, these data reveal a rapidly evolving cool core which is rich withstructure (both spatially and in temperature), is subject to a variety ofhighly energetic processes, and yet is cooling rapidly and forming stars alongthin, narrow filaments.

1508.06283	star-forming brightest cluster galaxies at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25: a  transitioning fuel supply	we present a multi-wavelength study of 90 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs)in a sample of galaxy clusters selected via the sunyaev zel'dovich effect bythe south pole telescope, utilizing data from various ground- and space-basedfacilities. we infer the star formation rate (sfr) for the bcg in each cluster,based on the uv and ir continuum luminosity, as well as the [o ii] emissionline luminosity in cases where spectroscopy is available, finding 7 systemswith sfr &gt; 100 msun/yr. we find that the bcg sfr exceeds 10 msun/yr in 31 of 90(34%) cases at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25, compared to ~1-5% at z ~ 0 from the literature.at z &gt; 1, this fraction increases to 92(+6)(-31)%, implying a steady decreasein the bcg sfr over the past ~9 gyr. at low-z, we find that the specific starformation rate in bcgs is declining more slowly with time than for field orcluster galaxies, most likely due to the replenishing fuel from the cooling icmin relaxed, cool core clusters. at z &gt; 0.6, the correlation between clustercentral entropy and bcg star formation - which is well established at z ~ 0 -is not present. instead, we find that the most star-forming bcgs at high-z arefound in the cores of dynamically unrelaxed clusters. we investigate therest-frame near-uv morphology of a subsample of the most star-forming bcgsusing data from the hubble space telescope, finding complex, highly asymmetricuv morphologies on scales as large as ~50-60 kpc. the high fraction ofstar-forming bcgs hosted in unrelaxed, non-cool core clusters at early timessuggests that the dominant mode of fueling star formation in bcgs may haverecently transitioned from galaxy-galaxy interactions to icm cooling.

1512.04535	cross-correlation of gravitational lensing from des science verification  data with spt and planck lensing	we measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb). the effects of gravitational lensing ondifferent sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same massfluctuations. we use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the darkenergy survey (des) science verification data and overlapping cmb lensing fromthe south pole telescope (spt) and planck. the des source galaxies have amedian redshift of $z_{\rm med} {\sim} 0.7$, while the cmb lensing kernel isbroad and peaks at $z{\sim}2$. the resulting cross-correlation is maximallysensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\sim}0.44$. assuming the planck 2015best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the des$\times$spt cross-power is found tobe $a = 0.88 \pm 0.30$ and that from des$\times$planck to be $a = 0.86 \pm0.39$, where $a=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. these areconsistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9\sigma$ and $2.2 \sigma$ respectively. we demonstrate that our results arerobust to a number of important systematic effects including the shearmeasurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and cmblensing systematics. significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes wouldincrease the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate avalue of $a = 1.08 \pm 0.36$ for des$\times$spt when we correct theobservations with a simple ia model. with three measurements of thiscross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliableevidence for any deviation from the expected lcdm level of cross-correlation,given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact ofsystematic errors, particularly ias. we provide forecasts for the expectedsignal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year des survey and spt-3g.

0807.4208	sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations of the bullet cluster (1e  0657-56) with apex-sz	we present observations of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) in the bulletcluster (1e 0657--56) using the apex-sz instrument at 150 ghz with a resolutionof 1 arcmin. the main results are maps of the sze in this massive, merginggalaxy cluster. the cluster is detected with 23 sigma significance within thecentral 1 arcmin radius of the source position. the sze map has a broadlysimilar morphology to that in existing x-ray maps of this system, and we findno evidence for significant contamination of the sze emission by radio or irsources. in order to make simple quantitative comparisons with cluster gasmodels derived from x-ray observations, we fit our data to an isothermalelliptical beta model, despite the inadequacy of such a model for this complexmerging system. with an x-ray derived prior on the power-law index, beta = 1.04+0.16 -0.10, we find a core radius r_c =142 +/- 18 arcsec, an axial ratio of0.889 +/- 0.072, and a central temperature decrement of -771 +/- 71micro-k_cmb, including a +/-5.5% flux calibration uncertainty. combining theapex-sz map with a map of projected electron surface density from chandra x-rayobservations, we determine the mass-weighted temperature of the cluster gas tobe t_mg=10.8 +/- 0.9 kev, significantly lower than some previously reportedx-ray spectroscopic temperatures. under the assumption of an isothermal clustergas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium, we compute the gas mass fractionfor prolate and oblate spheroidal geometries and find it to be consistent withprevious results from x-ray and weak lensing observations. this work is thefirst result from the apex-sz experiment, and represents the first reportedscientific result from observations with a large array of multiplexedsuperconducting transition-edge sensor bolometers.

astro-ph;0303510	peculiar velocity limits from measurements of the spectrum of the  sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in six clusters of galaxies	we have made measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect in six galaxyclusters at z &gt; 0.2 using the sunyaev-zel'dovich infrared experiment (suzie ii)in three frequency bands between 150 and 350 ghz. simultaneous multi-frequencymeasurements have been used to distinguish between thermal and kinematiccomponents of the sz effect, and to significantly reduce the effects ofvariations in atmospheric emission which can otherwise dominate the noise. wehave set limits to the peculiar velocities of each cluster with respect to thehubble flow, and have used the cluster sample to set a 95% confidence limit of&lt; 1410 km/s to the bulk flow of the intermediate-redshift universe in thedirection of the cmb dipole. this is the first time that sz measurements havebeen used to constrain bulk flows. we show that systematic uncertainties inpeculiar velocity determinations from the sz effect are likely to be dominatedby submillimeter point sources and we discuss the level of this contamination.

astro-ph;0404391	measurements of sunyaev-zel'dovich effect scaling relations for clusters  of galaxies	we present new measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect fromclusters of galaxies using the sunyaev-zel'dovich infrared experiment (suzieii). we combine these new measurements with previous cluster observations withthe suzie instrument to form a sample of 15 clusters of galaxies. for thissample we calculate the central comptonization, y, and the integrated sz fluxdecrement, s, for each of our clusters. we find that the integrated sz flux isa more robust observable derived from our measurements than the centralcomptonization due to inadequacies in the spatial modelling of theintra-cluster gas with a standard beta model. this is highlighted by comparingour central comptonization results with values calculated from measurementsusing the bima and ovro interferometers. on average, the suzie calculatedcentral comptonizations are approximately 60% higher in the cooling flowclusters than the interferometric values, compared to only approximately 12%higher in the non-cooling flow clusters. we believe this discrepancy to be inlarge part due to the spatial modelling of the intra-cluster gas. from ourcluster sample we construct y-t and s-t scaling relations. the y-t scalingrelation is inconsistent with what we would expect for self-similar clusters;however this result is questionable because of the large systematic uncertaintyin the central comptonization. the s-t scaling relation has a slope andredshift evolution consistent with what we expect for self-similar clusterswith a characteristic density that scales with the mean density of theuniverse. we rule out zero redshift evolution of the s-t relation at 90%confidence.

0810.1578	galaxy clusters discovered with a sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is conducting a sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effectsurvey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxyclusters to high redshift. in this preliminary study, we focus on a 40square-degree area targeted by the blanco cosmology survey (bcs), which iscentered roughly at right ascension 5h30m, declination -53 degrees. over twoseasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the spt at 95ghz, 150 ghz, and 225 ghz. we report the four most significant spt detectionsof sz clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and,therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an sz survey.the sz clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5-sigmasignificance in the high-sensitivity 150 ghz spt map. the sz spectrum of thesesources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locationsin the 95 ghz spt map and non-detections at those locations in the 225 ghz sptmap. multiband optical images from the bcs survey demonstrate significantconcentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the szdetections. photometric redshift estimates from the bcs data indicate that twoof the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z&gt;~ 0.8). one of the sz detections was previously identified as a galaxy clusterusing x-ray data from the rosat all-sky survey (rass). potential rasscounterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two ofthe new discoveries. these first four galaxy clusters are the most significantsz detections from a subset of the ongoing spt survey. as such, they serve as ademonstration that sz surveys, and the spt in particular, can be an effectivemeans for finding galaxy clusters.
