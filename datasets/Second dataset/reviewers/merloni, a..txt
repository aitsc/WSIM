0901.3372	cosmic evolution of radio selected active galactic nuclei in the cosmos  field	we explore the cosmic evolution of radio agn with low radio powers (l_1.4ghz&lt; 5\times10^25 w/hz) out to z=1.3 using to-date the largest sample of ~600 lowluminosity radio agn at intermediate redshift drawn from the vla-cosmos survey.we derive the radio luminosity function for these agn, and its evolution withcosmic time assuming two extreme cases: i) pure luminosity and ii) pure densityevolution. the former and latter yield l_*\propto(1+z)^(0.8+/-0.1), andphi*\propto (1+z)^(1.1+/-0.1), respectively, both implying a fairly modestchange in properties of low radio-power agn since z=1.3. we show that this isin stark contrast with the evolution of powerful (l_1.4ghz &gt; 5\times10^25 w/hz)radio agn over the same cosmic time interval, constrained using the 3crr, 6ce,and 7crs radio surveys by willott et al. (2001). we demonstrate that this canbe explained through differences in black hole fueling and triggeringmechanisms, and a dichotomy in host galaxy properties of weak and powerful agn.our findings suggest that high and low radio-power agn activity is triggered indifferent stages during the formation of massive red galaxies. we show thatweak radio agn occur in the most massive galaxies already at z~1, and they maysignificantly contribute to the heating of their surrounding medium and thusinhibit gas accretion onto their host galaxies, as recently suggested for the`radio mode' in cosmological models.

0902.4236	the hellas2xmm survey. xii. the infrared/sub-millimeter view of an x-ray  selected type 2 quasar at z=2	we present multi-wavelength observations (from optical to sub-millimeter,including spitzer and scuba) of h2xmmj 003357.2-120038 (also gd158_19), anx-ray selected, luminous narrow-line (type 2) quasar at z=1.957 selected fromthe hellas2xmm survey. its broad-band properties can be reasonably well modeledassuming three components: a stellar component to account for the optical andnear-ir emission, an agn component (i.e., dust heated by an accreting activenucleus), dominant in the mid-ir, with an optical depth at 9.7 micron along theline of sight (close to the equatorial plane of the obscuring matter) oftau(9.7)=1 and a full covering angle of the reprocessing matter (torus) of 140degrees, and a far-ir starburst component (i.e., dust heated by star formation)to reproduce the wide bump observed longward of 70 micron. the derivedstar-formation rate is about 1500 solar masses per year. the overall modelingindicates that gd158_19 is a high-redshift x-ray luminous, obscured quasar withcoeval powerful agn activity and intense star formation. it is probably caughtbefore the process of expelling the obscuring gas has started, thus quenchingthe star formation.

0910.1007	black hole growth and starburst activity at z = 0.6-4 in the chandra  deep field south. host galaxies properties of obscured agn	the co-evolution of host galaxies and the active black holes which reside intheir centre is one of the most important topics in modern observationalcosmology. here we present a study of the properties of obscured activegalactic nuclei (agn) detected in the cdfs 1ms observation and their hostgalaxies. we limited the analysis to the music area, for which deep k-bandobservations obtained with isaac@vlt are available, ensuring accurateidentifications of the counterparts of the x-ray sources as well as reliabledetermination of photometric redshifts and galaxy parameters, such as stellarmasses and star formation rates. in particular, we: 1) refined thex-ray/infrared/optical association of 179 sources in the music area detected inthe chandra observation; 2) studied the host galaxies observed and rest framecolors and properties. we found that x-ray selected (l_x&gt;10^{42} erg s^{-1})agn show spitzer colors consistent with both agn and starburst dominatedinfrared continuum; the latter would not have been selected as agn frominfrared diagnostics. the host galaxies of x-ray selected obscured agn are allmassive (m_*&gt;10^{10} m_sun) and, in 50% of the cases, are also actively formingstars (1/ssfr&lt;t_{hubble}) in dusty environments. the median l/ledd value of theactive nucleus is between 2% and 10% depending on the assumed m_{bh}/m_{*}ratio. finally, we found that the x-ray selected agn fraction increases withthe stellar mass up to a value of ~30% at z&gt;1 and m_*&gt;3x10^{11} m_sun, afraction significantly higher than in the local universe for agn of similarluminosities.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

0912.4166	the x-ray to optical-uv luminosity ratio of x-ray selected type 1 agn in  xmm-cosmos	we present a study of the x-ray to optical properties of a sample of 545x-ray selected type 1 agn, from the xmm-cosmos survey, over a wide range ofredshifts ($0.04&lt;\z&lt;4.25$) and x-ray luminosities ($40.6 \leq \log \lhard \leq45.3$). about 60% of them are spectroscopically identified type 1 agn, whilethe others have a reliable photometric redshift and are classified as type 1agn on the basis of their multi-band spectral energy distributions. we discussthe relationship between uv and x-ray luminosity, as parameterized by the$\alphaox$ spectral slope, and its dependence on redshift and luminosity. wecompare our findings with previous investigations of optically selectedbroad-line agn (mostly from sdss). a highly significant correlation between$\alphaox$ and $\lo$ is found, in agreement with previous investigations ofoptically selected samples. we calculate bolometric corrections, $\kbol$, forthe whole sample using hard x-ray luminosities ($\lhard$), and the eddingtonratios for a subsample of 150 objects for which black hole mass estimates areavailable. we confirm the trend of increasing bolometric correction withincreasing eddington ratio as proposed in previous works. a tight correlationis found between $\alphaox$ and $\kbol$, which can be used to estimate accuratebolometric corrections using only optical and x-ray data. we find a significantcorrelation between $\alphaox$ and eddington ratio, in which $\alphaox$increases for increasing eddington ratios.

1005.0289	properties of the integrated spectrum of serendipitous 2xmm catalogue  sources	our analysis is aimed at characterizing the properties of the integratedspectrum of active galactic nuclei (agns) such as the ubiquity of the fek{\alpha} emission in agns and the dependence of the spectral parameters on thex-ray luminosity and redshift. we selected 2646 point sources from the 2xmmcatalogue at high galactic latitude (|bii| &gt; 25 degrees) and with the sum ofepic-pn and epic-mos 0.2-12 kev counts greater than 1000. redshifts wereobtained for 916 sources from the ned. the final sample consists of 507 agn.individual source spectra have been summed in the observed frame to compute theintegrated spectra in different redshift and luminosity bins over the range0&lt;z&lt;5. detailed analysis of these spectra has been performed. we find that thenarrow fe k{\alpha} line at 6.4 kev is significantly detected up to z=1. theline equivalent width decreases with increasing x-ray luminosity in the 2-10kev band (''it effect''). the anti-correlation is characterized by the relationlog(ewfe) = (1.66 +/- 0.09) + (-0.43 +/- 0.07) log(lx,44), where ewfe is therest frame equivalent width of the neutral iron k{\alpha} line in ev and lx,44is the 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity in units of 10^{44} erg s^{-1}. the equivalentwidth is nearly independent of redshift up to z ~ 0.8 with an average value of101+/-40 (rms dispersion) ev in the luminosity range 43.5&lt;= loglx &lt;= 44.5. ouranalysis also confirmed the hardening of the spectral indices at lowluminosities implying a dependence of obscuration on luminosity. we confirmthat the neutral narrow fe k{\alpha} line is an almost ubiquitous feature ofagns. we find compelling evidence for the ''it effect'' over a redshiftinterval larger than probed in any previous study. we detect no evolution ofthe average rest frame equivalent width of the fe k{\alpha} line with redshift.

1012.0302	three years swift-bat survey of agn: reconciling theory and  observations?	it is well accepted that unabsorbed as well as absorbed agn are needed toexplain the nature and the shape of the cosmic x-ray background, even if thefraction of highly absorbed objects (dubbed compton-thick sources)substantially still escapes detection. we derive and analyze the absorptiondistribution using a complete sample of agn detected by swift-bat in the firstthree years of the survey. the fraction of compton-thick agn represents only4.6% of the total agn population detected by swift-bat. however, we show thatonce corrected for the bias against the detection of very absorbed sources thereal intrinsic fraction of compton-thick agn is 20$^{+9}_{-6}$%. we proved forthe first time (also in the bat band) that the anti-correlation of the fractionof absorbed agn and luminosity it tightly connected to the different behaviorof the luminosity functions (xlfs) of absorbed and unabsorbed agn. this pointstowards a difference between the two subsamples of objects with absorbed agnbeing, on average, intrinsically less luminous than unobscured ones. moreoverthe xlfs show that the fraction of obscured agn might also decrease at very lowluminosity. this can be successfully interpreted in the framework of a diskcloud outflow scenario as the disappearance of the obscuring region below acritical luminosity. our results are discussed in the framework of populationsynthesis models and the origin of the cosmic x-ray background.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1209.1478	spectral energy distributions of type 1 agn in the cosmos survey i - the  xmm-cosmos sample	the "cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) enables the study of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of active galactic nuclei (agn) because of the deepcoverage and rich sampling of frequencies from x-ray to radio. here we presenta sed catalog of 413 x-ray (\xmm) selected type 1 (emission line fwhm$&gt;2000$ kms$^{-1}$) agn with magellan, sdss or vlt spectrum. the seds are corrected forthe galactic extinction, for broad emission line contributions, constrainedvariability, and for host galaxy contribution. we present the mean sed and thedispersion seds after the above corrections in the rest frame 1.4 ghz to 40kev, and show examples of the variety of seds encountered. in the near-infraredto optical (rest frame $\sim 8\mu m$-- 4000\aa), the photometry is complete forthe whole sample and the mean sed is derived from detections only. reddeningand host galaxy contamination could account for a large fraction of theobserved sed variety. the seds are all available on-line.

1209.1640	accreting smbhs in the cosmos field and the connection to their host  galaxies	using the wide multi-band photometry available in the cosmos field we explorethe host galaxy properties of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (agn)obtained by combining x-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. based on acareful study of their spectral energy distribution (sed), which has beenparametrized using a 2-component (agn+galaxy) model fit, we deriveddust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formationrates (sfrs). we find that agn hosts span a large range of stellar masses andsfrs. no color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the agn hosts, which arefound to be mainly massive, red galaxies. once accounting for the color-massdegeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginalenhancement of agn incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific starformation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of ourability to properly account for agn light contamination and dust extinction.interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black holegrowing at any given "specific accretion rate" (i.e. the ratio of x-rayluminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxymass, while it decreases as a power-law with lx/m. by analyzing thenormalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence ofagn increases with redshift as rapidly as (1+z)^4, in close resemblance withthe overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxypopulation. although agn activity and star formation in galaxies do appear tohave a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within thecosmos sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signalingpowerful agn influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

1310.1922	the mean star-forming properties of qso host galaxies	quasi-stellar objects (qsos) occur in galaxies in which supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. manypopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and smbhs predict thatqsos are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by importantprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature ofgalaxies. a detailed study of the star-forming properties of qsos is a criticaltest of such models. we present a far-infrared herschel/pacs study of the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of a sample of spectroscopically observed qsos to z~2from the cosmos extragalactic survey. this is the largest sample to date ofmoderately luminous agns studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.we study trends of the mean sfr with redshift, black hole mass, nuclearbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (eddington ratio). tominimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of smbhproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects withinspectroscopic qso samples that influence the interpretation of sfr trends. wefind that the mean sfrs of these qsos are consistent with those of normalmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between smbh and galaxy massat all redshifts. no strong enhancement in sfr is found even among the mostrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean sfr trends from differentassumptions about the star-forming properties of qso hosts and redshiftevolution of the smbh-galaxy relationship. while limited currently byuncertainties, valuable constraints on agn-galaxy co-evolution can emerge fromour approach.

1311.1305	the incidence of obscuration in active galactic nuclei	we study the incidence of nuclear obscuration on a complete sample of 1310agn selected on the basis of their rest-frame 2-10 kev x-ray flux from thexmm-cosmos survey, in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3.5. we classify the agn asobscured or un-obscured on the basis of either the optical spectral propertiesand the overall sed or the shape of the x-ray spectrum. the two classificationsagree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be furthersubdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities x-ray un-obscured agndo not always show signs of broad lines or blue/uv continuum emission in theiroptical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at highluminosities broad line agn may have absorbed x-ray spectra, which hints at anincreased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration. weconfirm that the fraction of obscured agn is a decreasing function of theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, while the incidence of absorption shows significantevolution only for the most luminous agn, which appear to be more commonlyobscured at higher redshift. we find no significant difference between the meanstellar masses and star formation rates of obscured and un-obscured agn hosts.we conclude that the physical state of the medium responsible for obscurationin agn is complex, and mainly determined by the radiation environment (nuclearluminosity) in a small region enclosed within the gravitational sphere ofinfluence of the central black hole, but is largely insensitive to the widerscale galactic conditions.

1312.2264	agn x-ray variability in the xmm-cosmos survey	we took advantage of the observations carried out by xmm in the cosmos fieldduring 3.5 years, to study the long term variability of a large sample of agn(638 sources), in a wide range of redshift (0.1&lt;z&lt;3.5) and x-ray luminosity($10^{41}&lt;$l(2-10)$&lt;10^{45.5}$). both a simple statistical method to asses thesignificance of variability, and the normalized excess variance($\sigma^{2}_{rms}$) parameter, where used to obtain a quantitative measurementof the variability. variability is found to be prevalent in most agn, wheneverwe have good statistic to measure it, and no significant differences betweentype-1 and type-2 agn were found. a flat (slope -0.23+/-0.03) anti-correlationbetween $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity is found, when significantlyvariable sources are considered all together. when divided in three redshiftbins, the anti-correlation becomes stronger and evolving with z, with higherredshift agn being more variable. we prove however that this effect is due tothe pre-selection of variable sources: considering all the sources withavailable $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ measurement, the evolution in redshift disappears.for the first time we were also able to study the long term x-ray variabilityas a function of $m_{\rm bh}$ and eddington ratio, for a large sample of agnspanning a wide range of redshift. an anti-correlation between$\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and $m_{\rm bh}$ is found, with the same slope of theanti-correlation between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity, suggestingthat the latter can be a byproduct of the former one. no clear correlation isfound between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the eddington ratio in our sample.finally, no correlation is found between the x-ray $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and theoptical variability.

1402.0004	x-ray spectral modelling of the agn obscuring region in the cdfs:  bayesian model selection and catalogue	agn are known to have complex x-ray spectra that depend on both theproperties of the accreting smbh (e.g. mass, accretion rate) and thedistribution of obscuring material in its vicinity ("torus"). often however,simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the x-ray spectra ofagn. in the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have animpact on e.g. the determination of the agn luminosity function, the inferredaccretion history of the universe and also on our understanding of the relationbetween agn and their host galaxies. we develop a bayesian framework for modelcomparison and parameter estimation of x-ray spectra. we take into accountuncertainties associated with x-ray data and photometric redshifts. we alsodemonstrate how bayesian model comparison can be used to select among tendifferent physically motivated x-ray spectral models the one that provides abetter representation of the observations. despite the use of low-countspectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry ofthe torus. for a sample of 350 agn in the 4 ms chandra deep field south field,our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity ofthe observed x-ray spectra: (abridged). simpler models are ruled out withdecisive evidence in favour of a geometrically extended structure withsignificant compton scattering. regarding the geometry of the obscurer, thereis strong evidence against both a completely closed or entirely open toroidalgeometry, in favour of an intermediate case. the additional compton reflectionrequired by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a signof a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk.finally, we release a catalogue with estimated parameters such as the accretionluminosity in the 2-10 kev band and the column density, $n_{h}$, of theobscurer.

1503.01783	evidence for feedback in action from the molecular gas content in the  z~1.6 outflowing qso xid2028	gas outflows are believed to play a pivotal role in shaping galaxies, as theyregulate both star formation and black hole growth. despite their ubiquitouspresence, the origin and the acceleration mechanism of such powerful andextended winds is not yet understood. direct observations of the cold gascomponent in objects with detected outflows at other wavelengths are needed toassess the impact of the outflow on the host galaxy interstellar medium (ism).we observed with the plateau de bure interferometer an obscured quasar atz~1.5, xid2028, for which the presence of an ionised outflow has beenunambiguously signalled by nir spectroscopy. the detection of co(3-2) emissionin this source allows us to infer the molecular gas content and compare it tothe ism mass derived from the dust emission. we then analyze the results in thecontext of recent insights on scaling relations, which describe the gas contentof the overall population of star-forming galaxies at a similar redshifts. thestar formation efficiency (~100) and gas mass (m_gas=2.1-9.5x10^{10} m_sun)inferred from the co(3-2) line depend on the underlying assumptions on theexcitation of the transition and the co-to-h2 conversion factor. however, thecombination of this information and the ism mass estimated from the dust masssuggests that the ism/gas content of xid2028 is significantly lower thanexpected for its observed m$_\star$, ssfr and redshift, based on the mostup-to-date calibrations (with gas fraction &lt;20% and depletion time scale &lt;340myr). overall, the constraints we obtain from the far infrared and millimeterdata suggest that we are observing qso feedback able to remove the gas from thehost

1503.04870	a tidal disruption flare in a massive galaxy? implications for the  fuelling mechanisms of nuclear black holes	we argue that the `changing look' agn recently reported by lamassa et al.could be a luminous flare produced by the tidal disruption of a super-solarmass star passing just a few gravitational radii outside the event horizon of a$\sim 10^8 m_{\odot}$ nuclear black hole. this flare occurred in a massive,star forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks torepeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. by takingdifference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year sdss stripe-82light-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum overthe course of the outburst. the tidal disruption event (tde) interpretation isconsistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, whichdisplays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (witha clear superimposed re-brightening flare). our analysis places constraints onthe physical properties of the tde, such as the putative disrupted star's massand orbital parameters, as well as the size and temperature of the emittingmaterial. the properties of the broad and narrow emission lines observed in twoepochs of sdss spectra provide further constraints on the circum-nuclearstructure, and could be indicative that the system hosted a moderate-luminosityagn as recently as a few $10^4$ years ago, and is likely undergoing residualaccretion as late as ten years after peak, as seen from the broad h$\alpha$emission line. we discuss the complex interplay between tidal disruption eventsand gas accretion episodes in galactic nuclei, highlighting the implicationsfor future tde searches and for estimates of their intrinsic rates.

1505.04940	observing supermassive black holes across cosmic time: from  phenomenology to physics	in the last decade, a combination of high sensitivity, high spatialresolution observations and of coordinated multi-wavelength surveys hasrevolutionized our view of extra-galactic black hole (bh) astrophysics. we nowknow that supermassive black holes reside in the nuclei of almost every galaxy,grow over cosmological times by accreting matter, interact and merge with eachother, and in the process liberate enormous amounts of energy that influencedramatically the evolution of the surrounding gas and stars, providing apowerful self-regulatory mechanism for galaxy formation. the differentenergetic phenomena associated to growing black holes and active galacticnuclei (agn), their cosmological evolution and the observational techniquesused to unveil them, are the subject of this chapter. in particular, i willfocus my attention on the connection between the theory of high-energyastrophysical processes giving rise to the observed emission in agn, theobservable imprints they leave at different wavelengths, and the methods usedto uncover them in a statistically robust way. i will show how such a combinedeffort of theorists and observers have led us to unveil most of the smbh growthover a large fraction of the age of the universe, but that nagginguncertainties remain, preventing us from fully understating the exact role ofblack holes in the complex process of galaxy and large-scale structureformation, assembly and evolution.

1507.07558	the x-ray luminosity function of active galactic nuclei in the redshift  interval z=3-5	we combine deep x-ray survey data from the chandra observatory and thewide-area/shallow xmm-xxl field to estimate the agn x-ray luminosity functionin the redshift range z=3-5. the sample consists of nearly 340 sources witheither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.the combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminositybaseline of three orders of magnitude, lx(2-10kev)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z&gt;3. wefollow a bayesian approach to determine the binned agn space density andexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. our methodology accountsfor poisson errors in the determination of x-ray fluxes and uncertainties inphotometric redshift estimates. we demonstrate that the latter is essential forunbiased measurement of space densities. we find that the agn x-ray luminosityfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. thereis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminositydependent. the space density of agn with lx&lt;1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5between the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter agnappears to be milder. comparison of our x-ray luminosity function with that ofuv/optical selected qsos at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at brightluminosities, lx&gt;1e45erg/s. the faint-end slope of uv/optical luminosityfunctions however, is steeper than for x-ray selected agn. this implies thatthe type-i agn fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z&gt;3, oppositeto trends established at lower redshift. we also assess the significance of agnin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. our x-ray luminosity functionyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep theuniverse ionised at redshift z&gt;4. a source of uncertainty in this calculationis the escape fraction of uv photons for x-ray selected agn.

astro-ph;0006139	magnetic flares and the optical variability of the x-ray transient xte  j1118+480	the simultaneous presence of a strong quasi periodic oscillation of period ofabout 10 seconds in the optical and x-ray lightcurves of the x-ray transientxte j1118+480 suggests that a significant fraction of the optical fluxoriginates from the inner part of the accretion flow, where most of the x-raysare produced. we present a model of magnetic flares in an accretion disc coronawhere thermal cyclo-synchrotron emission contributes significantly to theoptical emission, while the x-rays are produced by inverse compton scatteringof the soft photons produced by dissipation in the underlying disc and by thesynchrotron process itself. given the observational constraints, we estimatethe values for the coronal temperature, optical depth and magnetic fieldintensity, as well as the accretion rate for the source. within our model wepredict a correlation between optical and hard x-ray variability and ananticorrelation between optical and soft x-rays. we also expect opticalvariability on flaring timescales (about tens of milliseconds), with a powerdensity spectrum similar to the one observed in the x-ray band. finally we useboth the available optical/euv/x-ray spectral energy distribution and the lowfrequency time variability to discuss limits on the inner radius of theoptically thick disc.

astro-ph;0108342	the effects of a comptonizing corona on the appearance of the reflection  components in accreting black hole spectra	we discuss the effects of a comptonizing corona on the appearance of thereflection components, and in particular of the reflection hump, in the x-raysspectra of accreting black holes. indeed, in the framework of a thermal coronamodel, we expect that part (or even all, depending on the coronal coveringfactor) of the reflection features should cross the hot plasma, and thus suffercompton scattering, before being observed. we have studied in detail thedependence of these effects on the physical (i.e. temperature and opticaldepth) and geometrical (i.e. inclination angle) parameters of the corona,concentrating on the slab geometry . due to the smoothing and shifting towardshigh energies of the comptonized reflection hump, the main effects on theemerging spectra appear above 100 kev. we have also investigated the importanceof such effects on the interpretation of the results obtained with the standardfitting procedures. we found that fitting comptonization models, taking intoaccount comptonized reflection, by the usual cut-off power law + uncomptonizedreflection model, may lead to an underestimation of the reflectionnormalization and an overestimation of the high energy cut-off. we discuss andillustrate the importance of these effects by analysing recent observationalresults as those of the galaxy ngc 4258. we also find that the comptonizingcorona can produce and/or emphasize correlations between the reflectionfeatures characteristics (like the iron line equivalent width or the coveringfraction) and the x-ray spectral index similar to those recently reported inthe literature. we also underline the importance of these effects when dealingwith accurate spectral fitting of the x-ray background.

astro-ph;0108373	thunderclouds and accretion discs: a model for the spectral and temporal  variability of seyfert 1 galaxies	x-ray observations of seyfert 1 galaxies offer the unique possibility ofobserving spectral variability on timescales comparable to the dynamical timeof the inner accretion flow. they typically show highly variable lightcurves,with power density spectra characterized by `red noise' and a break at lowfrequencies. time resolved spectral analysis have established that spectralvariability on the shortest timescales is important in all these sources, withthe spectra getting softer at high fluxes. here we present a model that is ableto explain a number of the above mentioned properties in terms of magneticflares shining above a standard accretion disc and producing the x-ray spectrumvia inverse compton scattering soft photons (both intrinsic and reprocessedthermal emission from the accretion disc and locally produced synchrotronradiation). we show that the fundamental heating event, likely caused bymagnetic reconnection, must be compact, with typical size comparable to theaccretion disc thickness and must be triggered at a height at least an order ofmagnitude larger than its size; the spatial and temporal distribution of flaresare not random: the heating of the corona proceeds in correlated trains ofevents in an avalanche fashion. the amplitude of the avalanches obeys apower-law distribution and determines the size of the active regions where thespectrum is produced. with our model we simulate x-ray lightcurves thatreproduce the main observational properties of the power density spectra and ofthe x-ray continuum short-term variability of seyfert 1 galaxies. by comparingthem with observations of mgc--6-30-15, we are able to infer that the corona inthis source must have a large optical depth (tau &gt;1.5) and small averagecovering fraction.

astro-ph;0112451	coronal outflow dominated accretion discs: a new possibility for low  luminosity black holes?	the spectral energy distributions of galactic black holes in the low/hardstate and of low-luminosity agn possess many common features, the mostprominent being: compact, flat (or inverted) spectrum radio cores with highbrightness temperatures; excess red and infrared emission, often correlatedwith the radio flux; an extremely weak (or absent) quasi-thermal hump and ahard x-ray power-law with high energy cut-off. these sources are thought to beaccreting at low rates and advection (or convection) dominated accretion flowsare usually considered the best candidates to explain them. here we present analternative possibility, involving strong, unbound, magnetic coronae generatedby geometrically thin, optically thick accretion discs at low accretion rates.first we show that, if angular momentum transport in the disc is due tomagnetic turbulent stresses, the magnetic energy density and effective viscousstresses inside the disc are proportional to the geometric mean of the total(gas plus radiation) and gas pressure. therefore the corona is less powerful ina radiation pressure dominated disc, and the relative fraction of the powerliberated in the corona increases as the accretion rate decreases. furthermore,we discuss reasons why energetically dominant coronae are ideal sites forlaunching powerful jets/outflows, both mhd and thermally driven. in analysingthe spectral properties of such coronal outflow dominated accretion discs, wereach the important conclusion that if the jet/outflow is, as is likely,radiatively inefficient, then so is the source overall, even without advectionof energy into the black hole being relevant for the dynamics of the accretionflow.

astro-ph;0202297	how the x-ray spectrum of a narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy may be  reflection dominated	a model for the inner regions of accretion flows is presented where, due todisc instabilities, cold and dense material is clumped into deep sheets orrings. surrounding these density enhancements is hot, tenuous gas where coronaldissipation processes occur. we expect this situation to be most relevant whenthe accretion rate is close to eddington and the disc is radiation-pressuredominated, and so may apply to narrow-line seyfert~1 (nls1) galaxies. in thisscenario, the hard x-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so thedetected x-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of thesheets. a simple comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indicescharacteristic of nls1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closelysurrounding the hard x-ray source. we test this model by fitting the xmm-newtonspectrum of the nls1 1h 0707-495 between 0.5 and 11 kev with reflectiondominated ionized disc models. a very good fit is found with three differentreflectors each subject to the same \gamma=2.35 power-law. an ironoverabundance is still required to fit the sharp drop in the spectrum at around7 kev. we note that even a small corrugation of the accretion disc may resultin \gamma &gt; 2 and a strong reflection component in the observed spectrum.therefore, this model may also explain the strength and the variabilitycharacteristics of the mcg-6-30-15 fe k line. the idea needs to be tested withfurther broadband xmm-newton observations of nls1s.

astro-ph;0302074	beyond the standard accretion disc model: coupled magnetic disc--corona  solutions with a physically motivated viscosity law	we present a systematic, analytical study of geometrically thin, opticallythick accretion disc solutions for magnetized turbulent flows, with analpha-like viscosity prescription. under the only assumptions that (1)magneto-rotational instability (mri) generates the turbulence that produces theanomalous viscosity needed for accretion to proceed, and that (2) the magneticfield amplified by the instability saturates due to buoyant vertical escape, weare able to self-consistently solve the disc structure equations including thefraction of power, f, that is carried off by vertical poynting flux (and likelydissipated outside the optically thick disc). for low-viscosity discs, weobtain stable high-f solutions at low accretion rates, when gas pressuredominates, and unstable, low-f, radiation pressure dominated solutions at highaccretion rates. for high viscosity discs, instead, a new thermally andviscously stable, radiation pressure dominated solution is found, characterizedby f~1 and appearing only above a critical accretion rate (of the order of fewtenths of the eddington one). we discuss the regimes of validity of ourassumptions, and the astrophysical relevance of our solutions. we conclude thatour newly discovered thin disc solutions, possibly accompanied by powerful,magnetically dominated coronae and outflows, should be seriously considered asmodels for black holes accreting at super-eddington rates.

astro-ph;0303143	iron k alpha line profiles and the inner boundary condition of accretion  flows	recent x-ray observations have shown evidence for exceptionally broad andskewed iron k alpha emission lines from several accreting black hole systems.the lines are assumed to be due to fluorescence of the accretion diskilluminated by a surrounding corona and require a steep emissivity profileincreasing in to the innermost radius. this appears to question both standardaccretion disc theory and the zero torque assumption for the inner boundarycondition, both of which predict a much less extreme profile. instead it arguesthat a torque may be present due to magnetic coupling with matter in theplunging region or even to the spinning black hole itself. discussion so farhas centered on the torque acting on the disc. however the crucial determinantof the iron line profile is the radial variation of the power radiated in thecorona. here we study the effects of different inner boundary conditions on thecoronal emissivity and on the profiles of the observable fe k alpha lines. weargue that in the extreme case where a prominent highly redshifted component ofthe iron line is detected, requiring a steep emissivity profile in theinnermost part and a flatter one outside, energy from the gas plunging into theblack hole is being fed directly to the corona.

astro-ph;0410282	constraints on relativistic beaming from estimators of the unbeamed flux	we review the statistical properties of relativistic doppler boostingrelevant for studies of relativistic jets from compact objects based onradio--x-ray(--mass) correlations, such as that found in black-hole x-raybinaries in the low/hard state, or the ``fundamental plane'' of merloni, heinz,&amp; dimatteo. we show that the presence of only moderate scatter in suchrelations does not necessarily imply low lorentz factors of the jets producingthe radio emission in the samples under consideration. applying doppler beamingstatistics to a large sample of xrbs and agn, we derive a limit on the width ofthe lorentz factor distribution of black holes with relativistic jets: if thex-rays are unbeamed (e.g., if they originate in the accretion disk or in theslower, innermost part of the jet), the width of the \beta\gamma distributionshould be about one order of magnitude or less. if the scatter about the``fundamental plane'' is entirely dominated by relativistic beaming, a lowerlimit on the mean lorentz factor &lt;\beta\gamma&gt; &gt; 5 can be derived. on the otherhand, if the x-rays are boosted by the same factor as the radio emission, weshow that the observed scatter cannot be reasonably explained by dopplerboosting alone.

astro-ph;0603159	on the limit cycle instability in magnetized accretion discs	observational evidence accumulated over the past decade indicates thataccretion discs in x-ray binaries are viscously stable unless they accrete veryclose to the eddington limit. this is at odds with the most basic standardaccretion disc theory, but could be explained by either having the discs to bemuch cooler whereby they are not radiation pressure dominated, or by a moresophisticated viscosity law. here we argue that the latter is taking place inpractice, on the basis of a stability analysis that assumes that themagneto-rotational-instability (mri) responsible for generating the turbulentstresses inside the discs is also the source for a magnetically dominatedcorona. we show that observations of stable discs in the high/soft states ofblack hole binaries, on the one hand, and of the strongly variable microquasargrs 1915+105 on the other, can all be explained if the magnetic turbulentstresses inside the disc scale proportionally to the geometric mean of gas andtotal pressure with a constant of proportionality (viscosity parameter) havinga value of a few times 10^{-2}. implications for bright agn are also brieflydiscussed

astro-ph;0605376	a radio-emitting outflow in the quiescent state of a0620-00:  implications for modelling low-luminosity black hole binaries	deep observations with the very large array of a0620-00, performed in 2005august, resulted in the first detection of radio emission from a black holebinary at x-ray luminosities as low as 10^{-8.5} times the eddington limit. themeasured radio flux density, of 51 \pm 7 microjy at 8.5 ghz, is the lowestreported for an x-ray binary system so far, and is interpreted in terms ofpartially self-absorbed synchrotron emission from outflowing plasma. making useof the estimated outer accretion rate of a0620-00 in quiescence, we demonstratethat the outflow kinetic power must be energetically comparable to the totalaccretion power associated with such rate, if it was to reach the black holewith the standard radiative efficiency of 10 per cent. this favours a model forquiescence in which a radiatively inefficient outflow accounts for a sizablefraction of the missing energy, and, in turn, substantially affects the overalldynamics of the accretion flow. simultaneous observations in the x-ray band,with chandra, confirm the validity of a non-linear radio/x-ray correlation forhard state black hole binaries down to low quiescent luminosities, therebycontradicting some theoretical expectations. taking the mass term into account,the a0620-00 data lie on the extrapolation of the so called fundamental planeof black hole activity, which has thus been extended by more than 2 orders ofmagnitude in radio and x-ray luminosity. with the addition of the a0620-00point, the plane relation provides an empirical proof for the scale-invarianceof the jet-accretion coupling in accreting black holes over the entireparameter space observable with current instrumentation.

astro-ph;0606262	on the x-ray spectra of luminous, inhomogeneous accretion flows	we discuss the expected x-ray spectral and variability properties of blackhole accretion discs at high luminosity, under the hypothesis that radiationpressure dominated discs are subject to violent clumping instabilities and, asa result, have a highly inhomogeneous two-phase structure. after deriving thefull accretion disc solutions explicitly in terms of the parameters of themodel, we study their radiative properties both with a simple two-zones model,treatable analytically, and with radiative transfer simulations which accountsimultaneously for energy balance and comptonisation in the hot phase, togetherwith reflection, reprocessing, ionization and thermal balance in the coldphase. we show that, if not only the density, but also the heating rate withinthese flows is inhomogeneous, then complex reflection-dominated spectra can beobtained for a high enough covering fraction of the cold phase. in general,large reflection components in the observed x-ray spectra should be associatedwith strong soft excesses, resulting from the combined emission of ionizedatomic emission lines. the variability properties of such systems are suchthat, even when contributing to a large fraction of the hard x-ray spectrum,the reflection component is less variable than the power-law like emissionoriginating from the hot comptonising phase, in agreement with what is observedin many narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies and bright seyfert 1. our model fallswithin the family of those trying to explain the complex x-ray spectra ofbright agn with ionized reflection, but presents an alternative, specific,physically motivated, geometrical setup for the complex multi-phase structureof the inner regions of near-eddington accretion flows.

0809.2513	high redshift quasars in the cosmos survey: the space density of z&gt;3  x-ray selected qsos	we present a new measurement of the space density of high redshift(3.0&lt;z&lt;4.5), x-ray selected qsos obtained by exploiting the deep and uniformmultiwavelength coverage of the cosmos survey. we have assembled astatistically large (40 objects), x-ray selected (f_{0.5-2 kev} &gt;10^{-15} cgs),homogeneous sample of z&gt;3 qsos for which spectroscopic (22) or photometric (18)redshifts are available. we present the optical (color-color diagrams) andx-ray properties, the number counts and space densities of the z&gt;3 x-rayselected quasars population and compare our findings with previous works andmodel predictions. we find that the optical properties of x-ray selectedquasars are not significantly different from those of optically selectedsamples. there is evidence for substantial x-ray absorption (logn_h&gt;23 cm^{-2})in about 20% of the sources in the sample. the comoving space density ofluminous (l_x &gt;10^{44} erg s^-1) qsos declines exponentially (by an e--foldingper unit redshift) in the z=3.0-4.5 range, with a behavior similar to thatobserved for optically bright unobscured qsos selected in large area opticalsurveys. prospects for future, large and deep x-ray surveys are also discussed.

0810.0720	chasing highly obscured qsos in the cosmos field	(abridged) we take advantage of the deep chandra and spitzer coverage of alarge area (more than 10 times the area covered by the chandra deep fields,cdfs in the cosmos field, to extend the search of highly obscured,compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. these sources have lowsurface density and large samples can be provided only through large areasurveys, like the cosmos survey. we analyze the x-ray properties of cosmos mipssources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$jy. for the mips sources notdirectly detected in the chandra images we produce stacked images in soft andhard x-rays bands. to estimate the fraction of compton-thick agn in the mipssource population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardnessratios to those predicted by detailed monte carlo simulations including bothobscured agn and star-forming galaxies. the density of lower luminositycompton-thick agn (logl(2-10kev)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of x-ray selectedagn. the comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, compton thickagn to the x-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured agn at high andlow luminosity suggests that compton-thick agn follow a luminosity dependencesimilar to that discovered for compton-thin agn, becoming relatively rarer athigh luminosities. we estimate that the fraction of agn (unobscured, moderatelyobscured and compton thick) to the total mips source population is $49\pm10%$,a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$mfluxes. we discuss how our findings can constrain agn feedback models.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].
