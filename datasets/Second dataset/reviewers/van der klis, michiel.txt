0904.2413	the first outburst of the new magnetar candidate sgr 0501+4516	we report here on the outburst onset and evolution of the new soft gammarepeater sgr 0501+4516. we monitored the new sgr with xmm-newton starting on2008 august 23, one day after the source became burst-active, and continuingwith 4 more observations, with the last one on 2008 september 30. combining thedata with the swift-xrt and suzaku data, we modelled the outburst decay over160 days, and we found that the source flux decreased exponentially with atimescale of t_c=23.8 days. in the first xmm-newton observation a large numberof short x-ray bursts were observed, the rate of which decayed drastically inthe following observations. we found large changes in the spectral and timingbehavior of the source during the outburst, with softening emission as the fluxdecayed, and the non-thermal soft x-ray spectral component fading faster thanthe thermal one. almost simultaneously to our xmm-newton observations (on 2008august 29 and september 2), we observed the source in the hard x-ray range withintegral, which clearly detected the source up to ~100kev in the firstpointing, while giving only upper limits during the second pointing,discovering a variable hard x-ray component fading in less than 10 days afterthe bursting activation. we performed a phase-coherent x-ray timing analysisover about 160 days starting with the burst activation and found evidence of astrong second derivative period component (\ddot{p} = -1.6(4)x10^{-19}s/s^{-2}). thanks to the phase-connection, we were able to study the thephase-resolved spectral evolution of sgr 0501+4516 in great detail. we alsoreport on the rosat quiescent source data, taken back in 1992 when the sourceexhibits a flux ~80 times lower than that measured during the outburst, and arather soft, thermal spectrum.

0906.4280	linking jet emission and x-ray properties in the peculiar neutron star  x-ray binary circinus x-1	we present the results of simultaneous x-ray and radio observations of thepeculiar z-type neutron star x-ray binary cir x-1, observed with the rossix-ray timing explorer satellite and the australia telescope compact array in2000 october and 2002 december. we identify typical z source behaviour in thepower density spectra as well as characteristic z patterns drawn in an x-rayhardness-intensity diagram. power spectra typical of bright atoll sources havealso been identified at orbital phases after the periastron passage, whileorbital phases before the periastron passage are characterized by power spectrathat are typical neither of z nor of atoll sources. we investigate the couplingbetween the x-ray and the radio properties, focusing on three orbital phaseswhen an enhancement of the radio flux density has been detected, to test thelink between the inflow (x-ray) and the outflow (radio jet) to/from the compactobject. in two out of three cases we associate the presence of the radio jet toa spectral transition in the x-rays, although the transition does not precedethe radio flare, as detected in other z sources. an analogous behaviour hasrecently been found in the black hole candidate gx 339-4. in the third case,the radio light curve shows a similar shape to the x-ray light curve. wediscuss our results in the context of jet models, considering also black holecandidates.

0708.0211	the long-term evolution of the spin, pulse shape, and orbit of the  accretion-powered millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658	we present a 7 yr timing study of the 2.5 ms x-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658,an x-ray transient with a recurrence time of ~2 yr, using data from the rossix-ray timing explorer covering 4 transient outbursts (1998-2005). we verifythat the 401 hz pulsation traces the spin frequency fundamental and not aharmonic. substantial pulse shape variability, both stochastic and systematic,was observed during each outburst. analysis of the systematic pulse shapechanges suggests that, as an outburst dims, the x-ray "hot spot" on the pulsarsurface drifts longitudinally and a second hot spot may appear. the overallpulse shape variability limits the ability to measure spin frequency evolutionwithin a given x-ray outburst (and calls previous nudot measurements of thissource into question), with typical upper limits of |nudot| &lt; 2.5x10^{-14} hz/s(2 sigma). however, combining data from all the outbursts shows with high (6sigma) significance that the pulsar is undergoing long-term spin down at a ratenudot = (-5.6+/-2.0)x10^{-16} hz/s, with most of the spin evolution occurringduring x-ray quiescence. we discuss the possible contributions of magneticpropeller torques, magnetic dipole radiation, and gravitational radiation tothe measured spin down, setting an upper limit of b &lt; 1.5x10^8 g for thepulsar's surface dipole magnetic field and and q/i &lt; 5x10^{-9} for thefractional mass quadrupole moment. we also measured an orbital periodderivative of pdot = (3.5+/-0.2)x10^{-12} s/s. this surprising large pdot isreminiscent of the large and quasi-cyclic orbital period variation observed inthe so-called "black widow" millisecond radio pulsars, supporting speculationthat sax j1808.4-3658 may turn on as a radio pulsar during quiescence. in anappendix we derive an improved (0.15 arcsec) source position from optical data.

1005.3210	xte j1701-462 and its implications for the nature of subclasses in  low-magnetic-field neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries	we report on an analysis of rxte data of the transient neutron star low-massx-ray binary (ns-lmxb) xte j1701-462, obtained during its 2006-2007 outburst.the x-ray properties of the source changed between those of various types ofns-lmxb subclasses. at high luminosities the source switched between two typesof z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from zsource to atoll source behavior. these transitions between subclasses primarilymanifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in x-ray color-colorand hardness-intensity diagrams, but they are accompanied by changes in the khzquasi-periodic oscillations, broad-band variability, burst behavior, and/orx-ray spectra. we find that the low-energy x-ray flux is a good parameter totrack the gradual evolution of the tracks in color-color and hardness-intensitydiagrams, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detailthan before and relate the observed properties to other ns-lmxbs. we furtherfind that during the transition from z to atoll, characteristic behavior knownas the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of aweakening z source flaring branch, thereby blurring the line between the twosubclasses. our findings strongly suggest that the wide variety in behaviorobserved in ns-lxmbs with different luminosities can be linked through changesin a single variable parameter, namely the mass accretion rate, without theneed for additional differences in the neutron star parameters or viewingangle. we briefly discuss the implications of our findings for the spectralchanges observed in ns lmxbs and suggest that, contrary to what is oftenassumed, the position along the color-color tracks of z sources is notdetermined by the instantaneous mass accretion rate.

1006.2214	photospheric radius expansion during magnetar bursts	on august 24th 2008 the new magnetar sgr 0501+4516 (discovered by swift)emitted a bright burst with a pronounced double-peak structure in hard x-rays,reminiscent of the double-peak temporal structure seen in some brightthermonuclear bursts on accreting neutron stars. in the latter case this is dueto photospheric radius expansion (pre): when the flux reaches the eddingtonlimit, the photosphere expands and cools so that emission becomes softer anddrops temporarily out of the x-ray band, re-appearing as the photospheresettles back down. we consider the factors necessary to generate double-peakedpre events, and show that such a mechanism could plausibly operate in magnetarbursts, despite the vastly different emission process. identification of themagnetic eddington limit in a magnetar would constrain magnetic field anddistance and could, in principle, enable a measurement of gravitationalredshift. it would also locate the emitting region at the neutron star surface,constraining the burst trigger mechanism. conclusive confirmation of pre eventswill require more detailed radiative models for bursts. however for sgr0501+4516 the predicted critical flux (using the magnetic field strengthinferred from timing and the distance suggested by its probable location in theperseus arm of our galaxy) is consistent with that observed in the august 24thburst.

1104.0837	rapid variations of polarization in low-mass x-ray binaries	time-resolved optical and infrared polarimetric observations of black holeand neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries are presented. data were acquired withthe vlt, ukirt and hippo on the saao 1.9-m. we find that for some sources inoutburst, a rapidly variable component of polarization is evident that isstronger in the redder wavebands. we attribute this to the polarimetricsignature of synchrotron emission from jets in these systems, the emission ofwhich is known to dominate these redder bands. such synchrotron emission fromjets launched close to black holes and neutron stars can be highly linearlypolarized, depending on the configuration of the magnetic field. thevariability of the polarization is suggestive of a tangled and turbulentmagnetic field at the location of the compact jet. for some sources theposition angle of polarization is consistent with a magnetic field that isparallel to the observed radio jet. these are some of the first observationalconstraints of the geometry and magnetic structure at the inner regions of theoutflow. we also present the first ever simultaneous optical polarization andx-ray campaign of an x-ray binary, using data taken simultaneously with hippoand rxte with sub-second time resolution.

1212.1011	quasi-periodic oscillations and broadband variability in short magnetar  bursts	the discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in magnetar giant flareshas opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. however, with onlythree giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient qualityto search for qpos, such analysis is seriously data limited. we set out aprocedure for doing qpo searches in the far more numerous, short, lessenergetic magnetar bursts. the short, transient nature of these bursts requiresthe implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliableinferences. using bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as acombination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at highfrequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. we useempirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodicand quasi-periodic oscillations at these frequencies. we compare our methodwith previously used techniques and find that although it is on the whole moreconservative, it is also more reliable in ruling out false positives. weillustrate our bayesian method by applying it to a sample of 27 bursts from themagnetar sgr j0501+4516 observed by the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor, and wefind no evidence for the presence of qpos in any of the bursts in the unbinnedspectra, but do find a candidate detection in the binned spectra of one burst.however, whether this signal is due to a genuine quasi-periodic process, or canbe attributed to unmodeled effects in the noise is at this point a matter ofinterpretation.

1303.1370	new methods for timing analysis of transient events, applied to  fermi/gbm magnetar bursts	in order to discern the physical nature of many gamma-ray sources in the sky,we must look not only in spectral and spatial dimensions, but also understandtheir temporal variability. however, timing analysis of sources with a highlytransient nature, such as magnetar bursts, is difficult: standard fouriertechniques developed for long-term variability generally observed, for example,from agn often do not apply. here, we present newly developed timing methodsapplicable to transient events of all kinds, and show their successfulapplication to magnetar bursts observed with fermi/gbm. magnetars are a primesubject for timing studies, thanks to the detection of quasi-periodicities inmagnetar giant flares and their potential to help shed light on the structureof neutron stars. using state-of-the art statistical techniques, we search forquasi-periodicities (qpos) in a sample of bursts from soft gamma repeater sgrj0501+4516 observed with fermi/gbm and provide upper limits for potential qpodetections. additionally, for the first time, we characterise the broadbandvariability behaviour of magnetar bursts and highlight how this new informationcould provide us with another way to probe these mysterious objects.

1306.3823	an exact analytic treatment of propagating mass accretion rate  fluctuations in x-ray binaries	many statistical properties of the aperiodic variability observed in x-rayradiation from accreting compact objects can be naturally explained by thepropagating fluctuations model. this considers variations in mass accretionrate to be stirred up throughout the accretion flow. variations from the outerregions of the accretion flow will propagate towards the central object,modulating the variations from the inner regions and eventually modulating theradiation, giving rise to the observed linear rms-flux relation and alsofourier frequency dependent time lags. previous treatments of this model haverelied on computationally intensive monte carlo simulations which can onlyyield an estimate of statistical properties such as the power spectrum. here,we find exact and analytic expressions for the power spectrum and lag spectrumpredicted by the same model. we use our calculation to fit the model of ingram&amp; done (2012) to a power spectrum of xte j1550-564. the result we present herewill apply to any treatment of the propagating fluctuations model and thusprovides a very powerful tool for future theoretical modelling.

1404.2756	quasi-periodic oscillations in short recurring bursts of the soft-gamma  repeater j1550-5418	the discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in magnetar giant flareshas opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. the scarcity ofgiant flares makes a search for qpos in the shorter, far more numerous burstsfrom soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) desirable. in huppenkothen et al (2013), wedeveloped a bayesian method for searching for qpos in short magnetar bursts,taking into account the effects of the complicated burst structure, and haveshown its feasibility on a small sample of bursts. here, we apply the samemethod to a much larger sample from a burst storm of 286 bursts from sgrj1550-5418. we report a candidate signal at 260 hz in a search of theindividual bursts, which is fairly broad. we also find two qpos at 93 hz andone at 127 hz, when averaging periodograms from a number of bursts inindividual triggers, at frequencies close to qpos previously observed inmagnetar giant flares. finally, for the first time, we explore the overallburst variability in the sample, and report a weak anti-correlation between thepower-law index of the broadband model characterising aperiodic burstvariability, and the burst duration: shorter bursts have steeper power lawindices than longer bursts. this indicates that longer bursts vary over abroader range of time scales, and are not simply longer versions of the shortbursts.

1411.1967	phase-resolved spectroscopy of low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations  in grs 1915+105	x-ray radiation from black hole binary (bhb) systems regularly displaysquasi-periodic oscillations (qpos). in principle, a number of suggestedphysical mechanisms can reproduce their power spectral properties, thus morepowerful diagnostics which preserve phase are required to discern betweendifferent models. in this paper, we first find for two rossi x-ray timingexplorer (rxte) observations of the bhb grs 1915+105 that the qpo has a welldefined average waveform. that is, the phase difference and amplitude ratiosbetween the first two harmonics vary tightly around a well defined mean. thisenables us to reconstruct qpo waveforms in each energy channel, in order toconstrain qpo phase-resolved spectra. we fit these phase resolved spectraacross 16 phases with a model including comptonisation and reflection (gaussianand smeared edge components) to find strong spectral pivoting and a modulationin the iron line equivalent width. the latter indicates the observed reflectionfraction is changing throughout the qpo cycle. this points to a geometric qpoorigin, although we note that the data presented here do not entirely rule outan alternative interpretation of variable disc ionisation state. we also seetentative hints of modulations in the iron line centroid and width which,although not statistically significant, could result from a non-azimuthallysymmetric qpo mechanism.

0805.4610	coherence of burst oscillations and accretion-powered pulsations in the  accreting millisecond pulsar xte j1814-338	x-ray timing of the accretion-powered pulsations during the 2003 outburst ofthe accreting millisecond pulsar xte j1814-338 has revealed variation in thepulse time of arrival residuals. these can be interpreted in several ways,including spin-down and wandering of the fuel impact point around the magneticpole. in this letter we show that the burst oscillations of this source arecoherent with the persistent pulsations, to the level where they track all ofthe observed fluctuations. only one burst, which occurs at the lowest accretionrates, shows a significant phase offset. we discuss what might lead to suchrigid phase-locking between the modulations in the accretion and thermonuclearburst emission, and consider the implications for spin variation and the burstoscillation mechanism. wandering of the fuel impact hot spot around a fixedmagnetic pole seems the most likely cause for the accretion-powered pulse phasevariations. this means that the burst asymmetry is coupled to the hot spot, notthe magnetic pole. if premature ignition at this point (due to higher localtemperatures) triggers a burning front that stalls before spreading over theentire surface, the resulting localized nuclear hot spot may explain theunusual burst and burst oscillation properties of this source.

astro-ph;0002074	simultaneous measurements of x-ray luminosity and kilohertz  quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass x-ray binaries	we measure simultaneously the properties of the energy spectra and thefrequencies of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in fifteen lowmass x-ray binaries covering a wide range of x-ray luminosities. in each sourcethe qpo frequencies cover the same range of approximately 300 hz to 1300 hz,though the sources differ by two orders of magnitude in their x-rayluminosities (as measured from the unabsorbed 2-50 kev flux). so the x-rayluminosity does not uniquely determine the qpo frequency. this is difficult tounderstand since the evidence from individual sources indicates that thefrequency and luminosity are very well correlated at least over shorttimescales. perhaps beaming effects or bolometric corrections change theobserved luminosities, or perhaps part of the energy in mass accretion is usedto power outflows reducing the energy emitted in x-rays. it is also possiblethat the parameters of a qpo model are tuned in such a way that the same rangeof frequencies appears in all sources. different modes of accretion may beinvolved for example (disk and radial) or multiple parameters may conspire toyield the same frequencies.

astro-ph;0105446	the erratic luminosity behavior of sax j1808.4-3658 during its 2000  outburst	we report on the highly variable and erratic long-term x-ray luminositybehavior of the only known accretion-driven millisecond x-ray pulsar saxj1808.4-3658 during its 2000 outburst, as observed with rxte. the maximumobserved luminosity is ~2.5 x 10^35 erg s^-1 (3-25 kev; for a distance of 2.5kpc), which is a factor of ~10 lower than that observed during the 1996 and1998 outbursts. due to solar constraints, the source could not be observed forseveral months with rxte before 21 jan. 2000. therefore, the exact moment ofthe outburst onset is unknown and the peak luminosity could have beensignificantly higher. on some occasions sax j1808.4-3658 was observed withluminosities of ~10^35 erg s^-1, but on other occasions it could not bedetected with rxte resulting in upper limits of a few times 10^33 erg s^-1(3-25 kev). the non-detections of the source during its 2000 outburst obtainedwith bepposax demonstrate that its luminosity was at times &lt;10^32 erg s^-1(0.5-10 kev). however, only a few days after these bepposax observations, wedetected the source again with rxte at high luminosities, giving a factor of&gt;1000 of luminosity swings in this system on time scales of days. the lastdetection of sax j1808.4-3658 with rxte was on 2000 may 13, almost 4 monthsafter the first detection. due to the lack of sensitivity and observationsduring the 1996 and 1998 outbursts, it cannot be excluded that after thoseoutbursts the source remained active for months and that the source behaviorduring the 2000 outburst is not unique. long duration activity at lowluminosities has been observed in other transients (both neutron stars andblack holes), although not with such extreme variability which might point to adifferent origin for this behavior for the pulsar.

astro-ph;0204113	kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations difference frequency exceeds  inferred spin frequency in 4u 1636-53	recent observations of the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1636-53 with the rossix-ray timing explorer show, for the first time, a kilohertz quasi-periodicoscillation (khz qpo) peak separation that exceeds the neutron star spinfrequency as inferred from burst oscillations. this strongly challenges thesonic-point beat frequency model for the khz qpos found in low-mass x-raybinaries. we detect two simultaneous khz qpos with a frequency separation of323.3+-4.3 hz in an average fourier power spectrum of observations obtained inseptember 2001 and january 2002. the lower khz qpo frequency varied between 644hz and 769 hz. in previous observations of this source the peak separationfrequency was ~250 hz when the lower khz qpo frequency was ~900 hz. burstoscillations occur in 4u 1636-53 at ~581 hz and possibly at half that frequency(290.5 hz). this is the first source where the peak separation frequency isobserved to change from less than (half) the burst oscillation frequency tomore than that. this observation contradicts all previously formulatedimplementations of the sonic-point beat frequency model except those where thedisk in 4u 1636-53 switches from prograde to retrograde.

astro-ph;0307029	nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the maximum spin frequency of  neutron stars	millisecond pulsars are neutron stars (nss) that are thought to have beenspun-up by mass accretion from a stellar companion. it is unknown whether thereis a natural brake for this process, or if it continues until the centrifugalbreakup limit is reached at submillisecond periods. many nss that are accretingfrom a companion exhibit thermonuclear x-ray bursts that last tens of seconds,caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. millisecond brightnessoscillations during bursts from ten nss (as distinct from other rapid x-rayvariability that is also observed) are thought to measure the stellar spin, butdirect proof of a rotational origin has been lacking. here, we report thedetection of burst oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accretingmillisecond pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the samerotational phase. this firmly establishes burst oscillations as nuclear-poweredpulsations tracing the spin of accreting nss, corroborating earlier evidence.the distribution of spin frequencies of the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts offwell below the breakup frequency for most ns models, supporting theoreticalpredictions that gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques inspinning up millisecond pulsars.

astro-ph;0401290	an ultra-relativistic outflow from a neutron star accreting gas from a  companion	collimated relativistic outflows, or jets, are amongst the most energetic andrelativistic phenomena in the universe. they are associated with supermassiveblack holes in distant active galactic nuclei (agn), accreting black holes andneutron stars in binary systems and are believed to be responsible forgamma-ray bursts. the physics of these jets,however, remains something of amystery in that their bulk velocities, compositions and energetics remainpoorly determined. here we report the discovery of an ultra-relativisticoutflow from a binary accreting neutron star accreting gas within a binarysystem. the velocity of the outflow is comparable to the fastest-moving flowsobserved from active galactic nuclei, and its strength is modulated by the rateof accretion of material onto the neutron star. shocks are energized furtherdownstream in the flow, which are themselves moving with mildly relativisticbulk velocities and are the sites of the observed synchrotron emission from thejet. we conclude that the generation of such highly relativistic outflows doesnot require properties unique to black holes, such as an event horizon.

astro-ph;9812244	discovery of a ~7 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the low-luminosity  low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1820-30	we have discovered a 7.06+-0.08 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in thex-ray flux of the low-luminosity low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) and atoll source4u 1820-30. this qpo was only observable at the highest observed mass accretionrate, when the source was in the uppermost part of the banana branch, at a 2-25kev luminosity of 5.4x10^37 erg/s (for a distance of 6.4 kpc). the qpo had afwhm of only 0.5+-0.2 hz during small time intervals (32-s of data), and showederratic shifts in the centroid frequency between 5.5 and 8 hz. the rmsamplitude over the energy range 2-60 kev was 5.6%+-0.2%. the amplitudeincreased with photon energy from 3.7%+-0.5% between 2.8 and 5.3 kev to7.3%+-0.6% between 6.8 and 9.3 kev, above which it remained approximatelyconstant at ~7%. the time lag of the qpo between 2.8-6.8 and 6.8-18.2 kev wasconsistent with being zero (-1.2+-3.4 ms).  the properties of the qpo (i.e., its frequency and its presence only at thehighest observed mass accretion rate) are similar to those of the 5-20 hz qpoobserved in the highest luminosity lmxbs (the z sources) when they areaccreting near the eddington mass accretion limit. if this is indeed the samephenomenon, then models explaining the 5-20 hz qpo in the z sources, whichrequire the near-eddington accretion rates, will not hold. assuming isotropicemission, the 2-25 kev luminosity of 4u 1820-30 at the time of the 7 hz qpos isat maximum only 40% (for a companion star with cosmic abundances), but mostlikely ~20% (for a helium companion star) of the eddington accretion limit.

astro-ph;9901161	discovery of twin khz quasi-periodic oscillations in the high galactic  la titude x-ray transient xte j2123--058	we report the discovery of twin khz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in thepersistent x-ray flux of the new x-ray transient xte j2123-058. we detected theqpos in data taken with the proportional counter array on board the rossi x-raytiming explorer on 1998 july 14, when the source count rate was at about 50% ofits outburst peak level. the frequencies of the qpos were 853+/-4 hz and1129+/-8 hz. the peaks had widths of 32 (+11/-8) hz and 50 (+17/-13) hz and therms amplitudes were 6.1% (+0.7/-0.6) and 6.5% (+0.9/-0.8), respectively. theqpo frequencies increased marginally with count rate and the amplitudes showeda small increase with photon energy. on the basis of the appearance in thecolor-color and hardness-intensity diagrams, the low-frequency power spectrum,and the strength of the khz qpos, the system can be classified as an atollsource. the source showed five type i x-ray bursts. the distance to the sourceis estimated to be about 10 (5-15) kpc, which combined with the high galacticlatitude of 36.2 degrees indicates the source is a located in the galactichalo.

astro-ph;9902383	the discovery of a 7-14 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the x-ray  transient xte j1806-246	we have studied the correlated x-ray spectral and x-ray timing behavior ofthe x-ray transient xte j1806-246 using data obtained with the proportionalcounter array onboard the rossi x-ray timing explorer. in the x-ray color-colordiagram two distinct patterns are traced out. the first pattern is a curvedbranch, which is observed during the rise and the decay of the outburst. thispattern resembles the so-called banana branch of those low-luminosity neutronstar low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) which are referred to as atoll sources.the power spectrum of xte j1806-246 on this curved branch consisted of a powerlaw and a cutoff power law component. the presence of these components andtheir dependence on position of the source on the branch is also identical tothe behavior of atoll sources on the banana branch. near the end of it outburstxte j1806-246 formed patches in the color-color diagram, the spectrum washarder, and the power spectrum showed strong band limited noise, characteristicof the atoll sources in the island state. a second pattern was traced outduring the only observation at the peak of the outburst. it consists of astructure which we interpret as formed by two distinct branches. this patternresembles the normal-flaring branches of the high-luminosity neutron star lmxbs(the z sources). the discovery of a 7-14 hz qpo during this observationstrengthens this similarity. we conclude that if xte j1806-246 is a neutronstar, it is most likely an atoll source that only at the peak of its outburstreached a luminosity level sufficiently high to show the type of qpo that zsources who on their normal and flaring branches.

astro-ph;9903105	on the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring interpretations  of the horizontal branch oscillation in the z sources	we study the horizontal branch oscillations (hbo) and the two simultaneouskilohertz qpos comparing their properties in five z sources with thepredictions of the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring precessionmodels. we find that the variation of the hbo frequency with accretion ratepredicted by the magnetospheric beat-frequency model for a purely dipolarstellar magnetic field and a radiation-pressure-dominated inner accretion diskagrees well with the observed variation. this model implies that the neutronstars in the z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium, that their magneticfield strengths are ~10^9-10^10 g, and that the critical fastness parameter forthese sources is &gt;0.8. if the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is anorbital frequency in the accretion disk, the magnetospheric beat-frequencymodel requires that a small fraction of the gas in the disk does not couplestrongly to the stellar magnetic field at 3-4 stellar radii but instead driftsslowly inward in nearly circular orbits until it is within a few kilometers ofthe neutron star surface. the lense-thirring precession model is consistentwith the observed magnitudes of the hbo frequencies only if the moments ofinertia of the neutron stars in the z sources are 4-5 times larger than thelargest values predicted by realistic neutron-star equations of state. thetrend of the correlation between the hbo and upper khz qpo frequencies is notconsistent with this model. we argue that the change in the slope of thecorrelation between the frequency of the horizontal branch oscillation and thefrequency of the upper kilohertz qpo, when the latter is greater than 850 hz,is directly related to the varying frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos.

astro-ph;9903148	a variable 0.58--2.44 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the eclipsing and  dipping low-mass x-ray binary exo 0748-676	we report the discovery of a quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in dataobtained with the rossi x-ray timing explorer of the dipping and eclipsinglow-mass x-ray binary exo 0748-676. the qpo had a frequency between 0.58 and2.44 hz changing on time scales of a few days, an rms amplitude between 8% and12%, and was detected in the persistent emission, during dips and during type ix-ray bursts. during one observation, when the count rate was a factor 2 to 3higher than otherwise, the qpo was not detected. the strength of the qpo didnot significantly depend on photon energy, and is consistent with being thesame in the persistent emission, both during and outside the dips, and duringtype i x-ray bursts. frequency shifts were observed during three of the fourx-ray bursts. we argue that the qpo is produced by the same mechanism as theqpo recently found by jonker et al. (1999) in 4u 1323-62. although the exactmechanism is not clear, it is most likely related to the high inclination ofboth systems. an orbiting structure in the accretion disc that modulates theradiation from the central source seems the most promising mechanism.

astro-ph;9903450	the x-ray timing behavior of the x-ray burst source slx 1735-269	we report for the first time on the rapid x-ray variability of the galacticbulge source and x-ray burster slx 1735-269. the power spectrum as observedwith the rossi x-ray timing explorer is characterized by a strong band-limitednoise component which is approximately flat below a 0.1-2.3 hz break frequency;above this frequency the power spectrum declines as a power law of index 0.9.at the highest observed count rate a broad bump is superimposed on thisband-limited noise. the power spectrum is very similar to that of otherlow-luminosity neutron-star low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) and to black-holecandidates when these types of source accrete at their lowest observed massaccretion rates. however, we identify one unusual aspect of the x-rayvariability of slx 1735-269: the break frequency increases when the inferredmass accretion rate decreases. this is the opposite to what is normallyobserved in other sources. the only source for which the same behavior has beenobserved is the accretion-powered millisecond x-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658. nocoherent millisecond pulsations were observed from slx 1735-269 with an upperlimit on the amplitude of 2.2% rms. observing this behavior in slx 1735-269increases the similarities between sax j1808.4-3658 and the other neutron starlmxbs for which so far no coherent pulsations have been observed. we expectthat other sources will show the same behavior when these sources are studiedin detail at their lowest mass accretion rates.

astro-ph;9904352	x-ray timing behaviour of cygnus x-2 at low intensities	it is known that the overall (mean) intensity of the low-mass x-ray binarycyg x-2 varies on time scales from a day to months, independently from thevariations on time scales of hours to a day by which the source moves betweenthe horizontal, normal and flaring branches.  we present rxte pca observations of cyg x-2, taken when its overall intensitywas near its lowest values, in october 1996 and september 1997. for the firsttime we perform a study of the fast timing behaviour at such low intensities.during the october 1996 observations the source was in the left part of thehorizontal branch, and during the september 1997 observations most likely inthe lower parts of the normal branch and flaring branch.  we find that the properties of the very low frequency noise during theseptember 1997 observations are consistent with a monotonic decrease in itsstrength and power-law index as a function of overall intensity. in contrast,the strength of the ~6 hz normal branch quasi-periodic oscillations do not varymonotonically with overall intensity. they are strongest at medium overallintensity and weaker both when the overall intensity is low and when theoverall intensity is high.

astro-ph;9909472	the timing properties of sco x-1 along its z track as seen with exosat	we present a systematic, homogeneous analysis of all the exosat me, high timeresolution data on sco x-1. we investigate all power spectral properties of the$&lt;$100 hz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpo) and noise of sco x-1 as a functionof position on the z-shaped track traced out in the x-ray colour-colourdiagram. generally, the properties of sco x-1 vary smoothly as a function ofposition along the z track. however, some variability parameters changeabruptly at either of the vertices of the z track indicating that the branchesof the z track represent distinct source states not only in spectral state butalso in rapid variability characteristics. we show that the very low frequencynoise (vlfn) is consistent with being solely due to motion along the z track.the qpo show a remarkably rapid change in frequency at or just before thenormal-branch/flaring-branch (nb/fb) vertex. this transition happens within1.5% of the entire extent of the z track. the qpo themselves are visible for17% of the z. we find a new sort of behaviour near the nb/fb vertex, i.e.,rapid excursions from the nb into the fb and back again taking only a fewminutes.

astro-ph;9909515	the complex phase lag behavior of the 3-12 hz quasi-periodic  oscillations during the very high state of xte j1550-564	we present a study of the complex phase lag behavior of the low-frequency(&lt;20 hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in the x-ray transient andblack-hole candidate xte j1550-564 during its very high state. we distinguishtwo different types of low-frequency qpos, based on their coherence andharmonic content. the first type is characterized by a 6 hz qpo with a q (theqpo frequency divided by the qpo width) of &lt;3 and with a harmonic at 12 hz. thesecond type of qpo is characterized by a 6 hz qpo with a q value of &gt;6 and withharmonics at 3, 12, 18, and possibly at 9 hz. not only the q values and theharmonic content of the two types are different, but also their phase lagbehavior. for the first type of qpo, the low energy photons (&lt;5 kev) of boththe 6 hz qpo and its harmonic at 12 hz lag the hard energy photons (&gt;5 kev) byas much as 1.3 radian. the phase lags of the second type of qpo are morecomplex. the soft photons (&lt;5 kev) of the 3 and the 12 hz qpos lag the hardphotons (&gt;5 kev) by as much as 1.0 radian. however, the soft photons of the 6hz qpo precede the hard ones by as much as 0.6 radian. this means thatdifferent harmonics of this type of qpo have different signs for their phaselags. this unusual behavior is hard to explain when the lags are due tolight-travel-time differences between the photons at different energies, e.g.,in a comptonizing region surrounding the area where the qpos are formed.

astro-ph;9910079	the rapid x-ray variability of v4641 sagittarii (sax j1819.3-2525 = xte  j1819-254)	we report on the rapid x-ray variability of the variable star and x-raytransient v4641 sagittarii (sax j1819.3-2525; xte j1819-254) as observed on 15sept. 1999 by the proportional counter array (pca) on board the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte). during the first ~900 s of the first pca observation,v4641 sgr showed very strong x-ray fluctuations by a factor of 4 on time scalesof seconds to about 500 on time scales of minutes. the spectrum of the sourceduring this flaring episode became harder when the count rate decreased. afterthis flaring episode, v4641 sgr entered a quiescent state in which it remainedfor the rest of this, and the subsequent pca observations. the x-ray spectrumwas considerably softer in this quiescent state than during the flaringepisode. the intrinsic x-ray luminosity (both during the flaring episode andthe quiescent state) and the rapid x-ray variability do not strongly constrainthe nature of the compact object (neutron star or black hole) in the system,although a black hole seems to be more likely. the very short duration of thebright x-ray phase of v4641 sgr and its likely close distance suggest that manysimilar objects could be present in our galaxy, most of which are not noticedwhen they are in x-ray outburst due to the short duration of these outbursts. aconsiderable number of the black holes present in our galaxy might be containedin systems similar to v4641 sgr.

astro-ph;9910159	discovery of a ~1 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the low-mass x-ray  binary 4u 1746-37	we have discovered a ~1 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in the persistentx-ray emission and during type i x-ray bursts of the globular cluster source,dipper and low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) 4u 1746-37. the qpo properties resemblethose of qpos found recently in the lmxb dippers 4u 1323-62, and exo 0748-676,which makes 4u 1746-37 the third source known to exhibit this type of qpos. wepresent evidence for x-ray spectral changes in this source similar to thoseobserved in lmxbs referred to as atoll sources. we detect two states, a lowintensity and spectrally hard state, and a higher intensity and spectrally softstate. this may explain the different spectral characteristics reported for 4u1746-37 earlier. the high intensity state resembles the banana branch state ofatoll sources. the qpos are only seen in the low intensity state, and areabsent when the source is in the banana branch. this strongly suggests thateither the accretion disk or an extended central source change shape betweenthe low intensity state and the banana branch. twelve bursts were detected, ofwhich 5 took place while the source was on the banana branch and 7 when thesource was in the low intensity state. the bursts occurring on the bananabranch had an e-folding time ~3 times longer than those which occurred in thelow intensity state. whereas previously detected dips showed only a decrease incount rate of ~15%, we found in one observation a dip in which the count ratedropped from ~200 counts per second to ~20 counts per second. this dip lastedonly ~250 seconds, during which clear spectral hardening occured. this is thefirst time strong evidence for spectral changes during a dip are reported forthis source.

astro-ph;9911287	no qpo time lags from sco x-1 as seen with exosat: a comparison with cyg  x-2	we have measured the phase-delay and rms amplitude spectra of cygx-2 andscox-1. using exosat data from the normal branch of cygx-2 we confirm earlier(ginga) results, showing that at an energy near 6kev there is both a minimum inthe qpo rms amplitude spectrum and a 150 degree phase jump in thequasi-periodic oscillations (qpo) phase-delay spectrum.  surprisingly, using exosat and ginga data, we find no evidence for a phasejump of this kind in the phase-delay spectrum of scox-1 on either the normal orflaring branch. upper limits (90% confidence) of 42 degrees can be set on anyphase jump in the energy range 2-10kev on the normal branch, and 88 degrees onthe flaring branch. the qpo rms amplitude spectrum of scox-1 increases steeplywith energy on both the normal and flaring branches. these results suggest thatthe x-ray spectrum pivots about an energy of &lt;~2kev or &gt;~10kev or that normalbranch qpo of scox-1 does not have a pivoting spectrum. we discuss theimplications of these results in terms of the radiation-hydrodynamic model fornormal branch qpo.
