0812.4399	testing the predictions of the cold dark matter model for the sizes,  colours, morphologies and luminosities of galaxies with the sdss	the huge size and uniformity of the sloan digital sky survey makes possiblean exacting test of current models of galaxy formation. we compare thepredictions of the galform semi-analytical galaxy formation model for theluminosities, morphologies, colours and scale-lengths of local galaxies.galform models the luminosity and size of the disk and bulge components of agalaxy, and so we can compute quantities which can be compared directly withsdss observations, such as the petrosian magnitude and the sersic index. wetest the predictions of two published models set in the cold dark mattercosmology: the baugh et al. (2005) model, which assumes a top-heavy initialmass function (imf) in starbursts and superwind feedback, and the bower et al.(2006) model, which uses agn feedback and a standard imf. the bower et al modelbetter reproduces the overall shape of the luminosity function, themorphology-luminosity relation and the colour bimodality observed in the sdssdata, but gives a poor match to the size-luminosity relation. the \baugh et al.model successfully predicts the size-luminosity relation for late-typegalaxies. both models fail to reproduce the sizes of bright early-typegalaxies. these problems highlight the need to understand better both the roleof feedback processes in determining galaxy sizes, in particular the treatmentof the angular momentum of gas reheated by supernovae, and the sizes of thestellar spheroids formed by galaxy mergers and disk instabilities.

0901.2570	cosmological parameter constraints from sdss luminous red galaxies: a  new treatment of large-scale clustering	we apply a new model for the spherically averaged correlation function atlarge pair separations to the measurement of the clustering of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) made from the sdss by cabre and gaztanaga(2009). our modeltakes into account the form of the bao peak and the large scale shape of thecorrelation function. we perform a monte carlo markov chain analysis fordifferent combinations of datasets and for different parameter sets. when usedin combination with a compilation of the latest cmb measurements, the lrgclustering and the latest supernovae results give constraints on cosmologicalparameters which are comparable and in remarkably good agreement, resolving thetension reported in some studies. the best fitting model in the context of aflat, lambda-cdm cosmology is specified by omega_m=0.261+-0.013,omega_b=0.044+-0.001, n_s=0.96+-0.01, h_0=71.6+-1.2 km/s/mpc andsigma_8=0.80+-0.02. if we allow the time-independent dark energy equation ofstate parameter to vary, we find results consistent with a cosmologicalconstant at the 5% level using all data sets: w_de=-0.97+-0.05. the large scalestructure measurements by themselves can constrain the dark energy equation ofstate parameter to w_de=-1.05+-0.15, independently of cmb or supernovae data.we do not find convincing evidence for an evolving equation of state. weprovide a set of "extended distance priors" that contain the most relevantinformation from the cmb power spectrum and the shape of the lrg correlationfunction which can be used to constrain dark energy models and spatialcurvature. our model should provide an accurate description of the clusteringeven in much larger, forthcoming surveys, such as those planned with nasa'sjdem or esa's euclid mission.

0906.3522	modelling the dusty universe i: introducing the artificial neural  network and first applications to luminosity and colour distributions	we introduce a new technique based on artificial neural networks which allowsus to make accurate predictions for the spectral energy distributions (seds) oflarge samples of galaxies, at wavelengths ranging from the far-ultra-violet tothe sub-millimetre and radio. the neural net is trained to reproduce the sedspredicted by a hybrid code comprised of the galform semi-analytical model ofgalaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy mergerhistories, and the grasil spectro-photometric code, which carries out aself-consistent calculation of the sed, including absorption and emission ofradiation by dust. using a small number of galaxy properties predicted bygalform, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority ofcases to within 10% of those computed directly using grasil. the methodperforms best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared and thefar-ultra-violet. the luminosity error introduced by the method has negligibleimpact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions orcolour distributions of galaxies. we use the neural net to predict the overlapbetween galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv and in the observer-frame sub-mmat z=2. we find that around half of the galaxies with a 850um flux above 5 mjyshould have optical magnitudes brighter than r_ab &lt; 25 mag. however, only 1% ofthe galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv down to r_ab &lt; 25 mag should have850um fluxes brighter than 5 mjy. our technique will allow the generation ofwide-angle mock catalogues of galaxies selected at rest-frame uv or mid- andfar-infrared wavelengths.

0908.1396	the redshift evolution of the mass function of cold gas in hierarchical  galaxy formation models	(abridged) accurately predicting how the cosmic abundance of neutral hydrogenevolves with redshift is a challenging problem facing modellers of galaxyformation. we investigate the predictions of four currently favouredsemi-analytical galaxy formation models applied to the millennium simulationfor the mass function of cold neutral gas (atomic and molecular) in galaxies asa function of redshift, and we use these predictions to construct number countsfor the next generation of all-sky neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) surveys.despite the different implementations of the physical ingredients of galaxyformation, we find that the model predictions are broadly consistent with oneanother; the key differences reflect how the models treat agn feedback and howthe timescale for star formation evolves with redshift. the models produce massfunctions of cold gas in galaxies that are generally in good agreement with hisurveys at $z$=0. interestingly we find that these mass functions do not evolvesignificantly with redshift. adopting a simple conversion factor for cold gasmass to hi mass that we apply to all galaxies at all redshifts, we derive massfunctions of hi in galaxies from the predicted mass functions of cold gas,which we use to predict the number counts of sources likely to be detected byhi surveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the square kilometrearray and its pathfinders. we show also how adopting a conversion factor forcold gas mass to hi mass that varies from galaxy to galaxy impacts on numbercounts. in addition, we examine how the typical angular sizes of galaxies varywith redshift. taken together, these results make clear that forthcoming hisurveys will provide important and powerful tests of theoretical galaxyformation models.

0909.1567	predictions for herschel from lambdacdm: unveiling the cosmic star  formation history	we use a model for the evolution of galaxies in the far-ir based on thelambdacdm cosmology to make detailed predictions for upcoming cosmologicalsurveys with the herschel space observatory. we use the combined galformsemi-analytical galaxy formation model and grasil spectrophotometric code tocompute galaxy seds including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model,which is the same as that in baugh et al. (2005), assumes two different imfs: anormal solar neighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and avery top-heavy imf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shownpreviously that the top-heavy imf appears necessary to explain the numbercounts and redshifts of faint sub-mm galaxies. in this paper, we presentpredictions for galaxy luminosity functions, number counts and redshiftdistributions in the herschel imaging bands. we find that source confusion willbe a serious problem in the deepest planned surveys. we also show predictionsfor physical properties such as star formation rates and stellar, gas and halomasses, together with fluxes at other wavelengths (from the far-uv to theradio) relevant for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. we investigatewhat fraction of the total ir emission from dust and of the high-mass starformation over the history of the universe should be resolved by plannedsurveys with herschel, and find a fraction ~30-50%, depending on confusion.finally, we show that galaxies in herschel surveys should be significantlyclustered.

0704.1562	galaxy evolution in the infra-red: comparison of a hierarchical galaxy  formation model with spitzer data	we present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function,number counts and redshift distributions in the ir based on the lambda-cdmcosmological model. we use the combined galform semi-analytical galaxyformation model and grasil spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy sedsincluding the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model, which is the sameas that in baugh et al (2005), assumes two different imfs: a normal solarneighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavyimf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shown previously thatthe top-heavy imf seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faintsub-mm galaxies. we compare the model with observational data from the spitzerspace telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen beforespitzer data became available. we find that the model matches the observedevolution in the ir remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probedby spitzer. in particular, the spitzer data show that there is strong evolutionin the mid-ir galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, andthis is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.on the other hand, a model with a normal imf in starbursts predicts far toolittle evolution in the mid-ir luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

0911.0669	probing dark energy with future redshift surveys: a comparison of  emission line and broad band selection in the near infrared	future galaxy surveys will map the galaxy distribution in the redshiftinterval $0.5&lt;z&lt;2$ using near-infrared cameras and spectrographs. the primaryscience goal of such surveys is to constrain the nature of the dark energy bymeasuring the large-scale structure of the universe. this requires a tracer ofthe underlying dark matter which maximizes the useful volume of the survey. weinvestigate two potential survey selection methods: an emission line samplebased on the \ha line and a sample selected in the h-band. we presentpredictions for the abundance and clustering of such galaxies, using twopublished versions of the \galform galaxy formation model. our models predictthat \ha selected galaxies tend to avoid massive dark matter haloes and insteadtrace the surrounding filamentary structure; h-band selected galaxies, on theother hand, are found in the highest mass haloes. this has implications for themeasurement of the rate at which fluctuations grow due to gravitationalinstability. we use mock catalogues to compare the effective volumes sampled bya range of survey configurations. to give just two examples: a redshift surveydown to $h_{\rm ab}=22$ samples an effective volume that is $\sim 5-10$ timeslarger than that probed by an \ha survey with $\logfha &gt; -15.4$; a flux limitof at least $\logfha = -16$ is required for an \ha sample to become competitivein effective volume.

0911.0686	empirical h-alpha emitter count predictions for dark energy surveys	future galaxy redshift surveys aim to measure cosmological quantities fromthe galaxy power spectrum. a prime example is the detection of baryonicacoustic oscillations (baos), providing a standard ruler to measure the darkenergy equation of state, w(z), to high precision. the strongest practicallimitation for these experiments is how quickly accurate redshifts can bemeasured for sufficient galaxies to map the large-scale structure. a promisingstrategy is to target emission-line (i.e. star-forming) galaxies athigh-redshift (z~0.5-2); not only is the space density of this populationincreasing out to z~2, but also emission-lines provide an efficient method ofredshift determination. motivated by the prospect of future dark energy surveystargeting h-alpha emitters at near-infrared wavelengths (i.e. z&gt;0.5), we usethe latest empirical data to model the evolution of the h-alpha luminosityfunction out to z~2, and thus provide predictions for the abundance of h-alphaemitters for practical limiting fluxes. we caution that the estimates presentedin this work must be tempered by an efficiency factor, epsilon, giving theredshift success rate from these potential targets. for a range of practicalefficiencies and limiting fluxes, we provide an estimate of np_{0.2}, where nis the 3d galaxy number density and p_{0.2} is the galaxy power spectrumevaluated at k=0.2h/mpc. ideal surveys must provide np_{0.2}&gt;1 in order tobalance shot-noise and cosmic variance errors. we show that a realisticemission-line survey (epsilon=0.5) could achieve np_{0.2}=1 out to z~1.5 with alimiting flux of 10^{-16} erg/s/cm^{-2}. if the limiting flux is a factor 5brighter, then this goal can only be achieved out to z~0.5, highlighting theimportance of survey depth and efficiency in cosmological redshift surveys.

0911.1128	grand unification of agn activity in the lambdacdm cosmology	we track the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (smbhs) and their hostgalaxies. the calculation is embedded in the galform semi-analytical modelwhich simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter(cdm) universe. during the evolution of the host galaxy, hot and cold gas areadded to the smbh by flows triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilitiesand galaxy mergers. this builds up the mass and spin of the bh, and theresulting accretion power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent starformation. the accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool discwhen the accretion rate exceeds 0.01\dot{m}_edd, and a geometrically thick,radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below thisvalue. the resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observationsvery well, and the mass of the smbh correlates with the mass of the galaxybulge as observed. the bh spin distribution depends strongly on whether the gasin any given accretion episode remains in the same plane (prolonged accretion)or whether, due to self-gravity, it fragments into multiple, randomly alignedaccretion episodes (chaotic accretion). in the chaotic accretion model there isa clear correlation of spin with smbh mass. massive bhs (m&gt;5\times10^8\msun)are hosted by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lowermass bhs are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. using theblandford-znajek mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet power, ourmodel is able to reproduce the radio loudness of radio galaxies, liners andseyferts. this is the first confirmation that a cdm galaxy formation model canreproduce the observed phenomenology of agn.

1002.3255	how bao measurements can fail to detect quintessence	we model the nonlinear growth of cosmic structure in different dark energymodels, using large volume n-body simulations. we consider a range ofquintessence models which feature both rapidly and slowly varying dark energyequations of state, and compare the growth of structure to that in a universewith a cosmological constant. the adoption of a quintessence model changes theexpansion history of the universe, the form of the linear theory power spectrumand can alter key observables, such as the horizon scale and the distance tolast scattering. the difference in structure formation can be explained tofirst order by the difference in growth factor at a given epoch; this scalingalso accounts for the nonlinear growth at the 15% level. we find thatquintessence models which feature late $(z&lt;2)$, rapid transitions towards$w=-1$ in the equation of state, can have identical baryonic acousticoscillation (bao) peak positions to those in $\lambda$cdm, despite being verydifferent from $\lambda$cdm both today and at high redshifts $(z \sim 1000)$.we find that a second class of models which feature non-negligible amounts ofdark energy at early times cannot be distinguished from $\lambda$cdm usingmeasurements of the mass function or the bao. these results highlight the needto accurately model quintessence dark energy in n-body simulations when testingcosmological probes of dynamical dark energy.

1003.0008	the spatial distribution of cold gas in hierarchical galaxy formation  models	the distribution of cold gas in dark matter haloes is driven by key processesin galaxy formation: gas cooling, galaxy mergers, star formation and reheatingof gas by supernovae. we compare the predictions of four different galaxyformation models for the spatial distribution of cold gas. we find thatsatellite galaxies make little contribution to the abundance or clusteringstrength of cold gas selected samples, and are far less important than they arein optically selected samples. the halo occupation distribution function ofpresent-day central galaxies with cold gas mass &gt; 10^9 h^-1 msun is peakedaround a halo mass of ~ 10^11 h^-1 msun, a scale that is set by the agnsuppression of gas cooling. the model predictions for the projected correlationfunction are in good agreement with measurements from the hi parkes all-skysurvey. we compare the effective volume of possible surveys with the squarekilometre array with those expected for a redshift survey in the near-infrared.future redshift surveys using neutral hydrogen emission will be competitivewith the most ambitious spectroscopic surveys planned in the near-infrared.

1003.4259	are the 2dfgrs superstructures a problem for hierarchical models?	we introduce an objective method to assess the probability of finding extremeevents in the distribution of cold dark matter such as voids, overdensities orvery high mass haloes. our approach uses an ensemble of n-body simulations ofthe hierar- chical clustering of dark matter to find extreme structures. thefrequency of extreme events, in our case the cell or smoothing volume with thehighest count of cluster-mass dark matter haloes, is well described by a gumbeldistribution. this distribution can then be used to forecast the probability offinding even more extreme events, which would otherwise require a much largerensemble of simulations to quantify. we use our technique to assess the chanceof finding concentrations of massive clusters or super- clusters, like the twofound in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs), using acounts-in-cells analysis. the gumbel distribution gives an excellent descrip-tion of the distribution of extreme cell counts across two large ensembles ofsimulations covering different cosmologies, and also when measuring theclustering in both real and redshift space. we find examples of structures likethose found in the 2dfgrs in the simulations. the chance of finding suchstructures in a volume equal to that of the 2dfgrs is around 2%.

1004.0711	the parameter space of galaxy formation	semi-analytic models are a powerful tool for studying the formation ofgalaxies. however, these models inevitably involve a significant number ofpoorly constrained parameters that must be adjusted to provide an acceptablematch to the observed universe. in this paper, we set out to quantify thedegree to which observational data-sets can constrain the model parameters. byrevealing degeneracies in the parameter space we can hope to better understandthe key physical processes probed by the data. we use novel mathematicaltechniques to explore the parameter space of the galform semi-analytic model.we base our investigation on the bower et al. 2006 version of galform, adoptingthe same methodology of selecting model parameters based on an acceptable matchto the local bj and k luminosity functions. the model contains 16 parametersthat are poorly constrained, and we investigate this parameter space using themodel emulator technique, constructing a bayesian approximation to the galformmodel that can be rapidly evaluated at any point in parameter space. bycombining successive waves of emulation, we show that only 0.26% of the initialvolume is of interest for further exploration. however, within this region weshow that the bower et al. 2006 model is only one choice from an extendedsub-space of model parameters that can provide equally acceptable fits. weexplore the geometry of this region and begin to explore the physicalconnections between parameters that are exposed by this analysis. we alsoconsider the impact of adding additional observational data to furtherconstrain the parameter space.

1004.3545	the evolution of lyman-break galaxies in cdm	we make a detailed investigation of the properties of lyman-break galaxies(lbgs) in the lambdacdm model. we present predictions for two publishedvariants of the galform semi-analytical model: the baugh et al. (2005) model,which has star formation at high redshifts dominated by merger-drivenstarbursts with a top-heavy imf, and the bower et al. (2006) model, which hasagn feedback and a standard solar neighbourhood imf throughout. we showpredictions for the evolution of the rest-frame far-uv luminosity function inthe redshift range z=3-20, and compare with the observed luminosity functionsof lbgs at z=3-10. we find that the baugh et al. model is in excellentagreement with these observations, while the bower et al. model predicts toomany high-luminosity lbgs. dust extinction, which is predictedself-consistently based on galaxy gas contents, metallicities and sizes, isfound to have a large effect on lbg luminosities. we compare predictions forthe size evolution of lbgs at different luminosities with observational datafor 2&lt;z&lt;7, and find the baugh et al. model to be in good agreement. we presentpredictions for stellar, halo and gas masses, star formation rates, circularvelocities, bulge-to-disk ratios, gas and stellar metallicities and clusteringbias, as functions of far-uv luminosity and redshift. we find broad consistencywith current observational constraints. we then present predictions for theabundance and angular sizes of lbgs out to very high redshift (z&lt;20), findingthat planned deep surveys with jwst should detect objects out to z&lt;15. thetypical uv luminosities of galaxies are predicted to be very low at highredshifts, which has implications for detecting the galaxies responsible forreionizing the igm; for example, at z=10, 50% of the ionizing photons areexpected to be produced by galaxies fainter than m_ab(1500a)-5logh ~ -15.

1006.0230	the role of submillimetre galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation	we study the role of submillimetre galaxies (smgs) in the galaxy formationprocess in the lambda cold dark matter cosmology. we use the baugh et al.(2005) semi-analytical model, which matches the observed smg number counts andredshift distribution by assuming a top-heavy initial mass function (imf) inbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we build galaxy merger trees and follow theevolution and properties of smgs and their descendants. our primary sample ofmodel smgs consists of galaxies which had 850 mu fluxes brighter than 5 mjy atsome redshift z&gt;1. our model predicts that the present-day descendants of suchsmgs cover a wide range of stellar masses ~ 10^{10} - 10^{12} msun/h, with amedian ~ 10^{11} msun/h, and that more than 70% of these descendants arebulge-dominated. more than 50% of present day galaxies with stellar masseslarger than 7 x 10^{11} msun/h are predicted to be descendants of such smgs. wefind that although smgs make an important contribution to the total starformation rate at z~2, the final stellar mass produced in the submillimetrephase contributes only 0.2% of the total present-day stellar mass, and 2% ofthe stellar mass of smg descendants, in stark contrast to the popular picturein which the smg phase marks the production of the bulk of the mass of presentday massive ellipticals.

1006.4637	modelling the spectral energy distribution of galaxies: introducing the  artificial neural network	the spectral energy distribution of galaxies is a complex function of thestar formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas ingalaxies. the computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiationthrough the dust distribution is time-consuming. this aspect becomesunacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then comparedwith multi-wavelength surveys. mainly for this aim, we have implemented anartificial neural network algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiativetransfer code grasil in order to compute the spectral energy distribution ofgalaxies in a short computing time. this allows to avoid the adoption ofempirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies outputby models. the ann has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum(the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-formingmolecular clouds and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties anddependencies). we have defined the input neurons effectively determining theiremission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and isnot linked to a particular galaxy formation model. we have trained the net forthe disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce thesed of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model forspheroidal galaxies. we have checked that for this model both the seds and thegalaxy counts in the herschel bands obtained with the ann approximation arealmost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full grasil. weconclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present theapplication to a more complex sam in another paper.

1011.5222	the evolution of agn across cosmic time: what is downsizing?	we use a coupled model of the formation and evolution of galaxies and blackholes (bh) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) in a colddark matter universe. the model predicts the bh mass, spin and mass accretionhistory. bh mass grows via accretion triggered by discs becoming dynamicallyunstable or galaxy mergers (called the starburst mode) and accretion fromquasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes (called the hot-halo mode). by taking intoaccount agn obscuration, we obtain a very good fit to the observed luminosityfunctions (lf) of agn (optical, soft and hard x-ray, and bolometric) for a widerange of redshifts (0&lt;z&lt;6). the model predicts a hierarchical build up of bhmass, with the typical mass of actively growing bhs increasing with decreasingredshift. remarkably, despite this, we find downsizing in the agn population,in terms of the differential growth with redshift of the space density of faintand bright agn. this arises naturally from the interplay between the starburstand hot-halo accretion modes. the faint end of the lf is dominated by massivebhs experiencing quiescent accretion via a thick disc, primarily during thehot-halo mode. the bright end of the lf, on the other hand, is dominated by agnwhich host bhs accreting close to or in excess of the eddington limit duringthe starburst mode. the model predicts that the comoving space density of agnpeaks at z~3, similar to the star formation history. however, when taking intoaccount obscuration, the space density of faint agn peaks at lower redshift(z&lt;2) than that of bright agn (z~2-3). this implies that the cosmic evolutionof agn is shaped in part by obscuration.

1108.0932	testing dark energy using pairs of galaxies in redshift space	the distribution of angles subtended between pairs of galaxies and the lineof sight,which is uniform in real space, is distorted by their peculiarmotions, and has been proposed as a probe of cosmic expansion. we test thisidea using n-body simulations of structure formation in a cold dark matteruniverse with a cosmological constant and in two variant cosmologies withdifferent dark energy models. we find that the distortion of the distributionof angles is sensitive to the nature of dark energy. however, for the firsttime, our simulations also reveal dependences of the normalization of thedistribution on both redshift and cosmology that have been neglected inprevious work. this introduces systematics that severely limit the usefulnessof the original method. guided by our simulations, we devise a new, improvedtest of the nature of dark energy. we demonstrate that this test does notrequire prior knowledge of the background cosmology and that it can evendistinguish between models that have the same baryonic acoustic oscillationsand dark matter halo mass functions. our technique could be applied to thecompleted boss galaxy redshift survey to constrain the expansion history of theuniverse to better than 2%. the method will also produce different signals fordark energy and modified gravity cosmologies even when they have identicalexpansion histories, through the different peculiar velocities induced in thesecases.

1111.0721	the contribution of star-forming galaxies to fluctuations in the cosmic  background light	star-forming galaxies which are too faint to be detected individually produceintensity fluctuations in the cosmic background light. this contribution needsto be taken into account as a foreground when using the primordial signal toconstrain cosmological parameters. the extragalactic fluctuations are alsointeresting in their own right as they depend on the star formation history ofthe universe and the way in which this connects with the formation of cosmicstructure. we present a new framework which allows us to predict the occupationof dark matter haloes by star-forming galaxies and uses this information, inconjunction with an n-body simulation of structure formation, to predict thepower spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the infrared background. we computethe emission from galaxies at far-infrared, millimetre and radio wavelengths.our method gives accurate predictions for the clustering of galaxies both forthe one halo and two halo terms. we illustrate our new framework using apreviously published model which reproduces the number counts and redshiftdistribution of galaxies selected by their emission at $850\,\mu$m. withoutadjusting any of the model parameters, the predictions show encouragingagreement at high frequencies and on small angular scales with recent estimatesof the extragalactic fluctuations in the background made from early dataanalysed by the planck collaboration. there are, however, substantialdiscrepancies between the model predictions and observations on large angularscales and at low frequencies, which illustrates the usefulness of theintensity fluctuations as a constraint on galaxy formation models.

1111.2135	clustering properties of bzk-selected galaxies in goods-n: environmental  quenching and triggering of star formation at z ~ 2	using a sample of bzk-selected galaxies at z~2 identified from thecfht/wircam near-infrared survey of goods-north, we discuss the relationbetween star formation rate (sfr), specific star formation rate (ssfr), andstellar mass (m_{*}), and the clustering of galaxies as a function of theseparameters. for star-forming galaxies (sbzks), the uv-based sfr, corrected forextinction, scales with the stellar mass as sfr ~ m_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =0.74+/-0.20 down to m_{*} ~ 10^{9} m_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence onthe stellar mass of the ssfr. we also measure the angular correlation functionand hence infer the correlation length for sbzk galaxies as a function ofm_{*}, sfr, and ssfr, as well as k-band apparent magnitude. we show thatpassive galaxies (pbzks) are more strongly clustered than sbzk galaxies at agiven stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lowerredshifts. we also find that the correlation length of sbzk galaxies rangesfrom 4 to 20 h^{-1}mpc, being a strong function of m_{k}, m_{*}, and sfr. onthe other hand, the clustering dependence on ssfr changes abruptly at 2x10^{-9}yr^{-1}, which is the typical value for "main sequence" star-forming galaxiesat z~2. we show that the correlation length reaches a minimum at thischaracteristic value, and is larger for galaxies with both smaller and largerssfrs; a dichotomy that is only marginally implied from the predictions of thesemi-analytical models. our results suggest that there are two types ofenvironmental effects at work at z~2. stronger clustering for relativelyquiescent galaxies implies that the environment has started to play a role inquenching star formation. at the same time, stronger clustering for galaxieswith elevated ssfrs ("starbursts") might be attributed to an increasedefficiency for galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments.

0710.3557	luminous red galaxies in hierarchical cosmologies	luminous red galaxies (lrgs) are much rarer and more massive than l*galaxies. coupled with their extreme colours, lrgs therefore provide ademanding testing ground for the physics of massive galaxy formation. wepresent the first self-consistent predictions for the abundance and propertiesof lrgs in hierarchical structure formation models. we test two publishedmodels which use quite different mechanisms to suppress the formation ofmassive galaxies: the bower et al. (2006) model, which invokes ``agn-feedback''to prevent gas from cooling in massive haloes, and the baugh et al. (2005)model which relies upon a ``superwind'' to eject gas before it is turned intostars. without adjusting any parameters, the bower et al. model gives anexcellent match to the observed luminosity function of lrgs in the sdss (with amedian redshift of z=0.24) and to their clustering; the baugh et al. model isless successful in these respects. both models fail to match the observedabundance of lrgs at z=0.5 to better than a factor of ~2. in the models, lrgsare typically bulge dominated systems with m* of ~2x10^11 h^{-1} m_sun andvelocity dispersions of ~250 km s^{-1}. around half of the stellar mass in themodel lrgs is already formed by z~2.2 and is assembled into one main progenitorby z~1.5; on average, only 25% of the mass of the main progenitor is addedafter z~1. lrgs are predicted to be found in a wide range of halo masses, aconclusion which relies on properly taking into account the scatter in theformation histories of haloes. remarkably, we find that the correlationfunction of lrgs is predicted to be a power law down to small pair separations,in excellent agreement with observational estimates. neither the bower et al.nor the baugh et al. model is able to reproduce the observed radii of lrgs.

1203.3216	scaling relations for galaxy clusters in the millennium-xxl simulation	we present a very large high-resolution cosmological n-body simulation, themillennium-xxl or mxxl, which uses 303 billion particles to represent theformation of dark matter structures throughout a 4.1gpc box in a lambdacdmcosmology. we create sky maps and identify large samples of galaxy clustersusing surrogates for four different observables: richness estimated from galaxysurveys, x-ray luminosity, integrated sunyaev-zeldovich signal, and lensingmass. the unprecedented combination of volume and resolution allows us toexplore in detail how these observables scale with each other and with clustermass. the scatter correlates between different mass-observable relationsbecause of common sensitivities to the internal structure, orientation andenvironment of clusters, as well as to line-of-sight superposition ofuncorrelated structure. we show that this can account for the apparentdiscrepancies uncovered recently between the mean thermal sz signals measuredfor optically and x-ray selected clusters by stacking data from the plancksatellite. related systematics can also affect inferences from extreme clustersdetected at high redshift. our results illustrate that cosmological conclusionsfrom galaxy cluster surveys depend critically on proper modelling, not only ofthe relevant physics, but also of the full distribution of the observables andof the selection biases induced by cluster identification procedures.

1203.5339	the journey of qso haloes from z=6 to the present	we apply a recently developed scaling technique to the millennium-xxl, one ofthe largest cosmological n-body simulations carried out to date 3x10^11particles within a cube of volume ~70gpc^3). this allows us to investigate thecosmological parameter dependence of the mass and evolution of haloes in theextreme high-mass tail of the z=6 distribution. we assume these objects to belikely hosts for the population of rare but ultraluminous high-redshift quasarsdiscovered by the sloan digital sky survey. haloes with a similar abundance tothese quasars have a median mass of 9x10^12 msun in the currently preferredcosmology, but do not evolve into equally extreme objects at z=0. rather, theirdescendants span the full range conventionally assigned to present-dayclusters, 6x10^13 to 2.5x10^15 msun for this same cosmology. the masses both atz=6 and at z=0 shift up or down by factors exceeding two if cosmologicalparameters are pushed to the boundaries of the range discussed in publishedinterpretations of data from the wmap satellite. the main factor determiningthe future growth of a high-mass z=6 halo is the mean overdensity of itsenvironment on scales of 7 to 14 mpc, and descendant masses can be predicted 6to 8 times more accurately if this density is known than if it is not. allthese features are not unique to extreme high-z haloes, but are generic tohierarchical growth. finally, we find that extreme haloes at z=6 typicallyacquired about half of their total mass in the preceding 100 myr, implying verylarge recent accretion rates which may be related to the large black holemasses and high luminosities of the sdss quasars.

1206.4052	the clustering of h-alpha emitters at z=2.23 from hizels	(abridged) we present a clustering analysis of 370 high-confidence h-alphaemitters (haes) at z=2.23. the haes are detected in the hi-z emission linesurvey (hizels), a large-area blank field 2.121um narrowband survey using theunited kingdom infrared telescope (ukirt) wide field camera (wfcam). averagingthe two-point correlation function of haes in two ~1 degree scale fields(united kingdom infrared deep sky survey/ultra deep survey [uds] andcosmological evolution survey [cosmos] fields) we find a clustering amplitudeequivalent to a correlation length of r_0=3.7+/-0.3 mpc/h for galaxies withstar formation rates of &gt;7 m_sun/yr. the data are well-fitted by the expectedcorrelation function of cold dark matter, scaled by a bias factor:omega_hae=b^2 omega_dm where b=2.4^{+0.1}_{-0.2}. the corresponding'characteristic' mass for the halos hosting haes islog(m_h/[m_sun/h])=11.7+/-0.1. comparing to the latest semi-analytic galformpredictions for the evolution of haes in a lcdm cosmology, we find broadagreement with the observations, with galform predicting a hae correlationlength of ~4 mpc/h. motivated by this agreement, we exploit the simulations toconstruct a parametric model of the halo occupation distribution (hod) of haes,and use this to fit the observed clustering. our best-fitting hod canadequately reproduce the observed angular clustering of haes, yielding aneffective halo mass and bias in agreement with that derived from the scaledomega_dm fit, but with the relatively small sample size the current dataprovide a poor constraint on the hod. our results support the broad picturethat 'typical' (~l*) star-forming galaxies have been hosted by dark matterhaloes with m_h&lt;10^12 m_sun/h since z~2, but with a broad occupationdistribution and clustering that is likely to be a strong function ofluminosity.

1208.2985	on the role of feedback in shaping the cosmic abundance and clustering  of neutral atomic hydrogen in galaxies	we investigate the impact of feedback - from supernovae (sne), activegalactic nuclei (agn) and a photo-ionizing background at high redshifts - onthe neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) mass function, the $b_{\rm j}$ band luminosityfunction, and the spatial clustering of these galaxies at $z$=0. we use aversion of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform that calculatesself-consistently the amount of hi in a galaxy as a function of cosmic time andlinks its star formation rate to its mass of molecular hydrogen (h$_2$). wefind that a systematic increase or decrease in the strength of sne feedbackleads to a systematic decrease or increase in the amplitudes of the luminosityand hi mass functions, but has little influence on their overall shapes.varying the strength of agn feedback influences only the numbers of thebrightest or most hi massive galaxies, while the impact of varying the strengthof photo-ionization feedback is restricted to changing the numbers of thefaintest or least hi massive galaxies.our results suggest that the hi massfunction is a more sensitive probe of the consequences of cosmologicalreionization for galaxy formation than the luminosity function. we find thatincreasing the strength of any of the modes of feedback acts to weaken theclustering strength of galaxies, regardless of their hi-richness. in contrast,weaker agn feedback has little effect on the clustering strength whereas weakersne feedback increases the clustering strength of hi-poor galaxies morestrongly than hi-rich galaxies. these results indicate that forthcoming hisurveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the square kilometre arrayand its pathfinders will be exploited most fruitfully as part ofmultiwavelength survey campaigns.

1209.2152	the uv colours and dust attenuation of lyman-break galaxies	using galform, a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation in the lambda colddark matter cosmology, we study the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) colours oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) in the redshift range 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 10. as the impactof dust on uv luminosity can be dramatic, our model includes a self-consistentcomputation of dust attenuation based on a radiative transfer model. we findthat intrinsically brighter galaxies suffer stronger dust attenuation thanfainter ones, though the relation has a large scatter. the model predictsgalaxies with uv colours consistent with the colour selection regions designedto select lbgs in observational surveys. we find that the drop-out techniquethat selects lbgs based on two rest-frame uv colours is robust and effective,selecting more than 70 per cent of uv bright galaxies at a given redshift. weinvestigate the impact on the predicted uv colours of varying selected modelparameters. we find that the uv colours are most sensitive to the modelling ofdust attenuation and in particular, to the extinction curve used in theradiative transfer calculation. if we assume a milky way dust extinction curve,the predicted uv continuum slopes are, in general, bluer than observed.however, we find that the opposite is true when using the small magellaniccloud dust extinction curve. this demonstrates the strong dependence of uvcolours on dust properties and highlights the inadequacy of using the uvcontinuum slope as a tracer of dust attenuation without any further knowledgeof the galaxy inclination or dust characteristics in high redshift galaxies.

0712.2280	the assembly bias of dark matter haloes to higher orders	we use an extremely large volume ($2.4h^{-3}{\rm gpc}^{3}$), high resolutionn-body simulation to measure the higher order clustering of dark matter haloesas a function of mass and internal structure. as a result of the largesimulation volume and the use of a novel ``cross-moment'' counts-in-cellstechnique which suppresses discreteness noise, we are able to measure theclustering of haloes corresponding to rarer peaks than was possible in previousstudies; the rarest haloes for which we measure the variance are 100 times moreclustered than the dark matter. we are able to extract, for the first time,halo bias parameters from linear up to fourth order. for all orders measured,we find that the bias parameters are a strong function of mass for haloes moremassive than the characteristic mass $m_{*}$. currently, no theoretical modelis able to reproduce this mass dependence closely. we find that the biasparameters also depend on the internal structure of the halo up to fourthorder. for haloes more massive than $m_{*}$, we find that the more concentratedhaloes are more weakly clustered than the less concentrated ones. we see nodependence of clustering on concentration for haloes with masses $m&lt;m_{*}$;this is contrary to the trend reported in the literature when segregatinghaloes by their formation time. our results are insensitive to whether haloesare labelled by the total mass returned by the friends-of-friends group finderor by the mass of the most massive substructure. this implies that ourconclusions are not an artefact of the particular choice of group findingalgorithm. our results will provide important input to theoretical models ofgalaxy clustering.

1303.7228	how well can we really estimate the stellar masses of galaxies from  broadband photometry?	the estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize howthe galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. if stellar masses can beestimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such asthe stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxyformation. we explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by fittingbroad-band spectral energy distributions (seds) with stellar population models,can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for thestar-formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dustattenuation curves of galaxies. we apply the observational technique ofbroad-band sed fitting to model galaxy seds calculated by the theoreticalgalaxy formation model galform, isolating the effect of each of theseassumptions. we find that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, thecommon assumption of exponentially declining star-formation histories does notadversely affect stellar mass estimation. we show that fixing the metallicityin sed fitting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce massdependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. we find that the commonassumption of a star-dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dustscreen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be significantlyunderestimated. finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered byapplying sed fitting to model galaxies at high redshift can differsignificantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functionspredicted by a given model. given these differences, our methodology of usingstellar masses estimated from model galaxy seds offers a new, self-consistentway to compare model predictions with observations.

1305.2199	the most luminous quasars do not live in the most massive dark matter  haloes at any redshift	quasars represent the brightest active galactic nuclei (agn) in the universeand are thought to indicate the location of prodigiously growing black holes(bhs), with luminosities as high as 10^48 erg/sec. it is often expected thoughthat such an extremely energetic process will take place in the most massivebound structures in the dark matter (dm) distribution. we show that in contrastto this expectation, in a galaxy formation model which includes agn feedback,quasars are predicted to live in average dm halo environments with typicalmasses of a few times 10^12 msun. this fundamental prediction arises from thefact that quasar activity (i.e., bh accretion with luminosity greater than10^46 erg/sec) is inhibited in dm haloes where agn feedback operates. thegalaxy hosts of quasars in our simulations are identified with over massive (ingas and stars) spheroidal galaxies, in which bh accretion is triggered via agalaxy merger or secular processes. we further show that the z=0 descendants ofhigh redshift (z~6) qsos span a wide range of morphologies, galaxy and halomasses. the z~6 bhs typically grow only by a modest factor by the present day.remarkably, high redshift qsos never inhabit the largest dm haloes at that timeand their descendants are very seldom found in the most massive haloes at z=0.we also show that observationally it is very likely to find an enhancement inthe abundance of galaxies around quasars at z~5. however, these enhancementsare considerably weaker compared to the overdensities expected at the extremepeaks of the dm distribution. thus, it is very unlikely that a quasar detectedin the $z\gtrsim5$ universe pinpoints the location of the progenitors ofsuperclusters in the local universe.

1305.2200	constraints on black hole fuelling modes from the clustering of x-ray  agn	we present a clustering analysis of x-ray selected agn by compiling x-raysamples from the literature and re-estimating the dark matter (dm) halo massesof agn in a uniform manner. we find that moderate luminosity agn (lx(2-10kev)=10^42-10^44 erg/sec) in the z=0-1.3 universe are typically found in dmhaloes with masses of ~10^13 msun. we then compare our findings to thetheoretical predictions of the coupled galaxy and black hole formation modelgalform. we find good agreement when our calculation includes the hot-halo modeof accretion onto the central black hole. this type of accretion, which isadditional to the common cold accretion during disk instabilities and galaxymergers, is tightly coupled to the agn feedback in the model. the hot-halo modebecomes prominent in dm haloes with masses greater than ~10^12.5 msun, whereagn feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class of moderateluminosity agn that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters. cold gas fuellingof the black hole cannot produce the observationally inferred dm halo masses ofx-ray agn. switching off agn feedback in the model results in a largepopulation of luminous quasars (lx(2-10 kev) &gt; 10^44 erg/sec) in dm haloes withmasses up to ~10^14 msun, which is inconsistent with the observed clustering ofquasars. the abundance of hot-halo agn decreases significantly in the z~3-4universe. at such high redshifts, the cold accretion mode is solely responsiblefor shaping the environment of moderate luminosity agn. our analysis supportstwo accretion modes (cold and hot) for the fuelling of supermassive black holesand strongly underlines the importance of agn feedback in cosmological modelsboth of galaxy formation and black hole growth.

1309.7057	a new model of galaxy formation: how sensitive are predicted galaxy  luminosities to the choice of sps model?	we present a new release of the galform semi-analytical model of galaxyformation and evolution, which exploits a millennium simulation-class n-bodyrun performed with the wmap7 cosmology. we use this new model to study theimpact of the choice of stellar population synthesis (sps) model on thepredicted evolution of the galaxy luminosity function. the semi-analyticalmodel is run using seven different sps models. in each case we obtain therest-frame luminosity function in the far-ultra-violet, optical andnear-infrared (nir) wavelength ranges. we find that both the predictedrest-frame ultra-violet and optical luminosity function are insensitive to thechoice of sps model. however, we find that the predicted evolution of therest-frame nir luminosity function depends strongly on the treatment of thethermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) stellar phase in the spsmodels, with differences larger than a factor of 2 for model galaxies brighterthan $m_{\rm ab}(k)-5$log$h&lt;-22$ ($\sim$l$_*$ for $0\leq z\leq 1.5$). we havealso explored the predicted number counts of galaxies, finding remarkableagreement between the results with different choices of sps model, except whenselecting galaxies with very red optical-nir colours. the predicted numbercounts of these extremely red galaxies appear to be more affected by thetreatment of star formation in disks than by the treatment of tp-agb stars inthe sps models.

1310.4178	which galaxies dominate the neutral gas content of the universe?	we study the contribution of galaxies with different properties to the globaldensities of star formation rate (sfr), atomic (hi) and molecular hydrogen (h2)as a function of redshift. we use the galform model of galaxy formation, whichis set in the lcdm framework. this model includes a self-consistent calculationof the sfr, which depends on the h2 content of galaxies. the predicted sfrdensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellarmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. the modelpredicts a modest evolution of the hi density at z&lt;3, which is also inagreement with the observations. the hi density is predicted to be alwaysdominated by galaxies with sfr&lt;1msun/yr. this contrasts with the h2 density,which is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with sfr&gt;10msun/yr. currenthigh-redshift galaxy surveys are limited to detect carbon monoxide in galaxieswith sfr&gt;30msun/yr, which in our model make up, at most, 20% of the h2 in theuniverse. in terms of stellar mass, the predicted h2 density is dominated bymassive galaxies, mstellar&gt;10^10msun, while the hi density is dominated by lowmass galaxies, mstellar&lt;10^9msun. in the context of upcoming neutral gassurveys, we suggest that the faint nature of the galaxies dominating the hicontent of the universe will hamper the identification of optical counterparts,while for h2, we expect follow up observations of molecular emission lines ofalready existing galaxy catalogues to be able to uncover the h2 density of theuniverse.

1405.0016	the origin of the atomic and molecular gas contents of early-type  galaxies. i. a new test of galaxy formation physics	we study the atomic (hi) and molecular hydrogen (h2) contents of early-typegalaxies (etgs) and their gas sources using the galform model of galaxyformation. this model uses a self-consistent calculation of the star formationrate (sfr), which depends on the h2 content of galaxies. we first present a newanalysis of hipass and atlas3d surveys, with special emphasis on etgs. themodel predicts hi and h2 contents of etgs in agreement with the observationsfrom these surveys only if partial ram pressure stripping of the hot gas isincluded, showing that observations of neutral gas in `quenched' galaxies placestringent constraints on the treatment of the hot gas in satellites. we findthat ~90% of etgs at z=0 have neutral gas contents supplied by radiativecooling from their hot halos, 8% were supplied by gas accretion from minormergers that took place in the last 1gyr, while 2% were supplied by mass lossfrom old stars. the model predicts neutral gas fractions strongly decreasingwith increasing bulge fraction. this is due to the impeded disk regeneration inetgs, resulting from both active galactic nuclei feedback and environmentalquenching by partial ram pressure stripping of the hot gas.

1410.5437	the origin of the atomic and molecular gas contents of early-type  galaxies. ii. misaligned gas accretion	we study the origin of the wide distribution of angles between the angularmomenta of the stellar and gas components, $\alpha_{\rm g,s}$, in early-typegalaxies (etgs). we use the galform model of galaxy formation, set in the$\lambda$ cold dark matter framework, and coupled it with a monte-carlosimulation to follow the angular momenta flips driven by matter accretion ontohaloes and galaxies. we consider a gas disk to be misaligned with respect tothe stellar body if $\alpha_{\rm g,s}&gt;30$~degrees. by assuming that the onlysources of misaligments in galaxies are galaxy mergers, we place a lower limitof $2-5$ per cent on the fraction of etgs with misaligned gas/stellarcomponents. these low fractions are inconsistent with the observed value of$\approx 42\pm 6$ per cent in atlas$^{\rm 3d}$. in the more general case, inwhich smooth gas accretion in addition to galaxy mergers can drivemisalignments, our calculation predicts that $\approx 46$ per cent of etgs have$\alpha_{\rm g,s}&gt;30$~degrees. in this calculation, we find correlationsbetween $\alpha_{\rm g,s}$ and stellar mass, cold gas fraction and starformation rate, such that etgs with high masses, low cold gas fractions and lowstar formation rates are more likely to display aligned cold gas and stellarcomponents. we confirm these trends observationally for the first time usingatlas$^{\rm 3d}$ data. we argue that the high fraction of misaligned gas discsobserved in etgs is mostly due to smooth gas accretion (e.g. cooling from thehot halo of galaxies) which takes place after most of the stellar mass of thegalaxy is in place and comes misaligned with respect to the stellar component.galaxies that have accreted most of their cold gas content prior to the timewhere most of the stellar mass was in place show aligned components.

1501.01564	galaxy formation &amp; dark matter modelling in the era of the square  kilometre array	theoretical galaxy formation models are an established and powerful tool forinterpreting the astrophysical significance of observational data, particularlygalaxy surveys. such models have been utilised with great success by opticalsurveys such as 2dfgrs and sdss, but their application to radio surveys of coldgas in galaxies has been limited. in this chapter we describe recentdevelopments in the modelling of the cold gas properties in the models, and howthese developments are essential if they are to be applied to cold gas surveysof the kind that will be carried out with the ska. by linking explicitly agalaxy's star formation rate to the abundance of molecular hydrogen in thegalaxy rather than cold gas abundance, as was assumed previously, the latestmodels reproduce naturally many of the global atomic and molecular hydrogenproperties of observed galaxies. we review some of the key results of thelatest models and highlight areas where further developments are necessary. wediscuss also how model predictions can be most accurately compared withobservational data, what challenges we expect when creating synthetic galaxysurveys in the ska era, and how the ska can be used to test models of darkmatter.

1502.06614	the galaxy - dark matter halo connection: which galaxy properties are  correlated with the host halo mass?	we demonstrate how the properties of a galaxy depend on the mass of its hostdark matter subhalo, using two independent models of galaxy formation. for thecases of stellar mass and black hole mass, the median property value displays amonotonic dependence on subhalo mass. the slope of the relation changes forsubhalo masses for which heating by active galactic nuclei becomes important.the median property values are predicted to be remarkably similar for centraland satellite galaxies. the two models predict considerable scatter around themedian property value, though the size of the scatter is model dependent. thereis only modest evolution with redshift in the median galaxy property at a fixedsubhalo mass. properties such as cold gas mass and star formation rate,however, are predicted to have a complex dependence on subhalo mass. in thesecases subhalo mass is not a good indicator of the value of the galaxy property.we illustrate how the predictions in the galaxy property - subhalo mass planediffer from the assumptions made in empirical models of galaxy clustering byreconstructing the model output using a subhalo abundance matching scheme. inits simplest form, abundance matching generally does not reproduce theclustering predicted by the models, typically resulting in an overprediction ofthe clustering signal. we show how the basic abundance matching scheme can beextended to reproduce the model predictions more faithfully, which hasimplications for the analysis of galaxy clustering, particularly for lowabundance samples.

1506.02736	the hi mass function as a probe of photoionisation feedback on low mass  galaxy formation	we explore the galaxy formation physics governing the low mass end of the himass function in the local universe. specifically, we predict the effects onthe hi mass function of varying i) the strength of photoionisation feedback andthe redshift of the end of the epoch of reionization, ii) the cosmology, iii)the supernovae feedback prescription, and iv) the efficiency of star formation.we find that the shape of the low-mass end of the hi mass function is mostaffected by the critical halo mass below which galaxy formation is suppressedby photoionisation heating of the intergalactic medium. we model the redshiftdependence of this critical dark matter halo mass by requiring a match to thelow-mass end of the hi mass function. the best fitting critical dark matterhalo mass decreases as redshift increases in this model, corresponding to acircular velocity of $\sim 50 \, {\rm km \,s}^{-1}$ at $z=0$, $\sim 30 \, {\rmkm\, s}^{-1}$ at $z \sim 1$ and $\sim 12 \, {\rm km \, s}^{-1}$ at $z=6$. wefind that an evolving critical halo mass is required to explain both the shapeand abundance of galaxies in the hi mass function below $m_{\rm hi} \sim 10^{8}h^{-2} {\rm m_{\odot}}$. the model makes specific predictions for theclustering strength of hi-selected galaxies with hi masses &gt; $10^{6} h^{-2}{\rm m_{\odot}}$ and $&gt; 10^{7} h^{-2} {\rm m_{\odot}}$ and for the relationbetween the hi and stellar mass contents of galaxies which will be testablewith upcoming surveys with the square kilometre array and its pathfinders. weconclude that measurements of the hi mass function at $z \ge 0$ will lead to animprovement in our understanding of the net effect of photoionisation feedbackon galaxy formation and evolution.

1511.03052	a hybrid multi resolution scheme to efficiently model the structure of  reionization on the largest scales	redshifted 21cm measurements of the structure of ionised regions that growduring reionization promise to provide a new probe of early galaxy andstructure formation. one of the challenges of modelling reionization is toaccount both for the sub-halo scale physics of galaxy formation and the regionsof ionization on scales that are many orders of magnitude larger. to bridgethis gap we first calculate the statistical relationship between ionizingluminosity and mpc-scale overdensity using detailed models of galaxy formationcomputed using relatively small volume - ($\sim$100mpc/$h$)$^{3}$, highresolution dark matter simulations. we then use a monte-carlo technique toapply this relationship to reionization of the intergalactic medium withinlarge volume dark matter simulations - ($&gt;$1gpc/$h$)$^{3}$. the resultingsimulations can be used to address the contribution of very large scaleclustering of galaxies to the structure of reionization, and show that volumeslarger than 500mpc/$h$ are required to probe the largest reionization featuresmid-way through reionization. as an example application of our technique, wedemonstrate that the predicted 21cm power spectrum amplitude and gradient couldbe used to determine the importance of supernovae feedback for early galaxyformation.

astro-ph;0001308	the infrared side of galaxy formation. i. the local universe in the  semi-analytical framework	we present a new evolutionary model for the far-uv to sub-mm properties ofthe galaxy population. this combines a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelbased on hierarchical clustering (galform) with a spectro-photometric codewhich includes dust reprocessing (grasil). the former provides the starformation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass andvarious geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formedin different density environments. these quantities allow us to model the sedsof galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction andre-emission. two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes,where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. themodel includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starburststriggered by galaxy mergers. we test our models against the observedspectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local universe. the modelsreproduce fairly well the seds of normal spirals and starbursts, and theirinternal extinction properties. the starbursts follow the observed relationshipbetween the fir to uv luminosity ratio and the slope of the uv continuum. theyalso reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (calzetti et al 99). thisresult is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the milkyway extinction law. it suggests that the observed attenuation law is related tothe geometry of the stars and dust. we compute galaxy luminosity functions overour wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement withobservational data. the uv continuum turns out to be a poor star formationindicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.

astro-ph;0006109	the impact of galaxy formation on the x-ray evolution of clusters	we present a new model for the x-ray properties of the intracluster mediumthat explicitly includes heating of the gas by the energy released during theevolution of cluster galaxies. we calculate the evolution of clusters bycombining the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation of cole et al. with asimple model for the radial profile of the intracluster gas. we focus on thecluster x-ray luminosity function and on the relation between x-ray temperatureand luminosity. we show that cooling alone is not enough to account for theflatness of the observed t-l relation or for the lack of strong redshiftevolution in the observed x-ray luminosity function. gas heating, on the otherhand, can solve these two problems: in the \lambda-cdm cosmology, our modelreproduces fairly well the t-l relation and the x-ray luminosity function.furthermore, it predicts only weak evolution in these two properties out toz=0.5, in agreement with recent observational data. a successful model requiresan energy input of 1--2 x 10^49 ergs per solar mass of stars formed. this iscomparable to the total energy released by the supernovae associated with theformation of the cluster galaxies. thus, unless the transfer of supernovaeenergy to the intracluster gas is very (perhaps unrealistically) efficient,additional sources of energy, such as mechanical energy from agn winds arerequired. however, the amplification of an initial energy input by the responseof the intracluster medium to protocluster mergers might ease the energyrequirements. our model makes definite predictions for the x-ray properties ofgroups and clusters at high redshift which may soon be tested with data fromthe chandra and newton satellites.

astro-ph;0008216	modelling the extinction properties of galaxies	recently (granato, lacey, silva et al. 2000, astro-ph/0001308) we havecombined our spectrophotometric galaxy evolution code which includes dustreprocessing (grasil, silva et al. 1998) with semi-analytical galaxy formationmodels (galform, cole et al. 1999). one of the most characteristic features ofthe former is that the dust is divided in two main phases: molecular cloudcomplexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellarmedium. as a consequence, stellar populations of different ages have differentgeometrical relationships with the two phases, which is essential inunderstanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular thoseundergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. indeed, our mergedgrasil+galform model reproduces fairly well the seds of normal spirals andstarbursts from the far-uv to the sub-mm and their internal extinctionproperties. in particular in the model the observed starburst attenuation law(calzetti 1999) is accounted for as an effect of geometry of stars and dust,and has nothing to do with the optical properties of dust grains.

astro-ph;0103092	the evolution of the galaxy distribution	we follow the evolution of the galaxy population in a lambda-cdm cosmology bymeans of high-resolution n-body simulations in which the formation of galaxiesand their observable properties are calculated using a semi-analytic model. wedisplay images of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the simulations thatillustrate its evolution and provide a qualitative understanding of theprocesses responsible for various biases that develop. we consider threespecific statistical measures of clustering at z=1 and z=0: the correlationlength (in real- and redshift-space) of galaxies of different luminosity, themorphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of galaxyisodensity surfaces. for galaxies with luminosity below l*, the z=0 correlationlength depends very little on the luminosity of the sample, but for brightergalaxies it increases very rapidly, reaching values in excess of 10mpc/h. the"accelerated" dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters,which is partly responsible for this effect, also results in a strongmorphology-density relation. remarkably, this relation is alreadywell-established at z=1. the genus curves of the galaxies are significantlydifferent from the genus curves of the dark matter but this is not due togenuine topological differences but rather to the sparse sampling of thedensity field provided by galaxies. the predictions of our model at z=0 will betested by forthcoming data from the 2df and sloan galaxy surveys, and those atz=1 by the deep and virmos surveys.

astro-ph;0107197	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy luminosity functions per spectral  type	we calculate the optical bj luminosity function of the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) for different subsets defined by their spectral properties.these spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter, eta, whichis a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a principalcomponent analysis. this parameter eta identifies the average emission andabsorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is auseful indicator of the present star formation. we use a total of 75,000galaxies in our calculations, chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noiseratio, low redshift galaxies observed before january 2001. we find that thereis a systematic steepening of the faint end slope (alpha) as one moves frompassive (alpha = -0.54) to active (alpha = -1.50) star-forming galaxies, andthat there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest-frame characteristicmagnitude m* - 5\log_10(h) (from -19.6 to -19.2). we also show that theschechter function provides a poor fit to the quiescent (type 1) lf for veryfaint galaxies (m - 5log_10(h) fainter than -16.0), perhaps suggesting thepresence of a significant dwarf population. the luminosity functions presentedhere give a precise confirmation of the trends seen previously in a muchsmaller preliminary 2dfgrs sample, and in other surveys. we also present a newprocedure for determining self-consistent k-corrections and investigatepossible fibre-aperture biases.

astro-ph;0108217	the effects of photoionization on galaxy formation - i: model and  results at z=0	we develop a coupled model for the evolution of the global properties of theintergalactic medium (igm) and the formation of galaxies, in the presence of aphotoionizing background due to stars and quasars. we use this model to predictthe thermodynamic history of the igm when photoionized by galaxies forming in acold dark matter (cdm) universe. the evolution of the galaxies is calculatedusing a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects oftidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting insidelarger dark matter halos. we include in the model the negative feedback ongalaxy formation from the photoionizing background. photoionization inhibitsgalaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos in two ways: (i) heating of theigm and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark halos by the igm pressure,and (ii) reduction in the radiative cooling of gas within halos. the result ofour method is a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the igm. the igmis reheated twice (during reionization of hi and heii), and we find that thestar formation rate per unit volume is slightly suppressed after each episodeof reheating. we find that galaxies brighter than l_* are mostly unaffected byreionization, while the abundance of faint galaxies is significantly reduced,leading to present-day galaxy luminosity functions with shallow faint endslopes, in good agreement with recent observational data. reionization alsoaffects other properties of these faint galaxies, in a readily understandableway.

astro-ph;0108218	the effects of photoionization on galaxy formation - ii: satellites in  the local group	we use a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the evolution of theintergalactic medium to study the effects of the reionization of the universeat high redshift on the properties of satellite galaxies like those seen aroundthe milky way. photoionization suppresses the formation of small galaxies, sothat surviving satellites are preferentially those that formed before theuniverse reionized. as a result, the number of satellites expected today isabout an order of magnitude smaller than the number inferred by identifyingsatellites with subhalos in high-resolution simulations of the dark matter. theresulting satellite population has an abundance and a distribution of circularvelocities similar to those observed in the local group. we explore many otherproperties of satellite galaxies, including their gas content, metallicity andstar formation rate, and find generally good agreement with available data. ourmodel predicts the existence of many as yet undetected satellites in the localgroup. we quantify their observability in terms of their apparent magnitude andsurface brightness and also in terms of their constituent stars. anear-complete census of the milky way's satellites would require imaging tov~20 and to a surface brightness fainter than 26 v-band magnitudes per squarearcsecond. satellites with integrated luminosity v=15 should contain of order100 stars brighter than b=26, with central stellar densities of a few tens persquare arcminute. discovery of a large population of faint satellites wouldprovide a strong test of current models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0112043	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the dependence of galaxy clustering on  luminosity and spectral type	we investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and spectraltype using the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). spectral types are assignedusing the principal component analysis of madgwick et al. we divide the sampleinto two broad spectral classes: galaxies with strong emission lines(`late-types'), and more quiescent galaxies (`early-types'). we measure theclustering in real space, free from any distortion of the clustering patterndue to peculiar velocities, for a series of volume-limited samples. theprojected correlation functions of both spectral types are well described by apower law for transverse separations in the range 2 &lt; (sigma/mpc/h) &lt; 15, witha marginally steeper slope for early-types than late-types. both early and latetypes have approximately the same dependence of clustering strength onluminosity, with the clustering amplitude increasing by a factor of ~2.5between l* and 4 l*. at all luminosities, however, the correlation functionamplitude for the early-types is ~50% higher than that of the late-types. theseresults support the view that luminosity, and not type, is the dominant factorin determining how the clustering strength of the whole galaxy populationvaries with luminosity.

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0202191	on the formation of globular cluster systems in a hierarchical universe	we have investigated the formation of globular cluster (gc) systems in thefiducial semi-analytic galaxy formation model of cole et al. we assume that gcsare formed at high-redshift (z &gt; 5) in proto-galactic fragments, and during thesubsequent gas-rich merging of these fragments. we find that the mean ages ofthe metal-rich gcs are dependent upon host galaxy luminosity and halo circularvelocity, whereas the mean ages of the metal-poor gcs are not. we find thatgaseous merging of the proto-galactic fragments leads to a significantage-spread amongst the metal-rich gcs, which increases for lower-luminositygalaxies. we find the total gc populations scale with host galaxy luminosity asl^1.25, due to the systematic increase in the mass-to-light ratios (with mass)of the galaxy haloes in the model. a comparison between the luminosity growthof the model ellipticals and their gc formation indicates that mergers do notsignificantly effect s_n at z &lt; 2. we conclude that gaseous merging, the bulkof which occurs at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4 in the lambda-cdm model, leads to the formation ofthe metal-rich peak of the gc systems of elliptical galaxies. we suggest thatthe formation and subsequent truncation of the metal-poor gcs is closelyrelated to the star formation rate in the proto-galactic fragments, which mayhave been significantly higher at early times (abridged).

astro-ph;0210354	the effects of photoionization on galaxy formation -- iii: environmental  dependence in the luminosity function	using semi-analytic modeling techniques, we calculate the luminosity functionof galaxy populations residing in cold dark matter halos of different mass. wepay particular attention to the influence of the reionization of the universeon the number of faint galaxies and to the effects of dynamical friction andtidal limitation of satellites on the number of bright galaxies. we findsubstantial differences in the shapes of the galaxy luminosity functions inhalos of different mass which reflect generic features of the cold dark mattermodel of galaxy formation and thus offer the opportunity to test it. we thenconsider how the individual halo luminosity functions combine together toproduce the global luminosity function. surprisingly, the global function endsup having a shallower faint end slope than those of the constituent haloluminosity functions. we compare our model predictions with the limiteddatasets compiled by trentham &amp; hodgkin. we find good agreement with theluminosity functions measured in the virgo and coma clusters but significantdisagreement with the luminosity functions measured in the local group and ursaminor cluster. we speculate on possible inadequacies in our modeling and in theexisting observational samples. the luminosity functions of galaxies in groupsand clusters identified in the 2df and sdss galaxy redshift surveys offer theprospect of testing galaxy formation models in detail.

astro-ph;0301083	the power spectrum of galaxy clustering in the apm survey	we measure the power spectrum of galaxy clustering in real space from the apmgalaxy survey. we present an improved technique for the numerical inversion oflimber's equation that relates the angular clustering of galaxies to anintegral over the power spectrum in three dimensions. our approach isunderpinned by a large ensemble of mock galaxy catalogues constructed from thehubble volume n-body simulations. the mock catalogues are used to test forsystematic effects in the inversion algorithm and to estimate the errors on ourmeasurement. we find that we can recover the power spectrum to an accuracy ofbetter than 15% over three decades in wavenumber. a key advantage of the use ofmock catalogues to infer errors is that we can apply our technique on scalesfor which the density fluctuations are not gaussian, thus probing the regimethat offers the best constraints on models of galaxy formation. on largescales, our measurement of the power spectrum is consistent with the shape ofthe mass power spectrum in the popular ``concordance'' cold dark matter model.the galaxy power spectrum on small scales is strongly affected by nonlinearevolution of density fluctuations, and, to a lesser degree, by galaxy bias. therms variance in the galaxy distribution, when smoothed in spheres of radius 8h^(-1)mpc, is sigma^g_8=0.96^(+0.17)_(-0.20) and the shape of the powerspectrum on large scales is described by a simple fitting formula withparameter gamma= 0.19^(+0.13)_(-0.04) (these errors are the 1-sigma ranges fora two parameter fit). we use our measurement of the power spectrum to estimatethe galaxy two point correlation function; the results are well described by apower law with correlation length r_0 = 5.9 +- 0.7 h^(-1)mpc and slope gamma =1.61 +- 0.06 for pair separations in the range 0.1 &lt; r/[h^(-1)mpc] &lt; 20.

astro-ph;0302450	what shapes the luminosity function of galaxies?	we investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function.beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos, we show how gas cooling,photoionization, feedback, merging and thermal conduction affect the shape ofthe luminosity function. we consider three processes whereby supernovae canaffect the forming galaxy: (1) reheating of disk gas to the halo temperature;(2) expansion of the diffuse halo gas; (3) expulsion of cold disk gas from thehalo. while feedback of form (1) is able to flatten the faint end of theluminosity function, this alone does not produce the sharp cut-off observed atlarge luminosities. feedback of form (2) is also unable to solve this problem.the relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if coolingin massive halos is strongly suppressed. conduction is a promising mechanism,but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to thedesired level. if, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of brightgalaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to thegalaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernovaexplosions. the mechanism is only viable if the formation of centralsupermassive black holes play a crucial role in limiting the amount of starsthat form in the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0303668	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type	we have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space,xi(sigma,pi), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2df galaxyredshift survey. using these correlation functions we are able to estimatevalues of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, beta = omega_m^0.6/b,the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for whichthe present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. at small separations,the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than thatof the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes arerespectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is adeclining function of radius. on scales larger than 10 h^-1 mpc there isevidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.this result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-spacedistortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- thecontours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, andbeta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. the pairwise velocity dispersion is highlycorrelated with beta. however, despite this a significant difference is seenbetween the two classes. over the range 8-20 h^-1 mpc, the pairwise velocitydispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active andpassive galaxy samples respectively. this is consistent with the expectationfrom morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxiespreferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

astro-ph;0404275	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: stochastic relative biasing between  galaxy populations	it is well known that the clustering of galaxies depends on galaxy type.suchrelative bias complicates the inference of cosmological parameters from galaxyredshift surveys, and is a challenge to theories of galaxy formation andevolution. in this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis ongalaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey, classified by both colour andspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. we fit three differentmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cellcounts, assuming poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. we investigatethe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells ofside 10mpc \leq l \leq 45mpc (h=0.7). exact linear bias is ruled out with highsignificance on all scales. power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihoodratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxyformation other than those from the local density field. using this model, wemeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_ln) of 0.958 forcells of length l=10mpc, increasing to 0.970 by l=45mpc. this corresponds to astochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\pm0.02 and 0.27\pm0.05 respectively. forsmaller cells, the poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents anincreasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction ofcompletely empty cells. we compare these trends with the predictions ofsemianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms ofoverall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of emptycells.

astro-ph;0407537	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity functions by density  environment and galaxy type	we use the 2df galaxy redshift survey to measure the dependence of thebj-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined bydensity contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1mpc, and on spectral type, determinedfrom principal component analysis. we find that the galaxy populations at bothextremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. thepopulation in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudesbrighter than m_bj-5log10h &lt;-18.5. in contrast, cluster regions have a relativeexcess of very bright early-type galaxies with m_bj-5log10h &lt; -21. differencesin the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: atm_bj-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparableabundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order ofmagnitude. we find that the luminosity functions measured in all densityenvironments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by schechterfunctions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in afashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. theseobserved variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of theoverall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, mayprove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0511338	the broken hierarchy of galaxy formation	recent observations of the distant universe suggest that much of the stellarmass of bright galaxies was already in place at $z&gt;1$. this presents achallenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembledlate in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (cdm). in this paper,we discuss a new implementation of the durham semi-analytic model in whichfeedback due to active galactic nuclei (agn) is assumed to quench cooling flowsin massive halos. this mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxyluminosity function at bright magnitudes. the model is implemented within themillennium n-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and largenumber of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulationprovides results in highly accurate statistics. after adjusting the values ofthe physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of localgalaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the k-band luminosity andgalaxy stellar mass functions. we also calculate the volume averaged starformation rate density of the universe as a function of redshift and the way inwhich this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. the modelrobustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift$z\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasingredshift in objects of all masses. although observational data on theseproperties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxyformation, we find that when agn feedback is taken into account, thefundamentally hierachical cdm model provides a very good match to theseobservations.

astro-ph;9703111	the epoch of galaxy formation	we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in hierarchical clusteringtheories to interpret recent data on galaxy formation and evolution, focussingprimarily on the recently discovered population of lyman-break galaxies at$z\simeq 3$. for a variety of cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies we constructmock galaxy catalogues subject to identical selection criteria to those appliedto the real data. we find that the expected number of lyman-break galaxies isvery sensitive to the assumed stellar initial mass function and to thenormalization of the primordial power spectrum. for reasonable choices of theseand other model parameters, it is possible to reproduce the observed abundanceof lyman-break galaxies in cdm models with $\omega_0=1$ and with $\omega_0&lt;1$.these galaxies generally form from rare peaks at high redshift and, as aresult, their spatial distribution is strongly biased, with a typical biasparameter, $b\simeq 4$, and a comoving correlation length, $r_0\simeq 4 \mpc$.the typical sizes of these galaxies, $\sim 0.5\kpc$, are substantially smallerthan those of present day bright galaxies. in combination with data at lowerredshifts, the lyman-break galaxies can be used to trace the cosmic starformation history. most galaxies (in our models and in the data) neverexperience star formation rates in excess of a few solar masses per year. ourmodels predict that even at $z=5$, the integrated star formation rate issimilar to that measured locally, although less than 1% of all the stars haveformed prior to this redshift. these galaxies mark the onset of the epoch ofgalaxy formation that continues into the present day. the basic ingredients ofa consistent picture of galaxy formation may well be now in place.

astro-ph;9711146	the k-band hubble diagram for the brightest cluster galaxies: a test for  galaxy formation and evolution models	the k-band hubble diagram for a sample of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs)in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 shows a very small scatter (0.3 magnitudes r.m.s).the bcgs exhibit very little luminosity evolution in this redshift range: ifq_0=0.0 we detect no luminosity evolution; for q_0=0.5 we measure a smallnegative evolution. if the mass in stars of these galaxies had remainedconstant over this period of time, substantial positive luminosity evolutionwould be expected: bcgs should have been brighter in the past since their starswere younger. this suggests that the stellar mass of the bcgs has beenassembled over time through merging and accretion. we estimate that the stellarmass in a typical bcg has grown by a factor ~ 2 since z=1 if q_0=0.0 or byfactor ~ 4 if q_0=0.5. these results are in remarkably good agreement with thepredictions of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution set inthe context of a hierarchical scenario for structure formation.

astro-ph;9801277	the k-band hubble diagram for the brightest cluster galaxies: a test of  hierarchical galaxy formation models	we analyse the k-band hubble diagram for a sample of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1. in good agreement with earlierstudies, we confirm that the scatter in the absolute magnitudes of the galaxiesis small (0.3 magnitudes). the bcgs exhibit very little luminosity evolution inthis redshift range: if q_0=0.0 we detect no luminosity evolution; for q_0=0.5we measure a small negative evolution (i.e., bcgs were about 0.5 magnitudesfainter at z=1 than today). if the mass in stars of these galaxies had remainedconstant over this period of time, substantial positive luminosity evolutionwould be expected: bcgs should have been brighter in the past since their starswere younger. a likely explanation for the observed zero or negative evolutionis that the stellar mass of the bcgs has been assembled over time throughmerging and accretion, as expected in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.the colour evolution of the bcgs is consistent with that of an old stellarpopulation (z_form &gt;2) that is evolving passively. we can thus use evolutionarypopulation synthesis models to estimate the rate of growth in stellar mass forthese systems. we find that the stellar mass in a typical bcg has grown by afactor ~ 2 since z=1 if q_0=0.0 or by factor ~ 4 if q_0=0.5. these results arein good agreement with the predictions of semi-analytic models of galaxyformation and evolution set in the context of a hierarchical scenario forstructure formation. the models predict a scatter in the luminosities of thebcgs that is somewhat larger than the observed one, but that depends on thecriterion used to select the model clusters.

astro-ph;9803030	the seeds of rich galaxy clusters in the universe	the discovery of a population of young galaxies at an epoch when the universewas about one tenth of its current age has shed new light on the question ofwhen and how galaxies formed. within the context of popular models this is thepopulation of primeval galaxies that built themselves up to the size ofpresent--day galaxies through the process of repeated mergers. but the recentdetection of a large concentration of these primeval galaxies (steidel et al.1997) appears to be incompatible with hierarchical clustering models, whichgenerally predict that clusters of this size are fully formed later in time.here we use a combination of two powerful theoretical techniques--semi-analytic modelling and n-body simulations-- to show that such largeconcentrations should be quite common in a universe dominated by cold darkmatter, and that they are the progenitors of the rich galaxy clusters seentoday. we predict the clustering properties of primeval galaxies which should,when compared with data that will be collected in the near future, test ourunderstanding of galaxy formation within the framework of a universe dominatedby cold dark matter.

astro-ph;9808209	early type galaxies in the hierarchical universe	any realistic theory of galaxy formation must be set in the context of amodel for the formation of structure in the universe. we describe a powerfulapproach -- semi-analytic modelling -- that combines a set of simple rulesdescribing the gas processes involved in galaxy formation with a scheme tofollow the hierarchical growth of dark matter haloes. surprisingly few freeparameters are required to specify the model, and these are fixed withreference to a subset of local observational data. the model produces the fullstar formation history of a galaxy, allowing a wide range of predictions to bemade. we review some of the successes of the models, namely the star formationhistory of the universe and the evolution of galaxy clustering, before focusingour attention on early-type galaxies. we discuss the observational evidenceagainst the classical picture in which early-type galaxies form at somearbitrarily high redshift in a single monolithic collapse and burst of starformation. the alternative scenario in which spheroidal systems are formed bythe merger of disk galaxies is outlined. we review some of the predictions ofthis model, namely the colour-magnitude relation, the faint counts and theevolution of cluster membership.

astro-ph;9810189	properties of galaxy clusters: mass and correlation functions	we analyse parallel n-body simulations of three cold dark matter (cdm)universes to study the abundance and clustering of galaxy clusters. thesimulations cover a volume comparable to the forthcoming sdss. we are able tomake robust measurements of cluster properties to a redshift larger than unity.we extract halos using two independent, public domain group finders (fof &amp; hop)and find consistent results. the correlation function of clusters is in verygood agreement with a simple analytic prescription based upon a lagrangianbiasing scheme developed by mo &amp; white (1996) and the press-schechter (ps)formalism for the mass function. the r_0--d_c relation for the open cdm modelis in good agreement with the results from the apm cluster survey. the scdmuniverse shows a robust deviation in the shape and evolution of the massfunction when compared with that predicted by the ps formalism. critical modelswith a low sigma_8 normalization or small shape parameter gamma show an excessof massive clusters compared with the ps prediction. when cluster normalized,the scdm universe at z =1 contains 10 times more clusters with temperaturesgreater than 7kev, compared with the ps prediction. the agreement between theanalytic and n-body mass functions of scdm can be improved if the value of thedelta_c (the extrapolated linear theory threshold for collapse) is revised tobe $ delta_c(z) = 1.685[(0.7/sigma_8)(1+z)]^{-0.125}. our best estimate for theamplitude of fluctuations inferred from the local cluster abundance for scdm issigma_{8} = 0.5 \pm 0.04. however, the discrepancy between the temperaturefunction predicted in a critical density universe and that observed at z=0.33(henry et al. 1998) remains.

astro-ph;9811222	modelling the evolution of galaxy clustering	measurements of galaxy clustering are now becoming possible over a range ofredshifts out to z=3. we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation tocompute the expected evolution of the galaxy correlation function withredshift. we illustrate how the degree of clustering evolution is sensitive tothe details of the sample selection. for a fixed apparent magnitude limit,galaxies selected at higher redshifts are located in progressively rarer darkmatter haloes, compared with the general population of galaxies in place ateach redshift. as a result these galaxies are highly biased tracers of theunderlying dark matter distribution and exhibit stronger clustering than thedark matter. in general, the correlation length measured in comoving units,decreases at first with increasing redshift, before increasing again at higherredshift. we show that the epsilon-model often used to interpret the angularcorrelation function of faint galaxies gives an inadequate description of theevolution of clustering, and offers no physical insight into the clusteringprocess. we compare our predictions with those of a simple, popular model inwhich a one-to-one correspondence between galaxies and dark halos is assumed.qualitatively, this model reproduces the correct evolutionary behaviour at highredshift, but the quantitative results can be significantly in error. ourtheoretical expectations are in good agreement with the high redshiftclustering data of carlberg etal and postman etal but are higher than themeasurements of le fevre etal.

astro-ph;9812137	the durham/ukst galaxy redshift survey - vi. power spectrum analysis of  clustering	we present the power spectrum analysis of clustering in the durham/ukstgalaxy redshift survey, which covers 1450 square degrees and consists of 2501galaxy redshifts sampled at a rate of 1 in 3 to b_j = 17. the fluctuations thatwe measure can be expressed as sigma_{8} = 1.01 +/- 0.17 . we find remarkablygood agreement between the power spectrum measured for the durham/ukst surveyand those from other optical studies, in spite of the very different samplingrates, magnitude limits and survey geometries employed, on scales up to lambda= (2 pi)/k = 80/h mpc. on scales larger than this we find good agreement withthe power measured from the stromlo-apm survey (tadros &amp; efstathiou), but findmore power than estimated from the las campanas redshift survey (lin et al). weapply a simple model for redshift space distortions to the real space apmgalaxy survey power spectrum and find a shape and amplitude that is in verygood agreement with the power spectrum of the durham/ukst survey. this impliesbeta=omega^{0.6}/b=0.60 +/- 0.35, where omega is the density parameter and b isthe bias between fluctuations in the galaxy and mass distributions, and alsosuggests a one dimensional velocity dispersion of sigma = 320 +/-140 km/s. wefind that for any choice of normalisation, the standard cdm model has a shapethat cannot be reconciled with the durham/ukst survey power spectrum, unlesseither unacceptably high values of the one dimensional velocity dispersion areadopted or the assumption that bias is constant is invalid on scales greaterthan 20/h mpc. over the range of wavenumbers for which we have a robustmeasurement of the power spectrum, we find the best agreement is obtained for acritical density cdm model in which the shape of the power spectrum ismodified.

astro-ph;9903343	the nature of galaxy bias and clustering	we have used a combination of high resolution cosmological n-body simulationsand semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processesthat determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (cdm)models. the galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency withwhich galaxies form in halos of different mass. in small mass halos, galaxyformation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,whereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of thegas. as a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at thehalo mass associated with l* galaxies. this leads to a scale dependent bias inthe distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. on largescales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to thebias in the distribution of massive halos. on small scales, the correlationfunction is determined by the interplay between various effects including thespatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the numberof galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,dynamical friction. remarkably, these processes conspire to produce acorrelation function in a flat, omega_0=0.3, cdm model that is close to apower-law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. this model agreeswell with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the apm survey. onsmall scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the darkmatter whereas on large scales, they trace the occupied halos. our clusteringpredictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formationmodel, provided only those models that match the bright end of the galaxyluminosity function are considered.

astro-ph;9910488	the dependence of velocity and clustering statistics on galaxy  properties	we use a combination of n-body simulations of the hierarchical clustering ofdark matter and semi-analytic modelling of the physics of galaxy formation toprobe the relationship between the galaxy distribution and the massdistribution. the pairwise line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies issensitive to the number of galaxies present in halos of different mass. thegalaxy velocity dispersion is ~40% lower than that of the dark matter and is inreasonable agreement with the values measured in the las campanas redshiftsurvey by jing et al. over two decades in pair separation. the origin of thisoffset is statistical rather than dynamical, and depends upon the relativeefficiency of galaxy formation in dark matter halos of different mass. althoughthe model galaxies and the dark matter have markedly different correlationfunctions in real space, such biases conspire to cause the redshift spacecorrelation functions to be remarkably similar to each other. the predictedredshift-space galaxy correlation function agrees well with observations. wefind no evidence in the model for a dependence of clustering strength onintrinsic galaxy luminosity, unless extremely bright galaxies, two magnitudesbrighter than l*, are considered. however, there are significant differenceswhen model galaxies are selected either by morphology or by colour. early typeor red galaxies show a much stronger clustering amplitude than late type orblue galaxies, particularly on small scales, again in good agreement withobservations.

astro-ph;9912220	a comparison of semi-analytic and smoothed particle hydrodynamics galaxy  formation	we compare the statistical properties of galaxies found in two differentmodels of hierarchical galaxy formation: the semi-analytic model of cole et al.and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations of pearce et al.using a `stripped-down' version of the semi-analytic model which mimics theresolution of the sph simulations and excludes physical processes not includedin them, we find that the two models produce an ensemble of galaxies withremarkably similar properties, although there are some differences in the gascooling rates and in the number of galaxies that populate halos of differentmass. the full semi-analytic model, which has effectively no resolution limitand includes a treatment of star formation and supernovae feedback, producessomewhat different (but readily understandable) results. agreement isparticularly good for the present-day global fractions of hot gas, cold dense(i.e. galactic) gas and uncollapsed gas, for which the sph and stripped-downsemi-analytic calculations differ by at most 25%. in the most massive halos,the stripped-down semi-analytic model predicts, on the whole, up to 50% lessgas in galaxies than is seen in the sph simulations. the two techniquesapportion this cold gas somewhat differently amongst galaxies in a given halo.this difference can be tracked down to the greater cooling rate in massivehalos in the sph simulation compared to the semi-analytic model.

0810.2177	the fate of substructures in cold dark matter haloes	we use the millennium simulation, a large, high resolution n-body simulationof the evolution of structure in a lambdacdm cosmology, to study the propertiesand fate of substructures within a large sample of dark matter haloes. we findthat the subhalo mass function departs significantly from a power law at thehigh mass end. we also find that the radial and angular distributions ofsubstructures depend on subhalo mass. in particular, high mass subhaloes tendto be less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer tothe direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their lessmassive counterparts. we find that mergers between subhaloes occur. these tendto be between substructures that were already dynamically associated beforeaccretion into the main halo. for subhaloes larger than 0.001 times the mass ofthe host halo, it is more likely that the subhalo will merge with the centralor main subhalo than with another subhalo larger than itself. for lower masses,subhalo-subhalo mergers become equally likely to mergers with the main subhalo.our results have implications for the variation of galaxy properties withenvironment and for the treatment of mergers in galaxy formation models.

0811.2134	massive, red galaxies in a hierarchical universe i. counts of extremely  red objects and basic properties	we present predictions for the abundance and nature of extremely red objects(eros) in the lambda cold dark matter model. eros are red, massive galaxiesobserved at z&gt;= 1 and their numbers and properties pose a challenge tohierarchical galaxy formation models. we compare the predictions from twopublished models, one of which invokes a "superwind" to regulate star formationin massive haloes and the other which suppresses gas cooling in haloes through"radio-mode" agn feedback. the superwind model underestimates the number countsof eros by an order of magnitude, whereas the radio-mode agn feedback modelgives excellent agreement with the number counts and redshift distribution oferos. in the agn feedback model the ero population is dominated by old,passively evolving galaxies, whereas observations favour an equal split betweenold galaxies and dusty starbursts. also, the model predicts a more extendedredshift distribution of passive galaxies than is observed. these comparisonssuggest that star formation may be quenched too efficiently in this model.
