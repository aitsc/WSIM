0903.3415	galaxy zoo: a sample of blue early-type galaxies at low redshift	we report the discovery of a population of nearby, blue early-type galaxieswith high star formation rates (0.5 &lt; sfr &lt; 50 msun/yr). they are identified bytheir visual morphology as provided by galaxy zoo for sdss dr6 and their u-rcolour. we select a volume-limited sample in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt;0.05, corresponding to luminosities of approximately l* and above, and with u-rcolours significantly bluer than the red sequence. we confirm the early-typemorphology of the objects in this sample and investigate their environmentaldependence and star formation properties. blue early-type galaxies tend to livein lower-density environments than `normal' red sequence early-types and makeup 5.7 +/-0.4% of the low-redshift early-type galaxy population. we find thatsuch blue early-type galaxies are virtually absent at high velocity dispersionsabove 200 km/s. our analysis uses emission line diganostic diagrams and we findthat ~25% of them are actively starforming, while another ~25% host both starformation and an agn. another ~12% are agn. the remaining 38% show no strongemission lines. when present and uncontaminated by an agn contribution, thestar formation is generally intense. we consider star formation rates derivedfrom halpha, u-band and infrared luminosities, and radial colour profiles, andconclude that the star formation is spatially extended. of those objects thatare not currently undergoing star formation must have ceased doing so recentlyin order to account for their blue optical colours. the gas phase metallicityof the actively starforming blue early-types galaxies is supersolar in allcases. we discuss the place of these objects in the context of galaxyformation. a catalogue of all 204 blue early-type galaxies in our sample,including star formation rates and emission line classification, is provided.

0706.3624	absorption line-strengths of 18 late-type spiral galaxies observed with  sauron	we present absorption line-strength maps for a sample of 18 sb-sd galaxiesobserved using the integral-field spectrograph sauron. the sauron spectralrange allows the measurement of the lick/ids indices hbeta, fe5015 and mgb,which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. we presenthere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. from the maps, welearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high hbeta and low fe5015 andmgb values, and that the hbeta index has often a positive gradient over thefield, while the metal indices peak in the central region. we investigate therelations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations withmorphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observedbehaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals fromthe sauron survey. we find that our galaxies lie below the mg - sigma relationdetermined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend withmorphological type. from the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicityand abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-ssp approach andfrom a two-ssp approach. late-type galaxies are generally younger and moremetal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.we also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover thestar formation history using the evolutionary models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (sfr).we find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst andthe central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shortertau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basicallyended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

0905.3386	star formation and nuclear activity in close pairs of early-type  galaxies	we extract from the sloan digital sky survey a sample of 347 systemsinvolving early type galaxies separated by less than 30 kpc, in projection, and500 km/s in radial velocity. these close pairs are likely progenitors of drymergers. the (optical) spectra is used to determine how the interaction affectsthe star formation history and nuclear activity of the galaxies. the emissionlines (or lack thereof) are used to classify the sample into agn, star formingor quiescent. increased agn activity and reduced star formation in early-typepairs that already appear to be interacting indicate that the merging processchanges the nature of nebular activity, a finding that is also supported by anincrease in agn luminosity with decreasing pair separation. recent starformation is studied on the absorption line spectra, both through principalcomponent analysis as well as via a comparison of the spectra with compositestellar population models. we find that the level of recent star formation inclose pairs is raised relative to a control sample of early-type galaxies. thisexcess of residual star formation is found throughout the sample of close pairsand does not correlate with pair separation or with visual signs ofinteraction. our findings are consistent with a scenario whereby the firststage of the encounter (involving the outer parts of the halos) triggerresidual star formation, followed by a more efficient inflow towards the centre-- switching to an agn phase -- after which the systems are quiescent.

0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0906.3321	the sauron project - xiv. no escape from v$_{\mathrm{esc}}$: a global  and local parameter in early-type galaxy evolution	we present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity(vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from thesauron sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies withboth detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling.values of vesc are computed using multi gaussian expansion (mge) photometricfitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneouslyon hst and ground-based images. we determine line strengths and escapevelocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation ofthe correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. we finda tight correlation between vesc and the line-strength indices. for mgb we findthat this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but alsoinside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. therelation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the globalrelation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsicscatter in the local gradients. we transform our line strength indexmeasurements to the single stellar population (ssp) equivalent age (t),metallicity ([z/h]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/fe]) and carry out a principalcomponent analysis of our ssp and vesc data. we find that in thisfour-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a goodapproximation confined to a plane, given by $\log\mathrm({v}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[z/h]} + 0.43 \log(\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{gyrs})$ - 0.20. it is surprising that it is a combinationof age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy'between age and metallicity or a weakness in the ssp models.

0907.4155	galaxy zoo green peas: discovery of a class of compact extremely  star-forming galaxies	we investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as"green peas", first noted by volunteers in the galaxy zoo project because oftheir peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in sdss imaging.their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [o iii]5007 a, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to ~1000 a. we discuss awell-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are stronglystar forming, although there are some agn interlopers including 8 newlydiscovered narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies. the star-forming peas are low massgalaxies (m~10^8.5 - 10^10 m_sun) with high star formation rates (~10m_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[o/h] + 12 ~ 8.7) and low reddening (e(b-v) &lt;0.25) and they reside in low density environments. they have some of thehighest specific star formation rates (up to ~10^{-8} yr^{-1}) seen in thelocal universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds ofmyrs. the few star-forming peas with hst imaging appear to have several clumpsof bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that mayindicate recent or ongoing mergers. the peas are similar in size, mass,luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies. they are alsosimilar to high redshift uv-luminous galaxies, e.g., lyman-break galaxies andlyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which tostudy the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshiftgalaxies. studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essentialto understanding the build up of stellar mass in the universe.

0912.0259	environment and self-regulation in galaxy formation	the environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxiesconsiderably best visible through the well-known morphology-densityrelationship. in this paper we study the effect of environment on the evolutionof early-type galaxies by analysing the stellar population properties of 3,360galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the sdss in theredshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.06. we find that the distribution of ages is bimodalwith a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ~2.5gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. this is analogue to 'redsequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containingboth early and late type galaxies. the fraction of the young, rejuvenatedgalaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasingenvironmental density up to about 45 per cent. the rejuvenated galaxies havelower alpha/fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoingstar formation through their emission line spectra. all objects that host agnin their centres without star formation are part of the red sequencepopulation. we confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results thatluminosity weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha/fe element ratios of the redsequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass.most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive toenvironmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. we infer thatearly-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billionyears ago around z~0.2. a self-regulated formation phase without environmentaldependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which theenvironment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy interactions.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1001.3141	galaxy zoo: the fundamentally different co-evolution of supermassive  black holes and their early- and late-type host galaxies	we use data from the sloan digital sky survey and visual classifications ofmorphology from the galaxy zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearbyuniverse (z &lt; 0.05) and to break down the agn host galaxy population by color,stellar mass and morphology. we find that black hole growth at luminositiesl_oiii &gt;1e40 erg/s in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different.agn host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses(1e10-1e11 msun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram andtheir central black holes have median masses around 1e6.5 msun. however, bycomparing early- and late-type agn host galaxies to their non-activecounterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it ispreferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that aregrowing, while late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive}blackholes that are growing. the duty cycle of agn in early-type galaxies isstrongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1e10 msun) of thered sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloudprogenitors. the duty cycle of agn in late-type galaxies on the other handpeaks in massive (1e11 msun) green and red late-types which generally do nothave a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. at high eddingtonratios (l/l_edd &gt; 0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of agnare the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. finally, the milky waylikely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the agn dutycycle of late-type galaxies is highest. we discuss the implications of theseresults for our understanding of the role of agn in the evolution of galaxies

1006.1574	the sauron project - xvii. stellar population analysis of the absorption  line strength maps of 48 early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a stellar population analysis of the absorption linestrength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample. using the linestrength index maps of hbeta, fe5015, and mgb, measured in the lick/ids systemand spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, together with predictionsfrom up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellarpopulation-equivalent (ssp-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio[alpha/fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately oneeffective radius. we find a large range of ssp-equivalent ages in our sample,of which ~40% of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellarpopulation. the most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, withssp-equivalent ages of &lt;=3 gyr observed over the full field-of-view, andsometimes even showing signs of residual star-formation, are restricted to lowmass systems(sigma_e &lt;= 100 k/ms or ~2x10^10 m_sol). spatially restricted casesof young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively belinked to the presence of star-formation in a thin, dusty disk/ring, also seenin the near-uv or mid-ir. the flattened components with disk-like kinematicspreviously identified in all fast rotators (krajnovi\'c et al.) are shown to beconnected to regions of distinct stellar populations. these range from theyoung, still star-forming circumnuclear disks and rings with increasedmetallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, toapparently old structures with extended disk-like kinematics, which areobserved to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [alpha/fe] ratiocompared to the main body of the galaxy. the slow rotators generally show nostellar population signatures over and above the well known metallicitygradients and are largely consistent with old (&gt;=10 gyr) stellar populations.

1007.2059	early-type galaxies in different environments: an hi view	we present an analysis of deep wsrt observations of the hi in 33 nearbyearly-type galaxies selected from a sample studied earlier at opticalwavelengths with the sauron integral-field spectrograph. the sample covers bothfield environments and the virgo cluster. our analysis shows that gas accretionplays a role in the evolution of field early-type galaxies, but less so forthose in clusters. for detection limits of a few times 10^6 msun, hi isdetected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies, while &lt;10% of the virgo objectsare detected. in about half of the detections, the hi forms a regularlyrotating disc or ring. all hi discs have counterparts of ionised gas and innerhi discs are also detected in molecular gas. the cold ism is dominated bymolecular gas (m_h2/m_hi ~ 10). we conclude that accretion of hi is common forfield early-type galaxies, but the amount of material involved is usuallysmall. cluster galaxies appear not to accrete hi. the few galaxies with asignificant young sub-population all have inner gas discs, but for theremaining galaxies there is no trend between stellar population and hi. someearly-type galaxies are very gas rich, but only have an old population. thestellar populations of field galaxies are typically younger than those invirgo. this is likely related to differences in accretion history. in about 50%of the galaxies we detect a central continuum source. in many objects thisemission is from a low-luminosity agn, in some it is consistent with theobserved star formation. galaxies with hi in the central regions are morelikely detected in continuum. this is due to a higher probability for starformation to occur in such galaxies and not to hi-related agn fuelling.(abridged)

1008.0005	the supermassive black hole in m84 revisited	the mass of the central black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy m84 haspreviously been measured by two groups using the same observations ofemission-line gas with the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) on thehubble space telescope, giving strongly discrepant results: bower et al. (1998)found m_bh = (1.5^{+1.1}_{-0.6}) x 10^9 m_sun, while maciejewski &amp; binney(2001) estimated m_bh = 4 x 10^8 m_sun. in order to resolve this discrepancy,we have performed new measurements of the gas kinematics in m84 from the samearchival data, and carried out comprehensive gas-dynamical modeling for theemission-line disk within ~70 pc from the nucleus. in comparison with the twoprevious studies of m84, our analysis includes a more complete treatment of thepropagation of emission-line profiles through the telescope and stis optics, aswell as inclusion of the effects of an intrinsic velocity dispersion in theemission-line disk. we find that an intrinsic velocity dispersion is needed inorder to match the observed line widths, and we calculate gas-dynamical modelsboth with and without a correction for asymmetric drift. including the effectof asymmetric drift improves the model fit to the observed velocity field. ourbest-fitting model with asymmetric drift gives m_bh = (8.5^{+0.9}_{-0.8}) x10^8 m_sun (68% confidence). this is a factor of ~2 smaller than the mass oftenadopted in studies of the m_bh - sigma and m_bh - l relationships. our resultprovides a firmer basis for the inclusion of m84 in the correlations betweenblack hole mass and host galaxy properties.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

0709.3015	observational evidence for agn feedback in early-type galaxies	a major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is theinclusion of so-called agn feedback. the energy input from an active centralmassive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxiesat later epochs. a major problem is that this process is poorly understood, andcompelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. insearch for signatures of agn feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 from the sdss database.key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterionthrough visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased againstrecent star formation and nuclear activity. the objects with emission (~20 percent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in thecolour-mass diagram. star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, whileearly-types with agn are located considerably closer to and almost on the redsequence. star formation-agn composites are found right between these twoextremes. we further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novelmethod that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-uv to near-ir andstellar absorption indices. we find that in those objects deviating from thered sequence star formation occurred several 100 myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. we identify an evolutionary sequence fromstar formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. this transition processlasts about 1 gyr, and the peak agn phase occurs roughly half a gyr after thestarburst. the most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressedby nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.

1104.2240	the planetary nebulae population in the central regions of m32: the  sauron view	extragalactic planetary nebulae (pne) are not only useful as distancesignposts or as tracers of the dark-matter content of their host galaxies, butconstitute also good indicators of the main properties of their parent stellarpopulations. yet, so far, the properties of pne in the optical regions ofgalaxies where stellar population gradients can be more extreme have remainedlargely unexplored, mainly because the detection of pne with narrow-bandimaging or slit-less spectroscopy is considerably hampered by a strong stellarbackground. integral-field spectroscopy (ifs) can overcome this limitation, andhere we present a study of the pn population in the nearby compact ellipticalm32. using sauron data taken with just two 10-minutes-long pointings we havedoubled the number of known pne within the effective radius of m32, detectingpne five times fainter than previously found in narrow-band images thatcollected nearly the same number of photons. furthermore, by carefullyaccounting for the incompleteness of our survey we could conclude, despitehaving only 15 sources, that the central pne population of m32 is consistentwith the generally adopted shape for the pne luminosity function and itstypical normalization observed in early-type galaxies. finally, owing to theproximity of m32 and to uv images taken with hst, we could identify the mostlikely candidates for the central star of a subset of our detected pne andconclude that these stars are affected by substantial amounts of circumstellardust extinction, a finding that could reconcile the intriguing discrepancypreviously reported in m32 between model predictions and observations for thelater stages of stellar evolution. considering the modest time investment on a4m-class telescope that delivered these results, this work illustrates thepotential of future ifs studies for the central pne population of early-typegalaxies.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1106.1896	improved and quality-assessed emission and absorption line measurements  in sloan digital sky survey galaxies	we present a new database of absorption and emission-line measurements basedon the entire spectral atlas from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) 7th datarelease of galaxies within a redshift of 0.2. our work makes use of thepublicly available penalized pixel-fitting(ppxf) and gas and absorption linefitting (gandalf) idl codes, aiming to improve the existing measurements forstellar kinematics, the strength of various absorption-line features, and theflux and width of the emissions from different species of ionised gas. our fitto the stellar continuum uses both standard stellar population models andempirical templates obtained by combining a large number of stellar spectra inorder to fit a subsample of high-quality sdss spectra for quiescent galaxies.furthermore, our fit to the nebular spectrum includes an exhaustive list ofboth recombination and forbidden lines. foreground galactic extinction isimplicitly treated in our models, whereas reddening in the sdss galaxies isincluded in the form of a simple dust screen component affecting the entirespectrum that is accompanied by a second reddening component affecting only theionised gas emission. in order to check for systematic departures, we provide aquality assessment for our fit to the sdss spectra in our sample. this qualityassessment also allows the identification of objects with either problematicdata or peculiar features. for example, based on the quality assessment,approximately 1% of the sdss spectra classified as "galaxies" by the sdsspipeline do in fact require additional broad lines to be matched, even thoughthey do not show a strong continuum from an active nucleus, as do the sdssobjects classified as "quasars". finally, we provide new spectral templates forgalaxies of different hubble types, obtained by combining the results of ourspectral fit for a subsample of 452 morphologically selected objects.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1107.5310	galaxy zoo: dust lane early-type galaxies are tracers of recent,  gas-rich minor mergers	we present the second of two papers concerning the origin and evolution oflocal early-type galaxies exhibiting dust features. we use optical and radiodata to examine the nature of active galactic nucleus (agn) activity in theseobjects, and compare these with a carefully constructed control sample. we findthat dust lane early-type galaxies are much more likely to host emission-lineagn than the control sample galaxies. moreover, there is a strong correlationbetween radio and emission-line agn activity in dust lane early-types, but notthe control sample. dust lane early-type galaxies show the same distribution ofagn properties in rich and poor environments, suggesting a similar triggeringmechanism. by contrast, this is not the case for early-types with no dustfeatures. these findings strongly suggest that dust lane early-type galaxiesare starburst systems formed in gas-rich mergers. further evidence in supportof this scenario is provided by enhanced star formation and black holeaccretion rates in these objects. dust lane early-types therefore represent anevolutionary stage between starbursting and quiescent galaxies. in theseobjects, the agn has already been triggered but has not as yet completelydestroyed the gas reservoir required for star formation.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1301.7184	a black-hole mass measurement from molecular gas kinematics in ngc4526	the masses of the supermassive black-holes found in galaxy bulges arecorrelated with a multitude of galaxy properties, leading to suggestions thatgalaxies and black-holes may evolve together. the number of reliably measuredblack-hole masses is small, and the number of methods for measuring them islimited, holding back attempts to understand this co-evolution. directlymeasuring black-hole masses is currently possible with stellar kinematics (inearly-type galaxies), ionised-gas kinematics (in some spiral and early-typegalaxies) and in rare objects which have central maser emission. here we reportthat by modelling the effect of a black-hole on the kinematics of molecular gasit is possible to fit interferometric observations of co emission and therebyaccurately estimate black hole masses. we study the dynamics of the gas in theearly-type galaxy ngc4526, and obtain a best fit which requires the presence ofa central dark-object of 4.5(+4.2-3.0)x10^8 msun (3 sigma confidence limit).with next generation mm-interferometers (e.g. alma) these observations could bereproduced in galaxies out to 75 megaparsecs in less the 5 hours of observingtime. the use of molecular gas as a kinematic tracer should thus allow one toestimate black-hole masses in hundreds of galaxies in the local universe, manymore than accessible with current techniques.

1304.7273	the m87 black hole mass from gas-dynamical models of space telescope  imaging spectrograph observations	the supermassive black hole of m87 is one of the most massive black holesknown and has been the subject of several stellar and gas-dynamical massmeasurements; however the most recent revision to the stellar-dynamical blackhole mass measurement is a factor of about two larger than the previousgas-dynamical determinations. here, we apply comprehensive gas-dynamical modelsthat include the propagation of emission-line profiles through the telescopeand spectrograph optics to new space telescope imaging spectrographobservations from the hubble space telescope. unlike the previous gas-dynamicalstudies of m87, we map out the complete kinematic structure of theemission-line disk within about 40 pc from the nucleus, and find that a smallamount of velocity dispersion internal to the gas disk is required to match theobserved line widths. we examine a scenario in which the intrinsic velocitydispersion provides dynamical support to the disk, and determine that theinferred black hole mass increases by only 6%. incorporating this effect intothe error budget, we ultimately measure a mass of m_bh = (3.5^{+0.9}_{-0.7}) x10^9 m_sun (68% confidence). our gas-dynamical black hole mass continues todiffer from the most recent stellar-dynamical mass by a factor of two,underscoring the need for carrying out more cross-checks between the two mainblack hole mass measurement methods.

(2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1402.4814	the green valley is a red herring: galaxy zoo reveals two evolutionary  pathways towards quenching of star formation in early- and late-type galaxies	we use sdss+\textit{galex}+galaxy zoo data to study the quenching of starformation in low-redshift galaxies. we show that the green valley between theblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxiesin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through whichmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. rather, an analysis that takesmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blueearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologiesare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.in contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation ratesdecline very slowly. we summarize a range of observations that lead to theseconclusions, including uv-optical colours and halo masses, which both show astriking dependence on morphological type. we interpret these results in termsof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. we conclude thatlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply ofgas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustionof the remaining gas over several gyr, driven by secular and/or environmentalprocesses. in contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gassupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapidquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.this gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, andmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly agnfeedback.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1510.06738	cold-gas outflows in typical low-redshift galaxies are driven by star  formation, not agn	energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) is an importantingredient for regulating the star-formation history of galaxies in models ofgalaxy formation, which makes it important to study how agn feedback actuallyoccurs in practice. in order to catch agns in the act of quenching starformation we have used the interstellar nad absorption lines to look forcold-gas outflows in a sample of 456 nearby galaxies for which we couldunambigously ascertain the presence of radio agn activity, thanks to radioimaging at milli-arcsecond scales. while compact radio emission indicating aradio agn was found in 103 galaxies (23% of the sample), and 23 objects (5%)exhibited nad absorption-line kinematics suggestive of cold-gas outflows, notone object showed evidence of a radio agn and of a cold-gas outflowsimultaneously. radio agn activity was found predominantly in early-typegalaxies, while cold-gas outflows were mainly seen in spiral galaxies withcentral star-formation or composite star-formation/agn activity. optical agnsalso do not seem capable of driving galactic winds in our sample. our work addsto a picture of the low-redshift universe where cold-gas outflows in massivegalaxies are generally driven by star formation and where radio-agn activityoccurs most often in systems in which the gas reservoir has already beensignificantly depleted.

0807.1505	the sauron project - xii. kinematic substructures in early-type  galaxies: evidence for disks in fast rotators	[abridged] we analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxiesobtained with the sauron and oasis integral-field spectrographs usingkinemetry, a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher order momentsof the line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd). in the sauron sample, wefind that 31% of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91% of themulti-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest havingthree. in addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. we find that the velocitymaps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in thetransition regions between kinematic subcomponents. in terms of e/s0classification, this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components withdisk-like kinematics. for the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axialratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary towhat is predicted with isotropic jeans models viewed at different inclinations.the position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly inslow rotators. velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similarto the distribution of light. we constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - v/sigmaand h4 - v/sigma diagrams from sauron observations. we confirm the classicalanti-correlation of h3 and v\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero insome objects or even weakly correlated with v/sigma. the distribution of h4 forfast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. the difference betweenslow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the losvd, withevidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likelydifferent evolutionary paths.

astro-ph;0004047	evidence for a black hole and accretion disk in the liner ngc 4203	we present spectroscopic observations from the hubble space telescope thatreveal for the first time the presence of a broad pedestal of balmer-lineemission in the liner galaxy ngc 4203. the emission-line profile is suggestiveof a relativistic accretion disk, and is reminiscent of double-peaked transientbalmer emission observed in a handful of other liners. the very broad lineemission thus constitutes clear qualitative evidence for a black hole, andspatially resolved narrow-line emission in ngc 4203 can be used to constrainits mass, with m_bh less than 6 x 10^6 solar masses at 99.7% confidence. thisvalue implies a ratio of black-hole mass to bulge mass of less thanapproximately 7 x 10^-4 in ngc 4203, which is less by a factor of ~3 - 9 thanthe mean ratio obtained for other galaxies. the availability of an independentconstraint on central black-hole mass makes ngc4203 an important testbed forprobing the physics of weak active galactic nuclei. assuming m_bh near thedetection limit, the ratio of observed luminosity to the eddington luminosityis approximately 10^-4. this value is consistent with advection-dominatedaccretion, and hence with scenarios in which an ion torus irradiates an outeraccretion disk that produces the observed double-peaked line emission.follow-up observations will make it possible to improve the black-hole massestimate and study variability in the nuclear emission.

0808.0914	hubble space telescope spectroscopic observations of the narrow-line  region in nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei	(abridged) we present stis observations of 14 nearby low-luminosity activegalactic nuclei, including 13 liners and 1 seyfert, taken at multiple parallelslit positions centered on the galaxy nuclei and covering the h-alpha spectralregion. for each galaxy, we measure the emission-line velocities, line widths,and strengths, to map out the inner narrow-line region structure. there is awide diversity among the velocity fields: in a few galaxies the gas is clearlyin disk-like rotation, while in other galaxies the gas kinematics appearchaotic or are dominated by radial flows with multiple velocity components. the[s ii] line ratio indicates a radial stratification in gas density, with asharp increase within the inner 10-20 pc, in the majority of the type 1objects. we examine how the [n ii] 6583 line width varies as a function ofaperture size over a range of spatial scales, extending from scales comparableto the black hole's sphere of influence to scales dominated by the hostgalaxy's bulge. for most galaxies in the sample, we find that the emission-linevelocity dispersion is largest within the black hole's gravitational sphere ofinfluence, and decreases with increasing aperture size toward values similar tothe bulge stellar velocity dispersion measured within ground-based apertures.future dynamical modeling in order to determine black hole masses for a fewobjects in this sample may be worthwhile, although disorganized motion willlimit the accuracy of the mass measurements.

astro-ph;0010240	supermassive black holes in bulges	we present spatially extended gas kinematics at parsec-scale resolution forthe nuclear regions of four nearby disk galaxies, and model them as rotation ofa gas disk in the joint potential of the stellar bulge and a putative centralblack hole. the targets were selected from a larger set of long-slit spectraobtained with the hubble space telescope as part of the survey of nearby nucleiwith stis (sunns). they represents the 4 galaxies (of 24) that displaysymmetric gas velocity curves consistent with a rotating disk. we derive thestellar mass distribution from the stis acquisition images adopting the stellarmass-to-light ratio normalized so as to match ground-based velocity dispersionmeasurements over a large aperture. subsequently, we constrain the mass of aputative black hole by matching the gas rotation curve, following two distinctapproaches. in the most general case we explore all the possible diskorientations, alternatively we constrain the gas disk orientation from thedust-lane morphology at similar radii. in the latter case the kinematic dataindicate the presence of a central black hole for three of the four objects,with masses of 10^7 - 10^8 solar masses, representing up to 0.025 % of the hostbulge mass. for one object (ngc2787) the kinematic data alone provide clearevidence for the presence of a central black hole even without externalconstraints on the disk orientation. these results illustrate directly the needto determine black-hole masses by differing methods for a large number ofobjects, demonstrate that the variance in black hole/bulge mass is much largerthan previously claimed, and reinforce the recent finding that the black-holemass is tightly correlated with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion.

0809.1096	destruction of molecular gas reservoirs in early-type galaxies by active  galactic nucleus feedback	residual star formation at late times in early-type galaxies and theirprogenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red,passively evolving systems we see today. likewise, residual or newly accretedreservoirs of molecular gas that are fuelling star formation must be destroyed.this suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonlyattributed to agn feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelledduring a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. however,direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of thismolecular gas and an agn phase has been missing so far. we present newmm-wavelength observations from the iram 30m telescope of a sample of lowredshift sdss early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process ofquenching of late-time star formation. our observations show that thedisappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 myr with theonset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to starformation alone. since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerfulquasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity agn episodes aresufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. this`suppression mode' of agn feedback is very different from the `truncation mode'linked to powerful quasar activity during early phases of galaxy formation.
