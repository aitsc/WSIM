(ii) the mainknots k1, k2 and k3 -of this hypergiant shell s3- show a stellar population andemission line ratios associated with the presence of a starburst + of/shocks.(iii) the internal shells s1 and s2 show structures, of components andproperties very similar to those detected in the nuclear shells of mrk 231.(iv) the shells s1+s2 and s3 are aligned at pa = 131: i.e. suggesting that theof process is in the blow-out phase with bipolar structure. in addition, theshells s4 and s5 (at 80-100 kpc scale) are aligned at pa = 40, i.e.: a bipolarof perpendicular to the internal of. finally, the generation of uhe cosmic raysand neutrino/ dark-matter -associated with hyne in bal + ir + fe ii qsos- isdiscussed.

0903.3988	bright strongly lensed galaxies at redshift z~ 6-7 behind the clusters  abell 1703 and cl0024+161	we report on the discovery of three bright, strongly-lensed objects behindabell 1703 and cl0024+16 from a dropout search over 25 square arcminutes ofdeep nicmos data, with deep acs optical coverage. they are undetected in thedeep acs images below 8500 a and have clear detections in the j and h bands.fits to the acs, nicmos and irac data yield robust photometric redshifts in therange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshiftinterlopers. all three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of brightknots. the bright i-band dropout in abell 1703 has an h-band ab magnitude of23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z&gt;5.5. ourmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with amass of ~ 1e10 solar mass. the dropout galaxy candidates behind cl0024+16 areseparated by 2.5" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have h-band ab magnitudesof 25.0 and 25.6. lensing models of cl0024+16 suggest that the objects havecomparable intrinsic magnitudes of ab ~ 27.3, approximately one magnitudefainter than l* at z~6.5. their similar redshifts, spectral energydistribution, and luminosities, coupled with their very close proximity on thesky, suggest that they are spatially associated, and plausibly are physicallybound. combining this sample with two previously reported, similarly magnifiedgalaxy candidates at z~6-8, we find that complex systems with dual nuclei maybe a common feature of high-redshift galaxies.

0906.2244	statistical studies of optically dark gamma-ray bursts in the swift era	we compare the properties of optically dark grbs, defined by theoptical-to-x-ray spectral index beta_ox&lt;0.5, and normal ones discovered by theswift satellite before the year 2008 in a statistical way, using data collectedfrom the literature and online databases. our sample include 200 long bursts,19 short bursts, and 10 with measured high redshifts (z&gt;=4). the ratio of darkbursts is found to be about 10-20%, and is similar between long bursts, shortones, and the high-z sub-sample. the result for long bursts is consistent withboth the pre-swift sample and studies by other authors on smaller swiftsamples. the existence of dark short grbs is pointed out for the first time.the x-ray derived hydrogen column densities of dark grbs clearly prefer largevalues compared with those of normal bursts. this supports the dust extinctionscenario as the main cause of dark grbs. other possibilities like very highredshifts and non-standard emission mechanisms are less likely although notfully excluded.

0909.1082	stellar masses of lyman break galaxies, lyman alpha emitters and radio  galaxies in overdense regions at z=4-6	we present new information on galaxies in the vicinity of luminous radiogalaxies and quasars at z=4,5,6. these fields were previously found to containoverdensities of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) or spectroscopic lyman alphaemitters. we use hst and spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast ourresults with large samples of lbgs in more average environments as probed bythe great observatories origins deep survey (goods). the following results wereobtained. first, lbgs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lieon a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.this is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[m*/msun] = 9-11) inwhich galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their starformation rate (sfr) increases. second, the two radio galaxies are among themost massive objects (log[m*/msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and areextremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimatedfrom the ~25x larger area goods survey. we suggest that the presence of thesemassive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapidaccretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. third, the total stellarmass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' tn1338 accounts for &lt;30% of the stellarmass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z&gt;4, based on acomparison with the massive x-ray cluster cl1252 at z=1.2. although futurenear-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies arecurrently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference isthat tn1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than cl1252. this raises theinteresting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z&gt;4remain yet to be discovered.

0912.5435	the x-ray asynchronous optical afterglow of grb 060912a and tentative  evidence of a 2175-a host dust extinction feature	we present optical photometry of the grb 060912a afterglow obtained withground-based telescopes, from about 100 sec after the grb trigger till about0.3 day later, supplemented with the swift optical afterglow data released inits official website. the optical light curve (lc) displays a smooth singlepower-law decay throughout the observed epochs, with a power-law index of about-1 and no significant color evolution. this is in contrast to the x-ray lcwhich has a plateau phase between two normal power-law decays of a respectiveindex of about -1 and -1.2. it is shown by our combined x-ray and optical dataanalysis that this asynchronous behavior is difficult to be reconciled with thestandard afterglow theory and energy injection hypothesis. we also construct anoptical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution at about 700 sec after the grbtrigger. it displays a significant flux depression in the b-band, reminding usof the possibility of a host-galaxy (at z=0.937) 2175-a dust absorption similarto the one that characterizes the milky way extinction law. such anidentification, although being tentative, may be confirmed by our detailedanalysis using both template extinction laws and the afterglow theory. so farthe feature is reported in very few grb afterglows. most seem to have a hostgalaxy either unusually bright for a grb, just like this one, or of an earlytype, supporting the general suggestion of an anti-correlation between thefeature and star-forming activities.

1002.0581	grb 081008: from burst to afterglow and the transition phase in between	we present a multi-wavelength study of grb 081008, at redshift 1.967, byswift, rotse-iii and grond. compared to other swift grbs, grb 081008 has atypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during theprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. theearly x-ray emission seen by the swift/xrt was dominated by the softening tailof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after theswift/bat detections. optical observations that started shortly after the firstactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. we interpretthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the earlyburst activities. a second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-raypulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve andthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. wesuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injectioninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch ofburst activities. these early observations thus provide a potential probe forthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. the later lightcurve of grb081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and x-ray. thetemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral breakwithin optical. however, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.we discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

1003.1789	ngc 2992 in an x-ray high state observed by xmm: response of the  relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line to the continuum	we present the analysis of an xmm observation of the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992.the source was found in its highest level of x-ray activity yet detected, afactor $\sim 23.5$ higher in 2--10 kev flux than the historical minimum. ngc2992 is known to exhibit x-ray flaring activity on timescales of days to weeks,and the xmm data provide at least factor of $\sim 3$ better spectral resolutionin the fe k band than any previously measured flaring x-ray state. we find thatthere is a broad feature in the \sim 5-7 kev band which could be interpreted asa relativistic fe k$\alpha$ emission line. its flux appears to have increasedin tandem with the 2--10 kev continuum when compared to a previous suzakuobservation when the continuum was a factor of $\sim 8$ lower than that duringthe xmm observation. the xmm data are consistent with the general picture thatincreased x-ray activity and corresponding changes in the fe k$\alpha$ lineemission occur in the innermost regions of the putative accretion disk. thisbehavior contrasts with the behavior of other agn in which the fe k$\alpha$line does not respond to variability in the x-ray.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1010.1436	searching for needles in haystacks - looking for grb gamma-rays with the  fermi/lat detector	since the launch of the fermi gamma-ray space telescope on june 11, 2008, 55gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been observed at coordinates that fall within66^\circ of the fermi large area telescope (lat) boresight with preciselocalizations provided by the nasa swift mission or other satellites. imposingselection cuts to exclude low galactic latitudes and high zenith angles reducesthe sample size to 41. using matched filter techniques, the fermi/lat photondata for these fields have been examined for evidence of bursts that have sofar evaded detection at energies above 100 mev. following comparisons withsimilar random background fields, two events, grb 080905a and grb 091208b,stand out as excellent candidates for such an identification. after excludingthe six bright bursts previously reported by the lat team, the remaining 35events exhibit an excess of lat "diffuse" photons with a statisticalsignificance greater than 2 sigma, independent of the matched filter analysis.after accounting for the total number of photons in the well-localized fieldsand including estimates of detection efficiency, one concludes that somewherein the range of 11% to 19% of all grbs within the lat field of view illuminatethe detector with two or more energetic photons. these are the most stringentestimates of the high energy photon content of grbs to date. the two new eventsassociated with high energy photon emission have similar ratios of high to lowenergy fluences as observed previously. this separates them from bursts withsimilar low energy fluences by a factor of ten, suggesting a distinct class ofevents rather than a smooth continuum.

1101.4199	transverse momentum dependent parton distribution/fragmentation  functions at an electron-ion collider	we present a summary of a recent workshop held at duke university on partonictransverse momentum in hadrons: quark spin-orbit correlations and quark-gluoninteractions. the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions(tmds), parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions, and multi-parton correlationfunctions, were discussed extensively at the duke workshop. in this paper, wesummarize first the theoretical issues concerning the study of partonicstructure of hadrons at a future electron-ion collider (eic) with emphasis onthe tmds. we then present simulation results on experimental studies of tmdsthrough measurements of single spin asymmetries (ssa) from semi-inclusivedeep-inelastic scattering (sidis) processes with an eic, and discuss therequirement of the detector for sidis measurements. the dynamics of partoncorrelations in the nucleon is further explored via a study of ssa in d (`d)production at large transverse momenta with the aim of accessing the unexploredtri-gluon correlation functions. the workshop participants identified the ssameasurements in sidis as a golden program to study tmds in both the sea andvalence quark regions and to study the role of gluons, with the siversasymmetry measurements as examples. such measurements will lead to majoradvancement in our understanding of tmds in the valence quark region, and moreimportantly also allow for the investigation of tmds in the sea quark regionalong with a study of their evolution.

1111.0283	panchromatic observations of the textbook grb 110205a: constraining  physical mechanisms of prompt emission and afterglow	we present a comprehensive analysis of a bright, long duration (t90 ~ 257 s)grb 110205a at redshift z= 2.22. the optical prompt emission was detected byswift/uvot, rotse-iiib and bootes telescopes when the grb was still radiatingin the gamma-ray band. nearly 200 s of observations were obtainedsimultaneously from optical, x-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of theexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6orders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. by fitting thetime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, aninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard grbsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. although the promptoptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit x/gamma-rayspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation tothe prompt high energy emission. the synchrotron + ssc scenario is disfavoredby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having twoemission regions can interpret the data well. shortly after prompt emission (~1100 s), a bright (r = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.it is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component hasbeen closely observed. the full optical and x-ray afterglow lightcurves can beinterpreted within the standard reverse shock (rs) + forward shock (fs) model.in general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us toapply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information aboutthe grb including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission r, initiallorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as thecollimation angle and the total energy budget.

1211.2230	a census of star-forming galaxies in the z~9-10 universe based on  hst+spitzer observations over 19 clash clusters: three candidate z~9-10  galaxies and improved constraints on the star formation rate density at z~9	we utilise a two-color lyman-break selection criterion to search for z~9-10galaxies over the first 19 clusters in the clash program. a systematic searchyields three z~9-10 candidates. while we have already reported the most robustof these candidates, macs1149-jd, two additional z~9 candidates are also foundand have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. a careful assessment of varioussources of contamination suggests &lt;~1 contaminants for our z~9-10 selection. todetermine the implications of these search results for the lf and sfr densityat z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantitiesin lensing fields. our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing thenumber of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in clash with the number of galaxiesin a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences inselection volumes), here taken to be z~8. this procedure takes advantage of thefact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selectionsbehind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensingmodels. we find that the normalization of the uv lf at z~9 is just0.28_{-0.20}^{+0.39}\times that at z~8, ~1.4_{-0.8}^{+3.0}x lower thanextrapolating z~4-8 lf results. while consistent with the evolution in the uvlf seen at z~4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z&gt;8.compared to similar evolutionary findings from the hudf, our result is lessinsensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independentsightlines on the high-redshift universe.

1211.2797	clash: the enhanced lensing efficiency of the highly elongated merging  cluster macs j0416.1-2403	we perform a strong-lensing analysis of the merging galaxy cluster macsj0416.1-2403 (m0416; z=0.42) in recent clash/hst observations. we identify 70new multiple images and candidates of 23 background sources in the range0.7&lt;z_{phot}&lt;6.14 including two probable high-redshift dropouts, revealing ahighly elongated lens with axis ratio ~5:1, and a major axis of ~100\arcsec(z_{s}~2). compared to other well-studied clusters, m0416 shows an enhancedlensing efficiency. although the critical area is not particularly large (~0.6\square\arcmin; z_{s}~2), the number of multiple images, per critical area, isanomalously high. we calculate that the observed elongation boosts the numberof multiple images, \emph{per critical area}, by a factor of ~2.5\times, due tothe increased ratio of the caustic area relative to the critical area.additionally, we find that the observed separation between the two main masscomponents enlarges the critical area by a factor of ~2. these geometricaleffects can account for the high number (density) of multiple images observed.we find in numerical simulations, that only ~4% of the clusters (with m_{vir}&gt;6x 10^{14} h^{-1}m_{\odot}) exhibit as elongated critical curves as m0416.

1211.6713	large-scale image processing with the rotse pipeline for follow-up of  gravitational wave events	electromagnetic (em) observations of gravitational-wave (gw) sources wouldbring unique insights into a source which are not available from either channelalone. however em follow-up of gw events presents new challenges. gw eventswill have large sky error regions, on the order of 10-100 square degrees, whichcan be made up of many disjoint patches. when searching such large areas thereis potential contamination by em transients unrelated to the gw event.furthermore, the characteristics of possible em counterparts to gw events arealso uncertain. it is therefore desirable to be able to assess the statisticalsignificance of a candidate em counterpart, which can only be done byperforming background studies of large data sets. current image processingpipelines such as that used by rotse are not usually optimised for large-scaleprocessing. we have automated the rotse image analysis, and supplemented itwith a post-processing unit for candidate validation and classification. wealso propose a simple ad hoc statistic for ranking candidates as more likely tobe associated with the gw trigger. we demonstrate the performance of theautomated pipeline and ranking statistic using archival rotse data. emcandidates from a randomly selected set of images are compared to a backgroundestimated from the analysis of 102 additional sets of archival images. thepipeline's detection efficiency is computed empirically by re-analysis of theimages after adding simulated optical transients that follow typical lightcurves for gamma-ray burst afterglows and kilonovae. we show that the automatedpipeline rejects most background events and is sensitive to simulatedtransients to limiting magnitudes consistent with the limiting magnitude of theimages.

1305.3676	a frequency determination method for digitized nmr signals	we present a high precision frequency determination method for digitized nmrfid signals. the method employs high precision numerical integration ratherthan simple summation as in many other techniques. with no independentknowledge of the other parameters of a nmr fid signal (phase $\phi$, amplitude$a$, and transverse relaxation time $t_{2}$) this method can determine thesignal frequency $f_{0}$ with a precision of $1/(8\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}t_{2}^{2})$if the observation time $t$ is long enough. the method is especially convenientwhen the detailed shape of the observed ft nmr spectrum is not well defined.when $t_{2}$ is $+\infty$ and the signal becomes pure sinusoidal, the precisionof the method is $3/(2\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}t^{2})$ which is one order more precisethan a typical frequency counter. analysis of this method shows that theintegration reduces the noise by bandwidth narrowing as in a lock-in amplifier,and no extra signal filters are needed. for a pure sinusoidal signal we findfrom numerical simulations that the noise-induced error in this method reachesthe cramer-rao lower band(crlb) on frequency determination. for the dampedsinusoidal case of most interest, the noise-induced error is found to be withina factor of 2 of crlb when the measurement time $t$ is a few times larger than$t_{2}$.we discuss possible improvements for the precision of this method.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

(2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band hst photometry acquired aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). obtainedas part of the clash-vlt survey, the vimos medium-resolution spectra of thissource show a very faint continuum between ~8700a and ~9300a and a prominentemission line at 8643a, which can be readily identified with lyman-alpha atz=6.110. the emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a morepronounced red wing. the rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ew=79+-10a.after correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (sfr) estimatedfrom the lya line is sfr(lya)=11 m_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the uv datais sfr(uv)=3 m_{sol}/yr. we estimate that the effective radius of the source isr_e&lt;~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density sigma_{sfr}&gt;6m_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the kennicutt-schmidt relation, a gas surface massdensity sigma_{gas}&gt;10^3 m_{sol}/pc^2. our results support the idea that thismagnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 l^* at z=6,with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. future follow-up observationswith alma will provide valuable insight into the sfr and molecular gas contentof this source. in the spirit of the frontier fields initiative, we alsopublish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other backgroundobjects which will help improving the strong lensing model of this galaxycluster.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

1405.3677	extensive hst ultraviolet spectra and multi-wavelength observations of  sn 2014j in m82 indicate reddening and circumstellar scattering by typical  dust	sn 2014j in m82 is the closest detected type ia supernova (sn ia) in at least28 years and perhaps in 410 years. despite its small distance of 3.3 mpc, sn2014j is surprisingly faint, peaking at v = 10.6 mag, and assuming a typical snia luminosity, we infer an observed visual extinction of a_v = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mag.but this picture, with r_v = 1.6 +/- 0.2, is too simple to account for allobservations. we combine 10 epochs (spanning a month) of hst/stis ultravioletthrough near-infrared spectroscopy with hst/wfc3, kait, and fancam photometryfrom the optical to the infrared and 9 epochs of high-resolution tresspectroscopy to investigate the sources of extinction and reddening for sn2014j. we argue that the wide range of observed properties for sn 2014j iscaused by a combination of dust reddening, likely originating in theinterstellar medium of m82, and scattering off circumstellar material. for thismodel, roughly half of the extinction is caused by reddening from typical dust(e(b-v ) = 0.45 mag and r_v = 2.6) and roughly half by scattering off lmc-likedust in the circumstellar environment of sn 2014j.

1503.06741	characteristics of he ii proximity profiles	the proximity profile in the spectra of z~3 quasars, where fluxes extendblueward of the he ii lya wavelength 304 (1+z) a, is one of the most importantspectral features in the study of the intergalactic medium. based on the hstspectra of 24 he ii quasars, we find that the majority of them display aproximity profile, corresponding to an ionization radius as large as 20 mpc inthe source's rest frame. in comparison with those in the h i spectra of thequasars at z~6, the he ii proximity effect is more prominent and is observedover a considerably longer period of reionization. the he ii proximity zonesizes decrease at higher redshifts, particularly at z &gt; 3.3. this trend issimilar to that for h i, signaling an onset of he ii reionization at z~4.  for quasar sdss1253+6817 (z=3.48), the he ii absorption trough displays agradual decline and serves a good case for modeling the he ii reionization. tomodel such a broad profile requires a quasar radiation field whose distributionbetween 4 and 1 rydberg is considerably harder than normally assumed. the uvcontinuum of this quasar is indeed exceptionally steep, and the he iiionization level in the quasar vicinity is higher than the average level in theintergalactic medium. these results are evidence that a very hard euv continuumfrom this quasar produces a large ionized zone around it.  distinct exceptions are the two brightest he ii quasars at z~2.8, for whichno significant proximity profile is present, possibly implying that they areyoung.

1508.01180	optical and x-ray early follow-up of antares neutrino alerts	high-energy neutrinos could be produced in the interaction of charged cosmicrays with matter or radiation surrounding astrophysical sources. even with therecent detection of extraterrestrial high-energy neutrinos by the icecubeexperiment, no astrophysical neutrino source has yet been discovered. transientsources, such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, or active galacticnuclei are promising candidates. multi-messenger programs offer a uniqueopportunity to detect these transient sources. by combining the informationprovided by the antares neutrino telescope with information coming from otherobservatories, the probability of detecting a source is enhanced, allowing thepossibility of identifying a neutrino progenitor from a single detected event.a method based on optical and x-ray follow-ups of high-energy neutrino alertshas been developed within the antares collaboration. this program, denoted astatoo, triggers a network of robotic optical telescopes (tarot and rotse) andthe swift-xrt with a delay of only a few seconds after a neutrino detection,and is therefore well-suited to search for fast transient sources. to identifyan optical or x-ray counterpart to a neutrino signal, the images provided bythe follow-up observations are analysed with dedicated pipelines. a total of 42alerts with optical and 7 alerts with x-ray images taken with a maximum delayof 24 hours after the neutrino trigger have been analysed. no optical or x-raycounterparts associated to the neutrino triggers have been found, and upperlimits on transient source magnitudes have been derived. the probability toreject the gamma-ray burst origin hypothesis has been computed for each alert.

astro-ph;0112184	chandra deep field south: the 1msec catalog	in this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposureof the chandra deep field south (cdfs), using acis-i on the chandra x-rayobservatory. catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two differentmethods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the sextractoralgorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for chandraobservations. the detection threshold has been set in order to have less than10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. we subdivided thecatalog into four sections. the primary list consists of objects common to thetwo detection methods. two secondary lists contain sources which were detectedby: 1) the sextractor algorithm alone and 2) the wavelet technique alone. thefourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. the flux limitsat the aimpoint for the soft (0.5--2 kev) and hard (2--10 kev) bands are5.5e-17 erg/s/cm^2 and 4.5e-16 erg/s/cm^2 respectively. the total number ofsources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5--2 kev band, and 251in the 2--10 kev band.  we also present optical identifications for the catalogued sources. ourprimary optical data is r band imaging to a depth of r~26.5 (vega). we foundthat the r-band/chandra offsets are small, ~1 arcsec. coordinatecross-correlation finds 85% of the chandra sources covered in r to havecounterparts within the 3-sigma error box (&gt;~1.5 arcsec depending on off-axisangle and signal-to-noise). the unidentified fraction of sources, approximately~10--15 %, is close to the limit expected from the observed x-ray flux tor-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0312427	a gravitationally lensed quasar with quadruple images separated by 14.62  arcseconds	gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution ofdark matter in the universe. the cold-dark-matter model of the formation oflarge-scale structures predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensedby concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would besplit by over 7 arcsec. numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasarshave, however, been unsuccessful. all of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known,including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that canbe explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter.although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known,quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of theresulting lens systems. here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, sdssj1004+4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominatedby dark matter. our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectationsbased on the cold-dark-matter model.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.
