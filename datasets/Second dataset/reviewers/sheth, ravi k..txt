0905.1706	the initial shear field in models with primordial local non-gaussianity  and implications for halo and void abundances	we generalize doroshkevich's celebrated formulae for the eigenvalues of theinitial shear field associated with gaussian statistics to the localnon-gaussian f_{nl} model. this is possible because, to at least second orderin f_{nl}, distributions at fixed overdensity are unchanged from the casef_{nl}=0. we use this generalization to estimate the effect of f_{nl}\ne 0 onthe abundance of virialized halos. halo abundances are expected to be relatedto the probability that a certain quantity in the initial fluctuation fieldexceeds a threshold value, and we study two choices for this variable: it caneither be the sum of the eigenvalues of the initial deformation tensor (theinitial overdensity), or its smallest eigenvalue. the approach based on acritical overdensity yields results which are in excellent agreement withnumerical measurements. we then use these same methods to developapproximations describing the sensitivity of void abundances on f_{nl}. while apositive f_{nl} produces more extremely massive halos, it makes fewer extremelylarge voids. its effect thus is qualitatively different from a simple rescalingof the normalisation of the density fluctuation field \sigma_8. therefore, voidabundances furnish complementary information to cluster abundances, and a jointcomparison of both might provide interesting constraints on primordialnon-gaussianity.

0906.0424	reconstructing galaxy fundamental distributions and scaling relations  from photometric redshift surveys. applications to the sdss early-type sample	noisy distance estimates associated with photometric rather thanspectroscopic redshifts lead to a mis-estimate of the luminosities, and producea correlated mis-estimate of the sizes. we consider a sample of early-typegalaxies from the sdss dr6 for which both spectroscopic and photometricinformation is available, and apply the generalization of the v_max method tocorrect for these biases. we show that our technique recovers the trueredshift, magnitude and size distributions, as well as the true size-luminosityrelation. we find that using only 10% of the spectroscopic information randomlyspaced in our catalog is sufficient for the reconstructions to be accuratewithin about 3%, when the photometric redshift error is dz = 0.038. we thenaddress the problem of extending our method to deep redshift catalogs, whereonly photometric information is available. in addition to the specificapplications outlined here, our technique impacts a broader range of studies,when at least one distance-dependent quantity is involved. it is particularlyrelevant for the next generation of surveys, some of which will only havephotometric information.

0906.2190	non-gaussian distribution and clustering of hot and cold pixels in the  wmap five-year sky	we present measurements of the clustering of hot and cold patches in themicrowave background sky as measured from the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) five-year data. these measurements are compared with theoreticalpredictions which assume that the cosmological signal obeys gaussianstatistics. we find significant differences from the simplest gaussian-basedprediction. however, the measurements are sensitive to the fact that the noiseis spatially inhomogeneous (e.g., because different parts of the sky wereobserved for different lengths of time). we show how to account for thisspatial inhomogeneity when making predictions. differences from thegaussian-based expectation remain even after this more careful accounting ofthe noise. in particular, we note that hot and cold pixels cluster differentlywithin the same temperature thresholds at few-degree scales. while thesefindings may indicate primordial non-gaussianity, we discuss other plausibleexplanations for these discrepancies. in addition, we find some deviations fromgaussianity at sub-degree scales, especially in the w band, whose origin may beassociated with extragalactic dust emission.

0909.4544	redshift space correlations and scale-dependent stochastic biasing of  density peaks	we calculate the redshift space correlation function and the power spectrumof density peaks of a gaussian random field. in the linear regime k &lt; 0.1h/mpc, the redshift space power spectrum is  p^s_{pk}(k,u) = exp(-f^2 s_{vel}^2 k^2 u^2) * [b_{pk}(k) + b_{vel}(k) fu^2]^2 * p_m(k), where u is the angle with respect to the line of sight,s_{vel} is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion, f is the growth rate, andb_{pk}(k) and b_{vel}(k) are k-dependent linear spatial and velocity biasfactors. for peaks, the value of s_{vel} depends upon the functional form ofb_{vel}. the peaks model is remarkable because it has unbiased velocities --peak motions are driven by dark matter flows -- but, in order to achieve this,b_{vel} is k-dependent. we speculate that this is true in general: k-dependenceof the spatial bias will lead to k-dependence of b_{vel} even if the biasedtracers flow with the dark matter. because of the k-dependence of the linearbias parameters, standard manipulations applied to the peak model will lead tok-dependent estimates of the growth factor that could erroneously beinterpreted as a signature of modified dark energy or gravity. we use thefisher formalism to show that the constraint on the growth rate f is degradedby a factor of two if one allows for a k-dependent velocity bias of the peaktype. we discuss a simple estimate of nonlinear evolution and illustrate theeffect of the peak bias on the redshift space multipoles. for k &lt; 0.1 h/mpc,the peak bias is deterministic but k-dependent, so the configuration space biasis stochastic and scale dependent, both in real and redshift space. we provideexpressions for this stochasticity and its evolution (abridged).

0911.0436	the substructure hierarchy in dark matter haloes	we present a new algorithm for identifying the substructure within simulateddark matter haloes. the method is an extension of that proposed by tormen etal. (2004) and giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group ofself-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of thehost halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite).however, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellitehaloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise tosub-subhaloes, etc. our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels ofthis hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of allsubstructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). on average, haloeswhich formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructureand to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. we providequantitative fits to these correlations. even though our algorithm is verydifferent from that of gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo massfunction per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. this universalityextends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of agiven mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration andsubstructure abundance are anti-correlated. this universality allows a simpleparametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halomasses, at any given time. we provide analytic fits to this function whichshould be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halosubstructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. finally, wediscuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise fromdifferent definitions of (host) halo mass.

0912.0012	sizes and ages of sdss ellipticals: comparison with hierarchical galaxy  formation models	in a sample of about 45,700 early-type galaxies extracted from sdss, we findthat the shape, normalization, and dispersion around the mean size-stellar massrelation is the same for young and old systems, provided the stellar mass isgreater than 3*10^10 msun. this is difficult to reproduce in pure passiveevolution models, which generically predict older galaxies to be much morecompact than younger ones of the same stellar mass. however, this aspect of ourmeasurements is well reproduced by hierarchical models of galaxy formation.whereas the models predict more compact galaxies at high redshifts, subsequentminor, dry mergers increase the sizes of the more massive objects, resulting ina flat size-age relation at the present time. at lower masses, the modelspredict that mergers are less frequent, so that the expected anti-correlationbetween age and size is not completely erased. this is in good agreement withour data: below 3*10^10 msun, the effective radius r_e is a factor of ~2 lowerfor older galaxies. these successes of the models are offset by the fact thatthe predicted sizes have other serious problems, which we discuss.

0707.3218	satellite luminosities in galaxy groups	halo model interpretations of the luminosity dependence of galaxy clusteringassume that there is a central galaxy in every sufficiently massive halo, andthat this central galaxy is very different from all the others in the halo. thehalo model decomposition makes the remarkable prediction that the meanluminosity of the non-central galaxies in a halo should be almost independentof halo mass: the predicted increase is about 20% while the halo mass increasesby a factor of more than 20. in contrast, the luminosity of the central objectis predicted to increase approximately linearly with halo mass at low tointermediate masses, and logarithmically at high masses. we show that thisweak, almost non-existent mass-dependence of the satellites is in excellentagreement with the satellite population in group catalogs constructed by twodifferent collaborations. this is remarkable, because the halo model predictionwas made without ever identifying groups and clusters. the halo model alsopredicts that the number of satellites in a halo is drawn from a poissondistribution with mean which depends on halo mass. this, combined with the weakdependence of satellite luminosity on halo mass, suggests that the scotteffect, such that the luminosities of very bright galaxies are merely thestatistically extreme values of a general luminosity distribution, may betterapply to the most luminous satellite galaxy in a halo than to bcgs. if galaxiesare identified with halo substructure at the present time, then centralgalaxies should be about 4 times more massive than satellite galaxies of thesame luminosity, whereas the differences between the stellar m/l ratios shouldbe smaller. therefore, a comparison of the weak lensing signal from central andsatellite galaxies should provide useful constraints.

1007.3500	optimal linear reconstruction of dark matter from halo catalogs	we derive the weight function w(m) to apply to dark-matter halos thatminimizes the stochasticity between the weighted halo distribution and itsunderlying mass density field. the optimal w(m) depends on the range of massesbeing used in the estimator. in n-body simulations, the poisson estimator is upto 15 times noisier than the optimal. implementation of the optimal weightyields significantly lower stochasticity than weighting halos by their mass,bias or equal. optimal weighting could make cosmological tests based on thematter power spectrum or cross-correlations much more powerful and/orcost-effective. a volume-limited measurement of the mass power spectrum atk=0.2h/mpc over the entire z&lt;1 universe could ideally be done using only 6million redshifts of halos with mass m&gt;6\times10^{13}h^{-1}m_\odot(1\times10^{13}) at z=0 (z=1); this is 5 times fewer than the poisson modelpredicts. using halo occupancy distributions (hod) we find thatuniformly-weighted catalogs of luminous red galaxies require &gt;3 times moreredshifts than an optimally-weighted halo catalog to reconstruct the mass tothe same accuracy. while the mean hods of galaxies above a threshold luminosityare similar to the optimal w(m), the stochasticity of the halo occupationdegrades the mass estimator. blue or emission-line galaxies are about 100 timesless efficient at reconstructing mass than an optimal weighting scheme. thissuggests an efficient observational approach of identifying and weighting haloswith a deep photo-z survey before conducting a spectroscopic survey. theoptimal w(m) and mass-estimator stochasticity predicted by the standard halomodel for m&gt;10^{12}h^{-1}m_\odot are in reasonable agreement with ourmeasurements, with the important exceptions that the halos must be assumed tobe linearly biased samples of a "halo field" that is distinct from the massfield.

1009.3449	modeling scale-dependent bias on the baryonic acoustic scale with the  statistics of peaks of gaussian random fields	models of galaxy and halo clustering commonly assume that the tracers can betreated as a continuous field locally biased with respect to the underlyingmass distribution. in the peak model pioneered by bbks, one considers insteaddensity maxima of the initial, gaussian mass density field as an approximationto the formation site of virialized objects. in this paper, the peak model isextended in two ways to improve its predictive accuracy. firstly, we derive thetwo-point correlation function of initial density peaks up to second order anddemonstrate that a peak-background split approach can be applied to obtain thek-independent and k-dependent peak bias factors at all orders. secondly, weexplore the gravitational evolution of the peak correlation function within thezel'dovich approximation. we show that the local (lagrangian) bias approachemerges as a special case of the peak model, in which all bias parameters arescale-independent and there is no statistical velocity bias. we apply ourformulae to study how the lagrangian peak biasing, the diffusion due to largescale flows and the mode-coupling due to nonlocal interactions affect the scaledependence of bias from small separations up to the baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) scale. for 2-sigma density peaks collapsing at z=0.3, our model predictsa ~ 5% residual scale-dependent bias around the acoustic scale that arisesmostly from first-order lagrangian peak biasing (as opposed to second-ordergravity mode-coupling). we also search for a scale dependence of bias in thelarge scale auto-correlation of massive halos extracted from a very largen-body simulation provided by the mice collaboration. for halos with massm&gt;10^{14}msun/h, our measurements demonstrate a scale-dependent bias across thebao feature which is very well reproduced by a prediction based on the peakmodel.

1010.2839	modelling the shapes of the largest gravitationally bound objects	we combine the physics of the ellipsoidal collapse model with the excursionset theory to study the shapes of dark matter halos. in particular, we developan analytic approximation to the nonlinear evolution that is more accurate thanthe zeldovich approximation; we introduce a planar representation of halo axisratios, which allows a concise and intuitive description of the dynamics ofcollapsing regions and allows one to relate the final shape of a halo to itsinitial shape; we provide simple physical explanations for some empiricalfitting formulae obtained from numerical studies. comparison with simulationsis challenging, as there is no agreement about how to define a non-sphericalgravitationally bound object. nevertheless, we find that our model matches theconditional minor-to-intermediate axis ratio distribution rather well, althoughit disagrees with the numerical results in reproducing the minor-to-major axisratio distribution. in particular, the mass dependence of the minor-to-majoraxis distribution appears to be the opposite to what is found in many previousnumerical studies, where low-mass halos are preferentially more spherical thanhigh-mass halos. in our model, the high-mass halos are predicted to be morespherical, consistent with results based on a more recent and elaborate halofinding algorithm, and with observations of the mass dependence of the shapesof early-type galaxies. we suggest that some of the disagreement with someprevious numerical studies may be alleviated if we consider only isolatedhalos.

1105.1990	halo abundances and counts-in-cells: the excursion set approach with  correlated steps	the excursion set approach has been used to make predictions for a number ofinteresting quantities in studies of nonlinear hierarchical clustering. theseinclude the halo mass function, halo merger rates, halo formation times andmasses, halo clustering, analogous quantities for voids, and the distributionof dark matter counts in randomly placed cells. the approach assumes that allthese quantities can be mapped to problems involving the first crossingdistribution of a suitably chosen barrier by random walks. most analyticexpressions for these distributions ignore the fact that, although differentk-modes in the initial gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is not true inreal space: the values of the density field at a given spatial position, whensmoothed on different real-space scales, are correlated in a nontrivial way. asa result, the problem is to estimate first crossing distribution by randomwalks having correlated rather than uncorrelated steps. in 1990, peacock &amp;heavens presented a simple approximation for the first crossing distribution ofa single barrier of constant height by walks with correlated steps. we showthat their approximation can be thought of as a correction to the distributionassociated with what we call smooth completely correlated walks. we then usethis insight to extend their approach to treat moving barriers, as well aswalks that are constrained to pass through a certain point before crossing thebarrier. for the latter, we show that a simple rescaling, inspired by bivariategaussian statistics, of the unconditional first crossing distribution,accurately describes the conditional distribution, independently of the choiceof analytical prescription for the former. in all cases, comparison withmonte-carlo solutions of the problem shows reasonably good agreement.(abridged)

1105.2261	halo bias in the excursion set approach with correlated steps	in the excursion set approach, halo abundances and clustering are closelyrelated. this relation is exploited in many modern methods which seek toconstrain cosmological parameters on the basis of the observed spatialdistribution of clusters. however, to obtain analytic expressions for thesequantities, most excursion set based predictions ignore the fact that, althoughdifferent k-modes in the initial gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is nottrue in real space: the values of the density field at a given spatialposition, when smoothed on different real-space scales, are correlated in anontrivial way. we show that when the excursion set approach is extended toinclude such correlations, then one must be careful to account for the factthat the associated prediction for halo bias is explicitly a real-spacequantity. therefore, care must be taken when comparing the predictions of thisapproach with measurements in simulations, which are typically made infourier-space. we show how to correct for this effect, and demonstrate thatignorance of this effect in recent analyses of halo bias has led to incorrectconclusions and biased constraints.

1107.3652	the luminosities of the brightest cluster galaxies and brightest  satellites in sdss groups	we show that the distribution of luminosities of brightest cluster galaxiesin an sdss-based group catalog suggests that bcg luminosities are just thestatistical extremes of the group galaxy luminosity function. this latterhappens to be very well approximated by the all-galaxy luminosity function(restricted to mr&lt;-19.9), provided one uses a parametrization of this functionthat is accurate at the bright end. a similar analysis of the luminositydistribution of the brightest satellite galaxies suggests that they are bestthought of as being the second brightest pick from the same luminositydistribution of which bcgs are the brightest. i.e., bsgs are not the brightestof some universal satellite luminosity function, in contrast to what halo modelanalyses of the luminosity dependence of clustering suggest. however, we thenuse mark correlations to provide a novel test of these order statistics,showing that the hypothesis of a universal luminosity function (i.e. no halomass dependence) from which the bcgs and bsgs are drawn is incompatible withthe data, despite the fact that there was no hint of this in the bcg and bsgluminosity distributions themselves. we also discuss why, since extreme valuestatistics are explicitly a function of the number of draws, the consistency ofbcg luminosities with extreme value statistics is most clearly seen if one iscareful to perform the test at fixed group richness n. tests at, e.g., fixedtotal group luminosity ltot, will generally be biased and may lead to erroneousconclusions.

1111.6977	formation times, mass growth histories and concentrations of dark matter  haloes	we develop a simple model for estimating the mass growth histories of darkmatter halos. the model is based on a fit to the formation time distribution,where formation is defined as the earliest time that the main branch of themerger tree contains a fraction f of the final mass m . our analysis exploitsthe fact that the median formation time as a function of f is the same as themedian of the main progenitor mass distribution as a function of time. whencoupled with previous work showing that the concentration c of the final halois related to the formation time tf associated with f \sim 0.04, our approachprovides a simple algorithm for estimating how the distribution of haloconcentrations may be expected to depend on mass, redshift and the expansionhistory of the background cosmology. we also show that one can predict log10 cwith a precision of about 0.13 and 0.09 dex if only its mass, or both mass andtf are known. and, conversely, one can predict log10 tf from mass or c with aprecision of 0.12 and 0.09 dex, approximately independent of f. adding the massto the c-based estimate does not result in further improvement. these latterresults may be useful for studies which seek to compare the age of the stars inthe central galaxy in a halo with the time the core was first assembled.

1201.3614	gravity and large-scale non-local bias	the relationship between galaxy and matter overdensities, bias, is most oftenassumed to be local. this is however unstable under time evolution, we provideproofs under several sets of assumptions. in the simplest model galaxies arecreated locally and linearly biased at a single time, and subsequently movewith the matter (no velocity bias) conserving their comoving number density (nomerging). we show that, after this formation time, the bias becomes unavoidablynon-local and non-linear at large scales. we identify the non-localgravitationally induced fields in which the galaxy overdensity can be expanded,showing that they can be constructed out of the invariants of the deformationtensor (galileons). in addition, we show that this result persists if weinclude an arbitrary evolution of the comoving number density of tracers. wethen include velocity bias, and show that new contributions appear, a dipolefield being the signature at second order. we test these predictions bystudying the dependence of halo overdensities in cells of fixed matter density:measurements in simulations show that departures from the mean bias relationare strongly correlated with the non-local gravitationally induced fieldsidentified by our formalism. the effects on non-local bias seen in thesimulations are most important for the most biased halos, as expected from ourpredictions. the non-locality seen in the simulations is not fully captured byassuming local bias in lagrangian space. accounting for these effects whenmodeling galaxy bias is essential for correctly describing the dependence ontriangle shape of the galaxy bispectrum, and hence constraining cosmologicalparameters and primordial non-gaussianity. we show that using our formalism weremove an important systematic in the determination of bias parameters from thegalaxy bispectrum, particularly for luminous galaxies.

1202.3438	plain fundamentals of fundamental planes: analytics and algorithms	the coefficients a and b of the fundamental plane relation r ~ sigma^a i^bdepend on whether one minimizes the scatter in the r direction or orthogonal tothe plane. we provide explicit expressions for a and b (and confidence limits)in terms of the covariances between logr, logsigma and logi. our analysis ismore generally applicable to any other correlations between three variables:e.g., the color-magnitude-sigma relation, the l-sigma-mbh relation, or therelation between the x-ray luminosity, sunyaev-zeldovich decrement and opticalrichness of a cluster, so we provide idl code which implements these ideas, andwe show how our analysis generalizes further to correlations between more thanthree variables. we show how to account for correlated errors and selectioneffects, and quantify the difference between the direct, inverse and orthogonalfit coefficients. we show that the three vectors associated with thefundamental plane can all be written as simple combinations of a and b becausethe distribution of i is much broader than that of sigma, and sigma and i areonly weakly correlated. why this should be so for galaxies is a fundamentalopen question about the physics of early-type galaxy formation. if luminosityevolution is differential, and rs and sigmas do not evolve, then this is justan accident: sigma and i must have been correlated in the past. on the otherhand, if the (lack of) correlation is similar to that at the present time, thendifferential luminosity evolution must have been accompanied by structuralevolution. a model in which the luminosities of low-l galaxies evolve morerapidly than do those of higher-l galaxies is able to produce the observeddecrease in a (by a factor of 2 at z~1) while having b decrease by only about20 percent. in such a model, the mdyn/l ratio is a steeper function of mdyn athigher z.

1203.6609	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: a large sample of mock galaxy catalogues	we present a fast method of producing mock galaxy catalogues that can be usedto compute covariance matrices of large-scale clustering measurements and testthe methods of analysis. our method populates a 2nd-order lagrangianperturbation theory (2lpt) matter field, where we calibrate masses of darkmatter halos by detailed comparisons with n-body simulations. we demonstratethe clustering of halos is recovered at ~10 per cent accuracy. we populatehalos with mock galaxies using a halo occupation distribution (hod)prescription, which has been calibrated to reproduce the clusteringmeasurements on scales between 30 and 80 mpc/h. we compare the samplecovariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discussdifferences. we have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to datarelease 9 of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss),producing 600mock catalogues of the "cmass" galaxy sample. these mocks enabled detailedtests of methods and errors that formed an integral part of companion analysesof these galaxy data.

1206.3506	peaks theory and the excursion set approach	we describe a model of dark matter halo abundances and clustering whichcombines the two most widely used approaches to this problem: that based onpeaks and the other based on excursion sets. our approach can be thought of asaddressing the cloud-in-cloud problem for peaks and/or modifying the excursionset approach so that it averages over a special subset, rather than allpossible walks. in this respect, it seeks to account for correlations betweensteps in the walk as well as correlations between walks. we first show how theexcursion set and peaks models can be written in the same formalism, and thenuse this correspondence to write our combined excursion set peaks model. wethen give simple expressions for the mass function and bias, showing that eventhe linear halo bias factor is predicted to be k-dependent as a consequence ofthe nonlocality associated with the peak constraint. at large masses, our modelhas little or no need to rescale the variable delta_c from the value associatedwith spherical collapse, and suggests a simple explanation for why the linearhalo bias factor appears to lie above that based on the peak-background splitat high masses when such a rescaling is assumed. although we have concentratedon peaks, our analysis is more generally applicable to other traditionallysingle-scale analyses of large-scale structure.

1207.7117	non-local lagrangian bias	halos are biased tracers of the dark matter distribution. it is often assumedthat the patches from which halos formed are locally biased with respect to theinitial fluctuation field, meaning that the halo-patch fluctuation field can bewritten as a taylor series in that of the dark matter. if quantities other thanthe local density influence halo formation, then this lagrangian bias willgenerically be nonlocal; the taylor series must be performed with respect tothese other variables as well. we illustrate the effect with monte-carlosimulations of a model in which halo formation depends on the local shear (thequadrupole of perturbation theory), and provide an analytic model whichprovides a good description of our results. our model, which extends theexcursion set approach to walks in more than one dimension, works both whensteps in the walk are uncorrelated, as well as when there are correlationsbetween steps. for walks with correlated steps, our model includes two distincttypes of nonlocality: one is due to the fact that the initial density profilearound a patch which is destined to form a halo must fall sufficiently steeplyaround it -- this introduces k-dependence to even the linear bias factor, butotherwise only affects the monopole of the clustering signal. the other is dueto the surrounding shear field; this affects the quadratic and higher orderbias factors, and introduces an angular dependence to the clustering signal. inboth cases, our analysis shows that these nonlocal lagrangian bias terms can besignificant, particularly for massive halos; they must be accounted for inanalyses of higher order clustering such as the halo bispectrum in lagrangianor eulerian space. although we illustrate these effects using halos, ouranalysis and conclusions also apply to the other constituents of the cosmic web-- filaments, sheets and voids.

1208.0229	lagrangian bias in the local bias model	it is often assumed that the halo-patch fluctuation field can be written as ataylor series in the initial lagrangian dark matter density fluctuation field.we show that if this lagrangian bias is local, and the initial conditions aregaussian, then the two-point cross-correlation between halos and mass should belinearly proportional to the mass-mass auto-correlation function. thisstatement is exact and valid on all scales; there are no higher ordercontributions, e.g., from terms proportional to products or convolutions oftwo-point functions, which one might have thought would appear upon truncatingthe taylor series of the halo bias function. in addition, the auto-correlationfunction of locally biased tracers can be written as a taylor series in theauto-correlation function of the mass; there are no terms involving, e.g.,derivatives or convolutions. moreover, although the leading order coefficient,the linear bias factor of the auto-correlation function is just the square ofthat for the cross-correlation, it is the same as that obtained from expandingthe mean number of halos as a function of the local density only in thelarge-scale limit. in principle, these relations allow simple tests of whetheror not halo bias is indeed local in lagrangian space. we discuss why things aremore complicated in practice. we also discuss our results in light of recentwork on the renormalizability of halo bias, demonstrating that it is better torenormalize than not. we use the lognormal model to illustrate many of ourfindings.

1210.1483	excursion set peaks: a self-consistent model of dark halo abundances and  clustering	we describe how to extend the excursion set peaks framework so that itspredictions of dark halo abundances and clustering can be compared directlywith simulations. these extensions include: a halo mass definition which usesthe tophat filter in real space; the mean dependence of the critical densityfor collapse delta_c on halo mass m; and the scatter around this mean value.all three of these are motivated by the physics of triaxial rather thanspherical collapse. a comparison of the resulting mass function with n-bodyresults shows that, if one uses delta_c(m) and its scatter as determined fromsimulations, then all three are necessary ingredients for obtaining ~10%accuracy. e.g., assuming a constant value of delta_c with no scatter, asmotivated by the physics of spherical collapse, leads to many more massivehalos than seen in simulations. the same model is also in excellent agreementwith n-body results for the linear halo bias, especially at the high mass endwhere the traditional peak-background split argument applied to the massfunction fit is known to underpredict the measured bias by ~10%. in theexcursion set language, our model is about walks centered on special positions(peaks) in the initial conditions -- we discuss what it implies for the usualcalculation in which all walks contribute to the statistics.

0712.0017	an analytic model for the bispectrum of galaxies in redshift space	we develop an analytic theory for the redshift space bispectrum of darkmatter, haloes and galaxies. this is done within the context of the halo modelof structure formation, as this allows for the self-consistent inclusion oflinear and non-linear redshift space distortions and also for the non-linearityof the halo bias. the model is applicable over a wide range of scales: on thelargest scales the predictions reduce to those of the standard perturbationtheory (pt); on smaller scales they are determined primarily by the nonlinearvirial velocities of galaxies within haloes, and this gives rise to theu-shaped anisotropy in the reduced bispectrum -- a finger print of thefinger-of-god distortions. we then confront the predictions with bispectrummeasurements from an ensemble of numerical simulations. on very large scales,k=0.05 h/mpc, we find reasonably good agreement between our halo model, pt andthe data, to within the errors. on smaller scales, k=0.1 h/mpc, the measuredbispectra differ from the pt at the level of 10-20%, especially for colineartriangle configurations. the halo model predictions improve over pt, but areaccurate to no better than 10%. on smaller scales k=0.5-1.0 h/mpc, our modelprovides a significant improvement over pt, which breaks down. this impliesthat studies which use the lowest order pt to extract galaxy bias informationare not robust on scales k&gt;0.1 h/mpc. the analytic and simulation results alsoindicate that there is no observable scale for which the configurationdependence of the reduced bispectrum is constant--hierarchical models for thehigher order correlation functions in redshift space are unlikely to be useful.it is hoped that our model will facilitate extraction of information fromlarge-scale structure surveys of the universe.

1212.4157	ellipsoidal halo finders and implications for models of triaxial halo  formation	we describe an algorithm for identifying ellipsoidal haloes in numericalsimulations, and quantify how the resulting estimates of halo mass and shapediffer with respect to spherical halo finders. haloes become more prolate whenfit with ellipsoids, the difference being most pronounced for the moreaspherical objects. although the ellipsoidal mass is systematically larger,this is less than 10% for most of the haloes. however, even this smalldifference in mass corresponds to a significant difference in shape. wequantify these effects also on the initial mass and deformation tensors, onwhich most models of triaxial collapse are based. by studying the properties ofprotohaloes in the initial conditions, we find that models in which protohaloesare identified in lagrangian space by three positive eigenvalues of thedeformation tensor are tenable only at the masses well-above $m_*$. theoverdensity $\delta$ within almost any protohalo is larger than the criticalvalue associated with spherical collapse (increasing as mass decreases); thisis in good qualitative agreement with models which identify haloes requiringthat collapse have occured along all three principal axes, each axis havingturned around from the universal expansion at a different time. thedistributions of initial values are in agreement with the simplest predictionsassociated with ellipsoidal collapse, assuming initially spherical protohaloes,collapsed around random positions which were sufficiently overdense. however,most protohaloes are not spherical and departures from sphericity increase asprotohalo mass decreases.

1301.5128	stochastic bias in multi-dimensional excursion set approaches	we describe a simple fully analytic model of the excursion set approachassociated with two gaussian random walks: the first walk represents theinitial overdensity around a protohalo, and the second is a crude way ofallowing for other factors which might influence halo formation. this model isricher than that based on a single walk, because it yields a distribution ofheights at first crossing. we provide explicit expressions for theunconditional first crossing distribution which is usually used to model thehalo mass function, the progenitor distributions, and the conditionaldistributions from which correlations with environment are usually estimated.these latter exhibit perhaps the simplest form of what is often called nonlocalbias, and which we prefer to call stochastic bias, since the new bias effectsarise from `hidden-variables' other than density, but these may still bedefined locally. we provide explicit expressions for these new bias factors. wealso provide formulae for the distribution of heights at first crossing in theunconditional and conditional cases. in contrast to the first crossingdistribution, these are exact, even for moving barriers, and for walks withcorrelated steps. the conditional distributions yield predictions for thedistribution of halo concentrations at fixed mass and formation redshift. theyalso exhibit assembly bias like effects, even when the steps in the walksthemselves are uncorrelated. finally, we show how the predictions are modifiedif we add the requirement that halos form around peaks: these depend on whetherthe peaks constraint is applied to a combination of the overdensity and theother variable, or to the overdensity alone. our results demonstrate the powerof requiring models to reproduce not just halo counts but the distribution ofoverdensities at fixed protohalo mass as well.

0712.3800	merger history trees of dark matter haloes in moving barrier models	we present an algorithm for generating merger histories of dark matterhaloes. the algorithm is based on the excursion set approach with movingbarriers whose shape is motivated by the ellipsoidal collapse model of haloformation. in contrast to most other merger-tree algorithms, ours takesdiscrete steps in mass rather than time. this allows us to quantify effectswhich arise from the fact that outputs from numerical simulations are usuallyin discrete time bins. in addition, it suggests a natural set of scalingvariables for describing the abundance of halo progenitors; this scaling is notas general as that associated with a spherical collapse. we test our algorithmby comparing its predictions with measurements in numerical simulations. theprogenitor mass fractions and mass functions are in good agreement, as is thepredicted scaling law. we also test the formation-redshift distribution, themass distribution at formation, and the redshift distribution of the mostrecent major merger; all are in reasonable agreement with n-body simulationdata, over a broad range of masses and redshifts. finally, we study the effectsof sampling in discrete time snapshots. in all cases, the improvement overalgorithms based on the spherical collapse assumption is significant.

0712.4100	dark matter halo creation in moving barrier models	in hierarchical models, the time derivative of the halo mass function may bethought of as the difference of two terms - a creation term, which describesthe increase in the number of haloes of mass m from mergers of less massiveobjects, and a destruction term, which describes the decrease in the number ofm-haloes as these merge with other haloes, creating more massive haloes as aresult. in models where haloes form from a spherical collapse, the distributionof halo creation times can be estimated from the same formalism which is usedto estimate halo abundances: the constant-barrier excursion-set approach. inthe excursion set approach, moving, rather than constant-barriers, arenecessary for estimating halo abundances when the collapse is triaxial. we showhow the corresponding estimates are modified by providing analytic estimates ofthe creation rate for a wide range of halo masses. we then show that thesemoving-barrier based predictions are in better agreement with measurements innumerical simulations than are the corresponding predictions of the sphericalcollapse model. these results should be useful for studies of merger-drivenstar-formation rates and agn activity. we also present a similar study ofcreation of haloes conditioned on belonging to an object of a certain masstoday, and reach similar conclusions - the moving barrier based estimates arein substantially better agreement with the simulations. this part of the studymay be useful for understanding the tendency for the oldest stars to exist inthe most massive objects.

1305.0724	the excursion set approach in non-gaussian random fields	insight into a number of interesting questions in cosmology can be obtainedfrom the first crossing distributions of physically motivated barriers byrandom walks with correlated steps. we write the first crossing distribution asa formal series, ordered by the number of times a walk upcrosses the barrier.since the fraction of walks with many upcrossings is negligible if the walk hasnot taken many steps, the leading order term in this series is the mostrelevant for understanding the massive objects of most interest in cosmology.this first term only requires knowledge of the bivariate distribution of thewalk height and slope, and provides an excellent approximation to the firstcrossing distribution for all barriers and smoothing filters of currentinterest. we show that this simplicity survives when extending the approach tothe case of non-gaussian random fields. for non-gaussian fields which areobtained by deterministic transformations of a gaussian, the first crossingdistribution is simply related to that for gaussian walks crossing a suitablyrescaled barrier. our analysis shows that this is a useful way to think of thegeneric case as well. although our study is motivated by the possibility thatthe primordial fluctuation field was non-gaussian, our results are general. inparticular, they do not assume the non-gaussianity is small, so they may beviewed as the solution to an excursion set analysis of the late-time, nonlinearfluctuation field rather than the initial one. they are also useful for modelsin which the barrier height is determined by quantities other than the initialdensity, since most other physically motivated variables (such as the shear)are usually stochastic and non-gaussian. we use the lognormal transformation toillustrate some of our arguments.

1305.5830	bias deconstructed: unravelling the scale dependence of halo bias using  real space measurements	we explore the scale dependence of halo bias using real spacecross-correlation measurements in n-body simulations and in pinocchio, analgorithm based on lagrangian perturbation theory. recent work has shown how tointerpret such real space measurements in terms of k-dependent bias in fourierspace, and how to remove the k-dependence to reconstruct the k-independentpeak-background split halo bias parameters. we compare our reconstruction ofthe linear bias, which requires no free parameters, with previous estimatesfrom n-body simulations which were obtained directly in fourier space at largescales, and find very good agreement. our reconstruction of the quadratic biasis similarly parameter-free, although in this case there are no previousfourier space measurements to compare with. our analysis of n-body simulationsexplicitly tests the predictions of the excursion set peaks (esp) formalism ofparanjape et al. (2013) for the scale dependence of bias; we find that the esppredictions accurately describe our measurements. in addition, our measurementsin pinocchio serve as a useful, successful consistency check between pinocchioand n-body simulations that is not accessible to traditional measurements.

1306.0551	the importance of stepping up in the excursion set approach	recently, we provided a simple but accurate formula which closelyapproximates the first crossing distribution associated with random walkshaving correlated steps. the approximation is accurate for the wide range ofbarrier shapes of current interest and is based on the requirement that, inaddition to having the right height, the walk must cross the barrier goingupwards. therefore, it only requires knowledge of the bivariate distribution ofthe walk height and slope, and is particularly useful for excursion set modelsof the massive end of the halo mass function. however, it diverges at lowermasses. we show how to cure this divergence by using a formulation whichrequires knowledge of just one other variable. while our analysis is general,we use examples based on gaussian initial conditions to illustrate our results.our formulation, which is simple and fast, yields excellent agreement with theconsiderably more computationally expensive monte-carlo solution of the firstcrossing distribution, for a wide variety of moving barriers, even at very lowmasses.

1401.3185	stochasticity in halo formation and the excursion set approach	the simplest stochastic halo formation models assume that the traceless partof the shear field acts to increase the initial overdensity (or decrease theunderdensity) that a protohalo (or protovoid) must have if it is to form by thepresent time. equivalently, it is the difference between the overdensity and(the square root of the) shear that must be larger than a threshold value. toestimate the effect this has on halo abundances using the excursion setapproach, we must solve for the first crossing distribution of a barrier ofconstant height by the random walks associated with the difference, which isnow (even for gaussian initial conditions) a non-gaussian variate. thecorrelation properties of such non-gaussian walks are inherited from those ofthe density and the shear, and, since they are independent processes, thesolution is in fact remarkably simple. we show that this provides an easy wayto understand why earlier heuristic arguments about the nature of the solutionworked so well. in addition to modelling halos and voids, this potentiallysimplifies models of the abundance and spatial distribution of filaments andsheets in the cosmic web.

1401.8177	on the markovian assumption in the excursion set approach: the  approximation of markov velocities	the excursion set approach uses the statistics of the density field smoothedon a wide range of scales, to gain insight into a number of interestingprocesses in nonlinear structure formation, such as cluster assembly, mergingand clustering. the approach treats the curve defined by the height of theoverdensity fluctuation field when changing the smoothing scale as a randomwalk. the steps of the walks are often assumed to be uncorrelated, so that thewalk heights are a markov process, even though this assumption is known to beinaccurate for physically relevant filters. we develop a model in which thewalk steps, rather than heights, are a markov process, and correlations betweensteps arise because of nearest neighbour interactions. this model is aparticular case of a general class, which we call markov velocity models. weshow how these can approximate the walks generated by arbitrary power spectraand filters, and, unlike walks with markov heights, provide a very goodapproximation to physically relevant models. we define a markov velocity montecarlo algorithm to generate walks whose first crossing distribution is verysimilar to that of tophat-smoothed lcdm walks. finally, we demonstrate thatmarkov velocity walks generically exhibit a simple but realistic form ofassembly bias, so we expect them to be useful in the construction of morerealistic merger history trees.

0802.4288	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the clustering of luminous  red galaxies since z = 0.6	we present an analysis of the small-to-intermediate scale clustering ofsamples of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey andthe 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey carefully matched to have the samerest-frame colours and luminosity. we study the spatial two-pointauto-correlation function in both redshift-space and real-space of a combinedsample of over 10,000 lrgs, which represent the most massive galaxies in theuniverse with stellar masses &gt; 10^11 h^-1 m_sun and space densities 10^-4 h^-3mpc^-3. we find no significant evolution in the amplitude r_0 of thecorrelation function with redshift, but do see a slight decrease in the slopewith increasing redshift over 0.19 &lt; z &lt; 0.55 and scales of 0.32 &lt; r &lt; 32 h^-1mpc. we compare our measurements with the predicted evolution of dark matterclustering and use the halo model to interpret our results. we find that ourclustering measurements are inconsistent (&gt;99.9% significance) with a passivemodel whereby the lrgs do not merge with one another; a model with a mergerrate of 7.5 +/- 2.3% from z = 0.55 to z = 0.19 (i.e. an average rate of 2.4%gyr^-1) provides a better fit to our observations. our clustering and numberdensity measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the merged lrgswere originally central galaxies in different haloes which, following themerger of these haloes, merged to create a single brightest cluster galaxy. inaddition, we show that the small-scale clustering signal constrains the scatterin halo merger histories. when combined with measurements of the luminosityfunction, our results suggest that this scatter is sub-poisson. while this is ageneric prediction of hierarchical models, it has not been tested before.

0805.0310	a halo model of galaxy colors and clustering in the sdss	successful halo-model descriptions of the luminosity dependence of clusteringdistinguish between the central galaxy in a halo and all the others(satellites). to include colors, we provide a prescription for how thecolor-magnitude relation of centrals and satellites depends on halo mass. thisfollows from two assumptions: (i) the bimodality of the color distribution atfixed luminosity is independent of halo mass, and (ii) the fraction ofsatellite galaxies which populate the red sequence increases with luminosity.we show that these two assumptions allow one to build a model of how galaxyclustering depends on color without any additional free parameters than thoserequired to model the luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering. we then showthat the resulting model is in good agreement with the distribution andclustering of colors in the sdss, both by comparing the predicted correlationfunctions of red and blue galaxies with measurements, and by comparing thepredicted color mark correlation function with the measured one. markcorrelation functions are powerful tools for identifying and quantifyingcorrelations between galaxy properties and their environments: our resultsindicate that the correlation between halo mass and environment is the primarydriver for correlations between galaxy colors and the environment; additionalcorrelations associated with halo `assembly bias' are relatively small. ourapproach shows explicitly how to construct mock catalogs which include bothluminosities {\em and} colors -- thus providing realistic training sets for,e.g., galaxy cluster finding algorithms. our prescription is the first steptowards incorporating the entire spectral energy distribution into the halomodel approach.

0805.1238	ellipsoidal collapse and the redshift space probability distribution  function of dark matter	we use the physics of ellipsoidal collapse to model the probabilitydistribution function of the smoothed dark matter density field in real andredshift space. we provide a simple approximation to the exact collapse modelwhich shows clearly how the evolution can be thought of as a modification ofthe spherical evolution model as well as of the zeldovich approximation. inessence, our model specifies how the initial smoothed overdensity and shearfields can be used to determine the shape and size of the region at latertimes. we use our parametrization to extend previous work on the real-space pdfso that it predicts the redshift space pdf as well. our results are in goodagreement with measurements of the pdf in simulations of clustering fromgaussian initial conditions down to scales on which the rms fluctuation isslightly greater than unity. we also show how the highly non-gaussiannon-linear redshifted density field in a numerical simulation can betransformed so that it provides an estimate of the shape of the initialreal-space pdf. when applied to our simulations, our method recovers theinitial gaussian pdf, provided the variance in the nonlinear smoothed field isless than 4.

1507.05627	the universality of the virial halo mass function and models for  non-universality of other halo definitions	the abundance of galaxy clusters can constrain both the geometry and growthof structure in our universe. however, this probe could be significantlycomplicated by recent claims of nonuniversality -- non-trivial dependences withrespect to the cosmological model and redshift. in this work we analyse thedependance of the mass function on the way haloes are identified and establishif this can cause departures from universality. in order to explore thisdependance, we use a set of different n-body cosmological simulations (lesbarbine simulations), with the latest cosmological parameters from the planckcollaboration; this first suite of simulations is followed by a lowerresolution set, carried out with different cosmological parameters. we identifydark matter haloes using a spherical overdensity algorithm with varyingoverdensity thresholds (virial, 2000rho_c, 1000rho_c, 500rho_c, 200rho_c and200rho_b) at all redshifts. we notice that, when expressed in term of therescaled variable nu, the mass functionfor virial haloes is a nearly universalas a function of redshift and cosmology, while this is clearly not the case forthe other overdensities we considered. we provide fitting functions for thehalo mass function parameters as a function of overdensity, that allow topredict, to within a few percent accuracy, the halo mass function for a widerange of halo definitions, redshifts and cosmological models. we then show howthe departures from universality associated with other halo definitions can bederived by combining the universality of the virial definition with theexpected shape of the density profile of halos.

1511.01909	effective window function for lagrangian halos	the window function for protohalos in lagrangian space is often assumed to bea tophat in real space. we measure this profile directly and find that it ismore extended than a tophat but less extended than a gaussian; its shape iswell-described by rounding the edges of the tophat by convolution with agaussan that has a scale length about 5 times smaller. this effective window$w_{\rm eff}$ is particularly simple in fourier space, and has an analytic formin real space. together with the excursion set bias parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$describes the scale-dependence of the lagrangian halo-matter cross correlationup to $kr_{\rm lag} \sim 10 $, where $r_{\rm lag}$ is the lagrangian size ofthe protohalo. moreover, with this $w_{\rm eff}$, all the spectral moments ofthe power spectrum are finite. while this simplifies analysis of the excursionset peak model, the predicted mass function which results is significantlylower, and hence appreciably lower than in simulations for halos of mass$\lesssim 10^{14} m_{\odot}/h $.

astro-ph;0006319	how many galaxies fit in a halo? constraints on galaxy formation  efficiency from spatial clustering	we study galaxy clustering using halo models, where gravitational clusteringis described in terms of dark matter halos. at small scales, clusteringstatistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales,correlations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory withhalo biasing. galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, andgalaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function ofhalo mass. this approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy powerspectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, andthe galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scalesthan their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. we findthat requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the apmgalaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. the data atlarge scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at smallmasses, m =10^10 msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the numberof galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-masslimit. these constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosityfunction or tully-fisher relation. we also predict the power spectrum,bispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. although halomodels agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higherorder sp parameters in n-body simulations, the model assumption that halos arespherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of thebispectrum at small scales. we stress the importance of finite volume effectsin higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.

astro-ph;0009166	peculiar velocities of galaxies and clusters	we present a simple model for the shape of the distribution function ofgalaxy peculiar velocities. we show how both nonlinear and linear theory termscombine to produce a distribution which has an approximately gaussian core withexponential wings. the model is easily extended to study how the statisticdepends on the type of particle used to trace the velocity field (dark matterparticles, dark matter haloes, galaxies), and on the density of the environmentin which the test particles are. comparisons with simulations suggest that ourmodel is accurate. we also show that the evolution of the peculiar velocitiesdepends on the local, rather than the global density. since clusters populatedenser regions on average, using cluster velocities with the linear theoryscaling may lead to an overestimate of the global value of omega. conversely,using linear theory with the global value of omega to scale cluster velocitiesfrom the initial to the present time results in an underestimate of their truevelocities. in general, however, the directions of motions of haloes are ratherwell described by linear theory. our results help to simplify models ofredshift-space distortions considerably.
{fenge}
astro-ph;0009167	linear and nonlinear contributions to pairwise peculiar velocities	we write the correlation function of dark matter particles, xi(r), as the sumof two terms - one which accounts for nonlinear evolution, and dominates onsmall scales, and another which is essentially the term from linear theory, anddominates on large scales. we use models of the number and spatial distributionof haloes and halo density profiles to describe the nonlinear term and itsevolution. the result provides a good description of the evolution of xi(r) insimulations. we then use this decomposition to provide simple and accuratemodels of how the single particle velocity dispersion evolves with time, andhow the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution dependon scale. the key idea is to use the simple physics of linear theory on largescales, the simple physics of the virial theorem on small scales, and our modelfor the correlation function to tell us how to weight the two types ofcontributions (linear and nonlinear) to the pairwise velocity statistics. whenincorporated into the streaming model, our results will allow a simple accuratedescription of redshift-space distortions over the entire range of linear tohighly nonlinear regimes.

astro-ph;0104332	non-gaussian cmb temperature fluctuations from peculiar velocities of  clusters	we use numerical simulations of a (480 mpc/h)^3 volume to show that thedistribution of peak heights in maps of the temperature fluctuations from thekinematic and thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effects will be highly non-gaussian,and very different from the peak height distribution of a gaussian randomfield. we then show that it is a good approximation to assume that each peak ineither sz effect is associated with one and only one dark matter halo. thisallows us to use our knowledge of the properties of haloes to estimate the peakheight distributions. at fixed optical depth, the distribution of peak heightsdue to the kinematic effect is gaussian, with a width which is approximatelyproportional to optical depth; the non-gaussianity comes from summing over arange of optical depths. the optical depth is an increasing function of halomass, and the distribution of halo speeds is gaussian, with a dispersion whichis approximately independent of halo mass. this means that observations of thekinematic effect can be used to put constraints on how the abundance of massiveclusters evolves, and on the evolution of cluster velocities. thenon-gaussianity of the thermal effect, on the other hand, comes primarily fromthe fact that, on average, the effect is larger in more massive haloes, and thedistribution of halo masses is highly non-gaussian. we also show that becausehaloes of the same mass may have a range of density and velocity dispersionprofiles, the relation between halo mass and the amplitude of the thermaleffect is not deterministic, but has some scatter.

astro-ph;0105008	on the distribution of haloes, galaxies and mass	the stochasticity in the distribution of dark haloes in the cosmic densityfield is reflected in the distribution function $p_v(n_h|\delta_m)$ which givesthe probability of finding $n_h$ haloes in a volume $v$ with mass densitycontrast $\delta_m$. we study the properties of this function usinghigh-resolution $n$-body simulations, and find that $p_v(n_n|\delta_m)$ issignificantly non-poisson. the ratio between the variance and the mean goesfrom $\sim 1$ (poisson) at $1+\delta_m\ll 1$ to $&lt;1$ (sub-poisson) at$1+\delta_m\sim 1$ to $&gt;1$ (super-poisson) at $1+\delta_m\gg 1$. the mean biasrelation is found to be well described by halo bias models based on thepress-schechter formalism. the sub-poisson variance can be explained as aresult of halo-exclusion while the super-poisson variance at high $\delta_m$may be explained as a result of halo clustering. a simple phenomenologicalmodel is proposed to describe the behavior of the variance as a function of$\delta_m$. galaxy distribution in the cosmic density field predicted bysemi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows similar stochastic behavior. wediscuss the implications of the stochasticity in halo bias to the modelling ofhigher-order moments of dark haloes and of galaxies.

astro-ph;0105113	an excursion set model of hierarchical clustering: ellipsoidal collapse  and the moving barrier	the excursion set approach allows one to estimate the abundance and spatialdistribution of virialized dark matter haloes efficiently and accurately. thepredictions of this approach depend on how the nonlinear processes of collapseand virialization are modelled. we present simple analytic approximations whichallow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical andellipsoidal collapse. in particular, we present formulae for the universalunconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass functionwhich describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given massrange today. we show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier modelprovides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulationsthan the spherical collapse based constant barrier model, although theagreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times. ourresults for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurateapproximations to the local-density mass function which quantifies the tendencyfor massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes. thishappens because low density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloesviewed at large lookback times, whereas high density regions are collapsedhaloes viewed at small lookback times. although we have only applied ouranalytic formulae to two simple barrier shapes, we show that they are, in fact,accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers. we suggest how they can be usedto study the case in which the initial dark matter distribution is notcompletely cold.

astro-ph;0106120	pthalos: a fast method for generating mock galaxy distributions	current models of galaxy formation applied to understanding the large-scalestructure of the universe have two parts. the first is an accurate solution ofthe equations of motion for the dark matter due to gravitational clustering.the second consists of making physically reasonable approximations to thebehavior of baryons inside dark matter halos. the first uses large,computationally intensive, $n$-body simulations. we argue that because thesecond step is, at least at present, uncertain, it is possible to obtainsimilar galaxy distributions without solving the first step exactly. wedescribe an algorithm which is several orders of magnitude faster than n-bodysimulations, but which is, nevertheless, rather accurate. the algorithmcombines perturbation theory with virialized halo models of the nonlineardensity and velocity fields. for two- and three-point statistics the resultingfields are exact on large scales, and rather accurate well into the nonlinearregime, particularly for two-point statistics in real and redshift space. wethen show how to use this algorithm to generate mock galaxy distributions fromhalo occupation numbers. as a first application, we show that it provides agood description of the clustering of galaxies in the pscz survey. we alsodiscuss applications to the estimation of non-gaussian contributions to errorbars and covariance matrix of the power spectrum, in real and redshift space,for galaxies and dark matter. the results for the latter show good agreementwith simulations, supporting the use of our method to constrain cosmologicalparameters from upcoming galaxy surveys.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107419	kl estimation of the power spectrum parameters from the angular  distribution of galaxies in early sdss data	we present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the sloandigital sky survey. the projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expandedover a set of karhunen-loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noiseratio in our analysis. a maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimateparameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional powerspectrum. our best estimates are gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8l = 0.915 +/-0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. we demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at orbeyond the peak of the 3d power spectrum. we discuss how the results scale withsystematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. we find that thecentral values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. we havealso explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations ofthe kl basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. we find that theimpact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties ofour fiducial result.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0205413	composite luminosity functions based on the sloan digital sky survey  "cut &amp; enhance" galaxy cluster catalog	we present here results on the composite luminosity functions of galaxies inthe clusters of galaxies selected from the sdss cut and enhance cluster catalog(ce; goto et al. 2001). we construct the composite luminosity function in thefive sdss bands, u,g,r,i and z, using 204 ce clusters ranging from z=0.02 toz=0.25. we use photometric redshifts to construct composite luminosityfunctions. the robustness of the weighting scheme was tested using monte carlosimulation. we find the slope of composite lfs become flatter toward reddercolor band. comparing with field lfs of sdss (blanton et al. 2001), cluster lfshave brighter characteristic magnitude and flatter slopes in g, r, i and zbands. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cluster lf hastwo distinct underlying populations i.e. the bright end of the lf is dominatedby bright early types that follow a gaussian--like luminosity distribution,while the faint--end of the cluster lf is a steep power--law like functiondominated by star--forming (bluer) galaxies. we also study the compositeluminosity functions for early--type and late--type galaxies using profilefits, a concentration parameter and u-r color to classify galaxy morphology.the strong dependence of lf on galaxy morphology is found.the faint end slopeof the lf is always flatter for early--type galaxies than late--type regardlessof passband and methodology. these results are consistent with the hypothesisthat the cluster region are dominated by bright elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0301280	on departures from a power law in the galaxy correlation function	we measure the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) from the sloan digitalsky survey for a flux-limited sample of 118,000 galaxies and for a volumelimited subset of 22,000 galaxies with absolute magnitude m_r&lt;-21. bothcorrelation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fitpower law, in particular a change in slope at r_p~1-2 mpc/h. these departuresare stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relativelyluminous galaxies. we show that the inflection point in w_p(r_p) can benaturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according towhich it marks the transition from a large scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in separate dark matter halos to a small scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in the same dark matter halo. for example, given the dark halo populationpredicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projectedcorrelation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by amodel in which the mean number of m_r&lt;-21 galaxies in a halo of mass m&gt;m_1=4.74x 10^{13}\msun/h is &lt;n&gt;_m=(m/m_1)^{0.89}, with 75% of the galaxies residing inless massive, single-galaxy halos. this physically motivated model has the samenumber of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the w_p(r_p) data better,with a \chi^2/d.o.f.=0.93 compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom,incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). departuresfrom a power-law correlation function encode information about the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter halos. higher precision measurements of thesedepartures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias andprovide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0301302	the morphological butcher-oemler effect in the sdss cut&amp;enhance galaxy  cluster catalog	we investigate the evolution of the fractions of late type cluster galaxiesas a function of redshift, using one of the largest, most uniform clustersamples available. the sample consists of 514 clusters of galaxies in the range0.02&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the sloan digital sky survey cut &amp; enhance galaxy clustercatalog. this catalog was created using a single automated cluster findingalgorithm on uniform data from a single telescope, with accurate ccdphotometry, thus, minimizing selection biases. we use four independent methodsto analyze the evolution of the late type galaxy fraction. specifically, weselect late type galaxies based on: restframe g-r color, u-r color, galaxyprofile fitting and concentration index. the first criterion corresponds to theone used in the classical butcher-oemler analyses. the last three criteria aremore sensitive to the morphological type of the galaxies. in all four cases, wefind an increase in the fraction of late type galaxies with increasingredshift, significant at the 99.9% level. the results confirm that clustergalaxies do change colors with redshift (the butcher-oemler effect) and, inaddition, they change their morphology to later-type toward higher redshift --indicating a morphological equivalent of the butcher-oemler effect. we alsofind a tendency of richer clusters to have lower fractions of late typegalaxies. the trend is consistent with a ram pressure stripping model, wherericher clusters have more effective ram pressure due to their highertemperature.

astro-ph;0301303	the environment of passive spiral galaxies in the sdss	in previous work on galaxy clusters, several authors reported a discovery ofan unusual population of galaxies, which have spiral morphologies, but do notshow any star formation activity. these galaxies are called ``passivespirals'', and have been interesting since it has been difficult to understandthe existence of such galaxies. using a volume limited sample (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 andmr&lt;-20.5; 25813 galaxies) of the sloan digital sky survey data, we have found73 (0.28$\pm$0.03%) passive spiral galaxies and studied their environments. itis found that passive spiral galaxies live in local galaxy density 1-2mpc$^{-2}$ and 1-10 cluster-centric virial radius. thus the origins of passivespiral galaxies are likely to be cluster related. these characteristicenvironments coincide with the previously reported environment where galaxystar formation rate suddenly declines and the so-called morphology-densityrelation turns. it is likely that the same physical mechanism is responsiblefor all of these observational results. the existence of passive spiralgalaxies suggests that a physical mechanism that works calmly is preferred todynamical origins such as major merger/interaction since such a mechanism candestroy spiral arm structures. compared with observed cluster galaxy evolutionsuch as the butcher-oemler effect and the morphological butcher-oemler effect,passive spiral galaxies are likely to be a galaxy population in transitionbetween red, elliptical/s0 galaxies in low redshift clusters and blue, spiralgalaxies more numerous in higher redshift clusters.

astro-ph;0304203	quasar-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy cross-correlations: model predictions  with realistic galaxies	several measurements of qso-galaxy correlations have reported signals muchlarger than predictions of magnification by large-scale structure. we find thatthe expected signal depends stronly on the properties of the foreground galaxypopulation. on arcminute scales it can be either larger or smaller by a factorof two for different galaxy types in comparison with a linearly biased versionof the mass distribution. thus the resolution of some of the excessmeasurements may lie in examining the halo occupation properties of the galaxypopulation sampled by a given survey; this is also the primary information suchmeasurements will provide.  we use the halo model of clustering and simulations to predict themagnification induced cross-correlations and errors for forthcoming surveys.with the full sloan digital sky survey the statistical errors will be below 1percent for the galaxy-galaxy correlations and significantly larger forqso-galaxy correlations. thus accurate constraints on parameters of the galaxyhalo occupation distribution can be obtained from small scale measurements andon the bias parameter from large scales. since the lensing inducedcross-correlation measures the first moment of the halo occupation number ofgalaxies, these measurements can provide the basis for interpreting galaxyclustering measurements which measure the second and higher order moments.

astro-ph;0311260	a hierarchy of voids: much ado about nothing	we present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution inthe context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. wefind that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which iswell-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly intime. this is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halomasses which does not have a small-scale cut-off.  in our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. the first processaffects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: theevolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergersof smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from themergers of less massive progenitors. the second process is unique to voids, andoccurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity:these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses aroundthem. it is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales.  in the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solutionof the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objectswhich are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walkscrossing one barrier. we show that a similar formulation of void evolutionrequires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account forvoids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. thus, in our model, the voidsize distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects thedynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.

astro-ph;0504510	detection of cosmic magnification with the sloan digital sky survey	we present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by thevariation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground largescale structure. to make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees ofphotometric observations from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containing\~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. our measurement of the galaxy-quasarcross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence andchange in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number countsthat is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. weshow that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, galactic dustextinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are wellcontrolled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. by weighting thequasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation ofquasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at &gt;4 sigmain all five sdss filters. our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scalesranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions based on the wmap concordance cosmology. as with galaxy-galaxylensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide usefulconstraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.

astro-ph;0511772	the halo-model description of marked statistics	marked statistics allow sensitive tests of how galaxy properties correlatewith environment, as well as of how correlations between galaxy properties areaffected by environment. a halo-model description of marked correlations isdeveloped, which incorporates the effects which arise from the facts thattypical galaxy marks (e.g., luminosity, color, star formation rate, stellarmass) depend on the mass of the parent halo, and that massive haloes extend tolarger radii and populate denser regions. comparison with measured markedstatistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good agreement onscales smaller than a megaparsec, and excellent agreement on larger scales. thehalo-model description shows clearly that the behaviour of some low-ordermarked statistics on these scales encodes information about the mean galaxymark as a function of halo mass, but is insensitive to mark-gradients withinhaloes. higher-order statistics encode information about higher order momentsof the distribution of marks within haloes. this information is obtainedwithout ever having to identify haloes or clusters in the galaxy distribution.on scales smaller than a megaparsec, the halo-model calculation shows thatmarked statistics allow sensitive tests of whether or not central galaxies inhaloes are a special population. a prescription for including more generalmark-gradients in the halo-model description is also provided. the formalismdeveloped here is particularly well-suited to interpretation of markedstatistics in astrophysical datasets, because it is phrased in the samelanguage that is currently used to interpret more standard measures of galaxyclustering.

astro-ph;0511773	marked correlations in galaxy formation models	the two-point correlation function has been the standard statistic forquantifying how galaxies are clustered. the statistic uses the positions ofgalaxies, but not their properties. clustering as a function of galaxyproperty, be it type, luminosity, color, etc., is usually studied by analysinga subset of the full population, the galaxies in the subset chosen because theyhave a similar range of properties. we explore an alternativetechnique---marked correlations---in which one weights galaxies by someproperty or `mark' when measuring clustering statistics. marked correlationsare particularly well-suited to quantifying how the properties of galaxiescorrelate with their environment. therefore, measurements of marked statistics,with luminosity, stellar mass, color, star-formation rate, etc. as the mark,permit sensitive tests of galaxy formation models. we make measurements of suchmarked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models to illustrate theirutility. these measurements show that close pairs of galaxies are expected tobe red, to have larger stellar masses, and to have smaller star formationrates. we also show that the simplest unbiased estimator of the particularmarked statistic we use extensively is very simple to measure---it does notrequire construction of a random catalog---and provide an estimate of itsvariance. large wide-field surveys of the sky are revolutionizing our view ofgalaxies and how they evolve. our results indicate that application of markedstatistics to this high quantity of high-quality data will provide a wealth ofinformation about galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0512463	the luminosity-weighted or `marked' correlation function	we present measurements of the redshift-space luminosity-weighted or `marked'correlation function in the sdss. these are compared with a model in which theluminosity function and luminosity dependence of clustering are the same asthat observed, and in which the form of the luminosity-weighted correlationfunction is entirely a consequence of the fact that massive halos populatedense regions. we do this by using mock catalogs which are constrained toreproduce the observed luminosity function and the luminosity dependence ofclustering, as well as by using the language of the redshift-space halo-model.these analyses show that marked correlations may show a signal on large scaleseven if there are no large-scale physical effects--the statistical correlationbetween halos and their environment will produce a measureable signal. ourmodel is in good agreement with the measurements, indicating that the halo massfunction in dense regions is top-heavy; the correlation between halo mass andlarge scale environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxyproperties and environment; and the luminosity of the central galaxy in a halois different from (in general, brighter than) that of the other objects in thehalo. thus our measurement provides strong evidence for the accuracy of thesethree standard assumptions of galaxy formation models. these assumptions alsoform the basis of current halo-model based interpretations of galaxyclustering.

astro-ph;0601407	the environmental dependence of galaxy clustering in the sloan digital  sky survey	a generic prediction of hierarchical clustering models is that the massfunction of dark haloes in dense regions in the universe should be top-heavy.we provide a novel test of this prediction using a sample of galaxies drawnfrom the sloan digital sky survey. to perform the test, we compare measurementsof galaxy clustering in dense and underdense regions. we find that galaxies indense regions cluster significantly more strongly than those in less denseregions. this is true over the entire 0.1--30 mpc pair separation range forwhich we can make accurate measurements. we make similar measurements inrealistic mock catalogs in which the only environmental effects are those whicharise from the predicted correlation between halo mass and environment. we alsoprovide an analytic halo-model based calculation of the effect. both the mockcatalogs and the analytic calculation provide rather good descriptions of thesdss measurements. thus, our results provide strong support for hierarchicalmodels. they suggest that, unless care is taken to study galaxies at fixedmass, correlations between galaxy properties and the surrounding environmentare almost entirely due to more fundamental correlations between galaxyproperties and host halo mass, and between halo mass and environment.

astro-ph;0608167	the probability distribution of the lya transmitted flux from a sample  of sdss quasars	we present a measurement of the probability distribution function (pdf) ofthe transmitted flux in the lya forest from a sample of 3492 quasars includedin the sdss dr3 data release. our intention is to investigate the sensitivityof the lya flux pdf as measured from low resolution and low signal-to-noisedata to a number of systematic errors such as uncertainties in the mean flux,continuum and noise estimate. the quasar continuum is described by thesuperposition of a power law and emission lines. we perform a power lawcontinuum fitting on a spectrum-by-spectrum basis, and obtain an averagecontinuum slope of 0.59 +/- 0.36 in the redshift range 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.5. taking intoaccount the variation in the continuum indices increases the mean flux by 3 and7 per cent at z=3 and 2.4, respectively, as compared to the values inferredwith a single (mean) continuum slope. we compare our measurements to the pdfobtained with mock lognormal spectra, whose statistical properties have beenconstrained to match the observed lya flux pdf and power spectrum of highresolution data. using our power law continuum fitting and the sdss pipelinenoise estimate yields a poor agreement between the observed and mock pdfs.allowing for a break in the continuum slope and, more importantly, for residualscatter in the continuum level substantially improves the agreement. a decreaseof 10-15 per cent in the mean quasar continuum with a typical rms variance atthe 20 per cent level can account for the data, provided that the noise excesscorrection is no larger than 10 per cent.

astro-ph;0609547	the scale dependence of halo and galaxy bias: effects in real space	we examine the scale dependence of dark matter, halo and galaxy clustering onvery large scales (0.01&lt;k[h/mpc]&lt;0.15), due to non-linear effects from dynamicsand halo bias. we pursue a two line offensive: high resolution numericalsimulations are used to establish several new results, and an analytic model isdeveloped to understand their origins. our simulations show: (i) that the z=0dark matter power spectrum is suppressed relative to linear theory by ~5% onscales (0.05&lt;k[h/mpc]&lt;0.075); (ii) that, indeed, halo bias is non-linear overthe scales we probe and that the scale dependence is a strong function of halomass. high mass haloes show no suppression of power on scales (k&lt;0.07[h/mpc]),and only show amplification on smaller scales, whereas low mass haloes showstrong, ~5-10%, suppression over the range (0.05 &lt;k[h/mpc] &lt;0.15). our resultshave relevance for studies of the baryon acoustic oscillation features.non-linear mode-mode coupling: (i) damps these features on progressively largerscales as halo mass increases; (ii) produces small shifts in the positions ofthe peaks and troughs which depend on halo mass. our analytic model isdescribed in the language of the `halo-model'. however, for the first time thehalo-halo clustering term is propagated into the non-linear regime using`1-loop' perturbation theory and a non-linear halo bias model. we show that,with bias parameters derived from simulations, the model predictions are inagreement with the numerical results. we then use the model to explore thescale dependence of galaxies of different colour and find significantdifferences between the power spectra of the two populations. thusunderstanding the scale dependent bias for a given galaxy sample will becrucial for deriving accurate cosmological constraints.

astro-ph;0609740	bispectrum and nonlinear biasing of galaxies: perturbation analysis,  numerical simulation and sdss galaxy clustering	we consider nonlinear biasing models of galaxies with particular attention toa correlation between linear and quadratic biasing coefficients, b_1 and b_2.we first derive perturbative expressions for b_1 and b_2 in halo and peakbiasing models. then we compute power spectra and bispectra of dark matterparticles and halos using n-body simulation data and of volume-limitedsubsamples of sloan digital sky survey (sdss) galaxies, and determine their b_1and b_2. we find that the values of those coefficients at linear regimes(k&lt;0.2h/mpc) are fairly insensitive to the redshift-space distortion and thesurvey volume shape. the resulting normalized amplitudes of bispectra, q, forequilateral triangles, are insensitive to the values of b_1 implying that b_2indeed correlates with b_1. the present results explain the previous finding ofkayo et al. (2004) for the hierarchical relation of three-point correlationfunctions of sdss galaxies. while the relations between b_1 and b_2 arequantitatively different for specific biasing models, their approximatelysimilar correlations indicate a fairly generic outcome of the biasing due tothe gravity in primordial gaussian density fields.

astro-ph;0611221	an improved model for the formation times of dark matter haloes	a dark matter halo is said to have formed when at least half its mass hassbeen assembled into a single progenitor. with this definition, it is possibleto derive a simple but useful analytic estimate of the distribution of haloformation times. the standard estimate of this distribution depends on theshape of the conditional mass function--the distribution of progenitor massesof a halo as a function of time. if the spherical collapse model is used toestimate the progenitor mass function, then the formation times one inferssystematically underestimate those seen in numerical simulations ofhierarchical gravitational clustering. we provide estimates of halo formationwhich may be related to an ellipsoidal collapse model. these estimates providea substantially better description of the simulations. we also provide analternative derivation of the formation time distribution which is based on theassumption that haloes increase their mass through binary mergers only. ourresults are useful for models which relate halo structure to halo formation.

astro-ph;0701879	the probability distribution function of the sz power spectrum: an  analytical approach	the sunyaev zel'dovich (sz) signal is highly non-gaussian, so the sz powerspectrum (along with the mean $y$ parameter) does not provide a completedescription of the sz effect. therefore, sz-based constraints on cosmologicalparameters and on cluster gastrophysics which assume gaussianity will bebiased.  we derive an analytic expression for the $n$-point joint pdf of the sz powerspectrum. our derivation, which is based on the halo model, has severaladvantages: it is expressed in an integral form which allows quick computation;it is applicable to any given survey and any given angular scale; it isstraightforward to incorporate many of the complexities which arise whenmodeling the sz signal. to illustrate, we use our expression to estimate$p(c_\ell)$, the one-point pdf of the sz power spectrum. for small sky coverage(applicable to bima/cbi and the sunyaev zel'dovich array experiments), ouranalysis shows that $p(c_\ell)$ on the several arc-minute scale is expected tobe strongly skewed, peaking at a value well below the mean and with a long tailwhich extends to tail high $c_\ell$ values. in the limit of large sky coverage(applicable to the south pole telescope and planck), $p(c_\ell)$ approaches agaussian form. however, even in this limit, the variance of the power spectrumis very different from the naive gaussian-based estimate. this is becausedifferent $\ell$ models are strongly correlated, making the cosmic variance ofthe sz band-power much larger than the naive estimate. our analysis should alsobe useful for modeling the pdf of the power spectrum induced by gravitationallensing at large $\ell$.

astro-ph;0703340	the three-point correlation function of luminous red galaxies in the  sloan digital sky survey	we present measurements of the redshift-space three-point correlationfunction of 50,967 luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from data release 3 (dr3) ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we have studied the shape dependence ofthe reduced three-point correlation function (qz(s,q,theta)) on three differentscales, s=4, 7 and 10 h-1 mpc, and over the range of 1 &lt; q &lt; 3 and 0 &lt; theta &lt;180. on small scales (s=4 h-1 mpc), qz is nearly constant, with little changeas a function of q and theta. however, there is evidence for a shallow u-shapedbehaviour (with theta) which is expected from theoretical modeling of qz . onlarger scales (s=7 and 10 h-1 mpc), the u-shaped anisotropy in qz (with theta)is more clearly detected. we compare this shape-dependence in qz(s,q,theta)with that seen in mock galaxy catalogues which were generated by populating thedark matter halos in large n-body simulations with mock galaxies using varioushalo occupation distributions (hod). we find that the combination of theobserved number density of lrgs, the (redshift-space) two-point correlationfunction and qz provides a strong constraint on the allowed hod parameters(m_min, m_1, alpha) and breaks key degeneracies between these parameters. forexample, our observed qz disfavors mock catalogues that overpopulate massivedark matter halos with many lrg satellites. we also estimate the linear bias oflrgs to be b=1.87+/-0.07 in excellent agreement with other measurements.

astro-ph;0703391	strong clustering of underdense regions and the environmental dependence  of clustering from gaussian initial conditions	we discuss two slightly counter-intuitive findings about the environmentaldependence of clustering in the sloan digital sky survey. first, we find thatthe relation between clustering strength and density is not monotonic: galaxiesin the densest regions are more strongly clustered than are galaxies in regionsof moderate overdensity; galaxies in moderate overdensities are more stronglyclustered than are those in moderate underdensities; but galaxies in moderateunderdensities are less clustered than galaxies in the least dense regions. weargue that this is natural if clustering evolved gravitationally from agaussian field, since the highest peaks and lowest troughs in gaussian fieldsare similarly clustered. the precise non-monotonic dependence of galaxyclustering on density is very well reproduced in a mock catalog which is basedon a halo-model decomposition of galaxy clustering.  second, the distribution of galaxy counts in our sample is rather welldescribed by a poisson cluster model. we show that, despite their poissonnature, correlations with environment are expected in such models. moreremarkably, the expected trends are very like those in standard models of halobias, despite the fact that correlations with environment in these models arisepurely from the fact that dense regions are dense because they happen to hostmore massive halos. this is in contrast to the usual analysis which assumesthat it is the large scale environment which determines the halo mass function.[abridged]

astro-ph;0703537	on estimating redshift and luminosity distributions in photometric  redshift surveys	the luminosity functions of galaxies and quasars provide invaluableinformation about galaxy and quasar formation. estimating the luminosityfunction from magnitude limited samples is relatively straightforward, providedthat the distances to the objects in the sample are known accurately;techniques for doing this have been available for about thirty years. however,distances are usually known accurately for only a small subset of the sample.this is true of the objects in the sloan digital sky survey, and will beincreasingly true of the next generation of deep multi-color photometricsurveys. estimating the luminosity function when distances are only knownapproximately (e.g., photometric redshifts are available, but spectroscopicredshifts are not) is more difficult. i describe two algorithms which canhandle this complication: one is a generalization of the v_max algorithm, andthe other is a maximum likelihood approach. because these methods account foruncertainties in the distance estimate, they impact a broader range of studies.for example, they are useful for studying the abundances of galaxies which aresufficiently nearby that the contribution of peculiar velocity to thespectroscopic redshift is not negligible, so only a noisy estimate of the truedistance is available. in this respect, peculiar velocities and photometricredshift errors have similar effects. the methods developed here are alsouseful for estimating the stellar luminosity function in samples where accurateparallax distances are not available.

astro-ph;0703620	`eppur si muove': on the motion of the acoustic peak in the correlation  function	the baryonic acoustic signature in the large-scale clustering pattern ofgalaxies has been detected in the two-point correlation function. its precisespatial scale has been forwarded as a rigid-rod ruler test for the space-timegeometry, and hence as a probe for tracking the evolution of dark energy.percent-level shifts in the measured position can bias such a test and erodeits power to constrain cosmology. this paper addresses some of the systematiceffects that might induce shifts: namely non-linear corrections from matterevolution, redshift space distortions and biasing. we tackle these questionsthrough analytic methods and through a large battery of numerical simulations,with total volume of the order ~100[gpc\h]^3. a toy-model calculation showsthat if the non-linear corrections simply smooth the acoustic peak, then thisgives rise to an `apparent' shifting to smaller scales. however if tilts in thebroad band power spectrum are induced then this gives rise to more pernicious`physical' shifts. our numerical simulations show evidence of both: in realspace and at z=0, for the dark matter we find percent level shifts; for haloesthe shifts depend on halo mass, with larger shifts being found for the mostbiased samples, up to 3%. from our analysis we find that physical shifts aregreater than ~0.4% at z=0. in redshift space these effects are exacerbated, butat higher redshifts are alleviated. we develop an analytical model tounderstand this, based on solutions to the pair conservation equation usingcharacteristic curves. when combined with modeling of pairwise velocities themodel reproduces the main trends found in the data. the model may also help tounbias the acoustic peak.

astro-ph;9602103	the non-linear correlation function and the shapes of virialized halos	the correlation function xi(r) of matter in the non-linear regime is assumedto be determined by the density profiles rho(r) and the mass distribution n(m)of virialized halos. the press--schechter approach is used to compute n(m), andthe stable clustering hypothesis is used to determine the density profiles ofthese press--schechter halos. thus, the shape and amplitude of xi(r) on smallscales is related to the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations.  the case of clustering from scale-free initial conditions is treated indetail. if n is the slope of the initial power spectrum of densityfluctuations, then stable clustering requires that xi(r)\propto r^{-gamma},where gamma is a known function of n. if halo--halo correlations can beneglected, then rho(r)\propto r^{-epsilon}, where epsilon = (gamma+3)/2 =3(4+n)/(5+n). for all values of n of current interest, this slope is steeperthan the value 3(3+n)/(4+n) that was obtained by hoffman &amp; shaham in theirtreatment of the shapes of the outer regions of collapsed halos. our mainresult is a prediction for the amplitude of the non-linear correlationfunction. the predicted amplitude and its dependence on n are in goodquantitative agreement with n-body simulations of self-similar clustering.  if stable clustering is a good approximation only inside the half-mass radiiof press--schechter halos, then the density contrast required for the onset ofstable clustering can be estimated. this density contrast is in the range~300-600 and increases with the initial slope n, in agreement with estimatesfrom n-body simulations.

astro-ph;9602112	galton--watson branching processes and the growth of gravitational  clustering	the press--schechter description of gravitational clustering from aninitially poisson distribution is shown to be equivalent to the well studiedgalton--watson branching process. this correspondence is used to provide adetailed description of the evolution of hierarchical clustering, including acomplete description of the merger history tree. the relation to branchingprocess epidemic models means that the press--schechter description can also beunderstood using the formalism developed in the study of queues. the queueingtheory formalism, also, is used to provide a complete description of the mergerhistory of any given press--schechter clump. in particular, an analyticexpression for the merger history of any given poisson press--schechter clumpis obtained. this expression allows one to calculate the partition function ofmerger history trees. it obeys an interesting scaling relation; the partitionfunction for a given pair of initial and final epochs is the same as that forcertain other pairs of initial and final epochs.  the distribution function of counts in randomly placed cells, as a functionof time, is also obtained using the branching process and queueing theorydescriptions. thus, the press--schechter description of the gravitationalevolution of clustering from an initially poisson distribution is now complete.all these interrelations show why the press--schechter approach works well in astatistical sense, but cannot provide a detailed description of the dynamics ofthe clustering particles themselves. one way to extend these results to moregeneral gaussian initial conditions is discussed.

astro-ph;9907024	ellipsoidal collapse and an improved model for the number and spatial  distribution of dark matter haloes	the press--schechter, excursion set approach allows one to make predictionsabout the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. itcombines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumptionthat the initial density fluctuations were gaussian and small. while thepredicted mass function is reasonably accurate at the high mass end, it hasmore low mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering.this discrepancy can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumedto form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical collapse. in the sphericalmodel, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a thresholdvalue, delta_sc. this value is independent of the initial size of the region,and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size,delta_sc is independent of final mass. in the ellipsoidal model, the collapseof a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initialoverdensity. therefore, there is a relation between the density threshold valuerequired for collapse, and the mass of the final object. we provide a fittingfunction to this delta_ec(m) relation for initially gaussian fields whichsimplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach.we discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halodistribution in high resolution n-body simulations, and show that our simpleparametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents a significantimprovement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. finally, weshow that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and thelarge scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than thestandard predictions.

0812.0200	spherical collapse and cluster counts in modified gravity models	modifications to the gravitational potential affect the nonlineargravitational evolution of large scale structures in the universe. toillustrate some generic features of such changes, we study the evolution ofspherically symmetric perturbations when the modification is of yukawa type;this is non-trivial, because we should not and do not assume that birkhoff'stheorem applies. we then show how to estimate the abundance of virializedobjects in such models. comparison with numerical simulations shows reasonableagreement: when normalized to have the same fluctuations at early times, weakerlarge scale gravity produces fewer massive halos. however, the opposite can betrue for models that are normalized to have the same linear theory powerspectrum today, so the abundance of rich clusters potentially placesinteresting constraints on such models. our analysis also indicates that theformation histories and abundances of sufficiently low mass objects areunchanged from standard gravity. this explains why simulations have found thatthe nonlinear power-spectrum at large k is unaffected by such modifications tothe gravitational potential. in addition, the most massive objects incmb-normalized models with weaker gravity are expected to be similar to thehigh-redshift progenitors of the most massive objects in models with strongergravity. thus, the difference between the cluster and field galaxy populationsis expected to be larger in models with stronger large-scale gravity.
