0901.3723	jet-lag in sgr a*: what size and timing measurements tell us about the  central black hole in the milky way	the black hole at the galactic center, sgr a*, is the prototype of a galacticnucleus at a very low level of activity. its radio through submm-wave emissionis known to come from a region close to the event horizon, however, the sourceof the emission is still under debate. a successful theory explaining theemission is based on a relativistic jet model scaled down from powerfulquasars. we want to test the predictive power of this established jet modelagainst newly available measurements of wavelength-dependent time lags and thesize-wavelength structure in sgr a*. using all available closure amplitude vlbidata from different groups, we again derived the intrinsic wavelength-dependentsize of sgr a*. this allowed us to calculate the expected frequency-dependenttime lags of radio flares, assuming a range of in- and outflow velocities.moreover, we calculated the time lags expected in the previously publishedpressure-driven jet model. the predicted lags are then compared to radiomonitoring observations at 22, 43, and 350 ghz. the combination of time lagsand size measurements imply a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk outflowspeeds of gamma*beta ~ 0.5-2. the newly measured time lags are reproduced wellby the jet model without any major fine tuning. the results further strengthenthe case for the cm-to-mm wave radio emission in sgr a* as coming from a mildlyrelativistic jet-like outflow. the combination of radio time lag and vlbiclosure amplitude measurements is a powerful new tool for assessing the flowspeed and direction in sgr a*. future vlbi and time lag measurements over arange of wavelengths will reveal more information about sgr a*, such as theexistence of a jet nozzle, and measure the detailed velocity structure of arelativistic jet near its launching point for the first time.

0902.0493	science with a lunar low-frequency array: from the dark ages of the  universe to nearby exoplanets	low-frequency radio astronomy is limited by severe ionospheric distortionsbelow 50 mhz and complete reflection of radio waves below 10-30 mhz. shieldingof man-made interference from long-range radio broadcasts, strong natural radioemission from the earth's aurora, and the need for setting up a largedistributed antenna array make the lunar far side a supreme location for alow-frequency radio array. a number of new scientific drivers for such anarray, such as the study of the dark ages and epoch of reionization,exoplanets, and ultra-high energy cosmic rays, have emerged and need to bestudied in greater detail. here we review the scientific potential andrequirements of these and other new scientific drivers and discuss theconstraints for various lunar surface arrays. in particular we describeobservability constraints imposed by the interstellar and interplanetarymedium, calculate the achievable resolution, sensitivity, and confusion limitof a dipole array using general scaling laws, and apply them to variousscientific questions. whichever science is deemed most important, pathfinderarrays are needed to test the feasibility of these experiments in the not toodistant future. lunar low-frequency arrays are thus a timely option toconsider, offering the potential for significant new insights into a wide rangeof today's crucial scientific topics. this would open up one of the lastunexplored frequency domains in the electromagnetic spectrum.

0911.0739	a time-dependent jet model for the emission from sagittarius a*	the source of emission from sgr a*, the supermassive black hole at thegalactic center, is still unknown. flares and data from multiwavelengthcampaigns provide important clues about the nature of sgr a* itself. here weattempt to constrain the physical origin of the broadband emission and theradio flares from sgr a*. we developed a time-dependent jet model, which forthe first time allows one to compare the model predictions with flare data fromsgr a*. taking into account relevant cooling mechanisms, we calculate thefrequency-dependent time lags and photosphere size expected in the jet model.the predicted lags and sizes are then compared with recent observations. boththe observed time lags and size-frequency relationships are reproduced well bythe model. the combined timing and structural information strongly constrainthe speed of the outflow to be mildly relativistic, and the radio flares arelikely to be caused by a transient increase in the matter channelled into thejets. the model also predicts light curves and structural information at otherwavelengths which could be tested by observations in the near future. we showthat a time-dependent relativistic jet model can successfully reproduce: (1)the quiescent broadband spectral energy distribution of sgr a*, (2) theobserved 22 and 43 ghz light curve morphologies and time lags, and (3) thefrequency-size relationship. the results suggest that the observed emission atradio frequencies from sgr a* is most easily explained by a stratified,optically thick, mildly relativistic jet outflow. frequency-dependentmeasurements of time-lags and intrinsic source size provide strong constraintson the bulk motion of the jet plasma.

1007.4146	general description of electromagnetic radiation processes based on  instantaneous charge acceleration in `endpoints'	we present a new methodology for calculating the electromagnetic radiationfrom accelerated charged particles. our formulation --- the `endpointformulation' --- combines numerous results developed in the literature inrelation to radiation arising from particle acceleration using a complete, andcompletely general, treatment. we do this by describing particle motion via aseries of discrete, instantaneous acceleration events, or `endpoints', witheach such event being treated as a source of emission. this method implicitlyallows for particle creation/destruction, and is suited to direct numericalimplementation in either the time- or frequency-domains. in this paper, wedemonstrate the complete generality of our method for calculating the radiatedfield from charged particle acceleration, and show how it reduces to theclassical named radiation processes such as synchrotron, tamm's description ofvavilov-cherenkov, and transition radiation under appropriate limits. usingthis formulation, we are immediately able to answer outstanding questionsregarding the phenomenology of radio emission from ultra-high-energy particleinteractions in both the earth's atmosphere and the moon. in particular, ourformulation makes it apparent that the dominant emission component of theaskaryan effect (coherent radio-wave radiation from high-energy particlecascades in dense media) comes from coherent `bremsstrahlung' from particleacceleration, rather than coherent vavilov-cherenkov radiation.

1010.4296	jets at lowest mass accretion rates	we present results of recent observations and theoretical modeling of datafrom black holes accreting at very low luminosities (l/l_edd ~ 10^{-8}). wediscuss our newly developed time-dependent model for episodic ejection ofrelativistic plasma within a jet framework, and a successful application ofthis model to describe the origin of radio flares seen in sgr a*, the galacticcenter black hole. both the observed time lags and size-frequency relationshipsare reproduced well by the model. we also discuss results from new spitzer dataof the stellar black hole x-ray binary system a0620-00. complemented by longterm smarts monitoring, these observations indicate that once the contributionfrom the accretion disk and the donor star are properly included, the residualmid-ir spectral energy distribution of a0620-00 is quite flat and consistentwith a non-thermal origin. the results above suggest that a significantfraction of the observed spectral energy distribution originating near blackholes accreting at low luminosities could result from a mildly relativisticoutflow. the fact that these outflows are seen in both stellar-mass black holesas well as in supermassive black holes at the heart of agns strengthens ourexpectation that accretion and jet physics scales with mass.

1010.5239	the jet in the galactic center: an ideal laboratory for  magnetohydrodynamics and general relativity	in this paper we review and discuss some of the intriguing properties of thegalactic center supermassive black hole candidate sgr a*. of all possible blackhole sources, the event horizon of sgr a*, subtends the largest angular scaleon the sky. it is therefore a prime candidate to study and image plasmaprocesses in strong gravity and it even allows imaging of the shadow cast bythe event horizon. recent mm-wave vlbi and radio timing observations as well asnumerical grmhd simulations now have provided several breakthroughs that putsgr a* back into the focus. firstly, vlbi observations have now measured theintrinsic size of sgr a* at multiple frequencies, where the highest frequencymeasurements have approached the scale of the black hole shadow. moreover,measurements of the radio variability show a clear time lag between 22 ghz and43 ghz. the combination of size and timing measurements, allows one to actuallymeasure the flow speed and direction of magnetized plasma at some tens ofschwarzschild radii. this data strongly support a moderately relativisticoutflow, consistent with an accelerating jet model. this is compared to recentgrmhd simulation that show the presence of a moderately relativistic outflowcoupled to an accretion flow sgr a*. further vlbi and timing observationscoupled to simulations have the potential to map out the velocity profile from5-40 schwarzschild radii and to provide a first glimpse at the appearance of ajet-disk system near the event horizon. future submm-vlbi experiments wouldeven be able to directly image those processes in strong gravity and directlyconfirm the presence of an event horizon.

1104.4105	radio jets from stellar tidal disruptions	a star that passes too close to a massive black hole will be torn apart bytidal forces. the flare of photons emitted during the accretion of the stellardebris is predicted to be observable and candidates of such events have beenobserved at optical to x-ray frequencies. if a fraction of the accretedmaterial is fed into a jet, tidal flares should be detectable at radiofrequencies too, thus comprising a new class of rare radio transients. usingthe well-established scaling between accretion power and jet luminosity andbasic synchrotron theory, we construct an empirically-rooted model to predictthe jet luminosity for a time-dependent accretion rate. we apply this model tostellar tidal disruptions and predict the snapshot rate of these events. for asmall angle between the observer and the jet, our model reproduces the observedradio flux of the tidal flare candidate grb 110328a. we find that future radiosurveys will be able to test whether the majority of tidal disruptions areaccompanied by a jet.

1206.0031	radio galaxies of the local universe: all-sky catalog, luminosity  functions, and clustering	to understand the feedback of black holes on their environment or theacceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the present cosmic epoch, asystematic, all-sky inventory of radio galaxies in the local universe isneeded. here we present the first catalog of radio-emitting galaxies that meetsthis requirement. our catalog allows the selection of volume-limited subsamplescontaining all low-power radio galaxies, similar to the prototypical low-powerradio galaxies cen a or m87, within some hundred mpc. it is constructed bymatching radio emission from the nvss and sumss surveys to galaxies of the2mass redshift survey (2mrs) using an image-level algorithm that properlytreats the extended structure of radio sources. the sample contains 575radio-emitting galaxies with a flux greater than 213 mjy at 1.4 ghz. over 30%of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-areaextra-galactic radio samples. we compute the optical and radio luminosityfunctions and the fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxyluminosity. we find that the galaxy density around radio galaxies issignificantly higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity andmorphology. this enhanced clustering suggests a causal relation betweenexternal galaxy properties, such as environment or merger history, and theformation of powerful jets in the present universe. since the enhancement isobserved with respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and hubble type, it isnot primarily driven by black hole mass. our automated matching procedure isfound to select radio-emitting galaxies with high efficiency (99%) and purity(91%), which is key for future processing of deeper, larger samples.

1210.0022	constraints on off-axis jets from stellar tidal disruption flares	many decades of observations of active galactic nuclei and x-ray binarieshave shown that relativistic jets are ubiquitous when compact objects accrete.one could therefore anticipate the launch of a jet after a star is disruptedand accreted by a massive black hole. this birth of a relativistic jet may havebeen observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (tdfs), whichwere discovered in gamma-rays by swift. yet no transient radio emission hasbeen detected from the tens of tdf candidates that were discovered at opticalto soft x-ray frequencies. because the sample that was followed-up at radiofrequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by doppler boosting,which reduces the jet flux for off-axis observers. and since the existingfollow-up observation are mostly within ~10 months of the discovery, thenon-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with respect tothe time of disruption. to test the conjecture that all tdfs launch jets, weobtained 5 ghz follow-up observations with the jansky vla of seven known tdfs.to avoid missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8 years sincethe estimated time of disruption. none of the sources are detected, with verydeep upper limits at the 10 micro jansky level. these observations rule out thehypothesis that these tdfs launched jets similar to radio-loud quasars. we alsoconstrain the possibility that the flares hosted a jet identical to sw 1644+57,the first and best-sampled relativistic tdf. we thus obtain evidence for adichotomy in the stellar tidal disruption population, implying that the jetlaunching mechanism is sensitive to the parameters of the disruption.

1307.1409	fast radio bursts: the last sign of supramassive neutron stars	several fast radio bursts have been discovered recently, showing a bright,highly dispersed millisecond radio pulse. the pulses do not repeat and are notassociated with a known pulsar or gamma-ray burst. the high dispersion suggestssources at cosmological distances, hence implying an extremely high radioluminosity, far larger than the power of single pulses from a pulsar. wesuggest that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassiverotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking.the neutron star is initially above the critical mass for non-rotating modelsand is supported by rapid rotation. as magnetic braking constantly reduces thespin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black hole several thousandto million years after its birth. we discuss several formation scenarios forsupramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures{making use of the results of recent numerical general-relativisticcalculations. while the collapse will hide the stellar surface behind an eventhorizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently. this can turn an almostordinary pulsar into a bright radio "blitzar": accelerated electrons from thetravelling magnetic shock dissipate a significant fraction of the magnetosphereand produce a massive radio burst that is observable out to z&gt;0.7. only a fewpercent of the neutron stars needs to be supramassive in order to explain theobserved rate. we suggest that fast radio bursts might trace the solitaryformation of stellar mass black holes at high redshifts. these bursts could bean electromagnetic complement to gravitational-wave emission and reveal a newformation and evolutionary channel for black holes that are not seen asgamma-ray bursts. radio observations of these bursts could trace thecore-collapse supernova rate throughout the universe.

1308.1437	the contribution of spin to jet-disk coupling in black holes	the spin of supermassive black holes could power jets from active galacticnuclei (agn), although direct observational evidence for this conjecture issparse. the accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, havelong been observed to follow a linear correlation. if jet power is coupled toblack hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of agncan be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.to exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the firstsurvey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from sdss. we obtain 763 fr-iiquasars with a median redshift of z=1.2 a tight correlation between the opticalluminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. weestimate that 5-20% of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jetpower. most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due toenvironment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e.g.,spin) contribute at most 0.2 dex. under the assumption that theblandford-znajek mechanism operates in agn, we obtain an upper limit of 0.1 dexto the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threadingthe horizon. if black hole spin determines the agn jet efficiency, then ourobservations imply that all fr-ii quasars have very similar spin. in addition,the quasar spin distribution needs to have a wide gap to explain theradio-quiet population. the alternative, and perhaps more likely,interpretation of the tight jet-disk correlation is that black hole spin is notrelevant for powering agn jets.

1309.4672	the angular broadening of the galactic center pulsar sgr j1745-29: a new  constraint on the scattering medium	the pulsed radio emission from the galactic center (gc) magnetar sgr j1745-29probes the turbulent, magnetized plasma of the gc hyperstrong scattering screenthrough both angular and temporal broadening. we present the first measurementsof the angular size of sgr j1745-29, obtained with the very long baseline arrayand the phased very large array at 8.7 and 15.4 ghz. the source sizes areconsistent with the scatter--broadened size of sagittarius a* at eachfrequency, demonstrating that sgr j1745-29 is also located behind the samehyperstrong scattering medium. combining the angular broadening with temporalscattering obtained from pulsar observations provides a complete picture of thescattering properties. if the scattering occurs in a thin screen, then it mustbe at a distance \delta &gt;~ 5 kpc. a best-fit solution for the distance of athin screen is \delta=5.9 +/-0.3 kpc, consistent with being located in thescutum spiral arm. this is a substantial revision of the previously held modelin which the scattering screen is located very close to the gc. as alsodiscussed in spitler et al., these results suggest that gc searches can detectmillisecond pulsars gravitationally bound to sgr a* with observations at &gt;~ 10ghz and ordinary pulsars at even lower frequencies.

1311.1841	towards the event horizon -- the supermassive black hole in the galactic  center	the center of our galaxy hosts the best constrained supermassive black holein the universe, sagittarius a* (sgr a*). its mass and distance have beenaccurately determined from stellar orbits and proper motion studies,respectively, and its high-frequency radio, and highly variable near-infraredand x-ray emission originate from within a few schwarzschild radii of the eventhorizon. the theory of general relativity (gr) predicts the appearance of ablack hole shadow, which is a lensed image of the event horizon. this shadowcan be resolved by very long baseline radio interferometry and test basicpredictions of gr and alternatives thereof. in this paper we review our currentunderstanding of the physical properties of sgr a*, with a particular emphasison the radio properties, the black hole shadow, and models for the emission andappearance of the source. we argue that the galactic center holds enormouspotential for experimental tests of black hole accretion and theories ofgravitation in their strong limits.

1408.4743	observational appearance of inefficient accretion flows and jets in 3d  grmhd simulations: application to sgr~a*	radiatively inefficient accretion flows (riafs) are believed to powersupermassive black holes (smbh) in the underluminous cores of galaxies. suchblack holes are typically accompanied by flat-spectrum radio cores indicatingthe presence of moderately relativistic jets. one of the best constrained riafsis associated with the smbh in the galactic center, sgr a*. since the plasma inriafs is only weakly collisional, the dynamics and the radiative properties ofthese systems are very uncertain. here we want to study the impact of varyingelectron temperature on the appearance of accretion flows and jets. using 3-dgrmhd accretion flow simulations, we use ray tracing methods to predict spectraand radio images of riafs allowing for different electron heating mechanisms inthe in- and outflowing parts of the simulations. we find that small changes inthe electron temperature can result in dramatic differences in the relativedominance of jets and accretion flows. application to sgr a* shows that radiospectrum and size of this source can be well reproduced with a model whereelectrons are more efficiently heated in the jet. the x-ray emission issensitive to the electron heating mechanism in the jets and disk and thereforex-ray observations put strong constraints on electron temperatures and geometryof the accretion flow and jet. for sgr a*, the jet model also predicts asignificant frequency-dependent core shift which could place independentconstraints on the model once measured accurately. we conclude that moresophisticated models for electron distribution functions are crucial forconstraining grmhd simulations with actual observations. for sgr a*, the radioappearance may well be dominated by the outflowing plasma. nonetheless, at thehighest radio frequencies, the shadow of the event horizon should still bedetectable with future very long baseline interferometric observations.

1503.08865	megahertz peaked-spectrum sources in the bo\"otes field i - a route  towards finding high-redshift agn?	we present a 324.5mhz image of the noao bo\"otes field that was made usingvery large array (vla) p-band observations. the image has a resolution of5.6x5.1arcsec, a radius of $2.05^\circ$ and a central noise of ~0.2mjy\beam.both the resolution and noise of the image are an order of magnitude betterthan what was previously available at this frequency and will serve as avaluable addition to the already extensive multiwavelength data that areavailable for this field. the final source catalogue contains 1370 sources andhas a median 325 to 1400mhz spectral index of -0.72. using a radiocolour-colour diagram of the unresolved sources in our catalogue, we identify33 megahertz peaked-spectrum (mps) sources. based on the turnover frequencylinear size relation for the gigahertz peaked-spectrum (gps) and compactsteep-spectrum (css) sources, we expect that the mps sources that are compacton scales of tens of milliarcseconds should be young radio loud active galacticnuclei at high (z&gt;2) redshifts. of the 33 mps sources, we were able todetermine redshifts for 24, with an average redshift of 1.3. given that five ofthe sources are at z&gt;2, that the four faint sources for which we could not findredshifts are likely at even higher redshifts and that we could only selectsources that are compact on a scale of ~5arcsec, there is encouraging evidencethat the mps method can be used to search for high-redshift sources.

astro-ph;0005382	radio sources in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. i. vla  detections of compact, flat-spectrum cores	we report a 0.2" resolution, 15 ghz survey of a sample of 48 low-luminosityactive galactic nuclei with the very large array. compact radio emission hasbeen detected in 57% (17 of 30) of liners and low-luminosity seyferts, at least15 of which have a flat to inverted radio spectrum (alpha &gt; -0.3). the compactradio cores are found in both type 1 (i.e. with broad halpha) and type 2(without broad halpha) nuclei. the 2 cm radio power is significantly correlatedwith the emission-line ([oi] lambda6300) luminosity. while the presentobservations are consistent with the radio emission originating in star-formingregions, higher resolution radio observations of 10 of the detected sources,reported in a companion paper (falcke et al. 2000), show that the cores arevery compact (&lt; pc), of high brightness temperature (t(b) &gt;= 10^8k) andprobably synchrotron self-absorbed, ruling out a starburst origin. thus, ourresults suggest that at least 50% of low-luminosity seyferts and liners in thesample are accretion powered, with the radio emission presumably coming fromjets or advection-dominated accretion flows. we have detected only 1 of 18`transition' (i.e. liner + hii) nuclei observed, indicating their radio coresare significantly weaker than those of `pure' liners.

astro-ph;0005383	radio sources in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. ii. vlbi  detections of compact radio cores and jets in a sample of liners	we have used the vlba at 5 ghz to observe all galaxies with nuclear radioflux densities above 3.5 mjy found in a vla survey at 15 ghz of a sample ofnearby liner galaxies. all galaxies were detected revealing high brightnesstemperature ($t_{b} \ga 10^8$ k) radio sources. free-free emission is unlikelysince it greatly overpredicts the soft x-ray luminosities. we infer thepresence of agn-like, non-thermal radio emission most likely powered byunder-fed black holes. together with our vla sample we estimate from ourobservations that at least half of liner galaxies host genuine agn. we find noevidence for highly inverted radio cores as predicted in the adaf model: the(non-simultaneous) spectral indices are on average around $\alpha=0.0$. in thetwo brightest sources we detect some extended emission, which appears tooriginate in jets in at least one of these galaxies. together with the spectralindices this suggests that the nuclear emission at centimeter radio waves islargely dominated by emission from radio jets, very similar to the situation inmore luminous agn. the energy released in these jets could be a significantfraction of the energy budget in the accretion flow.

astro-ph;0010560	a jet model for the broadband spectrum of xte j1118+480: synchrotron  emission from radio to x-rays in the low/hard spectral state	observations have revealed strong evidence for powerful jets in the low/hardstates of black hole candidate x-ray binaries. correlations, both temporal andspectral, between the radio -- infrared and x-ray bands suggest that jetsynchrotron as well as inverse compton emission could also be significantlycontributing at higher frequencies. we show here that, for reasonableassumptions about the jet physical parameters, the broadband spectrum fromradio through x-rays can be almost entirely fit by synchrotron emission. weexplore a relatively simple model for a relativistic, adiabatically expandingjet combined with a truncated thermal disk conjoined by an adaf, in the contextof the recently discovered black hole binary xte j1118+480. in particular, thex-ray power-law emission can be explained as optically thin synchrotronemission from a shock acceleration region in the innermost part of the jet,with a cutoff determined by cooling losses. for synchrotron cooling-limitedparticle acceleration, the spectral cutoff is a function only of dimensionlessplasma parameters and thus should be around a ``canonical'' value for sourceswith similar plasma properties. it is therefore possible that non-thermal jetemission is important for xte j1118+480 and possibly other x-ray binaries inthe low/hard state.

astro-ph;0102186	the jet model for sgr a*: radio and x-ray spectrum	the preliminary detection of the galactic center black hole sgr a* in x-raysby the chandra mission, as well as recent mm-vlbi measurements, impose strictconstraints on this source. using a relativistic jet model for sgr a*, wecalculate the synchrotron and synchrotron self-compton emission. the predictedspectrum provides an excellent fit to the radio spectrum and the the x-rayobservations. limits on the infrared flux and the low x-ray flux require ahigh-energy cut-off in the electron spectrum at gamma_e ~&lt; 100. the impliedlack of a significant power-law tail of high-energy electrons also suppressesthe appearance of the extended, optically thin radio emission usually seen inastrophysical jets. the jet therefore appears rather compact and naturallysatisfies current vlbi limits. the initial parameters of the model are tightlyconstrained by the radio spectrum and the "submm-bump" in particular. while thejet most likely is coupled to some kind of accretion flow, we suggest that themost visible signatures can be produced by this outflow. if ssc emission fromthe jet contributes to the sgr a* spectrum, significant variability in x-rayswould be expected. the model could be generic for other low-luminosity agn oreven x-ray binaries.

astro-ph;0111356	the power of jets: new clues from radio circular polarization and x-rays	jets are ubiquitous in accreting black holes. often ignored, they may be amajor contributor to the emitted spectral energy distribution for sub-eddingtonblack holes. for example, recent observations of radio-to-x-ray correlationsand broad band spectra of x-ray binaries in the low/hard state can be explainedby a significant synchrotron contribution from jets also to their ir-to-x-rayspectrum as proposed by markoff, falcke, fender 2001. this model can alsoexplain state-transitions from low/hard to high/soft states. relativisticbeaming of the jet x-ray emission could lead to the appearance of seeminglysuper-eddington x-rays sources in other galaxies. we show that a simplepopulation synthesis model of x-ray binaries with relativistic beaming can wellexplain the currently found distribution of off-nucleus x-ray point sources innearby galaxies. specifically we suggest that the so-called ultra-luminousx-ray sources (ulxs, also ixos) could well be relativistically beamedmicroblazars. the same model that can be used to explain x-ray binaries alsofits low-luminosity agn (llagn) and especially sgr a* in the galactic center.the recent detection of significant circular polarization in agn radio cores,ranging from bright quasars down to low-luminosity agn like m81*, sgr a* andeven x-ray binaries, now places additional new constraints on the mattercontents of such jets. the emerging picture are powerful jets with a mix of hotand cold matter, a net magnetic flux, and a stable magnetic north pole.

astro-ph;0112385	population x: are the super-eddington x-ray sources beamed jets in  microblazars or intermediate mass black holes?	recent x-ray observations reveal an increasing number of x-ray sources innearby galaxies exceeding luminosities of l_x &gt; 2 10^39 erg/s. assumingisotropic emission, the eddington limit suggests a population ofintermediate-mass black holes of m_bh &gt;&gt; 10 m_sun. however, markoff, falcke, &amp;fender (2001) proposed that jets may be contributing to the x-ray emission fromx-ray binaries (xrbs), implying that some x-ray sources may be relativisticallybeamed. this could reduce the required black hole masses to standard values. totest this hypothesis, we investigate a simple x-ray population synthesis modelfor x-ray point sources in galaxies with relativistic beaming and compare itwith an isotropic emission model. the model is used to explain a combined dataset of x-ray point sources in nearby galaxies. we show that the currentdistributions are consistent with black hole masses m_bh &lt;=10 m_sun and bulklorentz factors for jets in microquasars of gamma_j ~ 5. alternatively,intermediate mass black holes up to 1000 m_sun are required which aredistributed in a powerlaw with roughly dn/dm ~ m^-2.

astro-ph;0112398	circular polarization of radio emission from relativistic jets	in inhomogeneous optically thick synchrotron sources a substantial part ofthe electron population at low energies can be hidden by self-absorption andoverpowered by high energy electrons in optically thin emission. theseinvisible electrons produce faraday rotation and conversion, leaving theirfootprints in the linear and circular polarized radiation of the source. animportant factor is also the magnetic field structure, which can becharacterized in most cases by a global magnetic field and a turbulentcomponent. we present the basic radiative transfer coefficients for polarizedsynchrotron radiation and apply them to the standard jet model for relativisticradio jets. the model can successfully explain the unusual circular and linearpolarization of the galactic centre radio source sgr a* and its sibling m81*.it also can account for the circular polarization found in jets of moreluminous quasars and x-ray binaries. the high ratio of circular to linearpolarization requires the presence of a significant fraction of hidden matterand low-energy electrons in these jets. the stable handedness of circularpolarization requires stable global magnetic field components withnon-vanishing magnetic flux along the jet, while the low degree of totalpolarization implies also a significant turbulent field. the most favouredmagnetic field configuration is that of a helix, while a purely toroidal fieldis unable to produce significant circular polarization. if connected to themagnetosphere of the black hole, the circular polarization and the jetdirection determine the magnetic poles of the system which is stable over longperiods of time. this may also have implications for possible magnetic fieldconfigurations in accretion flows.

astro-ph;0112464	a jet-adaf model for sgr a*	the recent {\em chandra} observation of the radio source at the center of ourgalaxy, sgr a$^*$, puts new constraints on its theoretical models. the spectrumis very soft, and the source is rapidly variable. we consider different modelsto explain the observations. we find that the features of the x-ray spectrumcan be marginally explained with an advection-dominated accretion flow (adaf)model while it does not well fit the radio spectrum. an adaf with strong winds(adios) model is not favored if we assume that the wind does not radiate.alternatively, we propose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model to explainthe observations for sgr a$^*$. the accretion flow is described as an adaf fedby bondi-hoyle accretion of hot plasma in the galactic center region. a smallfraction of the accretion flow is ejected near the black hole, forming a jetafter passing through a shock. as a result, the electron temperature increasesto $\sim 2 \times 10^{11}{\rm k}$, which is about 10 times higher than thehighest temperature attained in the adaf. the model is self-consistent sincethe main jet parameters are determined by the underlying accretion disk at theinner edge. the emergent spectrum of sgr a$^*$ is the sum of the emission fromjet and underlying adaf. the very strong comptonization of synchrotron emissionfrom the jet dominates the bremsstrahlung from the adaf, therefore, a veryshort variability timescale is expected and the predicted x-ray slope and theradio spectrum is in very good agreement with the observations.

astro-ph;0205531	ngc4258: a jet-dominated low-luminosity agn?	low-luminosity agns (llagns) are a very important class of sources since theyoccupy a significant fraction of local galaxies. their spectra differsignificantly from the canonical luminous agns, most notably by the absence ofthe ``big blue bump''. in the present paper, taking a typicalllagn--ngc4258--as an example, we investigate the origin of their spectralemission. the observational data of ngc4258 is extremely abundant, includingwater maser emission, putting very strict constraints to its theoreticalmodels. the infrared (ir) spectrum is well described by a steep power-law form$f_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-1.4}$, and may extend to the optical/uv band. up untilnow there is no model which can explain such a steep spectrum, and we herepropose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model for ngc4258. the accretion diskis composed of an inner adaf (or radiatively inefficient accretion flow) and anouter standard thin disk. a shock occurs when the accretion flow is ejected outof the adaf to form the jet near the black hole, accelerating the electronsinto a power-law energy distribution. the synchrotron and self-comptonizedemission from these electrons greatly dominates over the underlying accretiondisk and can well explain the spectrum ranging from ir to x-ray bands. thefurther propagation of the shocked gas in the jet can explain the flat radiospectrum of ngc4258. several predictions of our model are presented for testingagainst future observations, and we briefly discuss the application of themodel to other llagns.

astro-ph;0207226	detecting radio emission from cosmic ray air showers and neutrinos with  a digital radio telescope	we discuss the possibilities of measuring ultra-high energy cosmic rays andneutrinos with radio techniques. we review a few of the properties of radioemission from cosmic ray air showers and show how these properties can beexplained by coherent ``geosynchrotron'' emission from electron-positron pairsin the shower as they move through the geomagnetic field. this should allow oneto use the radio emission as a useful diagnostic tool for cosmic ray research.a new generation of digital telescopes will make it possible to study thisradio emission in greater detail. for example, the planned low-frequency array(lofar), operating at 10-200 mhz, will be an instrument uniquely suited tostudy extensive air showers and even detect neutrino-induced showers on themoon. we discuss sensitivities, count rates and possible detection algorithmsfor lofar and a currently funded prototype station lopes. this should also beapplicable to other future digital radio telescopes such as thesquare-kilometer-array (ska). lofar will be capable of detecting air-showerradio emission from &gt;2*10^14 ev to ~10^20 ev. the technique could be easilyextended to include air shower arrays consisting of particle detectors(kascade, auger), thus providing crucial additional information for obtainingenergy and chemical composition of cosmic rays. it also has the potential toextend the cosmic ray search well beyond an energy of 10^21 ev if isotropicradio signatures can be found. other issues that lofar can address are todetermine the neutral component of the cosmic ray spectrum, possibly look forneutron bursts, and do actual cosmic ray astronomy.

astro-ph;0211503	single and binary black holes and their active environment	in this short review we describe some of the latest endeavours to understandthe activity around black holes. first, it has been possible to demonstratethat a large part of the electromagnetic emission observed can be interpretedas arising from the jet; this explains at once all spectral features and theirvariability. second we dwell on the concept that merging galaxies naturallylead to merging black holes. here we emphasize two aspects: a) the torqueexerted by the binary black holes carves a torus like distribution out of thestellar population near to the black hole binary; b) we consider the laststages of the black hole binary merger, taking into account the angle betweenthe spin of the primary black hole, and the orbital spin of the second blackhole. we show that the loss of orbital angular momentum is very stronglyspin-dependent; for large angles between the two spins the angular momentumloss is strongly inhibited, allowing spin flip of the primary black hole whichpreserves a high angular momentum relative to the maximum allowed. this ensuresthat both before and after the merger the accretion disk may reach to verysmall distances from the central black hole, with very high local temperaturesright near the base of the jet: this is especially interesting in the case thatforming the jet requires the formation of an adaf like ring near the inner edgeof the disk, as suggested by some earlier work. it also may have consequencesfor the initial hadronic interactions right near the base of the jet. finally,this may also have important implications for the discovery of gravitationalradiation bursts from the merger of black holes; the spin dependence needs tobe taken into account.

astro-ph;0302227	interferometric detection of linear polarization from sagittarius a* at  230 ghz	we measured the linear polarization of sagittarius a* to be 7.2 +/- 0.6 % at230 ghzusing the bima array with a resolution of 3.6 x 0.9 arcsec. thisconfirms the previously reported detection with the jcmt 14-m antenna. our highresolution observations demonstrate that the polarization does not arise fromdust but from a synchrotron source associated with sgr a*. we see no change inthe polarization position angle and only a small change in the polarizationfraction in four observations distributed over 60 days. we find a positionangle 139 +/- 4 degrees that differs substantially from what was found inearlier jcmt observations at the same frequency. polarized dust emission cannotaccount for this discrepancy leaving variability and observational error as theonly explanations. the bima observations alone place an upper limit on themagnitude of the rotation measure of 2 x 10^6 rad m^-2. these new observationswhen combined with the jcmt observations at 150, 375 and 400 ghz suggest rm=-4.3 +/- 0.1 x 10^5 rad m^-2. this rm may be caused by an external faradayscreen. barring a special geometry or a high number of field reversals, this rmrules out accretion rates greater than ~ 10^-7 m_sun y^-1. this measurement isinconsistent with high accretion rates necessary in standard advectiondominated accretion flow and bondi-hoyle models for sgr a*. it argues for lowaccretion rates as a major factor in the overall faintness of sgr a*.

astro-ph;0305335	a scheme to unify low-power accreting black holes - jet-dominated  accretion flows and the radio/x-ray correlation	we explore the evolution in power of black holes of all masses, and theirassociated jets, within the scheme of an accretion rate-dependent statetransition. below a critical value of the accretion rate all systems areassumed to undergo a transition to a state where the dominant accretion mode isoptically thin and radiatively inefficient. in these significantlysub-eddington systems, the spectral energy distribution is predicted to bedominated by non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet whereasnear-eddington black holes will be dominated instead by emission from theaccretion disk. reasonable candidates for such a sub-eddington state includex-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states, the galactic center (sgr a*),liners, fr i radio galaxies, and a large fraction of bl lac objects. standardjet physics predicts non-linear scaling between the optically thick (radio) andoptically thin (optical or x-ray) emission of these systems, which has beenconfirmed recently in x-ray binaries. we show that this scaling relation isalso a function of black hole mass and only slightly of the relativisticdoppler factor. taking the scaling into account we show that indeed hard andquiescent state x-ray binaries, liners, fr i radio galaxies, and bl lacs can beunified and fall on a common radio/x-ray correlation. this suggests that jetdomination is an important stage in the luminosity evolution of accreting blackhole systems.

astro-ph;0309622	radio emission from cosmic ray air showers: coherent geosynchrotron  radiation	cosmic ray air showers have been known for over 30 years to emit pulsed radioemission in the frequency range from a few to a few hundred mhz, an effect thatoffers great opportunities for the study of extensive air showers with upcomingfully digital "software radio telescopes" such as lofar and the enhancement ofparticle detector arrays such as kascade grande or the pierre augerobservatory. however, there are still a lot of open questions regarding thestrength of the emission as well as the underlying emission mechanism.accompanying the development of a lofar prototype station dedicated to theobservation of radio emission from extensive air showers, lopes, we thereforetake a new approach to modeling the emission process, interpreting it as"coherent geosynchrotron emission" from electron-positron pairs gyrating in theearth's magnetic field. we develop our model in a step-by-step procedureincorporating increasingly realistic shower geometries in order to disentanglethe coherence effects arising from the different scales present in the airshower structure and assess their influence on the spectrum and radialdependence of the emitted radiation. we infer that the air shower "pancake"thickness directly limits the frequency range of the emitted radiation, whilethe radial dependence of the emission is mainly governed by the intrinsicbeaming cone of the synchrotron radiation and the superposition of the emissionover the air shower evolution as a whole. our model succeeds in reproducing thequalitative trends in the emission spectrum and radial dependence that wereobserved in the past, and is consistent with the absolute level of the emissionwithin the relatively large systematic errors in the experimental data.

astro-ph;0310641	x-ray time lags from a pivoting power law in black holes	most black hole candidate x-ray binaries show fourier time lags betweensofter and harder x-rays. the hard photons seem to arrive up to a few ms afterthe soft for a given fourier frequency of the perturbation. the energydependence of the time lags has a roughly logarithmic behavior. up to now mosttheories fail to explain the observed magnitude and fourier frequencydependence of the lags or fail other statistical tests. we show that the timelags can arise from a simple pivoting power law model, which creates thelogarithmic dependence on the photon energy at once. a pivoting power lawarises naturally from jet/synchrotron models for the x-ray emission, but mayalso be applicable to corona models. a hint to the coherence features of thelight-curves can be obtained from the power spectral density, which can bedecomposed into a few broad lorentzians that could arise from a couple ofstrongly damped oscillators with low quality factors below one. using smallvariations of the power law index for each lorentzian separately the lags canbe derived analytically. they show the correct fourier frequency dependence ofthe time lags. if one assumes variations of the power law index by +- 0.2 themodel can account for the observed magnitude of the time lags in cyg x-1. as afurther test we calculated the cross- and auto-correlation functions for ourmodel, which also show qualitatively the observed behavior. the coherencefunction for the model is in agreement with the observed data in the fourierregime, where the model is valid.

astro-ph;0409223	radio emission from cosmic ray air showers: monte carlo simulations	we present time-domain monte carlo simulations of radio emission from cosmicray air showers in the scheme of coherent geosynchrotron radiation. our modeltakes into account the important air shower characteristics such as the lateraland longitudinal particle distributions, the particle track length and energydistributions, a realistic magnetic field geometry and the shower evolution asa whole. the monte carlo approach allows us to retain the full polarisationinformation and to carry out the calculations without the need for anyfar-field approximations. we demonstrate the strategies developed to tackle thecomputational effort associated with the simulation of a huge number ofparticles for a great number of observer bins and illustrate the robustness andaccuracy of these techniques. we predict the emission pattern, the radial andthe spectral dependence of the radiation from a prototypical 10^17 ev verticalair shower and find good agreement with our analytical results (huege &amp; falcke2003) and the available historical data. track-length effects in combinationwith magnetic field effects surprisingly wash out any significant asymmetry inthe total field strength emission pattern in spite of the magnetic fieldgeometry. while statistics of total field strengths alone can therefore notprove the geomagnetic origin, the predicted high degree of polarisation in thedirection perpendicular to the shower and magnetic field axes allows a directtest of the geomagnetic emission mechanism with polarisation-sensitiveexperiments such as lopes. our code provides a robust, yet flexible basis fordetailed studies of the dependence of the radio emission on specific showerparameters and for the inclusion of additional radiation mechanism in thefuture.

astro-ph;0502347	the murmur of the sleeping black hole: detection of nuclear ultraviolet  variability in liner galaxies	liner nuclei, which are present in many nearby galactic bulges, may be themanifestation of low-rate or low-radiative-efficiency accretion ontosupermassive central black holes. however, it has been unclear whether thecompact uv nuclear sources present in many liners are clusters of massivestars, rather than being directly related to the accretion process. we haveused hst to monitor the uv variability of a sample of 17 galaxies with linernuclei and compact nuclear uv sources. fifteen of the 17 galaxies were observedmore than once, with two to five epochs per galaxy, spanning up to a year. wedetect significant variability in most of the sample, with peak-to-peakamplitudes from a few percent to 50%. in most cases, correlated variations areseen in two independent bands (f250w and f330w). comparison to previous uvmeasurements indicates, for many objects, long-term variations by factors of afew over decade timescales. variability is detected in liners with and withoutdetected compact radio cores, in liners that have broad h-alpha wings detectedin their optical spectra (``liner 1's''), and in those that do not (``liner2s''). this variability demonstrates the existence of a non-stellar componentin the uv continuum of all types, and sets a lower limit to the luminosity ofthis component. we note a trend in the uv color (f250w/f330w) with spectraltype - liner 1s tend to be bluer than liner 2s. this trend may indicate a linkbetween the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or thevisibility of a broad-line region. in one target, the post-starburst galaxy ngc4736, we detect variability in a previously noted uv source that is offset by2.5" (60 pc in projection) from the nucleus. this may be the nearest example ofa binary active nucleus, and of the process leading to black hole merging.

astro-ph;0502551	radio sources in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.iv. radio  luminosity function, importance of jet power, and radio properties of the  complete palomar sample	we present the completed results of a high resolution radio imaging survey ofall (~200) low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) and agns in thepalomar spectroscopic sample. the high incidences of pc-scale radio nuclei,with t(brightness) &gt;=10^7 k, and sub-parsec jets argue for accreting blackholes in &gt;=50% of all liners and low-luminosity seyferts; there is no evidenceagainst all llagns being mini-agns. the radio luminosity function (rlf) ofpalomar sample llagns and agns extends three orders of magnitude below, and iscontinuous with, that of `classical' agns. we find marginal evidence for alow-power turnover in the rlf; nevertheless llagns are responsible for asignificant fraction of present day mass accretion. adopting the jet model offalcke &amp; biermann, we show that the accretion energy output in llagns isdominated by the energy in the observed jets rather than the radiatedbolometric luminosity. the palomar llagns and agns follow the same scalingbetween jet power and narrow line region (nlr) luminosity as the pc to kpc jetsin powerful radio galaxies. eddington ratios of &lt;= 10^{-1} - 10^{-5} areimplied in jet models of the radio emission. we find evidence that, in analogyto galactic black hole candidates, liners are in a `low/hard' state (gas poornuclei, low eddington ratio, ability to launch collimated jets) whilelow-luminosity seyferts are in a `high' state (gas rich nuclei, highereddington ratio, less likely to launch collimated jets). the jets areenergetically more significant than supernovae in the llagn host galaxies, andare potentially able to deposit sufficient energy into the innermost parsecs tosignificantly slow the gas supply to the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0507025	simulations and parametrisation of radio emission from cosmic ray air  showers	cosmic ray air showers are known to emit pulsed radio emission at frequenciesaround a few tens of mhz. accompanying the experimental efforts of the lopesproject, situated at the kascade-grande site of the forschungszentrumkarlsruhe, we have modeled the underlying emission mechanism in the scheme ofcoherent geosynchrotron radiation from electron-positron pairs deflected in theearth's magnetic field. as a follow-up to our earlier analytical calculations,we have developed a monte carlo simulation based on analytic parametrisationsof air shower properties, including longitudinal and lateral particledistributions, particle energy and track-length distributions, and thelongitudinal shower development as a whole. here we present detailed simulationresults. important findings are the absence of significant asymmetries in thetotal field strength emission pattern in spite of the asymmetry introduced bythe geomagnetic field, the polarisation characteristics of the geosynchrotronemission, allowing an unambiguous test of the geomagnetic emission mechanism,and the dependence of the radio emission on important shower parameters such asthe shower zenith angle, the primary particle energy and the depth of theshower maximum. as a particularly useful result, these dependences have beensummarized in a simple parametrisation formula, providing a solid basis for theinterpretation of experimental data gathered with current and futureexperiments.

astro-ph;0603117	refining the fundamental plane of accreting black holes	the idea of a unified description of supermassive and stellar black holes hasbeen supported by the extension of the empirical radio/x-ray correlation fromx-ray binaries to active galactic nuclei through the inclusion of a mass term.this has lead to the so-called fundamental plane of black hole activity in theblack hole mass, radio and x-ray luminosity space. two incarnations of thisfundamental plane have so far been suggested using different underlying modelsand using two different samples of accreting black holes. we present revisedsamples for both studies together with a refined statistical analysis usingmeasured errors of the observables. this method is used to compare the twosamples, discuss selection effects, and infer parameters for the fundamentalplane in a homogeneous way. we show that strongly sub-eddington objects in astate equivalent to the low/hard state of x-ray binaries follow the fundamentalplane very tightly; the scatter is comparable to the measurement errors.however, we find that the estimated parameters depend strongly on theassumptions made on the sources of scatter and the relative weight of thedifferent agn classes in the sample. using only hard state objects, thefundamental plane is in agreement with the prediction of a simple uncooledsynchrotron/jet model for the emitted radiation. inclusion of high-stateobjects increases the scatter and moves the correlation closer to a disk/jetmodel. this is qualitatively consistent with a picture where low-state objectsare largely dominated by jet emission while high-state objects have a strongcontribution from an accretion disk.

astro-ph;0606381	the rotation measure and 3.5mm polarization of sgr a*	we report the detection of variable linear polarization from sgr a* at awavelength of 3.5mm, the longest wavelength yet at which a detection has beenmade. the mean polarization is 2.1 +/- 0.1% at a position angle of 16 +/- 2 degwith rms scatters of 0.4% and 9 deg over the five epochs. we also detectpolarization variability on a timescale of days. combined with previousdetections over the range 150-400ghz (750-2000 microns), the averagepolarization position angles are all found to be consistent with a rotationmeasure of -4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10^5 rad/m^2. this implies that the faraday rotationoccurs external to the polarized source at all wavelengths. this implies anaccretion rate ~0.2 - 4 x 10^-8 msun/yr for the accretion density profilesexpected of adaf, jet and cdaf models and assuming that the region at whichelectrons in the accretion flow become relativistic is within 10 r_s. theinferred accretion rate is inconsistent with adaf/bondi accretion. thestability of the mean polarization position angle between disparatepolarization observations over the frequency range limits fluctuations in theaccretion rate to less than 5%. the flat frequency dependence of the inter-daypolarization position angle variations also makes them difficult to attributeto rotation measure fluctuations, and suggests that both the magnitude andposition angle variations are intrinsic to the emission.

astro-ph;9411100	the jet-disk symbiosis. ii. interpreting the radio/uv correlations in  quasars	we investigate the correlation between the accretion disk (uv) luminosity andthe radio core emission of a quasar sample. in a radio/$l_{\rm disk}$ plot wefind the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars(cdq), lobe dominated quasars (ldq), radio-intermediate quasars (riq) and radioweak quasars. in general the radio core emission scales with the diskluminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. this shows that radio and uvemission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loudand radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. we investigate thepossibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission inradio loud and radio weak quasars. comparing our data with a simple jetemission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation ina coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry atotal power $q_{\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity$l_{\rm disk}$. for the electron population one is forced to postulate anefficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electronswith a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 mev -- secondary pairproduction in hadronic cascades could be such a process. the bulk lorentzfactor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\la\gamma_{\rm j}\la10$)).the radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the sameparameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, assuggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. there is evidence that riq are therelativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. we can estimatethe hidden disk luminosity of fr ii galaxies and find that this is consistentwith frii being misdirected quasars.

astro-ph;9411106	unified schemes for active galaxies: a clue from the missing  fanaroff-riley type i quasar population	we link the lack of fr i type structure among quasars to the void of radioloud quasars below a critical disk luminosity of ~10^46 erg/sec in the pgsample. we argue that the opening angle of the obscuring torus in radio loudquasars depends on the power of the central engine, approaching the jet'sbeaming angle near the fr i/fr ii break. consequently, low power radio quasarswould either be classified as radio galaxies (fr i) or strongly core-boosted(bl lac) object, depending on the aspect angle, and no conspicuous transitionalpopulation would be expected for fr i sources. a closing torus with decreasingpower would not only obscure the optical nucleus for most aspect angles butwould also enhance the entrainment of the cool torus material into the jetstream, causing obscuration along the jet's periphery, as well as the jet'sdeceleration to form a fr i source. above a critical luminosity, the widertorus allows for fr ii type jets and visibility of the nuclear opticalemission, characteristic of radio loud quasars. apparently, at the same enginepower the torus opening in radio weak quasars and seyferts is substantiallywider than in radio loud quasars, probably because of different dynamics orfeeding mechanisms in disk and elliptical galaxies. this provides a clue forthe radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy of quasars if the the jet/torusinteraction leads to injection of relativistic e^+/- pairs via p-p collisions.strong jet/torus interaction may lead to a substantial injection of secondarypairs and collimation in radio loud quasars, while weak interaction in radioweak quasars leads neither to pair injection nor to good collimation.

astro-ph;9604026	the nuclear jet in m81	in this paper we apply the jet-disk symbiosis model developed for sgr a* tom81* -- the nucleus of the nearby galaxy m81. the model accurately predictsradio flux and size of m81* for the observed bolometric luminosity of thenuclear source with no major free parameter except for the inclination angle.we point out that the usually applied free, conical jet emission model impliesa longitudinal pressure gradient that must lead to a moderate acceleration ofthe jet along its flow direction. this, usually neglected, gradual accelerationnaturally accounts for the inverted spectrum and the size/frequency relation ofm81* and may be a general feature of radio cores. m81* is so far the best casefor a radio-loud jet nature of the compact radio core in the nucleus of anearby spiral galaxy. the fact that one can account for sgr a* and m81* withthe same model by simply changing the accretion rate, strongly supports thejet-disk symbiosis model as an explanation for the compact radio cores ofgalaxies in general.

astro-ph;9605165	the nature of radio-intermediate quasars: what is radio-loud and what is  radio-quiet?	we have performed quasi-simultaneous radio flux density measurements at 2.7and 10 ghz for all pg quasars with radio flux densities between 4-200 mjy. wefind that a large fraction of these sources are variable, flat-spectrumquasars. this brings the total fraction of flat-spectrum quasars with a ratiobetween radio and optical flux of r&gt;10 - a value previously used to define aradio-loud quasar - to 40% in the pg quasar sample. we also find that themedian r-parameter of these flat-spectrum quasars is lower than those ofsteep-spectrum radio-loud quasars. this contradicts the predictions of theunified scheme and the idea that all flat-spectrum, core-dominated quasars arerelativistically boosted lobe-dominated quasars. we show that this discrepancyis due to a population of flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars with25&lt;r&lt;250 which can neither be explained as relativistically boosted radio-loudquasars nor as normal radio-weak quasars. we point out that a naturalexplanation for the flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars is relativisticboosting in radio-weak quasars. if the flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasarsare considered the boosted counterparts to usual radio-weak quasars, theirfraction among radio-weak quasars is roughly 10%, similar to the fraction ofboosted radio-loud quasars. this would point towards average lorentz factors ofgamma_jet=2-4 for radio-loud and radio-weak quasars. the presence of theflat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars changes the definition of 'radio-loud'and can bias some conclusions drawn from optically selected quasar samples,where r ~ 1-10 is used as the dividing line for both, flat- and steep-spectrumquasars. instead one should use separate r-parameters for the dividing line insteep- (r~25) and flat-spectrum (r~250) quasars.

astro-ph;9610049	evn+merlin observations of radio-intermediate quasars: evidence for  boosted radio-weak quasars	we present vlbi (evn+merlin) observations of a sample of three low-redshiftradio-intermediate pg quasars (riq) with flat and variable radio spectrum (iiizw 2, pg 1309+355, pg 2209+184). their radio-to-optical flux ratio (r) isslightly lower than the average r for steep-spectrum quasars, but their radiospectral properties are those of core-dominated quasars. it was proposedpreviously that these sources might be relativistically boosted jets inradio-weak quasars. our vlbi observations now indeed confirm the presence of ahigh brightness temperature core in all three of these objects --- two of themhave lower limits on t_b well in excess of 10^10 kelvin. moreover, we find no``missing-flux'' which means that basically all the flux of these quasars isconcentrated in the compact radio core. as the total radio flux is already atthe low end for radio-loud quasars, we can place a strong limit on the presenceof any extended emission. this limit is consistent with the extended emissionin radio-weak quasars, but excludes that the flat-spectrum riq reside intypical radio-loud quasars. the observations therefore strongly support theidea that relativistic jets are present in radio-weak quasars and hence thatradio-loud and radio-weak quasars have very similar central engines.

astro-ph;9610098	compact radio cores in the galactic center and elsewhere	compact radio cores are not only common in radio galaxies and quasars butalso in many nearby galaxies with low-active, supermassive black holes. onefamous example is the galactic center source sgr a*. recent studies of propermotions and radial velocities of stars in the inner parsec of the galaxyconvincingly demonstrate the presence of a compact dark mass of 2.5 10^6 mo inthe nucleus of the milky way. millimeter vlbi and submm observations of sgr a*thus probe a region of only a few schwarzschild radii in diameter. in thispaper i will review our current theoretical and observational knowledge of thissource and compare it to some famous liner galaxies like ngc 4258, ngc 3079,and ngc 6500. in all cases these radio cores can be well explained by astandard agn jet model, and, with the exception of sgr a*, large scale outflowsare observed that have powers comparable to those inferred from the radiocores. recent vlbi observations of radio-weak quasars and hst observations ofseyfert galaxies indicate that these agn also produce powerful jets which,however, have relatively less luminous radio cores than radio-loud quasars andthe liners discussed here. therefore, jets and compact radio cores appear to benatural constituents of an agn, but the reason why apparently some jets areradio-loud and others not remains a mystery.

astro-ph;9802238	jets in agn -- new results from hst and vla	this paper summarizes some of our recent projects which try to illuminate thenature and importance of jets associated with active nuclei and compactobjects. after a short introduction on jets in radio galaxies and radio loudquasars the paper focuses on jets in other source types, such as radio-quietquasars, seyfert and liner galaxies, and stellar mass black holes. radioobservations of quasars, for example, have brought new evidence for theexistence of relativistic jets in radio quiet quasars, while hst and vlaobservations of seyfert galaxies have now clearly established not only thepresence of radio jets, but also the great importance these jets have for themorphology and the excitation of the emission line region in these agn.moreover, a recent vla survey found a large fraction of low-luminosity agn tohost compact, flat-spectrum radio cores indicating the presence of radio jetsthere as well. finally the jet/disk-symbiosis model, which successfullyexplains radio cores in liner galaxies, is applied to the stellar mass blackhole grs 1915+105, indicating that the radio cores in both types of sources arejust different sides of the same coin. the conclusion drawn from all theseobservations is that radio jets are a ubiquitous feature of most---if notall---agn and play an important effect in the overall energy budget, as well asfor the interpretation of observations in other wavebands (e.g. opticalemission lines).

astro-ph;9810226	the jet/disk symbiosis iii. what the radio cores in grs 1915+105, ngc  4258, m81, and sgr a tell us about accreting black holes	we have derived simplified equations for a freely expanding, pressure drivenjet model as a function of jet power and applied it successfully to the radiocores in the black hole candidates grs 1915+105, ngc 4258, and m81 which areobservationally well defined systems, and to sgr a*. by using equipartitionassumptions, the model has virtually no free parameters and can explain allsources by just scaling the jet power. in grs 1915+105 it also naturallyexplains the jet velocity and the radio time delay. the jet powers we derivefor the radio cores of the first three sources are comparable to theiraccretion disk luminosities, providing further evidence for the existence ofsymbiotic jet/disk systems and a common engine mechanism also in low-luminosityagn and stellar mass black holes. with the exception of sgr a* an advectiondominated accretion flow (adaf) does not seem to be necessary to explain any ofthe radio cores which span a large range in luminosity and size, as well as inblack hole masses and accretion rate---from eddington to extreme sub-eddington.we suggest, however, that the jet model can be used to derive minimum accretionrates and thus find that sgr a* seems to be truly radiatively deficient---evenin a starved black hole model---and that a combination of jet and adaf modelmay be one possible solution.

astro-ph;9903036	a jet-disk symbiosis model for gamma ray bursts: ss 433 the next?	we consider a jet-disk symbiosis model to explain gamma ray bursts and theirafterglows. it is proposed that grbs develop in a pre-existing jet. we considera binary system formed by a neutron star and an o/b/wr companion in which theenergy of the grb is due to the accretion-induced collapse of the neutron starto a black hole. the high speed in the energy flow in agn-jets is generallybelieved to be initiated by strong magnetic field coupling to the accretiondisk of the black hole. we use the same mechanism here. we assume that in thistransition a large amount of energy is anisotropically released as poyntingflux along the polar axis. one may think of this process as a violent and rapidtwist. this energy release naturally initiates an ultrarelativistic shock wavein the pre-existing jet. the emission microphysics are as in fireball models.our model has only two parameters overall, the energy in the shock along thejet, and the fraction of this energy in energetic electrons and positrons. thesystem ss433 appears to have the properties required for a grb precursor in ourmodel. we show that our model can explain the initial gamma ray burstenergetics, the spectrum and temporal behaviour of the afterglows, the lowbaryon load, and do all this with a modest energy budget.

astro-ph;9903070	accretion disk evolution with wind infall ii. results of 3d  hydrodynamical simulations with an illustrative application to sgr a*	in the first paper of this series, using analytic tools, we examined how theevolution and structure of a massive accretion disk may be influenced by thedeposition of mass and angular momentum by an infalling bondi-hoyle wind. sucha mass influx impacts the long-term behavior of the disk by providingadditional sources of viscosity and heating. here, we make improvements overthis earlier work by incorporating the results of 3d hydrodynamical simulationsof the large scale accretion from an ambient medium into the disk evolutionequations developed previously. we discuss two models, one with the axis of thedisk parallel to, and the second with the axis oriented perpendicular to thelarge scale bondi-hoyle flow. we find that the mass inflow rate onto the diskwithin logarithmic annuli is roughly constant with radius and that theimpacting wind carries much less specific angular momentum than keplerian. wealso find, in general, that the infrared spectrum of a wind-fed disk system issteeper than that of a shakura-sunyaev configuration, due mainly to thedissipation of the wind's kinetic energy at the disk's surface. in applying ourresults to the galactic center black hole candidate, sgr a*, we demonstratethat a high wind inflow rate of order 10^-4 solar masses per year cannot beincorporated into a fossil disk without a significant dissipation of kineticenergy at all radii. such a high dissipation would violate current infrared andnear-infrared limits on the observed spectrum of sgr a*.

astro-ph;9909439	the jet model for sgr a*	in this paper the jet model for the supermassive black hole candidate sgr a*in the center of the galaxy is reviewed. the most recent model, with a reducedset of parameters, is able to account for all major radio properties of thesource: size, structure, flux density, and spectrum. the model requires aminimum jet power of ~10^39 erg/sec and in a symbiotic jet/disk system impliesa minimum accretion rate of a few times 10^-8 m_sun/yr for a radio loud jet or\~10^-5 m_sun/yr for a radio quiet jet. low near-infrared limits on the sgr a*flux then imply that the accretion flow onto the central black hole must beradiatively deficient, but most likely has a high viscosity. within the jetmodel the high-frequency part of the sgr a* spectrum is self-consistentlyexplained as the nozzle of the outflow. in a symbiotic model this innermostregion of the jet could possibly be identified with the innermost region of anadvection dominated accretion disk, a bondi-hoyle accretion flow, or any othertype of under-luminous accretion process. the compact nozzle region is ofparticular importance since it can be used as a background photon sourceagainst which the central black hole could be directly imaged with futuremm-vlbi experiments.

astro-ph;9909442	disks with jet, adaf, or edaf for sgr a*	we investigate various models of accretion disks for sgr a*, one of the mostpuzzling sources in the galaxy. the generic image we have taken into accountconsists of a black hole, an accretion disk, and a jet. various accretionmodels are able to explain the low nir flux of sgr a*: a standard accretiondisk with a jet, an adaf, or an edaf (ejection dominated accretion flow) model.we find that all of these models are conceptually similar. the accretion modelwhich allows the formation of the jet at the innermost edge of the diskrequires a sub-keplerian gas motion and a very large base of the jet. the largebase of the jet may be unrealistic for sgr a*, since the jet model and theobservations suggest that the jet is collimated and anchored in the disk in avery narrow region of the disk close to the black hole. alternatively, one canthink of a jet plus wind model (edaf), where most of the energy goes outwithout being dissipated in the disk. the model resembles the adaf model atsmall radii. at large radii the energy is ejected by a wind.

astro-ph;9912263	viewing the shadow of the black hole at the galactic center	in recent years, the evidence for the existence of an ultra-compactconcentration of dark mass associated with the radio source sgr a* in thegalactic center has become very strong. however, an unambiguous proof that thisobject is indeed a black hole is still lacking. a defining characteristic of ablack hole is the event horizon. to a distant observer, the event horizon castsa relatively large ``shadow'' with an apparent diameter of ~10 gravitationalradii due to bending of light by the black hole, nearly independent of theblack hole spin or orientation. the predicted size (~30 micro-arcseconds) ofthis shadow for sgr a* approaches the resolution of currentradio-interferometers. if the black hole is maximally spinning and viewededge-on, then the shadow will be offset by ~8 micro-arcseconds from the centerof mass, and will be slightly flattened on one side. taking into accountscatter-broadening of the image in the interstellar medium and the finiteachievable telescope resolution, we show that the shadow of sgr a* may beobservable with very long-baseline interferometry at sub-millimeterwavelengths, assuming that the accretion flow is optically thin in this regionof the spectrum. hence, there exists a realistic expectation of imaging theevent horizon of a black hole within the next few years.
