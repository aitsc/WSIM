0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

0709.2640	neutrino triggered target of opportunity (ntoo) test run with amanda-ii  and magic	kilometer scale neutrino telescopes are now being constructed (icecube) anddesigned (km3net). while no neutrino flux of cosmic origin has been discoveredso far, the first weak signals are expected to be discerned in the next fewyears. multi-messenger (observations combining different kinds of emission)investigations can enhance the discovery chance for neutrinos in case ofcorrelations. one possible application is the search for time correlations ofhigh energy neutrinos and established signals. we show the first adaptation ofa target of opportunity strategy to collect simultaneous data of high energyneutrinos and gamma-rays. neutrino events with coordinates close to preselectedcandidate sources are used to alert gamma-ray observations. the detection of apositive coincidence can enhance the neutrino discovery chance. more generally,this scheme of operation can increase the availability of simultaneousobservations. if cosmic neutrino signals can be established, the combinedobservations will allow time correlation studies and therefore constraints onthe source modeling. a first technical implementation of this scheme involvingamanda-ii and magic has been realized for few pre-selected sources in a shorttest run (sept. to dec. 2006), showing the feasability of the concept. resultsfrom this test run are shown.

1108.0171	icecube sensitivity for low-energy neutrinos from nearby supernovae	this paper describes the response of the icecube neutrino telescope locatedat the geographic south pole to outbursts of mev neutrinos from the corecollapse of nearby massive stars. icecube was completed in december 2010forming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1cubic kilometer in the deep antarctic ice for particle induced photons. thetelescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 gev.owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates areparticularly low. hence icecube can also detect large numbers of mev neutrinosby observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the darknoise. with 2 ms timing resolution, icecube can detect subtle features in thetemporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. for a supernova at thegalactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-freemegaton-scale supernova search experiment. the sensitivity decreases to 20standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations atthe large magellanic cloud (50 kpc). icecube is sending triggers from potentialsupernovae to the supernova early warning system. the sensitivity to neutrinoproperties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as thepossibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electronneutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black holeas well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrateicecube's capability for supernova detection.

1208.3430	an improved method for measuring muon energy using the truncated mean of  de/dx	the measurement of muon energy is critical for many analyses in largecherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separatingextraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. muonenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss(de/dx) along the muon's path and relating the de/dx to the muon energy.because high-energy muons (e_mu &gt; 1 tev) lose energy randomly, the spread inde/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 inlog10(e_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the icecubedetector. in this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncatedmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. the muon track isdivided into separate segments with individual de/dx values. the elimination ofsegments with the highest de/dx results in an overall de/dx that is moreclosely correlated to the muon energy. this method results in an energyresolution of 0.22 in log10(e_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. thistechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially tolarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.

1210.7992	search for galactic pev gamma rays with the icecube neutrino observatory	gamma-ray induced air showers are notable for their lack of muons, comparedto hadronic showers. hence, air shower arrays with large underground muondetectors can select a sample greatly enriched in photon showers by rejectingshowers containing muons. icecube is sensitive to muons with energies above~500 gev at the surface, which provides an efficient veto system for hadronicair showers with energies above 1 pev. one year of data from the 40-stringicecube configuration was used to perform a search for point sources and agalactic diffuse signal. no sources were found, resulting in a 90% c.l. upperlimit on the ratio of gamma rays to cosmic rays of 1.2 x 10^(-3)for the fluxcoming from the galactic plane region (-80 deg &lt; l &lt; -30 deg; -10 deg &lt; b &lt; 5deg) in the energy range 1.2 - 6.0 pev. in the same energy range, point sourcefluxes with e^(-2) spectra have been excluded at a level of (e/tev)^2 d\phi/de~ 10^(-12)-10^(-11) cm^2/s/tev depending on source declination. the completeicecube detector will have a better sensitivity, due to the larger detectorsize, improved reconstruction and vetoing techniques. preliminary data from thenearly-final icecube detector configuration has been used to estimate the 5year sensitivity of the full detector. it is found to be more than an order ofmagnitude better, allowing the search for pev extensions of known tev gamma-rayemitters.

1308.5501	improvement in fast particle track reconstruction with robust statistics	the icecube project has transformed one cubic kilometer of deep naturalantarctic ice into a cherenkov detector. muon neutrinos are detected and theirdirection inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon trackinside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. reconstructing the muontrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering inthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muonsinside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. thismanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstructionproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover thetrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determinehow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. rather thansolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that areapplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment thedetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statisticaltechniques. these can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstructionand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. using the metric ofmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, weimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. we alsopresent improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: wecan accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.

1406.6868	multipole analysis of icecube data to search for dark matter accumulated  in the galactic halo	dark matter which is bound in the galactic halo might self-annihilate andproduce a flux of stable final state particles, e.g. high energy neutrinos.these neutrinos can be detected with icecube, a cubic-kilometer sized cherenkovdetector. given icecube's large field of view, a characteristic anisotropy ofthe additional neutrino flux is expected. in this paper we describe a multipolemethod to search for such a large-scale anisotropy in icecube data. this methoduses the expansion coefficients of a multipole expansion of neutrino arrivaldirections and incorporates signal-specific weights for each expansioncoefficient. we apply the technique to a high-purity muon neutrino sample fromthe northern hemisphere. the final result is compatible with thenull-hypothesis. as no signal was observed, we present limits on theself-annihilation cross-section averaged over the relative velocitydistribution $&lt;\sigma v&gt;$ down to $1.9\cdot10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter particle mass of$700\,\mathrm{gev}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{gev}$ and direct annihilation into$\nu\bar{\nu}$. the resulting exclusion limits come close to exclusion limitsfrom $\gamma$-ray experiments, that focus on the outer galactic halo, for highdark matter masses of a few tev and hard annihilation channels.

1501.05301	the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background and implications  for dark-matter annihilation	the origin of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (egb) has beendebated for some time. { the egb comprises the $\gamma$-ray emission fromresolved and unresolved extragalactic sources, such as blazars, star-forminggalaxies and radio galaxies, as well as radiation from truly diffuseprocesses.} this letter focuses on the blazar source class, the most numerousdetected population, and presents an updated luminosity function and spectralenergy distribution model consistent with the blazar observations performed bythe {\it fermi} large area telescope (lat). we show that blazars account for50$^{+12}_{-11}$\,\% of the egb photons ($&gt;$0.1\,gev), and that {\it fermi}-lathas already resolved $\sim$70\,\% of this contribution. blazars, and inparticular low-luminosity hard-spectrum nearby sources like bl lacs, areresponsible for most of the egb emission above 100\,gev. we find that theextragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars' high-energy emission,is responsible for the high-energy cut-off observed in the egb spectrum.finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies and radio galaxies cannaturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the0.1--820\,gev range, leaving only modest room for other contributions. thisallows us to set competitive constraints on the dark-matter annihilation crosssection.

1501.05464	limits on dark matter annihilation signals from the fermi lat 4-year  measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background	we search for evidence of dark matter (dm) annihilation in the isotropicgamma-ray background (igrb) measured with 50 months of fermi large areatelescope (lat) observations. an improved theoretical description of thecosmological dm annihilation signal, based on two complementary techniques andassuming generic weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) properties, rendersmore precise predictions compared to previous work. more specifically, weestimate the cosmologically-induced gamma-ray intensity to have an uncertaintyof a factor ~20 in canonical setups. we consistently include both the galacticand extragalactic signals under the same theoretical framework, and study theimpact of the former on the igrb spectrum derivation. we find no evidence for adm signal and we set limits on the dm-induced isotropic gamma-ray signal. ourlimits are competitive for dm particle masses up to tens of tev and, indeed,are the strongest limits derived from fermi lat data at tev energies. this ispossible thanks to the new fermi lat igrb measurement, which now extends up toan energy of 820 gev. we quantify uncertainties in detail and show thepotential this type of search offers for testing the wimp paradigm with acomplementary and truly cosmological probe of dm particle signals.

1501.06054	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the fermi large  area telescope	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei (agns) detected by the fermi-lat(3lac) is presented. it is based on the third fermi-lat catalog (3fgl) ofsources detected between 100 mev and 300 gev with a test statistic (ts) greaterthan 25, between 2008 august 4 and 2012 july 31. the 3lac includes 1591 agnslocated at high galactic latitudes (|b|&gt;10{\deg}), a 71% increase over thesecond catalog based on 2 years of data. there are 28 duplicate associations,thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3fgl catalog areagns. most of them (98%) are blazars. about half of the newly detected blazarsare of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficientquality to determine the strength of their emission lines. based on theirgamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split betweenflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) and bl~lacs. the most abundant detectedbl~lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (hsp) type. about 50% of the bl~lacshave no measured redshifts. a few new rare outliers (hsp-fsrqs andhigh-luminosity hsp bl~lacs) are reported. the general properties of the 3lacsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. the fraction of 3lacblazars in the total population of blazars listed in bzcat remainsnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the bzcat-blazar radio, optical andx-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazarscould eventually shine in gamma rays at lat-detection levels. the energy-fluxdistributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement withextrapolation from earlier catalogs.

1503.00598	searches for time dependent neutrino sources with icecube data from 2008  to 2012	in this paper searches for flaring astrophysical neutrino sources and sourceswith periodic emission with the icecube neutrino telescope are presented. incontrast to time integrated searches, where steady emission is assumed, theanalyses presented here look for a time dependent signal of neutrinos using theinformation from the neutrino arrival times to enhance the discovery potential.a search was performed for correlations between neutrino arrival times anddirections as well as neutrino emission following time dependent lightcurves,sporadic emission or periodicities of candidate sources. these include activegalactic nuclei, soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters, supernova remnants hostingpulsars, micro-quasars and x-ray binaries. the work presented here updates andextends previously published results to a longer period that covers four yearsof data from 2008 april 5 to 2012 may 16 including the first year of operationof the completed 86-string detector. the analyses did not find any significanttime dependent point sources of neutrinos and the results were used to setupper limits on the neutrino flux from source candidates.

1504.03753	measurement of the atmospheric $\nu_e$ spectrum with icecube	we present a measurement of the atmospheric $\nu_e$ spectrum at energiesbetween 0.1 tev and 100 tev using data from the first year of the completeicecube detector. atmospheric $\nu_e$ originate mainly from the decays of kaonsproduced in cosmic-ray air showers. this analysis selects 1078 fully containedevents in 332 days of livetime, then identifies those consistent with particleshowers. a likelihood analysis with improved event selection extends ourprevious measurement of the conventional $\nu_e$ fluxes to higher energies. thedata constrain the conventional $\nu_e$ flux to be $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ times abaseline prediction from a honda's calculation, including the knee of thecosmic-ray spectrum. a fit to the kaon contribution ($\xi$) to the neutrinoflux finds a kaon component that is $\xi =1.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ times the baselinevalue. the fitted/measured prompt neutrino flux from charmed hadron decaysstrongly depends on the assumed astrophysical flux and shape. if theastrophysical component follows a power law, the result for the prompt flux is$0.0^{+3.0}_{-0.0}$ times a calculated flux based on the work by enberg, renoand sarcevic.

1505.07259	search for dark matter annihilation in the galactic center with  icecube-79	the milky way is expected to be embedded in a halo of dark matter particles,with the highest density in the central region, and decreasing density with thehalo-centric radius. dark matter might be indirectly detectable at earththrough a flux of stable particles generated in dark matter annihilations andpeaked in the direction of the galactic center. we present a search for anexcess flux of muon (anti-) neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in thegalactic center using the cubic-kilometer-sized icecube neutrino detector atthe south pole. there, the galactic center is always seen above the horizon.thus, new and dedicated veto techniques against atmospheric muons are requiredto make the southern hemisphere accessible for icecube. we used 319.7 live-daysof data from icecube operating in its 79-string configuration during 2010 and2011. no neutrino excess was found and the final result is compatible with thebackground. we present upper limits on the self-annihilation cross-section,$\left&lt;\sigma_\mathrm{a} v\right&gt;$, for wimp masses ranging from 30 gev up to10 tev, assuming cuspy (nfw) and flat-cored (burkert) dark matter haloprofiles, reaching down to $\simeq 4 \cdot 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and$\simeq 2.6 \cdot 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for the $\nu\overline{\nu}$channel, respectively.

1506.03115	detection of a type iin supernova in optical follow-up observations of  icecube neutrino events	the icecube neutrino observatory pursues a follow-up program selectinginteresting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagneticfollow-up observations. in march 2012, the most significant neutrino alertduring the first three years of operation was issued by icecube. in thefollow-up observations performed by the palomar transient factory (ptf), a typeiin supernova (sn) ptf12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alertdirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. it has a redshift of$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,\mathrm{mpc}$ and the pan-starrs1 survey shows that its explosion time was atleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that acausal connection is unlikely. the a posteriori significance of the chancedetection of both the neutrinos and the sn at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$within icecube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. also, a complementaryneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.therefore, we consider the sn detection coincidental and the neutrinosuncorrelated to the sn. however, the sn is unusual and interesting by itself:it is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the sn iin 2010jl,and shows signs of interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium. high-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shockacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific sn. in thispaper, we describe the sn ptf12csy and present both the neutrino andelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

1507.03991	a combined maximum-likelihood analysis of the high-energy astrophysical  neutrino flux measured with icecube	evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now beenfound in multiple searches with the icecube detector. the first solid evidencewas provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies$\gtrsim30$ tev and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. recentanalyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies andis also visible with throughgoing, $\nu_\mu$-induced tracks from the northernhemisphere. here, we combine the results from six different icecube searchesfor astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. the combinedevent sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-likeevents. the data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle andevent topology. assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and toconsist of equal flavors at earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrinoenergies between 25 tev and 2.8 pev is well described by an unbroken power lawwith best-fit spectral index $-2.50\pm0.09$ and a flux at 100 tev of$\left(6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1}\right)\cdot10^{-18}\,\mathrm{gev}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index $-2$ is disfavoredwith a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$ ($p=0.0066\%$) with respect to the bestfit. this significance is reduced to 2.1 $\sigma$ ($p=1.7\%$) if instead wecompare the best fit to a spectrum with index $-2$ that has an exponentialcut-off at high energies. allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate fromthe other two flavors, we find a $\nu_e$ fraction of $0.18\pm0.11$ at earth.the sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic ofneutron-decay dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6$\sigma$ ($p=0.014\%$).

1507.04005	evidence for astrophysical muon neutrinos from the northern sky with  icecube	results from the icecube neutrino observatory have recently providedcompelling evidence for the existence of a high energy astrophysical neutrinoflux utilizing a dominantly southern hemisphere dataset consisting primarily ofnu_e and nu_tau charged current and neutral current (cascade) neutrinointeractions. in the analysis presented here, a data sample of approximately35,000 muon neutrinos from the northern sky was extracted from data takenduring 659.5 days of livetime recorded between may 2010 and may 2012. whilethis sample is composed primarily of neutrinos produced by cosmic rayinteractions in the earth's atmosphere, the highest energy events areinconsistent with a hypothesis of solely terrestrial origin at 3.7 sigmasignificance. these neutrinos can, however, be explained by an astrophysicalflux per neutrino flavor at a level of phi(e_nu) = 9.9^{+3.9}_{-3.4} times10^{-19} gev^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} s^{-1} ({e_nu / 100 tev})^{-2}, consistentwith icecube's southern hemisphere dominated result. additionally, a fit for anastrophysical flux with an arbitrary spectral index was performed. we find aspectral index of 2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, which is also in good agreement with thesouthern hemisphere result.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.
