0812.4541	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. vii. relative ages	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters is a hubble space telescope(hst) treasury program designed to provide a new large, deep and homogeneousphotometric database. based on observations from this program, we have measuredprecise relative ages for a sample of 64 galactic globular clusters bycomparing the relative position of the clusters' main sequence turn offs, usingmain-sequence fitting to cross-compare clusters within the sample. this methodprovides relative ages to a formal precision of 2-7%. we demonstrate that thecalculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. wefind that the galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups-- a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of ~5% and noage-metallicity relation, and a group of younger clusters with anage-metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associatedwith the sagittarius dwarf galaxy.  these results are consistent with the milky way halo having formed in twophases or processes. the first one would be compatible with a rapid (&lt;0.8 gyr)assembling process of the halo, in which the clusters in the old group wereformed. also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarfgalaxies that would later merge to build the milky way halo as predicted bylambda-cdm cosmology. however, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown bythese clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter. as for the youngerclusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to theirformation within milky way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but theorigin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear.

0902.3197	"an era of precision astrophysics: connecting stars, galaxies and the  universe," an astro2010 science white paper	abridged: the golden age of astrophysics is upon us with both granddiscoveries (extra-solar planets, dark matter, dark energy) and precisioncosmology. fundamental understanding of the working of stars and galaxies iswithin reach, thanks to newly available precision measurements. we highlightthe importance of distances and model independent distances and masses.  distances are fundamental in astrophysics and their knowledge can change ourperception of phenomena dramatically: e.g., in antiquity, the heliocentricmodel was rejected because the predicted stellar parallaxes were not observed.  distance measurements are directly related to the history &amp; fate of the uni-verse as they provide 2 of 3 methods available to date the universe. the 1stmethod is based on the ages of stars, which can be ascertained if their lumi-nosities (distances) are accurately known. the 2nd method relies on cosmolo-gical methods. to 1st order, the age of the universe is the inverse h_0.  as stressed by the previous decadal report, "the fundamental goal of ...astrophysics is to understand how the universe ... galaxies [and] stars ...formed, how they evolved, and what their destiny will be." these questions canbe answered partly by micro-arcsecond astrometry: 1) galactic archeology: adetailed reconstruction of the formation history of the milky way and otherlocal group galaxies, 2) the very oldest stars in the milky way and the age ofthe universe, and 3) h_0 and concordance cosmology.  these goals are achievable by combining muas-arcsecond astrometry from theproposed sim-lite mission supplemented with ground-based spectroscopy. theresults of our proposed project will force the biggest reassessment of stellarastrophysics in 50 years, which will affect most branches of astrophysics.

0902.3460	the detection of inside-out disk growth in m33	we present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis ofthe m33 disk from images taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard thehubble space telescope. the photometry provides a detailed census of the redclump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermostfield. through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find thatthe percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9%in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. the disk shows aclear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc10 gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 gyr ago, in agreementwith analytical predictions for disk growth. beyond the disk truncation radius,however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradientreverses, in agreement with recent simulations. the late and slow growth of thestellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of m33.

0904.2907	deep 2mass photometry of m67 and calibration of the main sequence j-ks  color difference as an age indicator	we present an analysis of two micron all sky survey (2mass) calibrationphotometry of the old open cluster m67 (ngc 2682). the proper motion-cleanedcolor-magnitude diagram (cmd) resulting from these data extends ~3 magnitudesdeeper than one based on data from the point source catalog. the cmd extendsfrom above the helium-burning red clump to a faint limit that is more than 7magnitudes below the main sequence turnoff in the ks band. after adopting areddening of e(b-v) = 0.041 +/- 0.004 and a metal abundance of [fe/h] = -0.009+/- 0.009 based on a survey of published values, we fit the unevolved mainsequence of m67 to field main sequence stars with 2mass photometry andhipparcos parallaxes. this analysis yields distance moduli of (m-m)ks = 9.72+/- 0.05 and (m-m)o = 9.70 +/- 0.05, which are consistent with publishedvalues. we compare the theoretical isochrones of girardi et al. and dotter etal. to the cmd of m67 and comment on the relative merits of each set of models.these comparisons suggest an age between 3.5 and 4.0 gyr for m67. the depth ofthe m67 data make them ideal for the calibration of a new age indicator thathas recently been devised by calamida et al.- the difference in (j-ks) colorbetween the main sequence turnoff (to) and the point on the lower main sequencewhere it turns down (td) and becomes nearly vertical [d(j-ks)]. coupled withdeep 2mass photometry for three other open clusters, ngc 2516, m44, and ngc6791, we calibrate d(j-ks) in terms of age and find d(j-ks) = (3.017 +/- 0.347)- (0.259 +/- 0.037)*log age (yrs).

0904.4290	rr lyrae variables in two fields in the spheroid of m31	we present hubble space telescope observations taken with the advanced camerafor surveys wide field channel of two fields near m32 - between four and sixkpc from the center of m31. the data cover a time baseline sufficient for theidentification and characterization of 681 rr lyrae variables of which 555 areab-type and 126 are c-type. the mean magnitude of these stars is &lt;v&gt;=25.29 +/-0.05 where the uncertainty combines both the random and systematic errors. thelocation of the stars in the bailey diagram and the ratio of c-type rr lyraesto all types are both closer to rr lyraes in oosterhoff type i globularclusters in the milky way as compared with oosterhoff ii clusters. the meanperiods of the ab-type and c-type rr lyraes are &lt;p(ab)&gt;=0.557 +/- 0.003 and&lt;p(c)&gt;=0.327 +/- 0.003, respectively, where the uncertainties in each caserepresent the standard error of the mean. when the periods and amplitudes ofthe ab-type rr lyraes in our sample are interpreted in terms of metallicity, wefind the metallicity distribution function to be indistinguishable from agaussian with a peak at &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-1.50 +/- 0.02, where the quoted uncertaintyis the standard error of the mean. using a relation between rr lyrae luminosityand metallicity along with a reddening of e(b-v) = 0.08 +/- 0.03, we find adistance modulus of (m-m)o=24.46 +/- 0.11 for m31. we examine the radialmetallicity gradient in the environs of m31 using published values for thebulge and halo of m31 as well as the abundances of its dwarf spheroidalcompanions and globular clusters. in this context, we conclude that the rrlyraes in our two fields are more likely to be halo objects rather thanassociated with the bulge or disk of m31, in spite of the fact that they arelocated at 4-6 kpc in projected distance from the center.

0704.1576	a catalog of star cluster candidates in m33	we present a new catalog of star cluster candidates in the nearby spiralgalaxy m33. it is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we havecross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistenciesbetween them. our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmedclusters based on hst and high resolution ground-based imaging. the catalogcontains precise cluster positions (ra and dec), magnitudes and colors in theubvrijhks filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, whereavailable, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. the colordistribution of the m33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the largemagellanic cloud with major peaks at (b-v)o~0.15, and (b-v)o~0.65. theintrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to10^{10.3} years. the age distribution of the star clusters supports the notionof rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in thedn_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. in addition, comparison to theoreticalsingle stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicityrelation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence thatyounger clusters (age &lt;~ 1 gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center ofm33 than older ones. a similar comparison with the radial profile of the m33field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greaterthan 99.9% confidence level. possible reasons for this are presented anddiscussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a morecomplete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 squaredegrees centered on m33.

0911.1527	rr lyrae variables in the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 147	we investigate the rr lyrae population in ngc 147, a dwarf satellite galaxyof m31 (andromeda). we used both thuan-gunn g-band ground-based photometry fromthe literature and hubble space telescope wide field planetary camera 2archival data in the f555w and f814w passbands to investigate the pulsationproperties of rr lyrae variable candidates in ngc 147. these datasets representthe two extreme cases often found in rr lyrae studies with respect to the phasecoverage of the observations and the quality of the photometric measurements.extensive artificial variable star tests for both cases were performed. weconclude that neither dataset is sufficient to confidently determine thepulsation properties of the ngc 147 rr lyraes. thus, while we can assert thatngc 147 contains rr lyrae variables, and therefore a population older than ~10gyr, it is not possible at this time to use the pulsation properties of theserr lyraes to study other aspects of this old population. our results provide agood reference for gauging the completeness of rr lyrae variable detection infuture studies.

0911.2469	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. ix. horizontal branch  morphology and the second parameter phenomenon	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gcs) is moststrongly influenced by metallicity. the second parameter phenomenonacknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the hb morphologyof all gcs. in particular, the outer galactic halo contains gcs with redder hbsat a given metallicity than are found inside the solar circle. thus, at least asecond parameter is required to characterize hb morphology. here we analyze themedian color difference between the hb and the red giant branch (rgb), d(v-i),measured from hst acs photometry of 60 gcs within ~20 kpc of the galacticcenter. analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influenceof metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(v-i) and age isstronger than that of any other parameter considered. expanding the sample toinclude hst photometry of the 6 most distant galactic gcs lends additionalsupport to the correlation between d(v-i) and age. this result is robust withrespect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination,but must bear the caveat that high quality, detailed abundance information isnot available for a significant fraction of the sample. when a subset of gcswith similar metallicities and ages are considered, a correlation betweend(v-i) and central luminosity density is exposed. with respect to the existenceof gcs with anomalously red hbs at a given metallicity, we conclude that age isthe second parameter and central density is most likely the third. importantproblems related to hb morphology in gcs, notably multi-modal distributions andfaint blue tails, remain to be explained.

1210.0542	the origins of blue stragglers and binarity in globular clusters	(abridged) we use newly available empirical binary fractions for globularclusters to carry out a direct test of the binary evolution hypothesis, and ofcollisional channels that involve binary stars. more specifically, using thepreviously reported correlation between blue straggler numbers and core mass asa benchmark, we test for correlations with the number of binary stars, as wellas with the rates of single-single, single-binary, and binary-binaryencounters. surprisingly, we find that the simple correlation with core massremains by far the strongest predictor of blue straggler population size, evenin our joint models. this is despite the fact that the binary fractionsthemselves strongly anti-correlate with core mass, just as expected in thebinary evolution model. at first sight, these results do not fit neatly witheither binary evolution or collisional models in their simplest forms. arguablythe simplest and most intriguing possibility to explain this unexpected resultis that observational errors on the core binary fractions are larger than thetrue intrinsic dispersion associated with their dependence on core mass. in thecontext of the binary evolution model, this would explain why the combinationof binary fraction and core mass is a poorer predictor of blue stragglernumbers than core mass alone. it would also imply that core mass is aremarkably clean predictor of core binary fractions. this would be ofconsiderable importance for the dynamical evolution of globular clusters, andprovides an important benchmark for models attempting to understand theirpresent-day properties.

1302.2827	the properties of the large magellanic cloud based on ogle iii  photometry of rr lyrae stars	we present results from a study of ab-type rr lyrae variables in the largemagellanic cloud using the extensive dataset from phase iii of the opticalgravitational lensing experiment (ogle). the metallicities of the rr lyraes,determined from the periods and amplitudes of their light curves, reveal astatistically significant radial abundance gradient that is approximatelyone-half of what is seen in the disks of the milky way and m33. the rr lyraeabundance gradient agrees with that of the old and metal-poor lmc globularclusters. the reddenings of the ogle rr lyraes have been calculated using theirminimum light colors and reveal a mean value of e(v-i) = 0.12 +/- 0.05, wherethe quoted uncertainty represents the standard deviation of the mean. thedistribution of rr lyrae extinctions across the face of the lmc iswell-correlated with the distribution and emission intensity of co clouds basedon recent millimeter wave surveys. in addition, we find that the old lmcglobulars tend to be located in regions of low extinction. this underscores theneed to survey the higher extinction regions with the specific aim ofincreasing the sample of old lmc globular clusters. finally, we examine thedistance distribution of the rr lyraes in order to probe the structure of thelmc and investigate the possibility that some of the rr lyraes may reside in akinematically hot halo population. in addition to calculating a mean lmcdistance of (m-m)o = 18.55 +/- 0.10 mag, we conclude that some fraction of therr lyraes in our sample could be members of the lmc halo.

1312.1641	the acs survey of globular clusters. xiii. photometric calibration in  comparison with stetson standards	in this study we compare the photometric data of 34 milky way globularclusters, observed within the acs treasury program (pi: ata sarajedini) withthe corresponding ground-based data, provided by the photometric standard fieldcatalogs of stetson (2000, 2005). we focus on the transformation between thehst/acs f606w to v-band and f814w to i-band only. the goal is to assess thevalidity of the filter transformation equations by sirianni et al.(2005) withrespect to their dependence on metallicity, horizontal branch morphology, massand integrated (v-i) colour of the various globular clusters. such a dependenceis expected due to the fact that the transformation equations are based on theobservations of only one globular cluster, i.e., ngc 2419. surprisingly, thecorrelation between offset and metallicity is found to be weak, with a lowlevel significance. the correlation between offset and horizontal branchstructure, as well as total cluster mass is still weaker. based on theavailable data we do not find the photometric offset to be linked to multiplestellar populations, e.g., as found in ngc 0288, ngc 1851, and ngc 5139. theresults of this study show that there are small systematic offsets between thetransformed acs- and observed ground based photometry, and that these are onlyweakly correlated, if at all, with various cluster parameters and theirunderlying stellar populations. as a result, investigators wishing to transformglobular cluster photometry from the sirianni et al.(2005) ground-based v, isystem onto the stetson (2000) system simply need to add 0.040 (+/-0.012) tothe v-band magnitudes and 0.047 (+/-0.011) to the i-band magnitudes. this inturn means that the transformed acs (v-i) colours match the ground-based valuesfrom stetson (2000) to within ~0.01 mag.

1402.3874	the early chemical enrichment histories of two sculptor group dwarf  galaxies as revealed by rr lyrae variables	we present the results of our analysis of the rr lyrae (rrl) variable starsdetected in two transition-type dwarf galaxies (dtrans), eso294-g010 andeso410-g005 in the sculptor group, which is known to be one of the closestneighboring galaxy groups to our local group. using deep archival images fromthe advanced camera for surveys (acs) onboard the hubble space telescope (hst),we have identified a sample of rr lyrae candidates in both dtrans galaxies [219rrab (rr0) and 13 rrc (rr1) variables in eso294-g010; 225 rrab and 44 rrc starsin eso410-g005]. the metallicities of the individual rrab stars are calculatedvia the period-amplitude-[fe/h] relation derived by alcock et al. this yieldsmean metallicities of &lt;[fe/h]&gt;_{eso294} = -1.77 +/- 0.03 and &lt;[fe/h]&gt;_{eso410}= -1.64 +/- 0.03. the rrl metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) areinvestigated further via simple chemical evolution models; these reveal therelics of the early chemical enrichment processes for these two dtransgalaxies. in the case of both galaxies, the shapes of the rrl mdfs arewell-described by pre-enrichment models. this suggests two possible channelsfor the early chemical evolution for these sculptor group dtrans galaxies: 1)the ancient stellar populations of our target dwarf galaxies might have formedfrom the star forming gas which was already enriched through "prompt initialenrichment" or an "initial nucleosynthetic spike" from the very first massivestars, or 2) this pre-enrichment state might have been achieved by the endproducts from more evolved systems of their nearest neighbor, ngc 55.

1404.1037	the rr lyrae variable population in the phoenix dwarf galaxy	we present the first detailed study of the rr lyrae variable population inthe local group dsph/dirr transition galaxy, phoenix, using previously obtainedhst/wfpc2 observations of the galaxy. we utilize template light curve fittingroutines to obtain best fit light curves for rr lyrae variables in phoenix. ourtechnique has identified 78 highly probable rr lyrae stars (54 ab-type; 24c-type) with about 40 additional candidates. we find mean periods for the twopopulations of $\langle p_{ab}\rangle = 0.60 \pm 0.03$ days and $\langlep_{c}\rangle = 0.353 \pm 0.002$ days. we use the properties of these lightcurves to extract, among other things, a metallicity distribution function forab-type rr lyrae. our analysis yields a mean metallicity of $\langle[fe/h]\rangle = -1.68 \pm 0.06$ dex for the rrab stars. from the mean periodand metallicity calculated from the ab-type rr lyrae, we conclude that phoenixis more likely of intermediate oosterhoff type; however the morphology of thebailey diagram for phoenix rr lyraes appears similar to that of an oosterhofftype i system. using the rrab stars, we also study the chemical enrichment lawfor phoenix. we find that our metallicity distribution is reasonably wellfitted by a closed-box model. the parameters of this model are compatible withthe findings of hidalgo et al.

1504.00909	population effects on the metallicity distribution function derived from  the red giant branch	we have tested the reliability of the red giant branch (rgb) as a metallicityindicator accounting for observational errors as well as the complexity of starformation histories (sfhs) and chemical evolution histories observed in variousstellar systems. we generate model color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) producedwith a variety of evolutionary histories and compare the resultant metallicityestimates from the colors and magnitudes of rgb stars to the true inputmetallicities. we include realistic models for photometric errors andcompleteness in our synthetic cmds. as expected, for simple simple stellarpopulations dominated by old stars, the rgb provides a very accurate estimateof the modular metallicity value for a population. an error in the age of asystem targeted for this type of study may produce metallicity errors of a fewtenths of a dex. the size of this metallicity error depends linearly on the ageerror, and we find this dependence to be stronger with more precise photometry.if the population has experienced any significant star formation within thelast $\sim$6 gyr, the metallicity estimates, [m/h], derived from the rgb may bein error by up to $\sim$0.5 dex. perhaps the most important consideration forthis technique is an accurate, independent estimate of the average age for thetarget stellar system, especially if it is probable that a significant fractionof the population formed less than $\sim$6 gyr ago.

astro-ph;0110005	determination of the distance to m33 based on single epoch i-band hst  observations of cepheids	we have determined the distance to m33 using single epoch i-band observationsof cepheids based on hst/wfpc2 images of five fields in m33. combining the hsti-band photometry and the periods determined from the ground-based observations(direct) for 21 cepheids with log p&gt;0.8 in the sample of 32 cepheids, we derivea distance modulus of (m-m)_0=24.52+/-0.14(random)+/-0.13(systematic) for anadopted total reddening of m33, e(b-v)=0.20+/-0.04 (e(v-i)=0.27+/-0.05) givenby freedmand et al.(2001), the reddening to the lmc, e(b-v)=0.10, and thedistance to the lmc, (m-m)_0=18.50. if the total reddening to m33 ofe(b-v)=0.10+/-0.09 given by freedman, wilson, and madore(1991) is used, thecepheid distance modulus based on the i-band photometry will be increased by0.20. metallicity effect on the cepheid distance to m33 is estimated to besmall, delta(m-m)_z=0.01 to 0.06, which leads to (m-m)_0=24.53 to 24.58 afterthis metallicity effect correction. using the wesenheit w_i, an extinction-freeparameter, we derive a similar value,(m-m)_0=24.52+/-0.15(random)+/-0.11(systematic). these results are inreasonable agreement with those based on the ground-based multi-epoch bvriobservations of brighter cepheids in m33, and are ~0.3 smaller than those basedon the tip of the red giant branch and the red clump. it is needed to estimatebetter the reddening to cepheids in m33.

0808.1918	the stellar populations of m33's outer regions iv: inflow history and  chemical evolution	we have modelled the observed color-magnitude diagram (cmd) at one locationin m33's outskirts under the framework of a simple chemical evolution scenariowhich adopts instantaneous and delayed recycling for the nucleosyntheticproducts of type ii and ia supernovae. in this scenario, interstellar gas formsstars at a rate modulated by the kennicutt-schmidt relation and gas outflowoccurs at a rate proportional to the star formation rate (sfr). with thisapproach, we put broad constraints on the role of gas flows during thisregion's evolution and compare its [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h] relation with that ofother local group systems. we find that models with gas inflow aresignificantly better than the closed box model at reproducing the observeddistribution of stars in the cmd. the best models have a majority of gas inflowtaking place in the last 7 gyr, and relatively little in the last 3 gyr. thesemodels predict most stars in this region to have [alpha/fe] ratios lower thanthe bulk of the milky way's halo. the predictions for the present-day sfr, gasmass, and oxygen abundance compare favorably to independent empiricalestimates. our results paint a picture in which m33's outer disc formed fromthe protracted inflow of gas over several gyr with at least half of the totalinflow occurring since z ~ 1.

astro-ph;0401387	variations in star formation history and the red giant branch tip	we examine the reliability of the tip of the red giant branch (trgb) as adistance indicator for stellar populations with different star formationhistories (sfhs) when photometric errors and completeness corrections at thetrgb are small. in general, the trgb-distance method is insensitive to theshape of the sfh except when it produces a stellar population with asignificant component undergoing the red giant branch phase transition. thei-band absolute magnitude of the trgb for the middle and late stages of thistransition (~1.3-1.7 gyr) is several tenths of a magnitude fainter than thecanonical value of m_i ~ -4.0. if more than 30% of all stars formed over thelifetime of the universe are formed at these ages, then the distance could beoverestimated by 10-25%. similarly, the trgb-distance method is insensitive tothe metallicity distribution of stars formed except when the averagemetallicity is greater than &lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -0.3. if more than ~70% of all starsformed have [fe/h] &gt; -0.3, the distance could be overestimated by ~10-45%. wefind that two observable quantities, the height of the discontinuity in theluminosity function at the trgb and the median (v-i)_0 at m_i = -3.5 can beused to test if the aforementioned age and metallicity conditions are met.

astro-ph;9604122	a precision age determination technique for globular clusters	globular cluster age estimates based on the absolute magnitude of the mainsequence turn-off (\mvto) are generally considered to be the most reliable froma theoretical viewpoint. however, the difficulty in determining \mvto\ inobserved colour-magnitude diagrams leads to a large error in the derived age.in this paper, we advocate the use of the absolute magnitude of the point whichis brighter than the turn-off and 0.05 mag redder (\mvb) as a precision ageindicator. it is easy to measure this point on observed colour-magnitudediagrams, leading to small observational error bars. furthermore, an extensivemonte carlo calculation indicates that the theoretical uncertainty in \mvb\ issimilar to \mvto. as a result, ages derived using \mvb\ are at least a factorof 2 more precise than those derived using \mvto. this technique is applied tothe globular cluster m68 and an age of $12.8\pm 0.3\,$gyr is derived (assuming$\mvrr = 0.20\,\feh + 0.98$), indicating that m68 is a `young' globularcluster. a homogeneous set of globular cluster age estimates with thisprecision would provide unprecedented insight into the formation of thegalactic halo.

astro-ph;9712314	wfpc2 observations of the small magellanic cloud intermediate-age  populous cluster ngc 416	we present our analysis of archival hubble space telescope wide fieldplanetary camera 2 observations in f555w (~v) and f450w (~b) of theintermediate-age populous star cluster ngc 416 in the small magellanic cloudgalaxy. we use published photometry of two other smc populous star clusters,lindsay 1 and lindsay 113, to investigate the age sequence of these three starclusters. we estimate that these clusters have age ratios of age_ngc416/age_l1~= 0.73 +- 0.05 and age_l113/age_l1 ~= 0.52 +- 0.09, using an extrapolation ofthe d_(b-v) method (which uses the color difference between the red horizontalbranch and the red giant branch as an age indicator) of sarajedini, lee, &amp; lee[apj, 450, 712 (1995)]. these age ratios provide absolute age estimates of 6.6+- 0.5 gyr and 4.7 +- 0.8 gyr for ngc 416 and lindsay 113, respectively,assuming that lindsay 1 is 9 gyr old. metallicities and reddenings for ngc 416,lindsay 1, and lindsay 113, respectively, were determined using thesimultaneous reddening and metallicity (srm) method of sarajedini &amp; layden [aj,113, 264, (1997)]. accurate (relative) ages for the intermediate-age populousclusters in the small magellanic cloud (e.g. via deep main sequence photometry)would allow the d_(b-v) method to be recalibrated with star clusters that aresignificantly younger than 7 gyr. an extended d_(b-v) method could prove to bea very useful age diagnostic for future studies of the intermediate-agemetal-poor stellar populations in local group galaxies where accuratemain-sequence turnoff photometry at m_v ~= +4 mag is currently not practical.

astro-ph;9806100	wiyn open cluster study 1: deep photometry of ngc 188	we have employed precise v and i photometry of ngc 188 at wiyn to explore thecluster luminosity function (lf) and study the cluster white dwarfs (wds). ourphotometry is offset by v = 0.052 (fainter) from sandage (1962) and eggen &amp;sandage (1969). all published photometry for the past three decades have beenbased on these two calibrations, which are in error by 0.05 +- 0.01. we employthe pinsonneault etal (1998) fiducial main sequence to derive a clusterdistance modulus of 11.43 +- 0.08. we report observations that are &gt;= 50%complete to v = 24.6 and find that the cluster central-field lf peaks at m_i ~3 to 4. this is unlike the solar neighborhood lf and unlike the lfs ofdynamically unevolved portions of open and globular clusters, which risecontinuously until m_i ~ 9.5. although we find that &gt;= 50% of the unresolvedcluster objects are multiple systems, their presence cannot account for theshape of the ngc 188 lf. for theoretical reasons (terlevich 1987; vesperini &amp;heggie 1997) having to do with the survivability of ngc 188 we believe thecluster is highly dynamically evolved and that the missing low luminosity starsare either in the cluster outskirts or have left the cluster altogether. weidentify nine candidate wds, of which we expect three to six are bona fidecluster wds. the luminosities of the faintest likely wd indicates an age(bergeron, wesemael, &amp; beauchamp 1995) of 1.14 +- 0.09 gyrs. this is a lowerlimit to the cluster age and observations probing to v = 27 or 28 will benecessary to find the faintest cluster wds and independently determine thecluster age. while our age limit is not surprising for this ~6 gyr old cluster,our result demonstrates the value of the wd age technique with its very lowinternal errors.

astro-ph;9808091	wfpc2 observations of star clusters in the magellanic clouds. ii. the  oldest star clusters in the small magellanic cloud	we present our analysis of archival hubble space telescope wide fieldplanetary camera 2 (wfpc2) observations in f450w (~b) and f555w (~v) of theintermediate- age populous star clusters ngc 121, ngc 339, ngc 361, ngc 416,and kron 3 in the small magellanic cloud. we use published photometry of twoother smc populous star clusters, lindsay 1 and lindsay 113, to investigate theage sequence of these seven populous star clusters in order to improve ourunderstanding of the formation chronology of the smc. we analyzed the v vs(b-v) and m_v vs (b-v)_0 color-magnitude diagrams of these populous smallmagellanic cloud star clusters using a variety of techniques and determinedtheir ages, metallicities, and reddenings. these new data enable us to improvethe age-metallicity relation of star clusters in the small magellanic cloud. inparticular, we find that a closed-box continuous star-formation model does notreproduce the age-metallicity relation adequately. however, a theoretical modelpunctuated by bursts of star formation is in better agreement with theobservational data presented herein.

astro-ph;9808253	the age dependent luminosities of the red giant branch bump, asymptotic  giant branch bump, and horizontal branch red clump	color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters often exhibit a prominenthorizontal branch (hb) and may also show features such as the red giant branch(rgb) bump and the asymptotic giant branch (agb) bump. stellar evolution theorypredicts that the luminosities of these features will depend on the metallicityand age of the cluster. we calculate theoretical lines of 2 to 12 gyr constantage rgb-bumps and agb-bumps in the v(hb-bump)--[fe/h] diagram, which shows thebrightness difference between the bump and the hb as a function of metallicity.in order to test the predictions, we identify giant branch bumps in new hubblespace telescope color-magnitude diagrams for 8 smc clusters. first, we concludethat the smc cluster bumps are rgb-bumps. the data for clusters younger than ~6gyr are in fair agreement the relative age dependent luminosities of the hb andrgb-bump. the v(hb-bump)--[fe/h] data for clusters older then ~6 gyrdemonstrate a less satisfactory agreement with our calculations. we concludethat ~6 gyr is a lower bound to the age of clusters for which the galacticglobular cluster, age independent v(hb-bump)--[fe/h] calibration is valid.application of the v(hb-bump)--[fe/h] diagram to stellar population studies isdiscussed.

astro-ph;9809275	hst wfpc2 color-magnitude diagrams of halo globular clusters in m33:  implications for the early formation history of the local group	we have constructed color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) for ten globular clustersin the halo of the nearby spiral galaxy m33 based on hubble space telescopewide-field planetary camera 2 observations in the f555w (~v) and f814w (~i)filters. these data reveal the morphology of the hb and allow us to estimatethe cluster metallicity using the shape and color of the red giant branch. theprincipal result we report herein is that 8 of the 10 clusters possessexclusively red hb morphologies yet their metallicities are as metal-poor as[fe/h] ~ -1.6. indeed, these 8 clusters present basically only giant branchclumps reminiscent of intermediate age star clusters in the magellanic clouds.in addition, two of the clusters form a second parameter pair which havesimilar metallicities but very disparate hb types. under the assumption thatcluster age is the global second parameter, the average age of halo globularclusters in m33 appears to be a few gyr younger than halo clusters in the milkyway. using the observed properties of hb stars in m31 and m33 along withpublished main-sequence turnoff ages for the globular clusters in the milkyway, lmc, smc, and the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (sgr), we attempt to sketchthe early formation history of these galaxies. this indicates that the milkyway, m31, m33, the lmc, and sgr all experienced their first epoch of clusterformation soon after the big bang. three to four gyr later, the smc began toform its first generation of clusters; the bulk of the m33 clusters formedlater still. we note that the halo clusters in m33 formed over a much longertime period than those in the milky way and m31.
