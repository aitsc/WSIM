0901.4705	discovery and characterization of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass  planet transiting a solar-type star	we report the discovery of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass planettransiting every 3.3610060 +0.0000022-0.0000035 days a mildly metal-poorsolar-type star of magnitude v=11.9. a combined analysis of the waspphotometry, high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocitiesyield a planetary mass m_p = 0.503 +0.019-0.038 m_jup and radius r_p = 1.224+0.051-0.052 r_jup, resulting in a density rho_p = 0.27 +-0.05 rho_jup. themass and radius for the host star are m_s = 0.88 +0.05-0.08 m_sun and r_s =0.870 +0.025-0.036 r_sun. the non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0.054+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidalheating ~1 gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius.high-precision radial velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measurea sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis beta = 11+14-18 deg. in addition to similar published measurements, this result favors adominant migration mechanism based on tidal interactions with a protoplanetarydisk.

0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

1001.0403	wasp-19b: the shortest period transiting exoplanet yet discovered	we report on the discovery of a new extremely short period transitingextrasolar planet, wasp-19b. the planet has mass mpl = 1.15 \pm 0.08 mj, radiusrpl = 1.31 \pm 0.06 rj, and orbital period p = 0.7888399 \pm 0.0000008 days.through spectroscopic analysis, we determine the host star to be a slightlysuper-solar metallicity ([m/h] = 0.1 \pm 0.1 dex) g-dwarf with teff = 5500 \pm100 k. in addition, we detect periodic, sinusoidal flux variations in the lightcurve which are used to derive a rotation period for the star of prot = 10.5\pm 0.2 days. the relatively short stellar rotation period suggests that eitherwasp-19 is somewhat young (~ 600 myr old) or tidal interactions between the twobodies have caused the planet to spiral inward over its lifetime resulting inthe spin-up of the star. due to the detection of the rotation period, thissystem has the potential to place strong constraints on the stellar tidalquality factor, q's, if a more precise age is determined.

1003.3678	evidence against the young hot-jupiter around bd +20 1790	context. the young active star bd +20 1790 is believed to host a substellarcompanion, revealed by radial-velocity measurements that detected the reflexmotion induced on the parent star.  aims. a complete characterisation of the radial-velocity signal is necessaryin order to assess its nature.  methods. we used coralie spectrograph to obtain precise (~10 m/s) velocitymeasurements on this active star, while characterizing the bisector spanvariations. particular attention was given to correctly sample both theproposed planetary orbital period, of 7.8 days, and the stellar rotationperiod, of 2.4 days.  results. a smaller radial-velocity signal (with peak-to-peak variations &lt;500m/s) than had been reported previously was detected, with different amplitudeon two different campaigns. a periodicity similar to the rotational period isfound on the data, as well as a clear correlation between radial-velocities andbisector span. this evidence points towards a stellar origin of theradial-velocity variations of the star instead of a barycentric movement of thestar, and repudiates the reported detection of a hot-jupiter.

1004.0790	observation of the full 12-hour-long transit of the exoplanet hd80606b.  warm-spitzer photometry and sophie spectroscopy	we present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanethd80606b. using the spitzer space telescope and its irac camera on thepost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation ofhd80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 january 2010. we complement thisphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneouslyperformed with sophie at haute-provence observatory. this provides radialvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previouslyuncovered with spectroscopy. this new data set allows the parameters of thissingular planetary system to be significantly refined. we obtained aplanet-to-star radius ratio r_p/r_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lowerthan the one measured from previous ground observations. we detected a featurein the spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. we also found atransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; thiscould be caused by actual ttvs due to an additional body in the system or byunderestimated systematic uncertainties. the sky-projected angle between thespin-axis of hd80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found tobe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the rossiter-mclaughlinanomaly. this allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitivelyrejected. over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, afew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two differentevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if theyexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. as in the caseof hd80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet aretilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario formassive planets in comparison with jupiter-mass planets.

1304.4130	astrophysical false positives in direct imaging for exoplanets: a white  dwarf close to a rejuvenated star	as is the case for all techniques involved in the research for exoplanets,direct imaging has to take into account the probability of so-calledastrophysical false positives, which are phenomena that mimic the signature ofobjects we are seeking. in this work we aim to present a case of a falsepositive found during a direct imaging survey conducted with vlt/naco. apromising exoplanet candidate was detected around the k2-type star hd\,8049 injuly 2010.its contrast of $\delta h$=7.05 at 1.57 arcsec allowed us to guessthe presence of a 35 \mjup companion at 50 projected au, for the nominal systemage and heliocentric distance.to check whether it was gravitationally bound tothe host star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed thesystem one year later and concluded a high probability of a bound system. wealso used radial velocity measurements of the host star, spanning a time rangeof $\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties, aswell as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectralenergy distribution. we also obtained for the companion $u$-band imaging withefosc and $nir$ spectroscopy. combining all these information we conclude thatthe companion of hd\,8049 is a white dwarf (wd), with temperature$t_{eff}=18800 \pm 2100$ k and mass $m_{wd}=0.56 \pm 0.08 m_{\odot}$. thesignificant radial velocity trend coupled with the imaging data indicate thatthe most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of about 50 au.the discrepancybetween the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star. themoderately large level of chromospheric activity and fast rotation, mimickingthe properties of a young star, might be induced by the exchange of mass withthe progenitor of the wd. this example demonstrates some of the challenges indetermining accurate age estimates and identifications of faint companions.

1403.4619	astrometric planet search around southern ultracool dwarfs ii:  astrometric reduction methods and a deep astrometric catalogue	we describe the astrometric reduction of images obtained with the fors2/vltcamera in the framework of an astrometric planet search around 20m/l-transition dwarfs. we present the correction of systematic errors, theachieved astrometric performance, and a new astrometric catalogue containingthe faint reference stars in 20 fields located close to the galactic plane. wedetected three types of systematic errors in the fors2 astrometry: the relativemotion of the camera's two ccd chips, errors that are correlated in space, andan error contribution of yet unexplained origin. the relative ccd motion hasprobably a thermal origin and usually is 0.001-0.010 px (~0.1-1 mas), butsometimes amounts to 0.02-0.05 px (3-6 mas). this instability andspace-correlated errors are detected and mitigated using reference stars. thethird component of unknown origin has an amplitude of 0.03-0.14 mas and isindependent of the observing conditions. we find that a consecutive sequence of32 images of a well-exposed star over 40 min at 0.6" seeing results in a medianr.m.s. of the epoch residuals of 0.126 mas. overall, the epoch residuals aredistributed according to a normal law with a chi2~1. we compiled a catalogue of12000 stars with i-band magnitudes of 16-22 located in 20 fields, each covering~2x2'. it contains i-band magnitudes, icrf positions with 40-70 mas precision,and relative proper motions and absolute trigonometric parallaxes with aprecision of 0.1 mas/yr and 0.1 mas at the bright end, respectively.

1507.08532	the harps-n rocky planet search i. hd219134b: a transiting rocky planet  in a multi-planet system at 6.5 pc from the sun	we present here the detection of a system of four low-mass planets around thebright (v=5.5) and close-by (6.5 pc) star hd219134. this is the first result ofthe rocky planet search program with harps-n on the tng in la palma. the innerplanet orbits the star in 3.0937 +/-0.0004 days, on a quasi-circular orbit witha semi-major axis of 0.0382 +/- 0.0003 au. spitzer observations allowed us todetect the transit of the planet in front of the star making hd219134b thenearest known transiting planet to date. from the amplitude of theradial-velocity variation (2.33 +/- 0.24 m/s) and observed depth of the transit(359 +/- 38 ppm), the planet mass and radius are estimated to be 4.46 +/- 0.47m_{\oplus} and 1.606 +/- 0.086 r_{\oplus} leading to a mean density of 5.89 +/-1.17 g/cc, suggesting a rocky composition. one additional planet with minimummass of 2.67 +/- 0.59 m_{\oplus} moves on a close-in, quasi-circular orbit witha period of 6.765 +/- 0.005 days. the third planet in the system has a periodof 46.78 +/- 0.16 days and a minimum mass of 8.7 +/- 1.1 m{\oplus}, at 0.234+/- 0.002 au from the star. its eccentricity is 0.32 +/- 0.14. the period ofthis planet is close to the rotational period of the star estimated fromvariations of activity indicators (42.3 +/- 0.1 days). the planetary origin ofthe signal is, however, the preferred solution as no indication of variation atthe corresponding frequency is observed for activity-sensitive parameters.finally, a fourth additional longer-period planet of mass of 62 +/- 6m_{\oplus} orbits the star in 1190 days, on an eccentric orbit (e=0.27 +/-0.11) at a distance of 2.14 +/- 0.27 au.

0806.0719	misaligned spin-orbit in the xo-3 planetary system?	the transiting extrasolar planet xo-3b is remarkable, with a high mass andeccentric orbit. the unusual characteristics make it interesting to testwhether its orbital plane is parallel to the equator of its host star, as it isobserved for other transiting planets. we performed radial velocitymeasurements of xo-3 with the sophie spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope ofhaute-provence observatory during a planetary transit, and at other orbitalphases. this allowed us to observe the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and, togetherwith a new analysis of the transit light curve, to refine the parameters of theplanet. the unusual shape of the radial velocity anomaly during the transitprovides a hint for a nearly transverse rossiter-mclaughlin effect. thesky-projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotationaxis should be lambda = 70 +/- 15 degrees to be compatible with ourobservations. this suggests that some close-in planets might result fromgravitational interaction between planets and/or stars rather than migrationdue to interaction with the accretion disk. this surprising result requiresconfirmation by additional observations, especially at lower airmass, to fullyexclude the possibility that the signal is due to systematic effects.

0806.4587	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets. xiii. a planetary  system with 3 super-earths (4.2, 6.9, &amp; 9.2 earth masses)	this paper reports on the detection of a planetary system with threesuper-earths orbiting hd40307. hd40307 is a k2v metal-deficient star at adistance of only 13 parsec, part of the harps gto high-precision planet-searchprogramme. the three planets on circular orbits have very low minimum masses ofrespectively 4.2, 6.9 and 9.2 earth masses and periods of 4.3, 9.6 and 20.5days. the planet with the shortest period is the lightest planet detectedto-date orbiting a main sequence star. the detection of the correspondingly lowamplitudes of the induced radial-velocity variations is completely secured bythe 135 very high-quality harps observations illustrated by the radial-velocityresiduals around the 3-keplerian solution of only 0.85 m/s. activity andbisector indicators exclude any significant perturbations of stellar intrinsicorigin, which supports the planetary interpretation. contrary to mostplanet-host stars, hd40307 has a marked sub-solar metallicity ([fe/h]=-0.31),further supporting the already raised possibility that the occurrence of verylight planets might show a different dependence on host star's metallicitycompared to the population of gas giant planets. in addition to the 3 planetsclose to the central star, a small drift of the radial-velocity residualsreveals the presence of another companion in the system the nature of which isstill unknown.

astro-ph;0106277	new neighbours. iii. 21 new companions to nearby dwarfs, discovered with  adaptive optics	we present some results of a cfht adaptive optics search for companions tonearby dwarfs. we identify 21 new components in solar neighbourhood systems, ofwhich 13 were found while surveying a volume-limited sample of m dwarfs within12pc. we are obtaining complete observations for this subsample, to deriveunbiased multiplicity statistics for the very-low-mass disk population.additionally, we resolve for the first time 6 known spectroscopic orastrometric binaries, for a total of 27 newly resolved companions. a fairfraction of the new binaries has favourable parameters for accurate massdeterminations. the newly resolved companion of gl120.1c had an apparentspectroscopic minimum mass in the brown-dwarf range (duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991)and it contributed to the statistical evidence that a few percent of solar typestars might have close-in brown-dwarf companions. we find that gl~120.1cactually is an unrecognised double-lined spectroscopic pair. itsradial-velocity amplitude had therefore been strongly underestimated byduquennoy &amp; mayor, and it does not truly belong to their sample of single-linedsystems with minimum spectroscopic mass below the substellar limit. we alsopresent the first direct detection of gl~494b, an astrometric brown-dwarfcandidate. its luminosity does straddle the substellar limit, and it is a browndwarf if its age is less than 300myr. a few more years of observations willascertain its mass and status from first principles.

astro-ph;0309784	vinci / vlti observations of main sequence stars	main sequence (ms) stars are by far the most numerous class in the universe.they are often somewhat neglected as they are relatively quiet objects (butexceptions exist), though they bear testimony of the past and future of oursun. an important characteristic of the ms stars, particularly the solar-typeones, is that they host the large majority of the known extrasolar planets.moreover, at the bottom of the ms, the red m dwarfs pave the way tounderstanding the physics of brown dwarfs and giant planets. we have measuredvery precise angular diameters from recent vinci/vlti interferometricobservations of a number of ms stars in the k band, with spectral types betweena1v and m5.5v. they already cover a wide range of effective temperatures andradii. combined with precise hipparcos parallaxes, photometry, spectroscopy aswell as the asteroseismic information available for some of these stars, theangular diameters put strong constraints on the detailed models of these stars,and therefore on the physical processes at play.

astro-ph;0312068	modeling of alpha cen and procyon using vlti observations	we present a novel approach to model the nearby stars alpha cen a &amp; b andprocyon a using asteroseismic and interferometric constraints. using the vinciinstrument installed at the vlt interferometer (vlti), the angular diameters ofthe alpha centauri system were measured with a relative precision of 0.2% and0.6%, respectively. from these values, we derive linear radii of r[a] = 1.224+/- 0.003 r_sun and r[b] = 0.863 +/- 0.005 r_sun. these radii are in excellentagreement with the models of thevenin et al. (2002), that use asteroseismicfrequencies as constraints (bouchy &amp; carrier 2001; bouchy &amp; carrier 2002). withthe same instrument, we also measured the angular diameter of procyon a. usingthe hipparcos parallax, we obtain a linear radius of 2.048 +/- 0.025 r_sun. weuse this result together with spectroscopic and photometric constraints tomodel this star with the cesam code. we also computed the adiabatic oscillationspectrum of our model of procyon a, giving a mean large frequency separation ofdelta nu_0 = 54.8 uhz, in agreement with the seismic observations by martic etal. (2001). our model favours a mass around 1.4 m_sun for procyon a.
