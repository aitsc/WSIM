0812.3918	aspherical core-collapse supernovae in red supergiants powered by  nonrelativistic jets	we explore the observational characteristics of jet-driven supernovae bysimulating bipolar-jet-driven explosions in a red supergiant progenitor. wepresent results of four models in which we hold the injected kinetic energy ata constant $10^{51}$ ergs across all jet models but vary the specificcharacteristics of the jets to explore the influence of the nature of jets onthe structure of the supernova ejecta. we evolve the explosions pastshock-breakout and into quasi-homologous expansion of the supernova envelopeinto a red supergiant wind. the oppositely-directed, nickel-rich jets give alarge-scale asymmetry that may account for the non-spherical excitation andsubstructure of spectral lines such as h$\alpha$ and he i 10830\aa. jets with alarge fraction of kinetic to thermal energy punch through the progenitorenvelope and give rise to explosions that would be observed to be asymmetricfrom the earliest epochs, inconsistent with spectropolarimetric measurements oftype ii supernovae. jets with higher thermal energy fractions result inexplosions that are roughly spherical at large radii but are significantlyelongated at smaller radii, deep inside the ejecta, in agreement with thepolarimetric observations. we present shock breakout light curves that indicatethat strongly aspherical shock breakouts are incompatible with recent {\itgalex} observations of shock breakout from red supergiant stars. comparisonwith observations indicates that jets must deposit their kinetic energyefficiently throughout the ejecta while in the hydrogen envelope. thermalenergy-dominated jets satisfy this criterion and yield many of theobservational characteristics of type ii supernovae.

0904.3737	dust and the type ii-plateau supernova 2004et	we present mid-infrared (mir) observations of the type ii-plateau supernova(sn) 2004et, obtained with the {\it spitzer space telescope} between days 64and 1406 past explosion. late-time optical spectra are also presented. for theperiod 300-795 days past explosion, we argue that the spectral energydistribution of sn 2004et comprises (a) a hot component due to emission fromoptically thick gas, as well as free-bound radiation, (b) a warm component dueto newly formed, radioactively heated dust in the ejecta, and (c) a coldcomponent due to an ir echo from the interstellar-medium dust of the hostgalaxy, ngc 6946. there may also have been a small contribution to the ir seddue to free-free emission from ionised gas in the ejecta. we reveal thefirst-ever spectroscopic evidence for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of asupernova. this is supported by our detection of a large, but progressivelydeclining, mass of sio. however, we conclude that the mass of directly detectedejecta dust grew to no more than a few times 10^(-4)msun. we also provideevidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size. we arguethat, after about two years past explosion, the appearance of wide, box-shapedoptical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitorcircumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool, dense shellwas responsible for a later rise in the mir flux. this study demonstrates therich, multi-faceted ways in which a typical core-collapse supernova and itsprogenitor can produce and/or interact with dust grains. the work presentedhere adds to the growing number of studies which do not support the contentionthat sne are responsible for the large mass of observed dust in high-redshiftgalaxies.

0907.1083	variable sodium absorption in a low-extinction type ia supernova	recent observations have revealed that some type ia supernovae exhibitnarrow, time-variable na i d absorption features. the origin of the absorbingmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gasin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implicationsfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. we present the third detection ofsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopyof the type ia supernova sn 2007le from keck and the het. the data span ~3months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. we find thatone component of the na d absorption lines strengthened significantly withtime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. thechanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier timeswhen the uv flux from the sn peaks. as with sn 2006x, we detect no change inthe ca ii h&amp;k lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effectsimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.unlike the previous two sne exhibiting variable absorption, sn 2007le is nothighly reddened (e_b-v = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar ratherthan interstellar absorption. photoionization models show that the data areconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pcfrom the explosion. these results broadly support the single-degeneratescenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass lossfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellargas. we also present tentative evidence for narrow halpha emission associatedwith the sn, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.[abridged]

0909.1798	modeling the light curve of the transient scp06f6	we consider simple models based on core collapse or pair-formation supernovaeto account for the light curve of the transient scp06f6. a radioactive decaydiffusion model provides estimates of the mass of the required radioactivenickel and the ejecta as functions of the unknown redshift. an opacity changesuch as by dust formation or a recombination front may account for the rapiddecline from maximum. we particularly investigate two specific redshifts:$z=0.143$, for which gaensicke et al. (2008) have proposed that theunidentified broad absorption features in the spectrum of scp06f6 are c$_{2}$swan bands, and $z=0.57$ based on a crude agreement with the ca h&amp;k and uviron-peak absorption features that are characteristic of supernovae of varioustypes. the ejected masses and kinetic energies are smaller for a more tightlyconstrained model invoking envelope recombination. we also discuss thepossibilities of circumstellar matter (csm) shell diffusion and shockinteraction models. in general, optically-thick csm diffusion models can fitthe data with the underlying energy coming from an energetic buried supernova.models in which the csm is of lower density so that the shock energy is bothrapidly thermalized and radiated tend not to be self-consistent. we suggestthat a model of scp06f6 worth futher exploration is one in which the redshiftis $\sim$ 0.57, the spectral features are ca and iron peak elements, and thelight curve is powered by the diffusive release of a substantial amount ofenergy from nickel decay or from an energetic supernova buried in the ejecta ofan lbv-like event.

1007.3693	aspherical supernova shock breakout and the observations of supernova  2008d	shock breakout is the earliest, readily-observable emission from acore-collapse supernova explosion. observing supernova shock breakout may yieldinformation about the nature of the supernova shock prior to exiting theprogenitor and, in turn, about the core-collapse supernova mechanism itself.x-ray outburst 080109, later associated with sn 2008d, is a very well-observedexample of shock breakout from a core-collapse supernova. despite excellentobservational coverage and detailed modeling, fundamental information about theshock breakout, such as the radius of breakout and driver of the light curvetime scale, is still uncertain. the models constructed for explaining the shockbreakout emission from sn 2008d all assume spherical symmetry. we present astudy of the observational characteristics of {\it aspherical} shock breakoutfrom stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae. we conduct two-dimensional,jet-driven supernova simulations from stripped-envelope progenitors andcalculate the resulting shock breakout x-ray spectra and light curves. thex-ray spectra evolve significantly in time as the shocks expand outward and arenot well-fit by single-temperature and radius black bodies. the time scale ofthe x-ray burst light curve of the shock breakout is related to the shockcrossing time of the progenitor, not the much shorter light crossing time thatsets the light curve time scale in spherical breakouts. this could explain thelong shock breakout light curve time scale observed for xro 080109/sn 2008d.

1101.4269	dependences of type ia supernovae lightcurve parameters on the host  galaxy star formation rate and metallicity	we present the dependences of the properties of type ia supernovae (sne ia)on their host galaxies by analyzing the multi-band lightcurves of 118spectroscopically confirmed sne ia observed by the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) supernova survey and the spectra of their host galaxies. we derive theequivalent width of the \rm{h}$\alpha$ emission line, star formation rate, andgas-phase metallicity from the spectra and compare these with the lightcurvewidths and colors of sne ia. in addition, we compare host properties with thedeviation of the observed distance modulus corrected for lightcurve parametersfrom the distance modulus determined by the best fit cosmological parameters.this allows us to investigate uncorrected systematic effects in the magnitudestandardization. we find that sne ia in host galaxies with a higher starformation rate have synthesized on average a larger $^{56}$ni mass and showwider lightcurves. the $^{56}$ni mass dependence on metallicity is consistentwith a prediction of timmes et al. 2003 based on nucleosynthesis. sne ia inmetal-rich galaxies ({$\log_{10}(o/h)+12&gt;8.9$) have become 0.13 $\pm$ 0.06magnitude brighter after corrections for their lightcurve widths and colors,which corresponds to up to 6% uncertainty in the luminosity distance. weinvestigate whether parameters for standardizing sn ia maximum magnitude differamong samples with different host characteristics. the coefficient of the colorterm is larger by 0.67 $\pm$ 0.19 for sne ia in metal-poor hosts than those inmetal-rich hosts when no color cuts are imposed.

1103.1671	a study of carbon features in type ia supernova spectra	one of the major differences between various explosion scenarios of type iasupernovae (sne ia) is the remaining amount of unburned (c+o) material and itsvelocity distribution within the expanding ejecta. while oxygen absorptionfeatures are not uncommon in the spectra of sne ia before maximum light, thepresence of strong carbon absorption has been reported only in a minority ofobjects, typically during the pre-maximum phase. the reported low frequency ofcarbon detections may be due to low signal-to-noise data, low abundance ofunburned material, line blending between c ii 6580 and si ii 6355, ejectatemperature differences, asymmetrical distribution effects, or a combination ofthese. however, a survey of published pre-maximum spectra reveals that more sneia than previously thought may exhibit c ii 6580 absorption features and relicsof line blending near 6300 angstroms. here we present new sn ia observationswhere spectroscopic signatures of c ii 6580 are detected, and investigate thepresence of c ii 6580 in the optical spectra of 19 sne ia using theparameterized spectrum synthesis code, synow. most of the objects in our samplethat exhibit c ii 6580 absorption features are of the low-velocity gradientsubtype. our study indicates that the morphology of carbon-rich regions isconsistent with either a spherical distribution or a hemispheric asymmetry,supporting the recent idea that sn ia diversity may be a result of off-centerignition coupled with observer line-of-sight effects.

1106.2390	sn 2008in - bridging the gap between normal and faint supernovae of type  iip	we present optical photometric and low-resolution spectroscopic observationsof the type ii plateau supernova (sn) 2008in, which occurred in the outskirtsof the nearly face-on spiral galaxy m 61. photometric data in the x-rays,ultraviolet and near-infrared bands have been used to characterize this event.the sn field was imaged with the rotse-iiib optical telescope about seven daysbefore the explosion. this allowed us to constrain the epoch of the shockbreakout to jd = 2454825.6. the duration of the plateau phase, as derived fromthe photometric monitoring, was ~ 98 days. the spectra of sn 2008in show astriking resemblance to those of the archetypal low-luminosity iip sne 1997dand 1999br. a comparison of ejecta kinematics of sn 2008in with thehydrodynamical simulations of type iip sne by dessart et al. (2010) indicatesthat it is a less energetic event (~ 5$\times10^{50}$ erg). however, the lightcurve indicates that the production of radioactive $^{56}$ni is significantlyhigher than that in the low-luminosity sne. adopting an interstellar absorptionalong the sn direction of $a_v$ ~ 0.3 mag and a distance of 13.2 mpc, weestimated a synthesized ni mass of ~ 0.015 $m_{\odot}$. employingsemi-analytical formulae (litvinova &amp; nadezhin 1985), we derived a pre-snradius of ~ 126$r_{\odot}$, an explosion energy of ~ 5.4$\times10^{50}$ erg anda total ejected mass of ~ 16.7$m_{\odot}$. the latter indicates that the zeroage main-sequence mass of the progenitor did not exceed 20$m_{\odot}$.considering the above properties of sn 2008in, and its occurrence in a regionof sub-solar metallicity ([o/h] ~ 8.44 dex), it is unlikely that fall-back ofthe ejecta onto a newly formed black hole occurred in sn 2008in. we thereforefavor a low-energy explosion scenario of a relatively compact, moderate-massprogenitor star that generates a neutron star.

1107.3165	stellar mass black holes in young galaxies	we explore the potential cumulative energy production of stellar mass blackholes in early galaxies. stellar mass black holes may accrete substantiallyfrom the higher density interstellar media of primordial galaxies, and theirenergy release would be distributed more uniformly over the galaxy, perhapsproviding a different mode of energy feedback into young galaxies than centralsupermassive black holes. we construct a model for the production and growth ofstellar mass black holes over the first few gigayears of a young galaxy. withthe simplifying assumption of a constant density of the ism, n ~ 10^4 - 10^5per cubic centimeter, we estimate the number of accreting stellar mass blackholes to be ~ 10^6 and the potential energy production to be as high as 10^61ergs over several billion years. for densities less than 10^5 per cubiccentimeter, stellar mass black holes are unlikely to reach their eddingtonlimit luminosities. the framework we present could be incorporated in numericalsimulations to compute the feedback from stellar-mass black holes withinhomogeneous, evolving interstellar media.

1111.1735	hst-cos observations of hydrogen, helium, carbon and nitrogen emission  from the sn 1987a reverse shock	we present the most sensitive ultraviolet observations of supernova 1987a todate. imaging spectroscopy from the hubble space telescope-cosmic originsspectrograph shows many narrow (dv \sim 300 km/s) emission lines from thecircumstellar ring, broad (dv \sim 10 -- 20 x 10^3 km/s) emission lines fromthe reverse shock, and ultraviolet continuum emission. the high signal-to-noise(&gt; 40 per resolution element) broad lya emission is excited by soft x-ray andeuv heating of mostly neutral gas in the circumstellar ring and outer supernovadebris. the ultraviolet continuum at \lambda &gt; 1350a can be explained by hi2-photon emission from the same region. we confirm our earlier, tentativedetection of nv \lambda 1240 emission from the reverse shock and we present thefirst detections of broad heii \lambda1640, civ \lambda1550, and niv]\lambda1486 emission lines from the reverse shock. the helium abundance in thehigh-velocity material is he/h = 0.14 +/- 0.06. the nv/h-alpha line ratiorequires partial ion-electron equilibration (t_{e}/t_{p} \approx 0.14 - 0.35).we find that the n/c abundance ratio in the gas crossing the reverse shock issignificantly higher than that in the circumstellar ring, a result that may beattributed to chemical stratification in the outer envelope of the supernovaprogenitor. the n/c abundance ratio may have been stratified prior to the ringexpulsion, or this result may indicate continued cno processing in theprogenitor subsequent to the expulsion of the circumstellar ring.

1111.5237	generalized semi-analytical models of supernova light curves	we present generalized supernova (sn) light curve (lc) models for a varietyof power inputs. we provide an expression for the power input that is producedby self-similar forward and reverse shocks in sn ejecta - circumstellar matter(csm) interaction. we find that this ejecta-csm interaction luminosity is inagreement with results from multi-dimensional radiation hydrodynamicssimulations in the optically-thin case. we develop a model for the case of anoptically-thick csm by invoking an approximation for the effects of radiativediffusion. in the context of this model, we provide predictions for the time offorward shock break-out from the optically-thick part of the csm envelope. wealso introduce a hybrid lc model that incorporates ejecta-csm interaction plusni-56 and co-56 radioactive decay input. we fit this hybrid model to the lc ofthe super-luminous supernova (slsn) 2006gy. we find that this model provides abetter fit to the lc of this event than previously presented models. we alsoaddress the relation between type iil and type iin sn with ejecta-csminteraction models. forward and reverse shock power input due to csminteraction can produce the lcs of type iin sne in terms of duration, shape anddecline rate. this model can also produce lcs that are symmetric in shapearound peak luminosity. we conclude that the observed lc variety of sne typeiin and of the slsne is likely to be a byproduct of the large range ofconditions relevant to significant ejecta-csm interaction as a power source.

1201.1328	effects of rotation on the minimum mass of primordial progenitors of  pair instability supernovae	the issue of which stars may reach the conditions of electron/positron pairformation instability is of importance to understand the final evolution bothof the first stars and of contemporary stars. the criterion to enter the pairinstability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by themass of the oxygen core. the main sequence masses that produce a given oxygencore mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective androtationally-induced mixing. we examine the evolution of massive stars todetermine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instabilityeffects, either a pulsational pair instability (ppisn) or a full-fledgedpair-instability supernova (pisn). we concentrate on zero-metallicity starswith no mass loss subject to the schwarzschild criterion for convectiveinstability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the ledouxcriterion. as expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,the minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induceeffectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is convertedalmost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. for this case, we find that theminimum main sequence mass is ~40 msun to encounter ppisn and ~65 msun toencounter a pisn. when mass-loss is taken into account those mass limits become~50 msun for ppisn and ~80 msun for pisn progenitors. the implications of theseresults for the first stars and for contemporary supernovae is discussed.

1206.1938	effects of rotationally-induced mixing in compact binary systems with  low-mass secondaries and in single solar-type stars	many population synthesis and stellar evolution studies have addressed theevolution of close binary systems in which the primary is a compact remnant andthe secondary is filling its roche lobe, thus triggering mass transfer.although tidal locking is expected in such systems, most studies have neglectedthe rotationally-induced mixing that may occur. here we study the possibleeffects of mixing in the mass-losing stars for a range in secondary star massesand metallicities. we find that tidal locking can induce rotational mixingprior to contact and thus affect the evolution of the secondary star if theeffects of the spruit-tayler dynamo are included both for angular momentum andchemical transport. once contact is made, the effect of mass transfer tends tobe more rapid than the evolutionary time scale, so the effects of mixing are nolonger directly important, but the mass transfer strips matter to inner layersthat may have been affected by the mixing. these effects are enhanced forsecondaries of 1-1.2 msun and for lower metallicities. we discuss the possibleimplications for the paucity of carbon in the secondaries of the cataclysmicvariable ss cyg and the black hole candidate xte j1118+480 and for theprogenitor evolution of type ia supernovae. we also address the issue of theorigin of blue straggler stars in globular and open clusters. we find that formodels that include rotation consistent with that observed for some bluestraggler stars, evolution is chemically homogeneous. this leads to tracks inthe hr diagram that are brighter and bluer than the non-rotating main-sequenceturn-off point. rotational mixing could thus be one of the factors thatcontribute to the formation of blue stragglers.

0711.3925	the shape of cas a	based on optical, ir and x-ray studies of cas a, we propose a geometry forthe remnant based on a "jet-induced" scenario with significant systematicdepartures from axial symmetry. in this model, the main jet axis is oriented inthe direction of strong blue-shifted motion at an angle of 110 - 120 degreeseast of north and about 40 - 50 degrees to the east of the line of sight.normal to this axis would be an expanding torus as predicted by jet-inducedmodels. in the proposed geometry, iron-peak elements in the main jet-like flowcould appear "beyond" the portions of the remnant rich in silicon by projectioneffects, not the effect of mixing. in the context of the proposed geometry, thedisplacement of the compact object from the kinematic center of the remnant ata position angle of ~169 degrees can be accommodated if the motion of thecompact object is near to, but slightly off from, the direction of the main"jet" axis by of order 30 degrees. in this model, the classical ne "jet," thesw "counter-jet" and other protrusions, particularly the "hole" in the north,are non-asymmetric flows approximately in the equatorial plane, e.g., outthrough the perimeter of the expanding torus, rather than being associated withthe main jet. we explore the spoke-like flow in the equatorial plane in termsof rayleigh-taylor, richtmyer-meshkov and kelvin-helmholz instabilities andillustrate these instabilities with a jet-induced simulation.

1209.1021	white dwarf/m dwarf binaries as single degenerate progenitors of type ia  supernovae	limits on the companions of white dwarfs in the single degenerate scenariofor the origin of type ia supernovae (snia) have gotten increasingly tight. theonly type of non-degenerate stars that survive the limits on the companions ofsnia in snr 0509-67.5 and sn1572 are m dwarfs. m dwarfs have special propertiesthat have not been considered in most work on the progenitors of snia: theyhave small but finite magnetic fields, and they flare frequently. theseproperties are explored in the context of snia progenitors. white dwarf/m dwarfpairs may be sufficiently plentiful to provide an adequate rate of explosions.even modest magnetic fields on the white dwarf and m dwarf will yield adequatetorques to lock the two stars together, resulting in a slowly rotating whitedwarf, with the magnetic poles pointing at one another in the orbital plane.the mass loss will be channeled by a "magnetic bottle" connecting the twostars, landing on a concentrated polar area on the white dwarf. this enhancesthe effective rate of accretion compared to spherical accretion. luminosityfrom accretion and hydrogen burning on the surface of the white dwarf mayinduce self-excited mass transfer. the combined effects of self-excited massloss, polar accretion, and magnetic inhibition of mixing of accretion layersgive possible means to beat the "nova limit" and grow the white dwarf to thechandrasekhar mass even at rather moderate mass accretion rates.

1210.3428	on the rates of type ia supernovae in dwarf and giant hosts with  rotse-iiib	we present a sample of 23 spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae thatwere discovered in the background of galaxy clusters targeted by rotse-iiib anduse up to 18 of these to determine the local (z = 0.05) volumetric rate. sinceour survey is flux limited and thus biased against fainter objects, thepseudo-absolute magnitude distribution (pamd) of sneia in a given volume is animportant concern, especially the relative frequency of high to low-luminositysneia. we find that the pamd derived from the volume limited lick observatorysupernova search (loss) sample is incompatible with the distribution of sneiain a volume limited (z&lt;0.12) sub sample of the sdss-ii. the loss samplerequires far more low-luminosity sneia than the sdss-ii can accommodate. eventhough loss and sdss-ii have sampled different sneia populations, theirvolumetric rates are surprisingly similar. using the same model pamd adopted inthe sdss-ii sneia rate calculation and excluding two high-luminosity sneia fromour sample, we derive a rate that is marginally higher than previouslow-redshift determinations. with our full sample and the loss pamd our rate ismore than double the canonical value. we also find that 5 of our 18 sneia arehosted by very low-luminosity (m_b &gt; -16) galaxies, whereas only 1 out 79nearby sdss-ii sneia have such faint hosts. it is possible that previous workshave under-counted either low luminosity sneia, sneia in low luminosity hosts,or peculiar sneia (sometimes explicitly), and the total sneia rate may behigher than the canonical value.

1212.5051	the morphology of the ejecta in supernova 1987a: a study over time and  wavelength	we present a study of the morphology of the ejecta in supernova 1987a basedon images and spectra from the hst as well as integral field spectroscopy fromvlt/sinfoni. the hst observations were obtained between 1994 - 2011 andprimarily probe the outer hydrogen-rich zones of the ejecta. the sinfoniobservations were obtained in 2005 and 2011 and instead probe the [si i]/[feii] emission from the inner regions. we find a strong temporal evolution of themorphology in the hst images, from a roughly elliptical shape before ~5,000days, to a more irregular, edge-brightened morphology thereafter. thistransition is a natural consequence of the change in the dominant energy sourcepowering the ejecta, from radioactive decay before ~5,000 days to x-ray inputfrom the circumstellar interaction thereafter. the [si i]/[fe ii] imagesdisplay a more uniform morphology, which may be due to a remaining significantcontribution from radioactivity in the inner ejecta and the higher abundance ofthese elements in the core. both the h-alpha and the [si i]/[fe ii] lineprofiles show that the ejecta are distributed fairly close to the plane of theinner circumstellar ring, which is assumed to define the rotational axis of theprogenitor. the h-alpha emission extends to higher velocities than [si i]/[feii] as expected. there is no clear symmetry axis for all the emission and weare unable to model the ejecta distribution with a simple ellipsoid model witha uniform distribution of dust. instead, we find that the emission isconcentrated to clumps and that the emission is distributed somewhat closer tothe ring in the north than in the south. this north-south asymmetry may bepartially explained by dust absorption. we compare our results with explosionmodels and find some qualitative agreement, but note that the observations showa higher degree of large-scale asymmetry.

1302.0911	rates of superluminous supernovae at z~0.2	we calculate the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae (slsne) based on5 events discovered with the rotse-iiib telescope. we gather light curves of 19events from the literature and our own unpublished data and employ crudek-corrections to constrain the pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions in therest frame rotse-iiib (unfiltered) band pass for both the hydrogen poor(slsn-i) and hydrogen rich (slsn-ii) populations. we find that the peakmagnitudes of the available slsn-i are narrowly distributed ($m = -21.7 \pm0.4$) in our unfiltered band pass and may suggest an even tighter intrinsicdistribution when the effects of dust are considered, although the sample maybe skewed by selection and publication biases. the presence of oii featuresnear maximum light may uniquely signal a high luminosity event, and we suggestfurther observational and theoretical work is warranted to assess the possibleutility of such sn 2005ap-like slsn-i as distance indicators. using thepseudo-absolute magnitude distributions derived from the light curve sample, wemeasure the slsn-i rate to be about (32^{+77}_{-26}) events gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}h_{71}^{3} at a weighted redshift of z = 0.17, and the slsn-ii rate to be about(151^{+151}_{-82}) events gpc^{-3} yr^{-1} h_{71}^{3} at z = 0.15. given thatthe exact nature and limits of these populations are still unknown, we discusshow it may be difficult to distinguish these rare slsne from other transientphenomena such as agn activity and tidal disruption events even when multi-bandphotometry, spectroscopy, or even high resolution imaging are available.including one spectroscopically peculiar event, we determine a total rate forslsn-like events of (199^{+137}_{-86}) events gpc^{-3} yr^{-1} h_{71}^{3} at z= 0.16.

0803.1689	the effect of turbulent intermittency on the deflagration to detonation  transition in sn ia explosions	we examine the effects of turbulent intermittency on the deflagration todetonation transition (ddt) in type ia supernovae. the zel'dovich mechanism forddt requires the formation of a nearly isothermal region of mixed ash and fuelthat is larger than a critical size. we primarily consider the hypothesis bykhokhlov et al. and niemeyer and woosley that the nearly isothermal, mixedregion is produced when the flame makes the transition to the distributedregime. we use two models for the distribution of the turbulent velocityfluctuations to estimate the probability as a function of the density in theexploding white dwarf that a given region of critical size is in thedistributed regime due to strong local turbulent stretching of the flamestructure. we also estimate lower limits on the number of such regions as afunction of density. we find that the distributed regime, and hence perhapsddt, occurs in a local region of critical size at a density at least a factorof 2-3 larger than predicted for mean conditions that neglect intermittency.this factor brings the transition density to be much larger than the empiricalvalue from observations in most situations. we also consider the intermittencyeffect on the more stringent conditions for ddt by lisewski et al. and woosley.we find that a turbulent velocity of $10^8$ cm/s in a region of size $10^6$ cm,required by lisewski et al., is rare. we expect that intermittency gives aweaker effect on the woosley model with stronger criterion. the predictedtransition density from this criterion remains below $10^7$ g/cm$^3$ afteraccounting for intermittency using our intermittency models.

1410.0039	emission from pair-instability supernovae with rotation	pair instability supernovae have been suggested as candidates for some superluminous supernovae, such as sn 2007bi, and as one of the dominant types ofexplosion occurring in the early universe from massive, zero-metallicitypopulation iii stars. the progenitors of such events can be rapidly rotating,therefore exhibiting different evolutionary properties due to the effects ofrotationally-induced mixing and mass-loss. proper identification of such eventsrequires rigorous radiation hydrodynamics and radiative transfer calculationsthat capture not only the behavior of the light curve but also the spectralevolution of these events. we present radiation hydrodynamics and radiationtransport calculations for 90-300 msun rotating pair-instability supernovaecovering both the shock break-out and late light curve phases. we alsoinvestigate cases of different initial metallicity and rotation rate todetermine the impact of these parameters on the detailed spectralcharacteristics of these events. in agreement with recent results onnon-rotating pair instability supernovae, we find that for a range ofprogenitor masses and rotation rates these events have intrinsically red colorsin contradiction with observations of super-luminous supernovae. thespectroscopic properties of rotating pair instability supernovae are similar tothose of non-rotating events with stripped hydrogen and helium envelopes. wefind that the progenitor metallicity and rotation rate properties are erasedafter the explosion and cannot be identified in the resulting model spectra. itis the combined effects of pre-supernova mass-loss and the basic properties ofthe supernova ejecta such as mass, temperature and velocity that have the mostdirect impact in the model spectra of pair instability supernovae.

1411.5714	the role of the magnetorotational instability in massive stars	the magnetorotational instability (mri) is key physics in accretion disks andis widely considered to play some role in massive-star core collapse. models ofrotating massive stars naturally develop very strong shear at compositionboundaries, a necessary condition for mri instability, and the mri is subjectto triply-diffusive destabilizing effects in radiative regions. we have usedthe mesa stellar evolution code to compute magnetic effects due to thespruit-taylor mechanism and the mri, separately and together, in a sample ofmassive star models. we find that the mri can be active in the later stages ofmassive star evolution, leading to mixing effects that are not captured inmodels that neglect the mri. the mri and related magneto-rotational effects canmove models of given zams mass across "boundaries" from degenerate co cores todegenerate o/ne/mg cores and from degenerate o/ne/mg cores to iron cores, thusaffecting the final evolution and the physics of core collapse. the mri actingalone can slow the rotation of the inner core in general agreement with theobserved "initial" rotation rates of pulsars. the mri analysis suggests thatlocalized fields ~10^{12} g may exist at the boundary of the iron core. withboth the st and mri mechanisms active in the 20 solar mass model, we find thatthe helium shell mixes entirely out into the envelope. enhanced mixing couldyield a population of yellow or even blue supergiant supernova progenitors thatwould not be standard sn iip.

1502.07278	high-velocity features of calcium and silicon in the spectra of type ia  supernovae	"high-velocity features" (hvfs) are spectral features in type ia supernovae(sne ia) that have minima indicating significantly higher (by greater thanabout 6000 km/s) velocities than typical "photospheric-velocity features"(pvfs). the pvfs are absorption features with minima indicating typicalphotospheric (i.e., bulk ejecta) velocities (usually ~9000-15,000 km/s nearb-band maximum brightness). in this work we undertake the most in-depth studyof hvfs ever performed. the dataset used herein consists of 445 low-resolutionoptical and near-infrared (nir) spectra (at epochs up to 5 d past maximumbrightness) of 210 low-redshift sne ia that follow the "phillips relation." aseries of gaussian functions is fit to the data in order to characterisepossible hvfs of ca ii h&amp;k, si ii {\lambda}6355, and the ca ii nir triplet. thetemporal evolution of the velocities and strengths of the pvfs and hvfs ofthese three spectral features is investigated, as are possible correlationswith other sn ia observables. we find that while hvfs of ca ii are regularlyobserved (except in underluminous sne ia, where they are never found), hvfs ofsi ii {\lambda}6355 are significantly rarer, and they tend to exist at theearliest epochs and mostly in objects with large photospheric velocities. it isalso shown that stronger hvfs of si ii {\lambda}6355 are found in objects thatlack c ii absorption at early times and that have red ultraviolet/opticalcolours near maximum brightness. these results lead to a self-consistentconnection between the presence and strength of hvfs of si ii {\lambda}6355 andmany other mutually correlated sn~ia observables, including photosphericvelocity.

astro-ph;0112020	asymmetric supernovae from magneto-centrifugal jets	strong toroidal magnetic fields generated in stellar collapse can generatemagneto-centrifugal jets in analogy to those found in simulations of black holeaccretion and explain why all core collapse supernovae are found to besubstantially asymmetric and predominantly bi-polar. we describe two phases:the initial leblanc-wilson jet and a subsequent protopulsar or toroidal jetthat propagates at about the core escape velocity. the jets will produce bowshocks that tend to expel matter, including iron and silicon, into equatorialtori, accounting for observations of the element distribution in cas a. amagnetic ``switch'' mechanism may apply in instances of low density and largemagnetic field with subsequent increase in the speed and collimation of thetoroidal jet, depositing relatively little momentum. the result could be enoughinfall to form a black hole with a third, highly relativistic jet that couldcatch up to the protopulsar jet after it has emerged from the star. theinteraction of these two jets could generate internal shocks and explain thepresence of iron lines in the afterglow. recent estimates that typicalgamma-ray burst energy is about 3x10^50 erg imply either a very low efficiencyfor conversion of rotation into jets, or a rather rapid turnoff of the jetprocess even though the black hole still rotates rapidly. magnetars and``hypernovae'' might arise in an intermediate parameter regime of energeticjets that yield larger magnetic fields and provide more energy than the routinecase, but that are not so tightly collimated that they yield failed supernova.(slightly abridged)

astro-ph;0301312	analysis of the flux and polarization spectra of the type ia supernova  sn 2001el: exploring the geometry of the high-velocity ejecta	sn 2001el is the first normal type ia supernova to show a strong, intrinsicpolarization signal. in addition, during the epochs prior to maximum light, thecaii ir triplet absorption is seen distinctly and separately at both normalphotospheric velocities and at very high velocities. the high-velocity tripletabsorption is highly polarized, with a different polarization angle than therest of the spectrum. the unique observation allows us to construct arelatively detailed picture of the layered geometrical structure of thesupernova ejecta: in our interpretation, the ejecta layers near the photosphere(v \approx 10,000 km/s) obey a near axial symmetry, while a detached,high-velocity structure (v \approx 18,000-25,000 km/s) with high caii lineopacity deviates from the photospheric axisymmetry. by partially obscuring theunderlying photosphere, the high-velocity structure causes a more incompletecancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light, and so gives riseto the polarization peak and rotated polarization angle of the high-velocity irtriplet feature. in an effort to constrain the ejecta geometry, we develop atechnique for calculating 3-d synthetic polarization spectra and use it togenerate polarization profiles for several parameterized configurations. inparticular, we examine the case where the inner ejecta layers are ellipsoidaland the outer, high-velocity structure is one of four possibilities: aspherical shell, an ellipsoidal shell, a clumped shell, or a toroid. thesynthetic spectra rule out the spherical shell model, disfavor a toroid, andfind a best fit with the clumped shell. we show further that differentgeometries can be more clearly discriminated if observations are obtained fromseveral different lines of sight.

astro-ph;0307543	importance of biologically active aurora-like ultraviolet emission:  stochastic irradiation of earth and mars by flares and explosions	(abridged) we show that sizeable fractions of incident ionizing radiationfrom stochastic astrophysical sources can be redistributed to biologically andchemically important uv wavelengths, a significant fraction of which can reachthe surface. this redistribution is mediated by secondary electrons, resultingfrom compton scattering and x-ray photoabsorption, with energies low enough toexcite atmospheric molecules and atoms, resulting in a rich aurora-likespectrum. we calculate the fraction of energy redistributed into biologicallyand chemically important wavelength regions for spectra characteristic ofstellar flares and supernovae using a monte-carlo transport code written forthis problem and then estimate the fraction of this energy that is transmittedfrom the atmospheric altitudes of redistribution to the surface for a fewillustrative cases. redistributed fractions are found to be of order 1%, evenin the presence of an ozone shield. this result implies that planetaryorganisms will be subject to mutationally significant, if intermittent,fluences of uv-b and harder radiation even in the presence of a narrow-band uvshield like ozone. we also calculate the surficial transmitted fraction ofionizing radiation and redistributed ultraviolet radiation for two illustrativeevolving mars atmospheres whose initial surface pressures were 1 bar. ourresults suggest that coding organisms on planets orbiting low-mass stars (andon the early earth) may evolve very differently than on contemporary earth,with diversity and evolutionary rate controlled by a stochastically varyingmutation rate and frequent hypermutation episodes.

astro-ph;0308311	transport of ionizing radiation in terrestrial-like exoplanet  atmospheres	(abridged) the propagation of ionizing radiation through model atmospheres ofterrestrial-like exoplanets is studied for a large range of column densitiesand incident photon energies using a monte carlo code we have developed totreat compton scattering and photoabsorption. incident spectra from parent starflares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts are modeled and compared to energeticparticles in importance. we find that terrestrial-like exoplanets withatmospheres thinner than about 100 g cm^-2 transmit and reprocess a significantfraction of incident gamma-rays, producing a characteristic, flat surficialspectrum. thick atmospheres (&gt;~ 100 g cm^-2) efficiently block even gamma-rays,but nearly all incident energy is redistributed into diffuse uv and visibleaurora-like emission, increasing the effective atmospheric transmission by manyorders of magnitude. depending on the presence of molecular uv absorbers andatmospheric thickness, up to 10% of the incident energy can reach the surfaceas uv reemission. for the earth, between 2 x 10^-3 and 4 x 10^-2 of theincident flux reaches the ground in the biologically effective 200--320 nmrange, depending on o_2/o_3 shielding. finally, we suggest that transientatmospheric ionization layers can be frequently created at low altitudes. weconclude that these events can produce frequent fluctuations in atmosphericionization levels and surficial uv fluxes on terrestrial-like planets.

astro-ph;0512580	the convective urca process with implicit two-dimensional hydrodynamics	consideration of the role of the convective flux in the thermodymics of theconvective urca neutrino loss process in degenerate, convective, quasi-static,carbon-burning cores shows that the convective urca process slows down theconvective current around the urca-shell, but, unlike the "thermal" urcaprocess, does not reduce the entropy or temperature for a given convectivevolume. here we demonstrate these effects with two-dimensional numericalhydrodynamical calculations. these two-dimensional implicit hydrodynamicscalculations invoke an artificial speeding up of the nuclear and weak rates.they should thus be regarded as indicative, but still qualitative. we findthat, compared to a case with no urca-active nuclei, the case with urca effectsleads to a higher entropy in the convective core because the energy released bynuclear burning is confined to a smaller volume by the effective boundary atthe urca shell. all else being equal, this will tend to accelerate theprogression to dynamical runaway. we discuss the open issues regarding theimpact of the convective urca process on the evolution to the "smolderingphase" and then to dynamical runaway.

astro-ph;0609717	de-leptonization and non-axisymmetric instabilities in core collapse  supernovae	the timescale of de-leptonization by neutrino loss and associated contractionof a proto-neutron star is short compared to the time to progagate a shockthrough the helium core of a massive star, and so the de-leptonization phasedoes not occur in the vacuum of space, but within the supernova ambiancewhether or not there has been a successful explosion. dynamicalnon-axisymmetric instabilities (naxi) are predicted for sufficiently stronglydifferentially rotating proto-neutron stars. some modes are unstable for smallvalues of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to binding energy, t/|w| &gt;0.01. the naxi are likely to drive magnetoacoustic waves into the surroundingtime-dependent density structure. these waves represent a mechanism of thedissipation of the free energy of differential rotation of the proto-neutronstar, and the outward deposition of this energy may play a role in thesupernova explosion process. we estimate the power produced by this process andthe associated timescale and discuss the possible systematics of thede-leptonization phase in this context. a likely possibility is that theproto-neutron star will spin down through these effects before de-leptonizationand produce substantial but not excessive energy input.

astro-ph;9603159	the speed of cooling fronts and the functional form of the dimensionless  viscosity in accretion disks	we examine the speed of inward traveling cooling fronts in accretion disks.we show that their speed is determined by the rarefaction wave that precedesthem and is approximately $\alpha_f c_{f} (h/r)^q$, where $\alpha_f$ is thedimensionless viscosity, $c_{f}$ is the sound speed, $r$ is the radialcoordinate, $h$ is the disk thickness, and all quantities are evaluated at thecooling front. the scaling exponent $q$ lies in the interval $[0,1]$, dependingon the slope of the $(t,\sigma)$ relation in the hot state. for a kramer's lawopacity and $\alpha\propto (h/r)^n$, where $n$ is of order unity, we find that$q\sim 1/2$. this supports the numerical work of cannizzo, chen and livio(1995) and their conclusion that $n\approx3/2$ is necessary to reproduce theexponential decay of luminosity in black hole x-ray binary systems. our resultsare insensitive to the structure of the disk outside of the radius where rapidcooling sets in. in particular, the width of the rapid cooling zone is aconsequence of the cooling front speed rather than its cause. we conclude thatthe exponential luminosity decay of cooling disks is probably compatible withthe wave-driven dynamo model. it is not compatible with models with separate,constant values of $\alpha$ for the hot and cold states.

astro-ph;9710148	constraints on torque-reversing accretion-powered x-ray pulsars	the observed abrupt torque reversals in x-ray pulsars, 4u 1626-67, gx 1+4,and oao 1657-415, can be explained by transition in accretion flow rotationfrom keplerian to sub-keplerian, which takes place at a critical accretionrate, $\sim 10^{16}-10^{17}g/s$. when a pulsar system spins up near equilibriumspin before the transition, the system goes into spin-down after transition tosub-keplerian. if a system is well into the spin-up regime, the transition cancause a sharp decrease in spin-up rate but not a sudden spin-down. theseobservable types of abrupt torque change are distinguished from the smoothtorque variation caused by change of ${\dot m}$ in the keplerian flow. theobserved abrupt torque reversal is expected when the pulsar magnetic field$b_*\sim 5\times 10^{11}b_p^{-1/2}l_{x,36}^{1/2}p_{*,10}^{1/2}g$ where themagnetic pitch parameter $b_p\sim$ a few, $l_{x,36}$ is the x-ray luminosity in$10^{36} erg/s$, and $p_{*,10}$ is the pulsar spin period in 10s. observedquasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) periods tightly constrain the model. for 4u1626-67, ${\dot m}\approx 2.7\times 10^{16}g/s$ with $b_p^{1/2} b_*\approx2\times 10^{12}g$. we estimate ${\dot m}\sim 6\times 10^{16} g/s$ and$b_p^{1/2}b_*\sim 5\times 10^{13}g$ for gx 1+4, and ${\dot m} \sim 1\times10^{17} g/s$ and $b_p^{1/2}b_*\sim 2\times 10^{13}g$ for oao 1657-415. reliabledetection of qpos before and after torque reversal could directly test themodel.

astro-ph;9711273	r-process in collapsing o/ne/mg cores	several circumstantial arguments point to the formation of the thirdr-process peak at a about 190, near platinum, in stars of mass of about 8-10solar masses: 1) the delayed production of europium with respect to ironimposes a time scale that restricts the progenitor stars to less than about 10solar masses; 2) the r-process demands a dominant robust mechanism at least forbarium and above, since the relative abundance pattern of those r-processelements in low-metallicity stars is consistent with the solar pattern; 3)stars of about 8-10 solar masses produce nearly identical degenerate o/ne/mgcores that collapse due to electron capture; and 4) the resulting low-masscores may produce both an r-process in a prompt explosion and a subsequentr-process in a neutrino driven wind. the prompt explosion of an o/ne/mg coreyields low entropy and low electron fraction, and hence may produce areasonable r-process peak at a about 190 as well as all of the r-processelements with z greater than 56. the possible differences in theneutrino-driven wind and associated r-process due to the low-mass neutron starsexpected in this mass range are also discussed.

astro-ph;9806212	the supernova-gamma ray burst connection	supernovae 1998bw and its corresponding relativistically expanding radiosource are coincident with the \grb source grb 980425. we show that of sixrecent sn ib/c for which an outburst epoch can be estimated with somereliability, four have radio outbursts and all are correlated in time and spacewith batse \grbs. the joint probability of all six correlations is1.5$\times10^{-5}$. no such correlation exists for sn ia and sn ii. the \gr\energy associated with the sn/grb events is $\sim10^{46} - 10^{48}$ ergs ifemitted isotropically. economy of hypotheses leads us to propose that all \grbsare associated with supernovae and that the \grb events have a quasi-isotropiccomponent that cannot be observed at cosmological distances and a stronglycollimated and doppler-boosted component that can only be seen if lookingnearly along the collimation axis. such collimation requires a high rate ofoccurrence perhaps consistent with a supernova rate. the collimated flow may begenerated by core collapse to produce rotating, magnetized neutron stars. allcore collapse events may produce such jets, but only the ones that occur insupernovae with small or missing hydrogen envelopes, type ib or ic, canpropagate into the interstellar medium and yield a visible \grb. we suggestthat asymmetries in line profiles and spectropolarimetry of sn ii and sn ib/c,pulsar runaway velocities, soft \gr repeaters and \grbs are associatedphenomena.

astro-ph;9904047	the supernova gamma-ray burst connection	study of the polarization of supernovae has suggested that the core collapseprocess may be intrinsically strongly asymmetric. there is a tentative trendfor supernova with smaller envelopes showing more polarization, with type ichaving the smallest envelopes and showing the largest polarization. the recentdiscovery of the unusual supernova sn 1998bw and its apparent correlation withthe gamma-ray burst grb~980425 has raised new issues concerning both thegamma-ray bursts and supernovae. sn 1998bw resembled a type ic, but wasunusually bright at maximum light in the optical and radio, and its expansionvelocities were large. this makes sn 1998bw a possible candidate for a"hypernova" with explosion energies exceeding 10^52 erg. we show that the lightcurve of sn 1998bw can be understood as the result of viewing an asphericalexplosion roughly along the symmetry axis of an exploding, non-degenerate c/ocore of a massive star with a kinetic energy of 2x10^51 erg, a total ejectamass of 2 solar masses, and a nickel-56 mass of 0.2 solar masses. in thismodel, the high expansion velocities are a direct consequence of the asphericalexplosion which, in turn, produces oblate iso-density contours and thataccounts for the polarization. it is not yet clear how either the hypernovae orthese asymmetric models can produce gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;9908127	the distribution of high and low redshift type ia supernovae	the distribution of high redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia) with respect toprojected distance from the center of the host galaxy is studied and comparedto the distribution of local sne. the distribution of high-z sne ia is found tobe similar to the local sample of sne ia discovered with ccds, but differentthan the sample discovered photographically. this is shown to be due to theshaw effect. these results have implications for the use of sne ia to determinecosmological parameters if the local sample of supernovae used to calibrate thelight curve decline relationships is drawn from a sample discoveredphotographically. a k-s test shows that the probability that the high redshiftsne of the supernova cosmology project are drawn from the same distribution asthe low redshift calibrators of riess et al. is 0.1%. this is a potentialproblem because photographically discovered sne are preferentially discoveredfarther away from the galaxy nucleus, where sne show a lower scatter inabsolute magnitude, and are on average 0.3 magnitudes fainter than sne locatedcloser to the center of their host galaxy. this raises questions about whetheror not the calibration sne sample the full range of parameters potentiallypresent in high redshift sne ia. the limited data available suggest that thecalibration process is adequate; however, it would be preferable if highredshift sne and the low redshift sne used to calibrate them were drawn fromthe same sample, as subtle differences may be important. data are alsopresented which suggest that the seeming anti-malmquist trend noticed bytammann et al.(1996, 1998) for sne ia in galaxies with cepheid distances may bedue to the location of the sne in their host galaxies.

astro-ph;9908302	black-hole x-ray transients: the effect of irradiation on time-dependent  accretion disk structure	some effects of irradiation on time-dependent accretion-disk models for blackhole x-ray novae are presented. two types of irradiation are considered: directirradiation from the inner hot disk and indirect irradiation as might bereflected by a corona or chromosphere above the disk. the shadowing effect ofthe time-dependent evolution of the disk height and consequent blocking of theouter disk by the inner and middle portions of the disk from the directirradiation is included. the direct irradiation of the disk by inner layerswhere the soft x-ray flux is generated is found to have only a small effect onthe outer disk because of shadowing. mild indirect irradiation that flattens,but otherwise does not affect the light curve substantially, still hasinteresting non-linear effects on the structure of the disk as heating andcooling waves propagate. the irradiated disks do not always make simpletransitions between the hot and cold states, but can linger at intermediatetemperatures or even return temporarily to the hot state, depending on theirradiation and the activity in adjacent portions of the disk.

astro-ph;9909096	conference summary: supernovae and gamma-ray bursts	there are hints that nearby type ia supernovae may be a little different thanthose at large redshift. confidence in the conclusion that there is acosmological constant and an accelerating universe thus still requires the hardwork of sorting out potential systematic effects. polarization data show thatcore-collapse supernovae (type ii and ib/c) probably depart strongly fromspherical symmetry. evidence for exceedingly energetic supernovae must beconsidered self-consistently with evidence that they are asymmetric, acondition that affects energy estimates. jets arising near the compact objectcan produce such asymmetries. there is growing conviction that gamma-ray burstsintrinsically involve collimated or jet-like flow and hence that they are alsostrongly asymmetric. sn 1998bw is a potential rosetta stone that will help tosort out the physics of explosive events. are events like sn 1998bw moreclosely related to "ordinary" supernovae or "hypernovae?" do they leave behindneutron stars as "ordinary" pulsars or "magnetars" or is the remnant a blackhole? are any of these events associated with classic cosmic gamma-ray burstsas suggested by the supernova-like modulation of the afterglows of grb 970228,grb 980326 and grb 990712?

astro-ph;9909293	asymmetric supernovae, pulsars, magnetars, and gamma-ray bursts	we outline the possible physical processes, associated timescales, andenergetics that could lead to the production of pulsars, jets, asymmetricsupernovae, and weak gamma-ray bursts in routine circumstances and to amagnetar and perhaps stronger gamma-ray burst in more extreme circumstances inthe collapse of the bare core of a massive star. the production of aleblanc-wilson mhd jet could provide an asymmetric supernova and result in aweak gamma-ray burst when the jet accelerates down the stellar density gradientof a hydrogen-poor photosphere. the matter-dominated jet would be formedpromptly, but requires 5 to 10 s to reach the surface of the progenitor of atype ib/c supernova. during this time, the newly-born neutron star couldcontract, spin up, and wind up field lines or turn on an alpha-omega dynamo. inaddition, the light cylinder will contract from a radius large compared to thealfven radius to a size comparable to that of the neutron star. this willdisrupt the structure of any organized dipole field and promote the generationof ultrarelativistic mhd waves (umhdw) at high density and large amplitudeelectromagnetic waves (laemw) at low density. the generation of the these waveswould be delayed by the cooling time of the neutron star about 5 to 10 seconds,but the propagation time is short so the umhdw could arrive at the surface atabout the same time as the matter jet. in the density gradient of the star andthe matter jet, the intense flux of umhdw and laemw could drive shocks,generate pions by proton-proton collision, or create electron/positron pairsdepending on the circumstances. the umhdw and laemw could influence thedynamics of the explosion and might also tend to flow out the rotation axis toproduce a collimated gamma-ray burst.

astro-ph;9912033	bi-polar supernova explosions	we discuss the optical spectropolarimetry of several core-collapsesupernovae, sn 1996cb (type iib), sn 1997x (type ic), and sn 1998s (type iin).the data show polarization evolution of several spectral features at levelsfrom 0.5% to above 4%. the observed line polarization is intrinsic to thesupernovae and not of interstellar origin. these data suggest that the thedistribution of ejected matter is highly aspherical. in the case of sn 1998s,the minimum major to minor axis ratio must be larger than 2.5 to 1 if thepolarization is 3% from an oblate spheroidal ejecta seen edge on. awell-defined symmetry axis can be deduced from spectropolarimetry for thepeculiar type iin supernova sn 1998s but the type iib events sn 1993j and sn1996cb seem to possess much more complicated geometries with polarizationposition angles showing larger irregular variations across spectral features;the latter may be associated with large scale clumpiness of the ejecta. theobserved degree of polarization of the type ic sn 1997x is above 5%. the datareveal a trend that the degree of polarization increases with decreasingenvelope mass and with the depth within the ejecta. we speculate that type iib,type ib, and type ic may be very similar events viewed from different aspectangles.  the high axial ratio of the ejecta is difficult to explain in terms of theconventional neutrino driven core-collapse models for type ii explosions.highly asymmetric explosion mechanisms such as the formation of bipolar jetsduring core-collapse may be a necessary ingredient for models of allcore-collapse supernovae.

astro-ph;9912403	cosmic explosions: rapporteur summary of the 10th maryland astrophysics  conference	this meeting covered the range of cosmic explosions from solar flares togamma-ray bursts. a common theme is the role of rotation and magnetic fields. arigorous examination is underway to characterize systematic effects that mightalter the type ia supernova results suggesting an accelerating universe. thediscovery of the central point of x-ray emission in cas a by cxo should givenew insight into the core collapse problem in general and the nature of thestill undetected compact remnant in sn 1987a in particular. jets were describedfrom protostars to microquasars to blazars to gamma-ray bursts. polarizationstudies of core-collapse supernovae lead to the conclusion that core collapseis not merely asymmetric, but strongly bi-polar. to account for normalcore-collapse supernovae, the explosion must be jet-like in routinecircumstances, that is, in the formation of neutron stars, not only for blackholes. given the observed asymmetries, estimates of explosion energies based onspherically-symmetric models must be regarded with caution. the strongpossibility that at least some gamma-ray bursts arise from massive stars meansthat it is no longer possible to decouple models of the gamma-ray burst andafterglow from considerations of the "machine." the implied correlation ofgamma-ray bursts with star formation and massive stars and evidence for jetsdoes not distinguish a black hole collapsar model from models based on thebirth of a magnetar. calorimetry of at least one afterglow suggests thatgamma-ray bursts cannot involve highly inefficient internal shock models.essentally all gamma-ray burst models involve the "blandford anxiety," theorigin of nearly equipartition magnetic fields in the associated relativisticshocks.

astro-ph;9912433	detection of co and dust emission in near-infrared spectra of sn 1998s	near-infrared spectra (0.95 -- 2.4 micron) of the peculiar type iin supernova1998s in ngc 3877 from 95 to 355 days after maximum light are presented. k-banddata taken at days 95 and 225 show the presence of the first overtone of coemission near 2.3 micron, which is gone by day 355. an apparent extended bluewing on the co profile in the day 95 spectrum could indicate a large coexpansion velocity (~2000 -- 3000 km/s). this is the third detection ofinfrared co emission in nearly as many type ii supernovae studied, implyingthat molecule formation may be fairly common in type ii events, and that theearly formation of molecules in sn 1987a may be typical rather thanexceptional. multi-peak hydrogen and helium lines suggest that sn 1998s isinteracting with a circumstellar disk, and the fading of the red side of thisprofile with time is suggestive of dust formation in the ejecta, perhapsinduced by co cooling. continuum emission that rises towards longer wavelengths(j -&gt; k) is seen after day 225 with an estimated near-infrared luminosity &gt;~10^40 erg/s. this may be related to the near-infrared excesses seen in a numberof other supernovae. if this continuum is due to free-free emission, itrequires an exceptionally shallow density profile. on the other hand, the shapeof the continuum is well fit by a 1200 +- 150 k blackbody spectrum possibly dueto thermal emission from dust. interestingly, we observe a similar 1200 kblackbody-like, near-infrared continuum in sn 1997ab, another type iinsupernova at an even later post-maximum epoch (day 1064+). a number of dustemission scenarios are discussed, and we conclude that the nir dust continuumis likely powered by the interaction of sn 1998s with the circumstellar medium.

astro-ph;9912564	astrophysical and astrobiological implications of gamma-ray burst  properties	combining results for the local cosmic rate and mean peak luminosity of grbswith the cosmic history of the star formation rate, we provide estimates forthe local grb rate per unit blue luminosity in galaxies. we find a typical grbrate per unit b luminosity of 2.4x10^-17 h_{70}^2/lsun/yr. the correspondingmean rate in the milky way is 5.5x10^-7 h_{70}^2/yr. we conclude: 1) the ratioof supernova rate to isotropic equivalent grb rate is large: more than 6000snibc per grb or 30,000 snii per grb. grbs could arise in a large fraction ofblack hole-forming events only with collimation in the range 0.01 - 0.001 and asteep enough slope of the imf; 2) grbs cannot account for the majority of largehi holes observed in galaxies; 3) the probability that the solar system wasexposed to a fluence large enough to melt the chondrules during the first 10^7yr of solar system history is negligibly small; 4) even for very opaqueatmospheres, a significant fraction of the grb energy is transmitted as uvlines due to excitation by secondary electrons. for eukaryotic-like organismsin thin atmospheres (e.g. contemporary mars), or for uv line exposure in thickatmospheres (e.g. earth), biologically significant events occur at a rate ofabout 100--500 /gyr. the direct contribution of these "jolts" to mutationalevolution may, however, be negligible because of the short duration of thegrbs. evolutionary effects due to partial sterilizations and to longer-liveddisruptions of atmospheric chemistry should be more important.
