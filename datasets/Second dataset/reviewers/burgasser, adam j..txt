0706.1601	discovery of 11 new t dwarfs in the two micron all-sky survey, including  a possible l/t transition binary	we present the discovery of 11 new t dwarfs, found during the course of aphotometric survey for mid-to-late t dwarfs in the 2mass point source catalogand from a proper motion selected sample of ultracool dwarfs in the 2massworking database. using the nasa infrared telescope facility spex spectrograph,we obtained low-resolution (r~150) spectroscopy, allowing us to derivenear-infrared spectral types of t2-t8. one of these new t dwarfs, 2massj13243559+6358284, was also discovered independently by metchev et al., inprep. this object is spectroscopically peculiar and possibly a binary and/orvery young (&lt;300 myr). we specifically attempted to model the spectrum of thissource as a composite binary to reproduce its peculiar spectralcharacteristics. the latest-type object in our sample is a t8 dwarf, 2massj07290002-3954043, now one of the four latest-type t dwarfs known. all 11 tdwarfs are nearby given their spectrophotometric distance estimates, with 1 tdwarf within 10 pc and 8 additional t dwarfs within 25 pc, if single. these newadditions increase the 25 pc census of t dwarfs by ~14%. their proximity offersan excellent opportunity to probe for companions at closer separations than arepossible for more distant t dwarfs.

0706.1965	sdss j080531.84+481233.0: an unresolved l dwarf/t dwarf binary	sdss j080531.84+481233.0 is a peculiar l-type dwarf that exhibits unusuallyblue near-infrared and mid-infrared colors and divergent optical (l4) andnear-infrared (l9.5) spectral classifications. these peculiar spectral traitshave been variously attributed to condensate cloud effects or subsolarmetallicity. here i present an improved near-infrared spectrum of this sourcewhich further demonstrates the presence of weak ch4 absorption at 1.6 micronbut no corresponding band at 2.2 micron. it is shown that these features can becollectively reproduced by the combined light spectrum of a binary with l4.5and t5 components, as deduced by spectral template matching. thus, sdssj080531.84+481233.0 appears to be a new low-mass binary straddling the ldwarf/t dwarf transition, an evolutionary phase for brown dwarfs that remainspoorly understood by current theoretical models. the case of sdssj080531.84+481233.0 further illustrates how a select range of l dwarf/t dwarfbinaries could be identified and characterized without the need for highangular resolution imaging or radial velocity monitoring, potentiallyalleviating some of the detection biases and limitations inherent to suchtechniques.

0903.1567	optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the l subdwarf sdss  j125637.13-022452.4	red optical and near-infrared spectroscopy are presented for sdssj125637.13-022452.4, one of only four l subdwarfs reported to date. these dataconfirm the low-temperature, metal-poor nature of this source, as indicated byprominent metal-hydride bands, alkali lines, and collision-induced h2absorption. the optical and near-infrared spectra of sdss j1256-0224 aresimilar to those of the sdl4 2mass j16262034+3925190, and we derive aclassification of sdl3.5 based on the preliminary scheme of burgasser, cruz, &amp;kirkpatrick. the kinematics of sdss j1256-0224 are consistent with membershipin the galactic inner halo, with estimated $uvw$ space velocities indicating aslightly prograde, eccentric and inclined galactic orbit (3.5 &lt;~ r &lt;~ 11 kpc;|zmax| = 7.5 kpc). comparison to synthetic spectra computed with the phoenixcode, including the recent implementation of kinetic condensate formation(drift-phoenix), indicate teff ~ 2100-2500 k and [m/h] ~ -1.5 to -1.0 for logg~ 5.0-5.5 (cgs), although there are clear discrepancies between model andobserved spectra particularly in the red optical region. the strongermetal-oxide bands present in the drift-phoenix model spectra, a result ofphase-non-equilibrium abundances of grain species, appears to contradict priorsuggestions that grain formation is inhibited in metal-poor atmospheres;conclusive statements on the metallicity dependence of grain formationefficiency are as yet premature. in addition, an apparent shift in thetemperature scale of l subdwarfs relative to l dwarfs may obviate the need formodified grain chemistry to explain some of the former's unique spectralcharacteristics.

1107.1484	the hyperactive l dwarf 2mass j13153094-2649513: continued emission and  a brown dwarf companion	we report new observations of the unusually active, high proper motion l5edwarf 2mass j13153094-2649513. optical spectroscopy with magellan/mage revealspersistent nonthermal emission, with narrow h i balmer, na i and k i lines allobserved in emission. low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy with irtf/spexindicates the presence of a low-temperature companion, which is resolvedthrough multi-epoch laser guide star adaptive optics imaging at keck. thecomoving companion is separated by 338 \pm 4 mas, and its relative brightness(\delta k_s = 5.09 \pm 0.10) makes this system the second most extreme fluxratio very low-mass binary identified to date. resolved near-infraredspectroscopy with keck/osiris identifies this companion as a t7 dwarf. theabsence of li i absorption in combined-light optical spectroscopy constrainsthe system age to &gt;~0.8-1.0 gyr, while the system's kinematics and unusuallylow mass ratio (m_2/m_1 = 0.3-0.6) suggests that it is even older. a coevalitytest of the components also indicates an older age, but reveals discrepanciesbetween evolutionary and atmosphere model fits of the secondary which arelikely attributable to poor reproduction of its near-infrared spectrum. with aprojected separation of 6.6 \pm 0.9 au, the 2mass j13153094-2649513 system istoo widely separated for mass exchange or magnetospheric interactions to bepowering its persistent nonthermal emission. rather, the emission is probablychromospheric in nature, signaling an inversion in the age-activity relation inwhich strong magnetic fields are maintained by relatively old and massiveultracool dwarfs.

0710.1123	clouds, gravity and metallicity in blue l dwarfs: the case of 2mass  j11263991-5003550	optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the newly discovered peculiar ldwarf 2mass j11263991-5003550 are presented. folkes et al. identified thissource as a high proper motion l9+/-1 dwarf based on its strong h2o absorptionat 1.4 micron. we find that the optical spectrum of 2mass j1126-5003 is in factconsistent with that of a normal l4.5 dwarf with notably enhanced fehabsorption at 9896 a. however, its near-infrared spectrum is unusually blue,with strong h2o and weak co bands similar in character to several recentlyidentified ``blue l dwarfs''. using 2mass j1126-5003 as a case study, andguided by trends in the condensate cloud models of burrows et al. and marley etal., we find that the observed spectral peculiarities of these sources can beadequately explained by the presence of thin and/or large-grained condensateclouds as compared to normal field l dwarfs. atypical surface gravities ormetallicities alone cannot reproduce the observed peculiarities, although theymay be partly responsible for the unusual condensate properties. we also ruleout unresolved multiplicity as a cause for the spectral peculiarities of 2massj1126-5003. our analysis is supported by examination of spitzer mid-infraredspectral data from cushing et al. which show that bluer l dwarfs tend to haveweaker 10 micron absorption, a feature tentatively associated with silicateoxide grains. with their unique spectral properties, blue l dwarfs like 2massj1126-5003 should prove useful in studying the formation and properties ofcondensates and condensate clouds in low temperature atmospheres.

1108.4678	the discovery of y dwarfs using data from the wide-field infrared survey  explorer (wise)	we present the discovery of seven ultracool brown dwarfs identified with thewide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). near-infrared spectroscopy revealsdeep absorption bands of h_2o and ch_4 that indicate all seven of the browndwarfs have spectral types later than ugps j072227.51-054031.2, the latest typet dwarf currently known. the spectrum of wisep j182831.08+265037.8 is distinctin that the heights of the j- and h-band peaks are approximately equal in unitsof f_lambda, so we identify it as the archetypal member of the y spectralclass. the spectra of at least two of the other brown dwarfs exhibit absorptionon the blue wing of the h-band peak that we tentatively ascribe to nh_3. thesespectral morphological changes provide a clear transition between the t dwarfsand the y dwarfs. in order to produce a smooth near-infrared spectral sequenceacross the t/y dwarf transition, we have reclassified ugps j0722-0540 as the t9spectral standard and tentatively assign wisep j173835.52+273258.9 as the y0spectral standard. in total, six of the seven new brown dwarfs are classifiedas y dwarfs: four are classified as y0, one is classified as y0 (pec?), andwisep j1828+2650 is classified as &gt;y0. we have also compared the spectra to themodel atmospheres of marley and saumon and infer that the brown dwarfs haveeffective temperatures ranging from 300 k to 500 k, making them the coldestspectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs known to date.

1203.5543	the brown dwarf kinematics project (bdkp). iii. parallaxes for 70  ultracool dwarfs	we report parallax measurements for 70 ultracool dwarfs (ucds). using bothliterature values and our sample, we report new polynomial relations betweenspectral type and m$_{jhk}$. including resolved l/t transition binaries in therelations, we find no reason to differentiate between a "bright" (unresolvedbinary) and "faint" (single source) sample across the l/t boundary. isolatingearly t dwarfs, we find that the brightening of t0-t4 sources is prominent inm$_{j}$ where there is a [1.2 - 1.4] magnitude difference. a similar yetdampened brightening of [0.3 - 0.5] magnitude happens at m$_{h}$ and a plateauor dimming of [-0.2 - -0.3] magnitude is seen in m$_{k}$. comparing withevolutionary models that vary gravity, metallicity, and cloud thickness we findthat a near constant temperature of 1200 $\pm$100 k along a narrow spectralsubtype of t0-t4 is required to account for the brightening and color magnitudediagram of the l-dwarf/t-dwarf transition. furthermore, there is a significantpopulation of both l and t dwarfs which are red or potentially "ultra-cloudy"compared to the models, many of which are known to be young indicating acorrelation between enhanced photospheric dust and youth. for the lowsurface-gravity or young companion l dwarfs we find that 8 out of 10 are atleast [0.2-1.0] magnitude underluminous in m$_{jh}$ and/or m$_{k}$ compared toequivalent spectral type objects. we speculate that this is a consequence ofincreased dust opacity and conclude that low-surface gravity l dwarfs require acompletely new spectral-type/absolute magnitude polynomial for analysis.

1212.6940	the l dwarf/t dwarf transition: multiplicity, magnetic activity and  mineral meteorology across the hydrogen burning limit	the transition between the l dwarf and t dwarf spectral classes is one of themost remarkable along the stellar/brown dwarf main sequence, separating sourceswith photospheres containing mineral condensate clouds from those containingmethane and ammonia gases. unusual characteristics of this transition include a1 micron brightening between late l and early t dwarfs observed in bothparallax samples and coeval binaries; a spike in the multiplicity fraction;evidence of increased photometric variability, possibly arising from patchycloud structures; and a delayed transition for young, planetary-mass objects.all of these features can be explained if this transition is governed by the"rapid" (nonequlibrium) rainout of clouds from the photosphere, triggered bytemperature, surface gravity, metallicity and (perhaps) rotational effects.while the underlying mechanism of this rainout remains under debate, thetransition is now being exploited to discover and precisely characterize tight(&lt; 1 au) very low-mass binaries that can be used to test brown dwarfevolutionary and atmospheric theories, and resolved binaries that furtherconstrain the properties of this remarkable transition.

1303.0304	near-infrared spectroscopy of sn2009ip's 2012 brightening reveals a  dusty pre-supernova environment	we present low-resolution near-ir 0.8-2.5 um spectra of sn2009ip, takenimmediately before, during, and just after its rapid brightening in latesep/oct 2012. the first epoch shows the same general spectral characteristicsas the later epochs (smooth continuum, narrow h and hei emission lines), butthe ir continuum shape is substantially redder than the later epochs. the epoch1 continuum can be approximated by reddening the peak-luminosity (epoch 3)spectrum by e(b-v)=1.0 mag, but the blue color seen in visual-wavelengthspectra at the same time indicates that strong wavelength-dependent extinctionby circumstellar dust is not the correct explanation. instead, we favor thehypothesis that the redder color before the brightening arises from excessemission from hot $\sim$2000 k circumstellar dust. the minimum radius (120 au)deduced from the dust temperature and observed luminosity of the transient,combined with the observed expansion speed in the precursor outbursts of sn2009ip, is consistent with an ejection at least 1.1 yr earlier. the mass of hotdust indicated by the ir excess is 4x10$^{-7}$ msun, although this is only alower limit since the near-ir data do not constrain the mass of cooler dust.thus, the observed pre-sn outbursts of this object were able to efficientlyform dust into which the sn ejecta and radiation now propagate. this isconsistent with the notion that the same pre-sn eruptions that generally giverise to sne iin also give rise to the dust needed for their commonly observedir echoes. we also discuss some aspects of the ir line profiles, including hei10830.

1303.2948	weather on other worlds i: detection of periodic variability in the l3  dwarf denis-p j1058.7-1548 with precise multi-wavelength photometry	photometric monitoring from warm spitzer reveals that the l3 dwarf denis-pj1058.7-1548 varies sinusoidally in brightness with a period of 4.25+0.26/-0.16 hours and an amplitude of 0.388 +/- 0.043% (peak-to-valley) in the3.6 micron band, confirming the reality of a 4.31 +/- 0.31 hour periodicitydetected in j-band photometry from the soar telescope. the j-band variationsare a factor of 2.17 +/- 0.35 larger in amplitude than those at 3.6 microns,while 4.5 micron spitzer observations yield a 4.5 micron/3.6 micron amplituderatio of only 0.23 +/- 0.15, consistent with zero 4.5 micron variability. thiswide range in amplitudes indicates rotationally modulated variability due tomagnetic phenomena and/or inhomogeneous cloud cover. weak h-alpha emissionindicates some magnetic activity, but it is difficult to explain the observedamplitudes by magnetic phenomena unless they are combined with cloudinhomogeneities (which might have a magnetic cause). however, inhomogenouscloudcover alone can explain all our observations, and our data align withtheory in requiring that the regions with the thickest clouds also have thelowest effective temperature. combined with published v sin(i) results, ourrotation period yields a 95% confidence lower limit of 0.111 solar radii on theradius of denis-p j1058.7-1548, suggesting upper limits of 320 myr and 0.055solar masses on the age and mass. these limits should be regarded cautiouslybecause of 3-sigma inconsistencies with other data; however, a lower limit of45 degrees on the inclination is more secure. denis-p j1058.7-1548 is only thefirst of nearly two dozen low-amplitude variables discovered and analyzed bythe weather on other worlds project.

1402.2342	a monitoring campaign for luhman 16ab. i. detection of resolved  near-infrared spectroscopic variability	[abbreviated] we report resolved near-infrared spectroscopic monitoring ofthe nearby l dwarf/t dwarf binary wise j104915.57-531906.1ab (luhman 16ab), aspart of a broader campaign to characterize the spectral energy distribution andtemporal variability of this system. a continuous 45-minute sequence oflow-resolution irtf/spex data spanning 0.8-2.4 micron were obtained, concurrentwith combined-light optical photometry with eso/trappist. our spectralobservations confirm the flux reversal of this binary, and we detect awavelength-dependent decline in the relative spectral fluxes of the twocomponents coincident with a decline in the combined-light optical brightnessof the system over the course of the observation. these data are successfullymodeled as a combination of brightness and color variability in the t0.5 luhman16b, consistent cloud variations; and no significant variability in l7.5 luhman16a. we estimate a peak-to-peak amplitude of 13.5% at 1.25 micron over the fulllightcurve. using a two-spot brightness temperature model, we infer an averagecloud covering fraction of ~30-55% for luhman 16b, varying by 15-30% over arotation period. a rhines scale interpretation for the size of the variablefeatures explains an apparent correlation between period and amplitude forthree highly variable t dwarfs, and predicts relatively fast winds (1-3 km/s)for luhman 16b consistent with lightcurve evolution on an advective time scale(1-3 rotation periods). our observations support the model of a patchydisruption of the mineral cloud layer as a universal feature of the l dwarf/tdwarf transition.

0803.0295	subtle signatures of multiplicity in late-type dwarf spectra: the  unresolved m8.5 + t5 binary 2mass j03202839-0446358	evidence is presented that 2mass j03202839-0446358, a late-type dwarf withdiscrepant optical (m8:) and near-infrared (l1) spectral types, is an as-yetunresolved stellar/brown dwarf binary with late-type m dwarf and t dwarfcomponents. this conclusion is based on low-resolution, near-infraredspectroscopy that reveals a subtle but distinctive absorption feature at 1.6micron. the feature, which is also present in the combined light spectrum ofthe m8.5 + t6 binary scr 1845-6357, arises from the combination of fehabsorption from an m8.5 primary and pseudo-continuum flux from a t5+/-1secondary, as ascertained from binary spectral templates constructed fromempirical data. the binary templates provide a far superior match to theoverall near-infrared spectral energy distribution of 2mass j0320-0446 than anysingle comparison spectra. laser guide star adaptive optics (lgs ao) imagingobservations, including the first application of lgs ao aperture maskinterferometry, fail to resolve a faint companion, restricting the projectedseparation of the system to less than 8.3 au at the time of observation. 2massj0320-0446 is the second very low mass binary to be identified from unresolved,low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that complementstraditional high resolution imaging and spectroscopic methods.

1406.1518	signatures of cloud, temperature, and gravity from spectra of the  closest brown dwarfs	we present medium resolution optical and nir spectral data for components ofthe newly discovered wise j104915.57-531906.1ab (luhman 16ab) brown dwarfbinary. the optical spectra reveal strong 6708 a li i absorption in both luhman16a (8.0+/-0.4 a) and luhman 16b (3.8+/-0.4 a). interestingly, this is thefirst detection of li i absorption in a t dwarf. combined with the lack ofsurface gravity features, the li i detection constrains the system age to 0.1 -3 gyr. in the nir data, we find strong ki absorption at 1.168, 1.177, 1.243,and 1.254 {\mu}m in both components. compared to the strength of ki lineabsorption in equivalent spectral subtype brown dwarfs, luhman 16a is weakerwhile luhman 16b is stronger. analyzing the spectral region around each doubletin distance scaled flux units and comparing the two sources, we confirm the jband flux reversal and find that luhman 16b has a brighter continuum in the1.17 {\mu}m and 1.25 {\mu}m regions than luhman 16a. converting flux units to abrightness temperature we interpret this to mean that the secondary is ~ 50 kwarmer than the primary in regions dominated by condensate grain scattering.one plausible explanation for this difference is that luhman 16b has thinnerclouds or patchy holes in its atmosphere allowing us to see to deeper, hotterregions. we also detect comparably strong feh in the 0.9896 {\mu}m wing-fordband for both components. traditionally, a signpost of changing atmosphereconditions from late-type l to early t dwarfs, the persistence and similarityof feh at 0.9896 {\mu}m in both luhman 16a and luhman 16b is an indication ofhomogenous atmosphere conditions. we calculate bolometric luminosities fromobserved data supplemented with best fit models for longer wavelengths and findthe components are consistent within 1{\sigma} with resultant teffs of1310+/-30 k and 1280+/-75 k for luhman 16ab respectively.

1411.2911	hst rotational spectral mapping of two l-type brown dwarfs: variability  in and out of water bands indicates high-altitude haze layers	we present time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of two l5 dwarfs, 2massj18212815+1414010 and 2mass j15074759-1627386, observed with the wide fieldcamera 3 instrument on the hubble space telescope (hst). we study thewavelength dependence of rotation-modulated flux variations between 1.1 $\mu$mand 1.7 $\mu$m. we find that the water absorption bands of the two l5 dwarfs at1.15 $\mu$m and 1.4 $\mu$m vary at similar amplitudes as the adjacentcontinuum. this differs from the results of previous hst observations of l/ttransition dwarfs, in which the water absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m displaysvariations of about half of the amplitude at other wavelengths. we find thatthe relative amplitude of flux variability out of the water band with respectto that in the water band shows a increasing trend from the l5 dwarfs towardthe early t dwarfs. we utilize the models of saumon &amp; marley (2008) and findthat the observed variability of the l5 dwarfs can be explained by the presenceof spatially varying high-altitude haze layers above the condensate clouds.therefore, our observations show that the heterogeneity of haze layers - thedriver of the variability - must be located at very low pressures, where eventhe water opacity is negligible. in the near future, the rotational spectralmapping technique could be utilized for other atomic and molecular species toprobe different pressure levels in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs andexoplanets and uncover both horizontal and vertical cloud structures.

astro-ph;0108452	the spectra of t dwarfs i: near-infrared data and spectral  classification	we present near-infrared spectra for a sample of t dwarfs, including elevennew discoveries made using the two micron all sky survey. these objects aredistinguished from warmer (l-type) brown dwarfs by the presence of methaneabsorption bands in the 1--2.5 $\micron$ spectral region. a first attempt at anear-infrared classification scheme for t dwarfs is made, based on thestrengths of ch$_4$ and h$_2$o bands and the shapes of the 1.25, 1.6, and 2.1$\micron$ flux peaks. subtypes t1 v through t8 v are defined, and spectralindices useful for classification are presented. the subclasses appear tofollow a decreasing t$_{eff}$ scale, based on the evolution of ch$_4$ andh$_2$o bands and the properties of l and t dwarfs with known distances.however, we speculate that this scale is not linear with spectral type for cooldwarfs, due to the settling of dust layers below the photosphere and subsequentrapid evolution of spectral morphology around t$_{eff}$ $\sim$ 1300--1500 k.similarities in near-infrared colors and continuity of spectral featuressuggest that the gap between the latest l dwarfs and earliest t dwarfs has beennearly bridged. this argument is strengthened by the possible role of ch$_4$ asa minor absorber shaping the k-band spectra of the latest l dwarfs. finally, wediscuss one peculiar t dwarf, 2mass 0937+2931, which has very bluenear-infrared colors (j-k$_s$ = $-0.89\pm$0.24) due to suppression of the 2.1$\micron$ peak. the feature is likely caused by enhanced collision-inducedh$_2$ absorption in a high pressure or low metallicity photosphere.

astro-ph;0109227	theoretical spectral models of t dwarfs at short wavelengths and their  comparison with data	we have generated new, self-consistent spectral and atmosphere models for theeffective temperature range 600 k to 1300 k thought to encompass the known tdwarfs. for the first time, theoretical models are compared with a {\it family}of measured t dwarf spectra at wavelengths shortward of $\sim$1.0 micron. bydefining spectral indices and standard colors in the optical and verynear-infrared, we explore the theoretical systematics with \teff, gravity, andmetallicity. we conclude that the short- wavelength range is rich indiagnostics that complement those in the near-infrared now used for spectralsubtyping. we also conclude that the wings of the na d and k i (7700\aa)resonance lines and aggressive rainout of heavy metals (with the resultingenhancement of the sodium and potassium abundances at altitude) are required tofit the new data shortward of 1.0 \mic. furthermore, we find that the waterbands weaken with increasing gravity, that modest decreases in metallicityenhance the effect in the optical of the sodium and potassium lines, and thatat low \teffs, in a reversal of the normal pattern, optical spectra becomebluer with further decreases in \teff. moreover, we conclude that t dwarfsubtype is not a function of \teff alone, but that it is a non-trivial functionof gravity and metallicity as well. as do marley et al. (2001), we see evidencein early t dwarf atmospheres of a residual effect of clouds. with cloudlessmodels, we obtain spectral fits to the two late t dwarfs with known parallaxes,but a residual effect of clouds on the emergent spectra of even late t dwarfscan not yet be discounted.

astro-ph;0201382	a search for variability in the active t dwarf 2mass 1237+6526	we present spectroscopic and imaging observations of the active t dwarf 2mass1237+6526, intended to investigate the emission mechanism of this cool browndwarf. the h$\alpha$ emission line first detected in 1999 july appears to bepersistent over 1.6 years, with no significant variation from$\log_{10}(l_{h{\alpha}}$/l$_{bol}$) = $-$4.3, ruling out flaring as a possiblesource. the relatively high level of emission in this object appears to beunique amongst observed late-l and t dwarfs. one of our spectra shows anapparent velocity shift in the h$\alpha$ line, which could be indicative of anaccretion hot spot in orbit around the brown dwarf; further confirmation ofthis shift is required. j-band monitoring observations fail to detect anysignificant variability (e.g., eclipsing events) at the $\pm$0.025 mag levelover periods of up to 2.5 hours, and there appears to be no statisticalevidence of variability for periods of up to 14 hours. these limits constrainthe mass of a hypothetical interacting secondary to m$_2$ $\lesssim$ 20m$_{jup}$ for inclinations $i$ $\gtrsim$ 60$\degr$. while our observations donot explicitly rule out the binary hypothesis for this object, it does suggestthat other mechanisms, such as youthful accretion, may be responsible.

astro-ph;0304339	infrared parallaxes for methane t dwarfs	we report final results from our 2.5 year infrared parallax program carriedout with the european southern observatory 3.5m new technology telescope andthe sofi infrared camera. our program targeted precision astrometricobservations of ten t type brown dwarfs in the j band. full astrometricsolutions (including trigonometric parallaxes) for nine t dwarfs are providedalong with proper motion solutions for a further object. we find thathgcdte-based infrared cameras are capable of delivering precision differentialastrometry. for t dwarfs, infrared observations are to be greatly preferredover the optical, both because they are so much brighter in the infrared, andbecause their prominent methane absorptions lead to similar effectivewavelengths through the j-filter for both target and reference stars, which inturn results in a dramatic reduction in differential colour refraction effects.we describe a technique for robust bias estimation and linearity correctionwith the sofi camera, along with an upper limit to the astrometric distortionof the sofi optical train. colour-magnitude and spectral-type-magnitudediagrams for both l and t dwarfs are presented which show complex andsignificant structure, with major import for luminosity function and massfunction work on t dwarfs. based on the width of the early l dwarf and late tdwarf colour magnitude diagrams, we conclude the brightening of early t dwarfsin the j passband (the "early t hump") is not an age effect, but due to thecomplexity of brown dwarf cooling curves. finally, empirical estimates of the"turn on" magnitudes for methane absorption in field t dwarfs and in youngstars clusters are provided. these make the interpretation of the t6 dwarfsigma ori j053810.1-023626 as a sigma ori member problematic.

0808.3153	a sample of very young field l dwarfs and implications for the brown  dwarf "lithium test" at early ages	using a large sample of optical spectra of late-type dwarfs, we identify asubset of late-m through l field dwarfs that, because of the presence oflow-gravity features in their spectra, are believed to be unusually young. froma combined sample of 303 field l dwarfs, we find observationally that7.6+/-1.6% are younger than 100 myr. this percentage is in agreement withtheoretical predictions once observing biases are taken into account. we findthat these young l dwarfs tend to fall in the southern hemisphere (dec &lt; 0 deg)and may be previously unrecognized, low-mass members of nearby, youngassociations like tucana-horologium, tw hydrae, beta pictoris, and ab doradus.we use a homogeneously observed sample of roughly one hundred and fifty6300-10000 angstrom spectra of l and t dwarfs taken with the low-resolutionimaging spectrometer at the w. m. keck observatory to examine the strength ofthe 6708-a li i line as a function of spectral type and further corroborate thetrends noted by kirkpatrick et al. (2000). we use our low-gravity spectra toinvestigate the strength of the li i line as a function of age. the data weaklysuggest that for early- to mid-l dwarfs the line strength reaches a maximum fora few 100 myr, whereas for much older (few gyr) and much younger (&lt;100 myr) ldwarfs the line is weaker or undetectable. we show that a weakening of lithiumat lower gravities is predicted by model atmosphere calculations, an effectpartially corroborated by existing observational data. larger samplescontaining l dwarfs of well determined ages are needed to further test thisempirically. if verified, this result would reinforce the caveat first cited inkirkpatrick et al.

astro-ph;0309634	identifying young brown dwarfs using gravity-sensitive spectral features	we report the initial results of the brown dwarf spectroscopic survey gravityproject, to study gravity sensitive features as indicators of youth in browndwarfs. low-resolution (r~2000) j-band and optical (r~1000) observations usingnirspec and lris at the w.m. keck observatory reveal transitions of tio, vo, ki, na i, cs i, rb i, cah, and feh. by comparing these features in late-typegiants and in old field dwarfs we show that they are sensitive to the gravity(g = gm/r^2) of the object. using low-gravity spectral signatures as ageindicators, we observed and analyzed j-band and optical spectra of two youngbrown dwarfs, g 196-3b (20-300 myr) and kpno tau-4 (1-2 myr), and two possiblelow mass brown dwarfs in the sigma orionis cluster (3-7 myr). we report theidentification of the phi bands of tio near 1.24 microns and the a-x band of vonear 1.18 microns together with extremely weak j-band lines of k i inkpno-tau4. this is the first detection of tio and vo in the j-band in asub-stellar mass object. the optical spectrum of kpno-tau4 exhibits weak k iand na i lines, weak absorption by cah, and strong vo bands, also signatures ofa lower gravity atmosphere. g 196-3b shows absorption features in bothwavelength regions like those of kpno-tau4 suggesting that its age and mass areat the lower end of published estimates. whereas sigma ori 51 appears to beconsistent with a young sub-stellar object, sigma ori 47 shows signatures ofhigh gravity most closely resembling an old l1.5/l0, and can not be a member ofthe sigma orionis cluster.

astro-ph;0510707	a method for determining the physical properties of the coldest known  brown dwarfs	we present a method for measuring the physical parameters of the coldestt-type brown dwarfs using low resolution near infrared spectra. by comparingh_2o- and h_2-sensitive spectral ratios between empirical data and theoreticalatmosphere models, and calibrating these ratios to measurements for thewell-characterized 2-5 gyr companion brown dwarf gliese 570d, we deriveestimates of the effective temperatures and surface gravities for 13 mid- andlate-type field t dwarfs. we also deduce the first quantitative estimate ofsubsolar metallicity for the peculiar t dwarf 2mass 0937+2931. derivedtemperatures are consistent with prior estimates based on parallax andbolometric luminosity measurements, and examination of possible systematiceffects indicate that the results are robust. two recently discovered late-typet dwarfs, 2mass 0939-2448 and 2mass 1114-2618, both appear to be &gt;50 k coolerthan the latest-type t dwarf, 2mass 0415-0935, and are potentially the coldestand least luminous brown dwarfs currently known. we find that, in general,higher surface gravity t dwarfs have lower effective temperatures andluminosities for a given spectral type, explaining previously observed scatterin the teff/spectral type relation for these objects. masses, radii and agesare estimated for the t dwarfs in our sample using the evolutionary models ofburrows et al.; we also determine masses and radii independently for eight tdwarfs with measured luminosities. these two determinations are largelyconsistent, lending support to the validity of evolutionary models at lateages. our method is well suited to large samples of faint brown dwarfs, and canultimately be used to directly measure the substellar mass function andformation history in the galaxy.

astro-ph;0511462	discovery of a very young field l dwarf, 2mass j01415823-4633574	while following up l dwarf candidates selected photometrically from the twomicron all sky survey, we uncovered an unusual object designated 2massj01415823-4633574. its optical spectrum exhibits very strong bands of vanadiumoxide but abnormally weak absorptions by titanium oxide, potassium, and sodium.morphologically such spectroscopic characteristics fall intermediate betweenold, field early-l dwarfs (log(g)~5) and very late m giants (log(g)~0), leadingus to favor low gravity as the explanation for the unique spectral signaturesof this l dwarf. such a low gravity can be explained only if this l dwarf ismuch lower in mass than a typical old field l dwarf of similar temperature andis still contracting to its final radius. these conditions imply a very youngage. further evidence of youth is found in the near-infrared spectrum,including a triangular-shaped h-band continuum reminiscent of young brown dwarfcandidates discovered in the orion nebula cluster. using the above informationalong with comparisons to brown dwarf atmospheric and interior models, ourcurrent best estimate is that this l dwarf has an age of 1-50 myr and a mass of6-25 m_jupiter. the location of 2mass 0141-4633 on the sky coupled with adistance estimate of ~35 pc and the above age estimate suggests that thisobject may be a brown dwarf member of either the 30-myr-old tucana/horologiumassociation or the ~12-myr-old beta pic moving group.

astro-ph;0602122	not alone: tracing the origins of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs  through multiplicity studies	the properties of multiple stellar systems have long provided importantempirical constraints for star formation theories, enabling (along with severalother lines of evidence) a concrete, qualitative picture of the birth and earlyevolution of normal stars. at very low masses (vlm; m &lt;~ 0.1 m_sun), down toand below the hydrogen burning minimum mass, our understanding of formationprocesses is not as clear, with several competing theories now underconsideration. one means of testing these theories is through the empiricalcharacterization of vlm multiple systems. here, we review the results ofvarious vlm multiplicity studies to date. these systems can be generallycharacterized as closely separated (93% have projected separations delta &lt; 20au) and near equal-mass (77% have m_2/m_1 &gt;= 0.8) occurring infrequently(perhaps 10-30%). both the frequency and maximum separation of stellar andbrown dwarf binaries steadily decrease for lower system masses, suggesting thatvlm binary formation and/or evolution may be a mass-dependent process. there isevidence for a fairly rapid decline in the number of loosely-bound systemsbelow ~0.3 m_sun, corresponding to a factor of 10-20 increase in the minimumbinding energy of vlm binaries as compared to more massive stellar binaries.this wide-separation ``desert'' is present among both field (~1-5 gyr) andolder (&gt; 100 myr) cluster systems, while the youngest (&lt;~10 myr) vlm binaries,particularly those in nearby, low-density star forming regions, appear to havesomewhat different systemic properties. we compare these empirical trends topredictions laid out by current formation theories, and outline futureobservational studies needed to probe the full parameter space of the lowestmass multiple systems.

astro-ph;0603382	discovery of the coolest extreme subdwarf	we report the discovery of lehpm 2-59 as the coolest extreme m subdwarf(esdm) found to date. optical and near infrared spectroscopy demonstrate thatthis source is of later spectral type than the esdm7 apmpm 0559-2903, with thepresence of strong alkali lines (including rb i), vo absorption at 7400 a andh2o absorption at 1.4 microns. current optical classification schemes yield aspectral type of esdm8, making lehpm 2-59 one of only two ultracool esdmsknown. the substantial space velocity of this object (v_galactic ~ -180 km/s)identifies it as a halo star. spectral model fits to the optical and nearinfrared spectral data for this and four other late-type esdms indicate thatlehpm 2-59 is the coolest esdm currently known, with teff = 2800-3000 k and-1.5 &lt;~ [m/h] &lt;~ -2.0. comparison of teff determinations for m dwarfs and esdmsbased on spectral model fits from this study and the literature demonstrate adivergence in teff scales beyond spectral types m5/esdm5, as large as 600-800 kby types m8/esdm8. while this divergence is likely an artifact of theunderlying classification scheme, it may lead to systematic errors in thederived properties of intermediate metallicity subdwarfs. we comment on thefuture of ultracool subdwarf classification, and suggest several ideas foraddressing shortcomings in current (largely extrapolated) schemes.

astro-ph;0605577	hubble space telescope nicmos observations of t dwarfs: brown dwarf  multiplicity and new probes of the l/t transition	we present the results of a hubble space telescope nicmos imaging survey of22 t-type field brown dwarfs. five are resolved as binary systems with angularseparations of 0"05-0"35, and companionship is established on the basis ofcomponent f110w-f170m colors (indicative of ch4 absorption) and lowprobabilities of background contamination. prior ground-based observations show2mass 1553+1532ab to be a common proper motion binary. the properties of thesesystems - low multiplicity fraction (11[+7][-3]% resolved, as corrected forsample selection baises), close projected separations (a = 1.8-5.0 au) andnear-unity mass ratios - are consistent with previous results for field browndwarf binaries. three of the binaries have components that span thepoorly-understood transition between l dwarfs and t dwarfs. spectraldecomposition analysis of one of these, sdss 1021-0304ab, reveals a peculiarflux reversal between its components, as its t5 secondary is ~30% brighter at1.05 and 1.27 micron than its t1 primary. this system, 2mass 0518-2828ab andsdss 1534+1615ab all demonstrate that the j-band brightening observed betweenlate-type l to mid-type t dwarfs is an intrinsic feature of this spectraltransition, albeit less pronounced than previously surmised. we also find thatthe resolved binary fraction of l7 to t3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other l andt dwarfs, an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid evolution ofbrown dwarfs through the l/t transition, perhaps driven by dynamic(nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric condensates.

astro-ph;0609793	on the nature of the unique h$\alpha$-emitting t dwarf 2mass  j12373919+6526148	we explore and discount the hypothesis that the strong, continualh$\alpha$-emitting t dwarf 2mass j12373919+6526148 can be explained as a young,low gravity, very low mass brown dwarf. the source is already known to have amarginally-fainter absolute magnitude than similar t dwarfs with trigonometricparallax measurements, and has a tangential velocity consistent with old diskkinematics. applying the technique of burgasser, burrows &amp; kirkpatrick on newnear infrared spectroscopy for this source, estimates of its {\teff}, $\log{g}$and metallicity ([m/h]) are obtained. 2m 1237+6526 has a {\teff} $\approx$800-850 k. if [m/h] is solar, $\log{g}$ is as high as $\sim$5.5 (cgs) and thissource is older than 10 gyr. we find a more plausible scenario to be a modestlysubsolar metallicity ([m/h] = -0.2) and moderate $\log{g}$ $\sim$ 5.0, implyingan age older than 2 gyr and a mass greater than 0.035 m$_{\sun}$. thealternative explanation of the unique emission of this source, involving aninteracting, close, double degenerate system, should be investigated further.indeed, there is some evidence of a {\teff} $&lt;$ 500 k companion to 2m 1237+6526on the basis of a possible $spitzer irac$ [3.6]--[4.5] color excess. thisexcess may, however, be caused by a subsolar metallicity.

astro-ph;0611505	binaries and the l dwarf/t dwarf transition	high-resolution imaging has revealed an unusually high binary fractionamongst objects spanning the transition between the l dwarf and t dwarfspectral classes. in an attempt to reproduce and unravel the origins of thisapparent binary excess, i present a series of monte carlo mass function andmultiplicity simulations of field brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun.these simulations are based on the solar metallicity brown dwarf evolutionarymodels and incorporate empirical luminosity and absolute magnitude scales,measured multiplicity statistics and observed spectral templates in theconstruction and classification of composite binary spectra. in addition toproviding predictions on the number and surface density distributions of l andt dwarfs for volume-limited and magnitude-limited samples, these simulationssuccessfully reproduce the observed binary fraction distribution assuming anintrinsic (resolved) binary fraction of 11(+6)(-3)% (95% confidence interval),consistent with prior determinations. however, the true binary fraction may beas high as 40% if, as suggested by liu et al., a significant fraction of l/ttransition objects (~66%) are tightly-bound, unresolved multiples. thesimulations presented here demonstrate that the binary excess amongst l/ttransition objects arises primarily from the flattening of the luminosity scaleover these spectral types and is not inherently the result of selection effectsincurred in current magnitude-limited imaging samples. indeed, the existence ofa binary excess can be seen as further evidence that brown dwarfs traverse thel/t transition rapidly, possibly driven by a nonequilibrium submergence ofphotospheric condensates.

0812.1223	using magnetic activity and galactic dynamics to constrain the ages of m  dwarfs	we present a study of the dynamics and magnetic activity of m dwarfs usingthe largest spectroscopic sample of low-mass stars ever assembled. the age atwhich strong surface magnetic activity (as traced by h-alpha) ceases in mdwarfs has been inferred to have a strong dependence on mass (spectral type,surface temperature) and explains previous results showing a large increase inthe fraction of active stars at later spectral types. using spectralobservations of more than 40000 m dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey, weshow that the fraction of active stars decreases as a function of verticaldistance from the galactic plane (a statistical proxy for age), and that themagnitude of this decrease changes significantly for different m spectraltypes. adopting a simple dynamical model for thin disk vertical heating, weassign an age for the activity decline at each spectral type, and thusdetermine the activity lifetimes for m dwarfs. in addition, we derive astatistical age-activity relation for each spectral type using the dynamicalmodel, the vertical distance from the plane and the h-alpha emission lineluminosity of each star (the latter of which also decreases with verticalheight above the galactic plane).
