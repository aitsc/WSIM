0901.4038	the optical afterglows and host galaxies of three short/hard gamma-ray  bursts	short grbs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of doublecompact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.optical observations of short grbs allow us to measure redshifts, firmlyidentify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localizegrbs within them. multiwavelength observations of grb afterglows provide usefulinformation on the emission mechanisms at work. these are all key issues thatallow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. wecarried out photometric observations of the short/hard grb 051227, grb 061006,and grb 071227 with the eso-vlt starting from several hours after the explosiondown to the host galaxy level several days later. for grb 061006 and grb 071227we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. we compared theresults obtained from our optical observations with the available x-ray data ofthese bursts. for all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglowsand firmly identified their host galaxies. about half a day after the burst,the optical afterglows of grb 051227 and grb 061006 present a decaysignificatly steeper than in the x-rays. in the case of grb 051227, the opticaldecay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in thetwo wavelengths ranges. the three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies atmoderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the solar one. theprojected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centersspan a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts andpresent evidence for local absorption in their x-ray spectra. we discuss ourfindings in light of the current models of short grb progenitors.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

1002.3164	do wolf-rayet stars have similar locations in hosts as type ib/c  supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts?	aims: we study the distribution of wolf-rayet (wr) stars and their subtypeswith respect to their host galaxy light distribution. we thus want toinvestigate whether wr stars are potential progenitors of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae (sne) and/or long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs).methods: we derived the relative surface brightness (fractional flux) at thelocations of wr stars and compared with similar results for lgrbs and sne. weexamined two nearby galaxies, m 83 and ngc 1313, for which a comprehensivestudy of the wr population exists. these two galaxies contain a sufficientlylarge number of wr stars and sample different metallicities. to enable thecomparison, the images of the galaxies were processed to make them appear asthey would look at a higher redshift. the robustness of our results againstseveral sources of uncertainty was investigated with the aid of monte carlosimulations. results: we find that the wc star distribution favours brighterpixels than the wn star population. wc stars are more likely drawn from thesame distribution as sne ic than from other sn distributions, while wn starsshow a higher degree of association with sne ib. it can also not be excludedthat wr (especially wc) stars are related to lgrbs. some differences betweenthe two galaxies do exist, especially in the subtype distributions, and maystem from differences in metallicity. conclusions: although a conclusive answeris not possible, the expectation that wr stars are the progenitors of sne ib/cand lgrbs survives this test. the trend observed between the distributions ofwn and wc stars, as compared to those of sne ib and ic, is consistent with thetheoretical picture that sne ic result from progenitors that have been strippedof a larger part of their envelope.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1004.2919	discovery of the nearby long, soft grb 100316d with an associated  supernova	we report the swift discovery of nearby long, soft gamma-ray burst grb100316d, and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy andassociated supernova. we derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb-sn. we study the extremelyunusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to x-ray spectroscopy, andfind that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition toa synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. the x-ray light curvehas a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. the host is a bright,blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south, vlt andhst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. wecompare and contrast the x-ray emission and host galaxy of grb 100316d to asubsample of grb-sne. grb 100316d is unlike the majority of grb-sne in itsx-ray evolution, but resembles rather grb 060218, and we find that these twoevents have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.comparison of the host galaxies of grb-sne demonstrates, however, that there isa great diversity in the environments in which grb-sne can be found. grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample ofspectroscopically confirmed grb-sne, from which a better understanding of longgrb progenitors and the grb--sn connection can be gleaned.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1010.1783	a nearby grb host prototype for z~7 lyman-break galaxies: spitzer-irs  and x-shooter spectroscopy of the host galaxy of grb031203	gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies have been studied extensively in opticalphotometry and spectroscopy. here we present the first mid-infrared spectrum ofa grb host, hg031203. it is one of the nearest grb hosts at z=0.1055, allowingboth low and high-resolution spectroscopy with spitzer-irs. medium resolutionuv-to-k-band spectroscopy with the x-shooter spectrograph on the vlt is alsopresented, along with spitzer irac and mips photometry, as well as radio andsub-mm observations. these data allow us to construct a uv-to-radio spectralenergy distribution with almost complete spectroscopic coverage from 0.3-35micron of a grb host galaxy for the first time, potentially valuable as atemplate for future model comparisons. the irs spectra show strong,high-ionisation fine structure line emission indicative of a hard radiationfield in the galaxy, suggestive of strong ongoing star-formation and a veryyoung stellar population. the selection of hg031203 via the presence of a grbsuggests that it might be a useful analogue of very young star-forming galaxiesin the early universe, and hints that local bcds may be used as more reliableanalogues of star-formation in the early universe than typical localstarbursts. we look at the current debate on the ages of the dominant stellarpopulations in z~7 and z~8 galaxies in this context. the nebular line emissionis so strong in hg031203, that at z~7, it can reproduce the spectral energydistributions of z-band dropout galaxies with elevated irac 3.6 and 4.5 micronfluxes without the need to invoke a 4000a break.

1011.0113	grb 050502b optical afterglow: a jet break at high redshift	aims: grb 050502b is well known for the very bright flare displayed in itsx-ray light curve. despite extensive studies, however, the optical light curvehas never been discussed and its redshift is unconstrained. possiblecorrelations between optical and x-ray data are analysed. methods: photometricdata from tng in the r and i bands were used to compare the optical afterglowwith the x-ray light curve. the hyperz package and a late time vlt hostobservation were used to derive redshift estimates. results: the i-bandafterglow decay followed a power-law of index {\alpha} = 2.1 $\pm$ 0.6, after alate break at ~ $1.3 \times 10^5$ s. the r - i color is remarkably red and thebroadband spectral index {\beta}_ox = $0.9 \pm 0.1$ is consistent with thex-ray spectral slope {\beta}_x. although a photometric redshift of z &gt; 4 is themost conservative result to consider, a photometric redshift of z = 5.2 $\pm$0.3 is suggested with no extinction in the host, based on which an isotropicenergy e_{\gamma},iso = $(3.8 \pm 0.7) \times 10^52$ erg and a jet openingangle {\theta} ~ $3.7^{\circ}$ are subsequently derived.  conclusions: the combined x-ray and optical data suggest an achromatic break,which we interpret as a jet break. the post jet break slope obeys roughly theclosure relation for the jet slow cooling model. because of the afterglow'svery red color, in order for the redshift to be low (z &lt; 1), extinction, ifpresent in the host, must be significantly high. since the optical-to-x-rayindex is consistent with the x-ray spectrum, and there is no xrt evidence forexcess n_h, grb 050502b was likely at high redshift.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1112.0744	diversity of multiwavelength emission bumps in the grb 100219a afterglow	context. multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowsprovide important information about the activity of their central engines andtheir environments. in particular, the short timescale variability, such asbumps and/or rebrightening features visible in the multi-wavelength lightcurves, is still poorly understood.  aims. we analyze the multi-wavelength observations of the grb100219aafterglow at redshift 4.7. in particular, we attempt to identify the physicalorigin of the late achromatic flares/bumps detected in the x-ray and opticalbands.  methods. we present ground-based optical photometric data and swift x-rayobservations on grb100219a. we analyzed the temporal behavior of the x-ray andoptical light curves, as well as the x-ray spectra.  results. the early flares in the x-ray and optical light curves peaksimultaneously at about 1000 s after the burst trigger, while late achromaticbumps in the x-ray and optical bands appear at about 20000 s after the bursttrigger. these are uncommon features in the afterglow phenomenology.considering the temporal and spectral properties, we argue that both opticaland x-ray emissions come from the same mechanism. the late flares/bumps may beproduced by late internal shocks from long-lasting activity of the centralengine. an off-axis origin for a structured jet model is also discussed tointerpret the bump shapes. the early optical bump can be interpreted as theafterglow onset, while the early x-ray flare could be caused by the internalactivity. grb 100219a exploded in a dense environment as revealed by the strongattenuation of x-ray emission and the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution.

1203.1919	the metal-enriched host of an energetic gamma-ray burst at z ~ 1.6	(abridged) long gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies might open a short-cut tothe characteristics of typical star-forming galaxies throughout the history ofthe universe. due to the absence of near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy, however,detailed investigations, specifically a determination of the gas-phasemetallicity of gamma-ray burst hosts, was largely limited to redshifts z &lt; 1 todate. here, we report observations of the galaxy hosting grb 080605 at z = 1.64using optical/nir spectroscopy and high-resolution hst/wfc3 imaging. we availof vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy to measure the metallicity, electron density,star-formation rate (sfr), and reddening of the host. specifically, we usedifferent strong-line diagnostics based on [n ii] to robustly measure thegas-phase metallicity for the first time for a grb host at this redshift. thehost of the energetic (e_iso ~ 2 x 10^53 erg) grb 080605 is a morphologicallycomplex, vigorously star-forming galaxy with an h\alpha-derived sfr of 31m_sun/yr. its ism is significantly enriched with metals with an oxygenabundance between 8.3 and 8.6 depending on the adopted strong-line calibrator.this corresponds to values in the range of 0.4-0.8 times the solar value. forits measured stellar mass of 8 x 10^9 m_sun and sfr this value is consistentwith the fundamental metallicity relation defined by star-forming fieldgalaxies. our observations directly illustrate that grb hosts are notnecessarily metal-poor, both on absolute scales as well as relative to theirstellar mass and sfr. grb hosts could thus be fair tracers of the population ofordinary star-forming galaxies as a whole at high redshift.

1205.3490	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. iii. redshift  distribution	we present 10 new gamma-ray burst (grb) redshifts and another five redshiftlimits based on host galaxy spectroscopy obtained as part of a large programconducted at the very large telescope (vlt). the redshifts span the range 0.345&lt; z &lt; 2.54. three of our measurements revise incorrect values from theliterature. the homogeneous host sample researched here consists of 69 hoststhat originally had a redshift completeness of 55% (with 38 out of 69 hostshaving redshifts considered secure). our project, including vlt/x-shooterobservations reported elsewhere, increases this fraction to 77% (53/69), makingthe survey the most comprehensive in terms of redshift completeness of anysample to the full swift depth, analyzed to date. we present the cumulativeredshift distribution and derive a conservative, yet small, associateduncertainty. we constrain the fraction of swift grbs at high redshift to amaximum of 14% (5%) for z &gt; 6 (z &gt; 7). the mean redshift of the host sample isassessed to be &lt;z&gt; &gt; 2.2, with the 10 new redshifts reducing it significantly.using this more complete sample, we confirm previous findings that the grb rateat high redshift (z &gt; 3) appears to be in excess of predictions based onassumptions that it should follow conventional determinations of the starformation history of the universe, combined with an estimate of its likelymetallicity dependence. this suggests that either star formation at highredshifts has been significantly underestimated, for example due to a dominantcontribution from faint, undetected galaxies, or that grb production isenhanced in the conditions of early star formation, beyond that usuallyascribed to lower metallicity.

1205.4239	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. vi. radio observations  at z&lt;1 and consistency with typical star-forming galaxies	the objective of this paper is to determine the level of obscured starformation activity and dust attenuation in a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb)hosts; and to test the hypothesis that grb hosts have properties consistentwith those of the general star-forming galaxy populations. we present a radiocontinuum survey of all z&lt;1 grb hosts in the optically unbiased grb host(tough) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-swift) grb-snhosts discovered before october 2006. we present new radio data for 22 objectsand have obtained a detection for three of them (grb 980425, 021211, 031203;none in the tough sample), increasing the number of radio-detected grb hostsfrom two to five. the star formation rate (sfr) for the grb 021211 host of ~825mo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a grb host, places it in the categoryof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. we found that at least 63% of grb hostshave sfr &lt; 100 mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have sfr &gt; 500 mo yr^-1. for theundetected hosts the mean radio flux (&lt;35 ujy 3sigma) corresponds to an averagesfr &lt; 15 mo yr^-1. moreover, ~88% of the z&lt;1 grb hosts have ultraviolet dustattenuation a_uv &lt; 6.7 mag (visual attenuation a_v &lt; 3 mag). hence we did notfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of grb hosts. finally,we found that the distributions of sfrs and a_uv of grb hosts are consistentwith those of lyman break galaxies, halpha emitters at similar redshifts and ofgalaxies from cosmological simulations. the similarity of the grb populationwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that grbs, aleast at z&lt;1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are thereforeless biased indicators than once thought.

1209.0891	the distribution of equivalent widths in long grb afterglow spectra	the extreme brightness of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows and their simplespectral shape make them ideal beacons to study the interstellar medium oftheir host galaxies through absorption line spectroscopy. using 69low-resolution grb afterglow spectra, we conduct a study of the rest-frameequivalent width (ew) distribution of features with an average rest-frame ewlarger than 0.5 a. to compare an individual grb with the sample, we develop ewdiagrams as a graphical tool, and we give a catalogue with diagrams for the 69spectra. we introduce a line strength parameter (lsp) that allows us toquantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by asingle number. using the distributions of ews of single-species features, wederive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth (cog) fit. wefind correlations between the lsp and the extinction of the grb, the uvbrightness of the host galaxies and the neutral hydrogen column density.however, we see no significant evolution of the lsp with the redshift. there isa weak correlation between the ionisation of the absorbers and the energy ofthe grb, indicating that, either the grb event is responsible for part of theionisation, or that galaxies with high-ionisation media produce more energeticgrbs. spectral features in grb spectra are, on average, 2.5 times stronger thanthose seen in qso intervening damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems and slightlymore ionised. in particular we find larger excess in the ew of civ1549 relativeto qso dlas, which could be related to an excess of wolf-rayet stars in theenvironments of grbs. from the cog fitting we obtain an average number ofcomponents in the absorption features of grbs of 6.00(-1.25,+1.00). the mostextreme ionisation ratios in our sample are found for grbs with low neutralhydrogen column density, which could be related to ionisation by the grbemission.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1303.4743	dust extinction for an unbiased sample of grb afterglows	in this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of asample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. the selection criteria of thesample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emissionand therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. it istherefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population ofgamma-ray bursts. our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinctionof gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a singledistribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% sufferfrom less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. the remaining 13% of the afterglows arehighly absorbed. the true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing highabsorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events withoutreliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. these events maybe due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated withthe gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or tomassive dusty host galaxies. no clear evolution in the dust extinctionproperties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although thelargest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the starformation rate. those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. a correlation betweenoptical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density basedon x-ray studies is shown although the observed nh appears to be well in excesscompared to those observed in the local group. dust extinction does not seem tocorrelate with grb energetics or luminosity.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1305.6832	discovery of the broad-lined type ic sn 2013cq associated with the very  energetic grb 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) at z &lt; 1 are in most cases found to beaccompanied by bright, broad-lined type ic supernovae (sne ic-bl). thehighest-energy grbs are mostly located at higher redshifts, where theassociated sne are hard to detect observationally. here we present early andlate observations of the optical counterpart of the very energetic grb 130427a.despite its moderate redshift z = 0.3399+/-0.0002, grb 130427a is at the highend of the grb energy distribution, with an isotropic-equivalent energy releaseof eiso ~ 9.6x10^53 erg, more than an order of magnitude more energetic thanother grbs with spectroscopically confirmed sne. in our dense photometricmonitoring, we detect excess flux in the host-subtracted r-band light curve,consistent with what expected from an emerging sn, ~0.2 mag fainter than theprototypical sn 1998bw. a spectrum obtained around the time of the sn peak(16.7 days after the grb) reveals broad undulations typical of sne ic-bl,confirming the presence of a sn, designated sn 2013cq. the spectral shape andearly peak time are similar to those of the high expansion velocity sn 2010bhassociated with grb 100316d. our findings demonstrate that high-energylong-duration grbs, commonly detected at high redshift, can also be associatedwith sne ic-bl, pointing to a common progenitor mechanism.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1311.4340	new constraints on grb jet geometry and relativistic shock physics	we use high--quality, multi-band observations of swift grb120404a, fromgamma-ray to radio frequencies, together with the new hydrodynamics code of vaneerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

0803.1919	the spectral lag of grb060505: a likely member of the long duration  class	two long gamma-ray bursts, grb 060505 and grb 060614, occurred in nearbygalaxies at redshifts of 0.089 and 0.125 respectively. due to their proximityand durations, deep follow-up campaigns to search for supernovae (sne) wereinitiated. however none were found in either case, to limits more than twoorders of magnitude fainter than the prototypical grb-associated sn, 1998bw. itwas suggested that the bursts, in spite of their durations (4 and 102 s),belonged to the population of short grbs which has been shown to be unrelatedto sne. in the case of grb 060614 this argument was based on a number ofindicators, including the negligible spectral lag, which is consistent withthat of short bursts. grb 060505 has a shorter duration, but no spectral lagwas measured. we present the spectral lag measurements of grb 060505 usingsuzakus wide area monitor and the swift burst alert telescope. we find that thelag is 0.36+/- 0.05 s, inconsistent with the lags of short bursts andconsistent with the properties of long bursts and sn-grbs. these resultssupport the association of grb 060505 with other low-luminosity grbs also foundin star-forming galaxies and indicates that at least some massive stars may diewithout bright sne.

0803.2235	on the distribution of stellar masses in gamma-ray burst host galaxies	we analyse spitzer images of 30 long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) hostgalaxies. we estimate their total stellar masses (m*) based on the rest-framek-band luminosities (l_krest) and constrain their star formation rates (sfrs,not corrected for dust extinction) based on the rest-frame uv continua.further, we compute a mean m*/l_krest = 0.45 msun/lsun. we find that the hostsare low m*, star-forming systems. the median m* in our sample (&lt;m*&gt; = 10^9.7msun) is lower than that of "field" galaxies (e.g., gemini deep deep survey).the range spanned by m* is 10^7 msun &lt; m* &lt; 10^11 msun, while the range spannedby the dust-uncorrected uv sfr is 10^-2 msun yr^-1 &lt; sfr &lt; 10 msun yr^-1. thereis no evidence for intrinsic evolution in the distribution of m* with redshift.we show that extinction by dust must be present in at least 25% of the grbhosts in our sample and suggest that this is a way to reconcile our finding ofa relatively lower uv-based, specific sfr (phi = sfr/m*) with previous claimsthat grbs have some of the highest phi values. we also examine the effect thatthe inability to resolve the star-forming regions in the hosts has on phi.

1409.8331	spectroscopy of superluminous supernova host galaxies. a preference of  hydrogen-poor events for extreme emission line galaxies	superluminous supernovae (slsne) are very bright explosions that were onlydiscovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarfgalaxies. understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellarexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover theelusive progenitors of slsne and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. inthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study superluminoussupernova host galaxies, focusing on the sample for which we have obtainedspectroscopy. we show that slsne-i and slsne-r (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% inour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as extreme emission linegalaxies (eelgs). the probability of this happening by chance is negligible andwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the slsnphenomenon are related. in contrast, slsne-ii (hydrogen-rich) occur in moremassive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. therefore, ifslsne-ii constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likelydifferent from those of h-poor slsne. gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are, on average,not found in as extreme environments as h-poor slsne. we propose that h-poorslsne result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlierthan grbs. this might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in thesesystems. slsne present a novel method of selecting candidate eelgs independentof their luminosity.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

0806.1182	photometry and spectroscopy of grb 060526: a detailed study of the  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst	aims: with this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglowlight curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (grb) 060526 at $z=3.221$.methods: we present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for agrb afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultravioletto the near infrared. the data set contains 412 data points in total to whichwe add additional data from the literature. furthermore, we presentlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. the afterglowlight curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power lawfits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.the absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive columndensities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis fromwhich we derive the metallicity of the host of grb 060526. results: thetemporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law withbreaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. it shows deviationsfrom the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energyinjections from the central engine, although some significant microvariabilityremains. the broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows nosignificant extinction along the line of sight. the metallicity derived from\ion{s}{ii} and \ion{fe}{ii} of [s/h] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [fe/h] =--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparableto the metallicity of other grb hosts at similar redshifts. at the position ofthe afterglow, no host is detected to f775w(ab) = 28.5 mag with the hst,implying an absolute magnitude of the host m(1500 \aa{})$&gt;$--18.3 mag which isfainter than most long-duration hosts, although the grb may be associated witha faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

0807.1348	the short grb070707 afterglow and its very faint host galaxy	we present the results from an eso/vlt campaign aimed at studying theafterglow properties of the short/hard gamma ray burst grb 070707. observationswere carried out at ten different epochs from ~0.5 to ~80 days after the event.the optical flux decayed steeply with a power-law decay index greater than 3,later levelling off at r~27.3 mag; this is likely the emission level of thehost galaxy, the faintest yet detected for a short grb. spectroscopicobservations did not reveal any line features/edges that could unambiguouslypinpoint the grb redshift, but set a limit z &lt; 3.6. in the range of allowedredshifts, the host has a low luminosity, comparable to that of long-durationgrbs. the existence of such faint host galaxies suggests caution whenassociating short grbs with bright, offset galaxies, where the true host mightjust be too dim for detection. the steepness of the decay of the opticalafterglow of grb 070707 challenges external shock models for the opticalafterglow of short/hard grbs. we argue that this behaviour might results fromprolonged activity of the central engine or require alternative scenarios.

astro-ph;0210333	the afterglow of grb 021004: surfing on density waves	we present a model for the early optical afterglow of grb 021004. this bursthad one of the earliest detected optical afterglows, allowing a dense opticalsampling. the lightcurve was peculiar, since bright bumps were superimposed tothe regular power-law decay observed in many other events. we show that, giventheir time scale and shape, the bumps are due to the interaction of thefireball with moderate enhancements in the ambient medium density. theenhancements have a density contrast of order 10, modifying only slightly thedynamics of the fireball, which therefore surfs on them rather than collidingonto them. a relativistic reverse shock does not develop. since the interactiontakes place when the fireball is still hyper-relativistic it is not possible tounderstand if the overdensities are localized in clumps or are sphericallysymmetric around the grb progenitor. the monotonic decrease of the contrast ofsuccessive rebrightenings suggests however the presence of clumps in an averageuniform environment. such an interpretation, complemented by the detection ofseveral high velocity absorption systems in the optical spectrum, stronglysuggests that grb 021004 exploded within the remnant of a previous explosion.

astro-ph;0309748	grb 020813: polarization in the case of a smooth optical decay	we present the results of a vlt polarimetric monitoring campaign of the grb020813 optical afterglow carried out in three nights, from 0.88 to 4.20 daysafter the gamma-ray event. the mean values of the degree of linear polarization(p) and its position angle (theta) resulting from our campaign are&lt;p&gt;=1.18+/-0.10% and theta = 148.7+/-2.3 deg after correcting for galacticinterstellar polarization. our vlt data set is most naturally described by aconstant degree of linear polarization and position angle, nonetheless a slowtheta evolution cannot be entirely ruled out by our data. the vlt monitoringcampaign did not reveal either a significant theta rotation respect to the keckspectropolarimetric observations performed ~0.25 days after the grb (barth etal. 2003). however, &lt;p&gt; is a factor of two lower than the polarization degreemeasured from keck. additionally, the vlt polarization data allowed us toconstruct an accurate v-band light curve. the v-band photometric data revealeda smooth light curve with a break located between the last keck and our firstvlt polarimetric measurement, 0.33 &lt; t_(break, v) &lt; 0.88 days after the grb.the typical magnitude fluctuations of the vlt v-band lightcurve are 0.003 mag,0.010 mag and 0.016 mag for our three observing nights, respectively. wespeculate that the stability of theta might be related to the smoothness of thelight curve.

astro-ph;0401315	on the jet structure and magnetic field configuration of grb 020813	the polarization curve of grb 020813 is discussed and compared to differentmodels for the structure, evolution and magnetisation properties of the jet andthe interstellar medium onto which the fireball impacts. grb 020813 is bestsuited for this kind of analysis for the smoothness of its afterglow lightcurve, ensuring the applicability of current models. the polarization datasetallows us to rule out the standard grb jet, in which the energy and lorentzfactor have a well defined value inside the jet opening angle and the magneticfield is generated at the shock front. we explore alternative models findingthat a structured jet or a jet with a toroidal component of the magnetic fieldcan fit equally well the polarization curve. stronger conclusions cannot bedrawn due to the incomplete sampling of the polarization curve. a more densesampling, especially at early times, is required to pin down the structure ofthe jet and the geometry of its magnetic field.

astro-ph;0408041	probing a grb progenitor at a redshift of z=2: a comprehensive observing  campaign of the afterglow of grb 030226	we report results from a comprehensive follow-up observing campaign of theafterglow of grb 030226, including vlt spectroscopy, vlt polarimetry, andchandra x-ray observations. in addition, we present bootes-1 wide-fieldobservations at the time of the occurrence of the burst. first observations ateso started 0.2 days after the event when the grb afterglow was at a magnitudeof r~19 and continued until the afterglow had faded below the detectionthreshold (r&gt;26). no underlying host galaxy was found. the optical light curveshows a break around 0.8 days after the burst, which is achromatic within theobservational errors, supporting the view that it was due to a jettedexplosion. close to the break time the degree of linear polarization of theafterglow light was less than 1.1%, which favors a uniform jet model ratherthan a structured one. vlt spectra show two absorption line systems atredshifts z=1.962+/-0.001 and at z=1.986+/-0.001, placing the lower limit forthe redshift of the grb close to 2. we emphasize that the kinematics and thecomposition of the absorbing clouds responsible for these line systems is verysimilar to those observed in the afterglow of grb 021004. this corroborates thepicture in which at least some grbs are physically related to the explosion ofa wolf-rayet star.

astro-ph;0510141	the short-duration grb 050724 host galaxy in the context of the  long-duration grb hosts	we report optical and near-infrared broad band observations of theshort-duration grb 050724 host galaxy, used to construct its spectral energydistribution (sed). unlike the hosts of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs),which show younger stellar populations, the sed of the grb 050724 host galaxyis optimally fitted with a synthetic elliptical galaxy template based on anevolved stellar population (age ~2.6 gyr). the sed of the host is difficult toreproduce with non-evolving metallicity templates. in contrast, if the shortgrb host galaxy metallicity enrichment is considered, the synthetic templatesfit the observed sed satisfactorily. the internal host extinction is low (a_v\~&lt; 0.4 mag) so it cannot explain the faintness of the afterglow. this shortgrb host galaxy is more massive (~5x10^10 mo) and luminous (~1.1 l*) than mostof the long-duration grb hosts. a statistical comparison based on the ages ofshort- and long-duration grb host galaxies strongly suggests thatshort-duration grb hosts contain, on average, older progenitors. these findingssupport a different origin for short- and long-duration grbs.

astro-ph;0607601	anatomy of a dark burst - the afterglow of grb 060108	we report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a grb (060108) thatwould have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-basedoptical imaging with the 2-m robotic faulkes telesscope (ftn). ourmultiwavelength analysis reveals an x-ray light curve typical of many swiftlong grbs (3-segments plus flare). its optical afterglow, however, was alreadyfainter than the detection limit of the uvot within 100s of the burst. opticalimaging in bvri' filters with the ftn began 2.75 minutes after the burst andresulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a ukirtk-band identification at ~45 mins. r and i'-band light curves are consistentwith a single power law decay in flux, f(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 &lt;0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. deep vlt r-band imaging at ~12 daysreveals a faint, extended object (r ~23.5 mag) at the location of theafterglow. although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of thea_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. this impliesthat the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observedin the x-rays. we derive a maximum photometric redshift z&lt;3.2 for grb 060108and a best-fitting optical-to-x-ray sed at 1000 s after the burst consistentwith a power law with index beta_ox = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.the unambiguous detection at b-band and the derived photometric redshift ruleout a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of grb 060108.instead, the hard opt/x-ray spectral index confirms it as one of theoptically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains theuvot non-detection (abridged).

astro-ph;0609825	uves/vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb 050730 afterglow: probing  the features of the grb environment	we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of the opticalafterglow of grb050730, obtained with uves@vlt about hours after the grbtrigger. the spectrum shows that the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 3.967 iscomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorptionsystem. we detect strong cii*, siii*, oi* and feii* fine structure absorptionlines associated to the second and third component. for the first threecomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of thegrb explosion. component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not presentany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionizationfeatures, such as civ and ovi, suggesting that this component is very close tothe grb site. from the analysis of low and high ionization lines and finestructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from thesite of the grb explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. weevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. however, this should not be taken asrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to thehydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while thatof the other elements presumably comes from the ism closer to the grb site.furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modifysignificantly these values. the mean [c/fe] ratio agrees well with thatexpected by single star-formation event models. interestingly the [c/fe] ofcomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with grb dustdestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the grbsite.

astro-ph;0610660	the remarkable afterglow of grb 061007: implications for optical flashes  and grb fireballs	we present a multiwavelength analysis of swift grb 061007. the 2-m roboticfaulkes telescope south (fts) began observing 137 s after the onset of thegamma-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from r10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hours. these observationsbegin during the final gamma-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long,soft tail of gamma-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-lawdecay identical to that seen at optical and x-ray wavelengths, with temporalslope alpha 1.7 this remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare forswift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. we suggest theafterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with theon-going variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates froma physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. the afterglowcontinues unabated until at least 10^5 s showing no evidence of a break. theobserved multiwavelength evolution of grb 061007 is explained by an expandingfireball whose optical, x-ray and late-time gamma-ray emission is dominated byemission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, nu_m, that isalready below the optical band as early as t=137 s and a cooling frequency,nu_c, above the x-ray band to at least t=10^5 s. in contrast, the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. we suggestthat the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of swiftgrbs may be explained with a low nu_m originating from small microphysicsparameters, epsilon_e and epsilon_b.

astro-ph;0610845	long-term monitoring of the x-ray afterglow of grb 050408 with swift/xrt	we present observations of the x-ray afterglow of grb 050408, a gamma-rayburst discovered by hete-ii. swift began observing the field 42 min after theburst, performing follow-up over a period of 38 d (thus spanning three decadesin time).the x-ray light curve showed a steepening with time, similar to manyother afterglows. however, the steepening was unusually smooth, over theduration of the xrt observation, with no clear break time. the early decay wastoo flat to be described in terms of standard models. we therefore explorealternative explanations, such as the presence of a structured afterglow or oflong-lasting energy injection into the fireball from the central grb engine.the lack of a sharp break puts constraints on these two models. in the formercase, it may indicate that the angular energy profile of the jet was not asimple power law, while in the second model it implies that injection did notstop abruptly. the late decay may be due either to a standard afterglow (thatis, with no energy injection), or to a jetted outflow still being refreshed. asignificant amount of absorption was present in the x-ray spectrum,corresponding to a rest-frame hydrogen column density nh = 1.2(-0.3,+0.4)*10^22 cm^-2, indicative of a dense environment.

astro-ph;0612494	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments and by konus-wind. thanks to theseexceptional circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the promptemission could be studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges (up to 2mev). while the x-ray emission (0.2-10 kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst,the optical component follows a different pattern, likely indicating adifferent origin, possibly the onset of external shocks. the prompt grbspectrum shows significant spectral evolution, with both the peak energy andthe spectral index varying. as observed in several long grbs, significant lagsare measured between the hard- and low-energy components, showing that thisbehaviour extends over 3 decades in energy. the grb peaks are also much broaderat soft energies. this is related to the temporal evolution of the spectrum,and can be accounted for by the softening of the electron spectral index withtime. the burst energy (e_iso~5x10^{53} erg at z=2.297) and average peak energy(e_p~300 kev) make grb 060124 consistent with the amati relation. the x-rayafterglow is characterized by a decay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0701591	swift grbs: the early afterglow spectral energy distribution	we present the first results of a program to systematically study theoptical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) of swift grb afterglowswith known redshift. the goal is to study the properties of the grb explosionand of the intervening absorbing material. in this report we present thepreliminary analysis on 23 afterglows. thanks to swift, we could build the sedat early times after the grb (minutes to hours). we derived the hydrogen columndensities and the spectral slopes from the x-ray spectrum. we then constrainedthe visual extinction by requiring that the combined optical/x-ray sed is dueto synchrotron, namely either a single power law or a broken power law with aslope change by 0.5. we confirm a low dust-to-metal ratio, smaller than in thesmc, even from the analysis of data taken significantly earlier than previouslypossible. our analysis does not support the existence of ``grey'' dust. we alsofind that the synchrotron spectrum works remarkably well to explain afterglowseds. we clearly see, however, that during the x-ray steep decay phases and theflares, the x-ray radiation cannot be due only to afterglow emission.

astro-ph;0703458	gamma-ray burst host galaxies and the link to star-formation	we briefly review the current status of the study of long-duration gamma-rayburst (grb) host galaxies. grb host galaxies are mainly interesting to studyfor two reasons: 1) they may help us understand where and when massive starswere formed throughout cosmic history, and 2) the properties of host galaxiesand the localisation within the hosts where grbs are formed may give essentialclues to the precise nature of the progenitors. the main current problem is tounderstand to what degree grbs are biased tracers of star formation. if grbsare only formed by low-metallicity stars, then their host galaxies will notgive a representative view of where stars are formed in the universe (at leastnot a low redshifts). on the other hand, if there is no dependency onmetallicity then the nature of the host galaxies leads to the perhapssurprising conclusion that most stars are formed in dwarf galaxies. in order toresolve this issue and to fully exploit the potential of grbs as probes ofstar-forming galaxies throughout the observable universe it is mandatory that acomplete sample of bursts with redshifts and host galaxy detections is built.

0810.2897	dust extinction in high-z galaxies with grb afterglow spectroscopy - the  2175{\aa} feature at z=2.45	we report the clear detection of the 2175a dust absorption feature in theoptical afterglow spectrum of the gamma-ray burst (grb) grb070802 at a redshiftof z=2.45. this is the highest redshift for a detected 2175a dust bump to date,and it is the first clear detection of the 2175a bump in a grb host galaxy,while several tens of optical afterglow spectra without the bump have beenrecorded in the past decade. the derived extinction curve gives a_v=0.8-1.5depending on the assumed intrinsic slope. of the three local extinction laws,an lmc type extinction gives the best fit to the extinction curve of the hostof grb070802. besides the 2175a bump we find that the spectrum of grb070802 ischaracterized by unusually strong low-ionization metal lines and possibly ahigh metallicity for a grb sightline ([si/h]=-0.46+/-0.38,[zn/h]=-0.50+/-0.68). in particular, the spectrum of grb070802 is unique for agrb spectrum in that it shows clear ci absorption features, leading us topropose a correlation between the presence of the bump and ci. the gas to dustratio for the host galaxy is found to be significantly lower than that of othergrb hosts with n(hi)/a_v=(2.4+/-1.0)x10^21 cm^-2 mag^-1, which lies betweentypical mw and lmc values. our results are in agreement with the tentativeconclusion reached by gordon et al. 2003 that the shape of the extinctioncurve, in particular the presence of the bump, is affected by the uv fluxdensity in the environment of the dust.

0811.0989	probing the complex environments of grb host galaxies and intervening  systems: high resolution spectroscopy of grb050922c	the aim of this paper is to investigate the environment of gamma ray bursts(grbs) and the interstellar matter of their host galaxies. we use to thispurpose high resolution spectroscopic observations of the afterglow ofgrb050922c, obtained with uves/vlt 3.5 hours after the grb event. we foundthat, as for most high resolution spectra of grbs, the spectrum of theafterglow of grb050922c is complex. at least seven components contribute to themain absorption system at z=2.1992. the detection of lines of neutral elementslike mgi and the detection of fine-structure levels of the ions feii, siii andcii allows us to separate components in the grb ism along the line of sight.moreover, in addition to the main system, we have analyzed the five interveningsystems between z = 2.077 and z = 1.5664 identified along the grb line ofsight. grb afterglow spectra are very complex, but full of information. thiscan be used to disentangle the contribution of the different parts of the grbhost galaxy and to study their properties. our metallicity estimates agree withthe scenario of grbs exploding in low metallicity galaxies

0811.3897	grbs as probes of massive stars near and far	long-duration gamma-ray bursts are the manifestations of massive stellardeath. due to the immense energy release they are detectable from most of theobservable universe. in this way they allow us to study the deaths of single(or binary) massive stars possibly throughout the full timespan massive starshave existed in the universe. grbs provide a means to infer information aboutthe environments and typical galaxies in which massive stars are formed. twomain obstacles remain to be crossed before the full potential of grbs as probesof massive stars can be harvested: i) we need to build more complete and wellunderstood samples in order not to be fooled by biases, and ii) we need tounderstand to which extent grbs may be intrinsically biased in the sense thatthey are only formed by a limited subset of massive stars defined by mostlikely a restricted metallicity interval. we describe the status of an ongoingeffort to build a more complete sample of long-duration grbs with measuredredshifts. already now we can conclude that the environments of grb progenitorsare very diverse with metallicities ranging from solar to a hundredth solar andextinction ranging from none to a_v&gt;5 mag. we have also identified a sightlinewith significant escape of lyman continuum photons and another with a clear2175aa extinction bump.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.
