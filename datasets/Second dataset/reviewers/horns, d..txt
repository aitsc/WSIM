0706.2784	bepposax observation of 4u 1705-44: detection of hard x-ray emission in  the soft state	4u 1705-44 is one of the best studied type i x-ray burster and atoll sources.since it covers a wide range in luminosity (from a few to 50 x 10^{36} ergs^{-1}) and shows clear spectral state transitions, it represents a goodlaboratory to test the accretion models proposed for atoll sources. we analysedthe energy spectrum accumulated with bepposax observations (43.5 ksec) inaugust 2000 when the source was in a soft spectral state. the continuum of thewide band energy spectrum is well described by the sum of a blackbody(kt_{bb}~0.56 kev) and a comptonized component (seed-photon temperature kt_w~1kev, electron temperature kt_e~2.7 kev, and optical depth ~11). a hard tail wasdetected at energies above ~25 kev. the latter can be modeled by a power lawhaving a photon index ~2.9 which contributes ~11% of the total flux in therange 0.1-200 kev. a broad emission line, possibly from a relativisticaccretion disk, models the feature in the fe k line region of the spectrum.this is the first time that a high energy tail has been observed during a softstate of the source.

1002.0581	grb 081008: from burst to afterglow and the transition phase in between	we present a multi-wavelength study of grb 081008, at redshift 1.967, byswift, rotse-iii and grond. compared to other swift grbs, grb 081008 has atypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during theprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. theearly x-ray emission seen by the swift/xrt was dominated by the softening tailof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after theswift/bat detections. optical observations that started shortly after the firstactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. we interpretthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the earlyburst activities. a second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-raypulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve andthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. wesuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injectioninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch ofburst activities. these early observations thus provide a potential probe forthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. the later lightcurve of grb081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and x-ray. thetemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral breakwithin optical. however, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.we discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

1002.2364	locating the vhe source in the galactic centre with milli-arcsecond  accuracy	very high-energy gamma-rays (vhe; e&gt;100 gev) have been detected from thedirection of the galactic centre up to energies e&gt;10 tev. up to now, the originof this emission is unknown due to the limited positional accuracy of theobserving instruments. one of the counterpart candidates is the super-massiveblack hole (smbh) sgr a*. if the vhe emission is produced within ~10^{15} cm~1000 r_g (r_g=g m/c^2 is the schwarzschild radius) of the smbh, a decrease ofthe vhe photon flux in the energy range 100--300 gev is expected whenever anearly type or giant star approaches the line of sight within ~ milli-arcseconds(mas). the dimming of the flux is due to absorption by pair-production of thevhe photons in the soft photon field of the star, an effect we refer to aspair-production eclipse (ppe). based upon the currently known orbits of starsin the inner arcsecond of the galaxy we find that ppes lead to a systematicdimming in the 100--300 gev band at the level of a few per cent and lasts forseveral weeks. since the ppe affects only a narrow energy band and is wellcorrelated with the passage of the star, it can be clearly discriminatedagainst other systematic or even source-intrinsic effects. while the effect istoo small to be observable with the current generation of vhe detectors,upcoming high count-rate experiments like the cherenkov telescope array (cta)will be sufficiently sensitive. measuring the temporal signature of the ppebears the potential to locate the position and size of the vhe emitting regionwithin the inner 1000 r_g or in the case of a non-detection exclude theimmediate environment of the smbh as the site of gamma-ray productionaltogether.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

0708.1516	spectral evolution of non-thermal electron distributions in intense  radiation fields	(abridged) models of many astrophysical gamma-ray sources assume they containa homogeneous distribution of electrons that are injected as a power-law inenergy and evolve by interacting with radiation fields, magnetic fields andparticles in the source and by escaping. this problem is particularlycomplicated if the radiation fields have higher energy density than themagnetic field and are sufficiently energetic that inverse compton scatteringis not limited to the thomson regime. we present a simple, time-dependent,semi-analytical solution of the electron kinetic equation that treats bothcontinuous and impulsive injection, cooling via synchrotron and inverse comptonradiation, (taking into account klein-nishina effects) and energy dependentparticle escape. the kinetic equation for an arbitrary, time-dependent sourcefunction is solved by the method of laplace transformations. using anapproximate expression for the energy loss rate that takes into accountsynchrotron and inverse compton losses including klein-nishina effects forscattering off an isotropic photon field with either a power-law or black-bodydistribution, we find explicit expressions for the cooling time and escapeprobability of individual electrons. this enables the full, time-dependentsolution to be reduced to a single quadrature. from the electron distribution,we then construct the time-dependent, multi-wavelength emission spectrum. wecompare our solutions with several limiting cases and discuss the generalappearance and temporal behaviour of spectral features (i.e., cooling breaks,bumps etc.). as a specific example, we model the broad-band energy spectrum ofthe open stellar association westerlund-2 at different times of its evolution,and compare it with observations.

1008.4524	the crab nebula as a standard candle in very high-energy astrophysics	the continuum high-energy gamma-ray emission between 1 gev and 100 tev fromthe crab nebula has been measured for the first time in overlapping energybands by the fermi large-area telescope (fermi/lat) below ~ 100 gev and byground-based imaging air cherenkov telescopes (iacts) above ~ 60 gev. to followup on the phenomenological approach suggested by hillas et al. (1998), thebroad band spectral and spatial measurement (from radio to low-energygamma-rays &lt; 1 gev) is used to extract the shape of the electron spectrum.while this model per construction provides an excellent description of the dataat energies &lt; 1 gev, the predicted inverse compton component matches thecombined fermi/lat and iact measurements remarkably well after including allrelevant seed photon fields and fitting the average magnetic field to b = (124+/- 6 (stat.) +15 / -6 (sys.)) {\mu}g. the close match of the resulting broadband inverse compton component with the combined fermi/lat and iacts data isused to derive instrument specific energy-calibration factors. these factorscan be used to combine data from fermi/lat and iacts without suffering fromsystematic uncertainties on the common energy scale. as a first application ofthe cross calibration, we derive an upper limit to the diffuse gamma-rayemission between 250 gev and 1 tev based upon the combined measurements offermi/lat and the h.e.s.s. ground-based cherenkov telescopes. finally, thepredictions of the magneto-hydrodynamic flow model of kennel &amp; coroniti (1984)are compared to the measured sed.

1108.2855	discovery of the source hess j1356-645 associated with the young and  energetic psr j1357-6429	several newly discovered very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-raysources in the galaxy are thought to be associated with energetic pulsars.among them, middle-aged (&gt; 1e+4 yr) systems exhibit large centre-filled vhenebulae, offset from the pulsar position, which result from the complexrelationship between the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium, and reflectthe past evolution of the pulsar. imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(iacts) have been successful in revealing extended emission from these sourcesin the vhe regime. together with radio and x-ray observations, thisobservational window allows one to probe the energetics and magnetic fieldinside these large-scale nebulae. h.e.s.s., with its large field of view,angular resolution of &lt; 0.1deg and unprecedented sensitivity, has been used todiscover a large population of such vhe sources. in this paper, the h.e.s.s.data from the continuation of the galactic plane survey (-80deg &lt; l &lt; 60deg,|b| &lt; 3deg), together with the existing multi-wavelength observations, areused. a new vhe gamma-ray source was discovered at r.a.

1110.6868	dark matter subhalos as fermi gamma-ray sources and first candidates in  the 1fgl catalog	predicted by hierarchical structure formation, milky way-type galaxies areanticipated to host numerous dark matter subhalos with masses between 10^{10}and a cut-off of 10^{-6} solar masses, or even less. in self-annihilating darkmatter scenarios, these objects could be visible in the gamma-ray band as faintand non-variable sources without astrophysical counterpart. in accordance withrealistic subhalo models and current observational constraints onself-annihilating dark matter, we predict that about one massive galacticsubhalo may have already been detected in the 11-months catalog of fermi-latdata (1fgl). selection cuts applied to the 1fgl reveal twelve possiblecandidates, and in-depth studies of the most promising object, 1fglj0030.7+0724, are presented. in a dedicated x-ray follow-up observation withthe swift xrt, seven point-like x-ray sources have been discovered. within thepositional uncertainty derived from the 24-months fermi-lat data, we considerthe unidentified radio source nvss j003119+072456, coinciding with one of thediscovered swift sources, as the most promising counterpart candidate for 1fglj0030.7+0724. the broad-band spectral energy distribution is consistent with ahigh-energy-peaked blazar. however, flux and extent of the fermi source mayalso be compatible with a dark matter subhalo. a discrimination between the twoscenarios requires further multi-wavelength observations. strategies foridentifying gamma-ray sources associated with self-annihilating dm subhalos arediscussed.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1111.3514	dark matter subhaloes as gamma-ray sources and candidates in the first  fermi-lat catalogue	the standard paradigm of hierarchical structure formation in a lambdacdmuniverse predicts the presence of dark matter subhaloes, hosted by milkyway-sized galaxies. anticipated subhalo masses range from 10^{10} down to acut-off mass between 10^{-3} and 10^{-11} solar masses. if dark matter iscomposed of heavy self-annihilating or decaying particles, these subhaloescould be visible in the gamma-ray band as faint and temporally constant sourceswithout astrophysical counterparts. based upon realistic subhalo models andcurrent observational constraints on annihilating dark matter scenarios, wepredict that one massive galactic subhalo between 10^6 and 10^8 solar massesmay already be present in the 11-month catalogue of fermi-lat. indeed, at leasttwelve objects in the first fermi catalogue qualify as candidates. the mostpromising object, 1fgl j0030.7+0724, is investigated in detail using adedicated swift x-ray follow-up observation and a refined positional analysisof the 24-month fermi-lat data. with the new observations, seven point-likex-ray sources have been discovered, of which swift j003119.8+072454, whichcoincides with a faint radio source (12 mjy at 1.4 ghz), serves as acounterpart candidate of 1fgl j0030.7+0724. the broad-band spectral energydistribution is consistent with a high-energy-peaked blazar. however, flux andextent of 1fgl j0030.7+0724 may also be compatible with a dark matter subhalo.detection of temporal variability or improved astrometry of 1fgl j0030.7+0724are necessary to rule out or confirm an astrophysical origin. we discussstrategies to identify gamma-ray sources that are associated withself-annihilating dark matter subhaloes.

1111.5343	an experiment to locate the site of tev flaring in m87	we describe a chandra x-ray too project designed to isolate the site of tevflaring in the radio galaxy m87. to date, we have triggered the chandraobservations only once (2010 april) and by the time of the first of our 9observations, the tev flare had ended. however, we found that the x-rayintensity of the unresolved nucleus was at an elevated level for our firstobservation. of the more than 60 chandra observations we have made of the m87jet covering 9 years, the nucleus was measured at a comparably high level only3 times. two of these occasions can be associated with tev flaring, and at thetime of the third event, there were no tev monitoring activities. from therapidity of the intensity drop of the nucleus, we infer that the size of theemitting region is of order a few light days times the unknown beaming factor;comparable to the same sort of estimate for the tev emitting region. we alsofind evidence of spectral evolution in the x-ray band which seems consistentwith radiative losses affecting the non-thermal population of the emittingelectrons within the unresolved nucleus.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1210.6513	identification of hess j1303-631 as a pulsar wind nebula through  gamma-ray, x-ray and radio observations	the previously unidentified very high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-raysource hess j1303-631, discovered in 2004, is re-examined including new datafrom the h.e.s.s. cherenkov telescope array. archival data from the xmm-newtonx-ray satellite and from the pmn radio survey are also examined. detailedmorphological and spectral studies of vhe \gamma-ray emission as well as of thexmm-newton x-ray data are performed. significant energy-dependent morphology ofthe \gamma-ray source is detected with high-energy emission (e &gt; 10 tev)positionally coincident with the pulsar psr j1301-6305 and lower energyemission (e &lt;2 tev) extending \sim 0.4^{\circ} to the south-east of the pulsar.the spectrum of the vhe source can be described with a power-law with anexponential cut-off n_{0} = (5.6 \pm 0.5) x 10^{-12} tev^-1 cm^-2 s^-1, \gamma= 1.5 \pm 0.2) and e_{\rm cut} = (7.7 \pm 2.2) tev. the pwn is also detected inx-rays, extending \sim 2-3' from the pulsar position towards the center of the\gamma-ray emission region. the spectral energy distribution (sed) is welldescribed by a one zone leptonic scenario which, with its associated caveats,predicts a very low average magnetic field for this source. significantenergy-dependent morphology of this source, as well as the identification of anassociated x-ray pwn from xmm-newton observations enable identification of thevhe source as an evolved pwn associated to the pulsar psr j1303-6305. however,the large discrepancy in emission region sizes and the low level of synchrotronradiation suggest a multi-population leptonic nature. the low implied magneticfield suggests that the pwn has undergone significant expansion. this wouldexplain the low level of synchrotron radiation and the difficulty in detectingcounterparts at lower energies, the reason this source was originallyclassified as a "dark" vhe \gamma-ray source.

1301.1678	search for very-high-energy \gamma-ray emission from galactic globular  clusters with h.e.s.s	globular clusters (gcs) are established emitters of high-energy (he, 100mev&lt;e&lt;100 gev) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulativeemission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (mspsrs) in the clusters' cores orfrom inverse compton (ic) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in thegc environment. these stellar clusters could also constitute a new class ofsources in the very-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) \gamma-ray regime, judgingfrom the recent detection of a signal from the direction of terzan 5 with theh.e.s.s. telescope array.  we searched for point-like and extended vhe \gamma-ray emission from 15 gcsserendipitously covered by h.e.s.s observations and also performed a stackinganalysis combining the data from all gcs to investigate the hypothesis of apopulation of faint emitters. assuming ic emission as the origin of the vhe\gamma-ray signal from the direction of terzan 5, we calculated the expected\gamma-ray flux from each of the 15 gcs, based on their number of millisecondpulsars, their optical brightness and the energy density of background photonfields.  we did not detect significant vhe \gamma-ray emission from any of the 15 gcsin either of the two analyses. given the uncertainties related to the parameterdeterminations, the obtained flux upper limits allow to rule out the simpleic/mspsr scaling model for ngc 6388 and ngc 7078. the upper limits derived fromthe stacking analyses are factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted bythe simple leptonic scaling model, depending on the assumed source extent andthe dominant target photon fields. therefore, terzan 5 still remainsexceptional among all gcs, as the vhe \gamma-ray emission either arises fromextra-ordinarily efficient leptonic processes, or from a recent catastrophicevent, or is even unrelated to the gc itself.

0705.0009	xmm-newton observations of the first unidentified tev gamma-ray source  tev j2032+4130	(abridged) the first unidentified very high energy gamma ray source (tevj2032+4130) in the cygnus region has been the subject of intensive search for acounterpart source at other wavelengths. a deep ($\approx 50$ ksec) exposure oftev j2032+4130 with \textit{xmm-newton} has been obtained. the contribution ofpoint sources to the observed x-ray emission from tev j2032+4130 is subtractedfrom the data. the point-source subtracted x-ray data are analyzed using blanksky exposures and regions adjacent to the position of tev j2032+4130 in thefield of view covered by the xmm-newton telescopes to search for diffuse x-rayemission. an extended x-ray emission region with a full width half maximum(fwhm) size of $\approx 12$ arc min is found. the centroid of the emission isco-located with the position of tev j2032+4130.the energy spectrum of theemission coinciding with the position and extension of tev j2032+4130 can bemodeled by a power-law model with a photon index$\gamma=1.5\pm0.2_\mathrm{stat}\pm0.3_\mathrm{sys}$ and an energy fluxintegrated between 2 and 10 kev of $f_{2-10 \mathrm{kev}} \approx 7\cdot10^{-13}$ ergs/(cm$^2$ s) which is lower than the very high energy gamma-rayflux observed from tev j2032+4130. we conclude that the faint extended x-rayemission discovered in this observation is the x-ray counterpart of tevj2032+4130. formally, it can not be excluded that the extended emission is dueto an unrelated population of faint, hot ($k_bt\approx 10$ kev) unresolvedpoint-sources which by chance coincides with the position and extension of tevj2032+4130. we discuss our findings in the frame of both hadronic and leptonicgamma-ray production scenarios.

(high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1407.0925	a new method of reconstructing very-high-energy gamma-ray spectra: the  template background spectrum	very-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;0.1 tev) gamma-ray emission regions with angularextents comparable to the field-of-view of current imaging air-cherenkovtelescopes (iact) require additional observations of source-free regions toestimate the background contribution to the energy spectrum. this reduces theeffective observation time and deteriorates the sensitivity. a new method ofreconstructing spectra from iact data without the need of additionalobservations of source-free regions is developed. its application is notrestricted to any specific iact or data format. on the basis of the templatebackground method, which defines the background in air-shower parameter space,a new spectral reconstruction method from iact data is developed and studied,the template background spectrum (tbs); tbs is tested on published h.e.s.s.data and h.e.s.s. results. good agreement is found between vhe gamma-rayspectra reported by the h.e.s.s. collaboration and those re-analysed with tbs.this includes analyses of point-like sources, sources in crowded regions, andof very extended sources down to sources with fluxes of a few percent of thecrab nebula flux and excess-to-background ratios around 0.1. however, the tbsbackground normalisation introduces new statistical and systematic errors whichare accounted for, but may constitute a limiting case for very faint extendedsources. the tbs method enables the spectral reconstruction of data when othermethods are hampered or even fail. it does not need dedicated observations ofvhe gamma-ray-free regions (e.g. as the on/off background does) and circumventsknown geometrical limitations to which other methods (e.g. the reflected-regionbackground) for reconstructing spectral information of vhe gamma-ray emissionregions are prone to; tbs would be, in specific cases, the only feasible way toreconstruct energy spectra.

astro-ph;0407119	the crab nebula: linking mev synchrotron and 50 tev inverse compton  photons	pulsar wind driven synchrotron nebulae are offering a unique view on theconnection of the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium. the crab nebula isparticularly well suited for detailed studies of the different emissionregions. as inferred from the observed synchrotron emission extending beyondmev energies, the crab is a unique and extreme accelerator. in the framework ofthe synchrotron/inverse compton emission model, the same electrons withenergies exceeding $10^{15}$ ev that are responsible for the mev synchrotronemission produce via inverse compton scattering 10-50 tev radiation which hasrecently been observed with the hegra system of ground based gamma-raytelescopes. here we discuss the close relation of the two energy bands coveredby integral and ground based gamma-ray telescopes. despite the lack ofsufficient spatial resolution in both bands to resolve the emission region,correlation of the flux measurements in the two energy bands would allow toconstrain the structure of the emission region. the emission region is expectedto be a very compact region (limited by the life-time of the electrons) nearthe termination shock of the pulsar wind. we extend previous model calculationsfor the nebula's emission to include an additional compact non-thermal emissionregion recently detected at mm wavelengths.the overall good agreement of thismodel with data constrains additional emission processes (ions in the wind,inverse compton from the unshocked wind) to be of little relevance.

astro-ph;0509594	optical lightcurve &amp; cooling break of grb 050502a	we present lightcurves of the afterglow of grb050502a, including very earlydata at t-t_{grb} &lt; 60s. the lightcurve is composed of unfiltered rotse-iiiboptical observations from 44s to 6h post-burst, r-band mdm observations from1.6 to 8.4h post-burst, and pairitel j h k_s observations from 0.6 to 2.6hpost-burst. the optical lightcurve is fit by a broken power law, wheret^{alpha} steepens from alpha = -1.13 +- 0.02 to alpha = -1.44 +- 0.02 at\~5700s. this steepening is consistent with the evolution expected for thepassage of the cooling frequency nu_c through the optical band. even in ourearliest observation at 44s post-burst, there is no evidence that the opticalflux is brighter than a backward extrapolation of the later power law wouldsuggest. the observed decay indices and spectral index are consistent witheither an ism or a wind fireball model, but slightly favor the isminterpretation. the expected spectral index in the ism interpretation isconsistent within 1 sigma with the observed spectral index beta = -0.8 +- 0.1;the wind interpretation would imply a slightly (~2 sigma) shallower spectralindex than observed. a small amount of dust extinction at the source redshiftcould steepen an intrinsic spectrum sufficiently to account for the observedvalue of beta. in this picture, the early optical decay, with the peak at orbelow 4.7e14 hz at 44s, requires very small electron and magnetic energypartitions from the fireball.

astro-ph;0609423	integral observations of tev plerions	amongst the sources seen in very high gamma-rays several are associated withpulsar wind nebulae (``tev plerions''). the study of hard x-ray/soft gamma-rayemission is providing an important insight into the energetic particlepopulation present in these objects. the unpulsed emission from pulsar/pulsarwind nebula systems in the energy range accessible to the integral satellite ismainly synchrotron emission from energetic and fast cooling electrons close totheir acceleration site. our analyses of public integral data of known tevplerions detected by ground based cherenkov telescopes indicate a deeper linkbetween these tev plerions and integral detected pulsar wind nebulae. the newlydiscovered tev plerion in the northern wing of the kookaburra region(g313.3+0.6 powered by the middle aged psr j1420-6048) is found to have apreviously unknown integral counterpart which is besides the vela pulsar theonly middle aged pulsar detected with integral. we do not find an integralcounterpart of the tev plerion associated with the x-ray pwn ``rabbit''g313.3+0.1 which is possibly powered by a young pulsar.
