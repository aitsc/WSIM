0812.4888	near-ir spectroscopic ages of massive star clusters in m82	like other starburst galaxies, m82 hosts compact, massive young star clustersthat are interesting both in their own right and as benchmarks for populationsynthesis models. can spectral synthesis models at resolutions around 1000adequately reproduce the near-ir spectral features and the energy distributionof these clusters between 0.8 and 2.4 microns? how do the derived clusterproperties compare with previous results from optical studies?  we analyse the spectra of 5 massive clusters in m82, using data acquired withthe spectrograph spex on the infrared telescope facility (nasa/irtf) and a newpopulation synthesis tool with a highly improved near-ir extension, based on arecent collection of empirical and theoretical spectra of red supergiant stars.we obtain excellent fits across the near-ir with models at quasi-solarmetallicity and a solar neighbourhood extinction law. spectroscopy breaks astrong degeneracy between age and extinction in the near-ir colours in the redsupergiant-dominated phase of evolution. the estimated near-ir ages clusterbetween 9 and 30 myr, i.e. the ages at which the molecular bands due toluminous red supergiants are strongest in the current models. they do notalways agree with optical spectroscopic ages. adding optical data sometimesleads to the rejection of the solar neighbourhood extinction law. this is notsurprising considering small-scale structure around the clusters, but it has nosignificant effect on the near-ir based spectroscopic ages.

0901.1237	star formation history in the smc: the case of ngc602	deep hst/acs photometry of the young cluster ngc 602, located in the remotelow density "wing" of the small magellanic cloud, reveals numerous pre-mainsequence stars as well as young stars on the main sequence. the resolvedstellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation historyinto recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, suchas the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binaryfraction. to better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present anew set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase withmetallicity appropriate for the small magellanic cloud (z = 0.004). we use astellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range ofstellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formationhistory in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitudediagrams. the derived present day mass function for ngc 602 is consistent withthat resulting from the synthetic diagrams. the star formation rate in theregion has increased with time on a scale of tens of myr, reaching $0.3-0.7\times 10^{-3} m_\odot yr^{-1}$ in the last 2.5 myr, comparable to what isfound in galactic ob associations. star formation is most complete in the maincluster but continues at moderate levels in the gas-rich periphery of thenebula.

0901.2096	physical conditions in the ionized gas of 30 doradus	we present a mid-infrared spectroscopic data cube of the central part of 30doradus, observed with spitzer's irs and mips/sed mode. aromatic dust emissionfeatures and emission lines from molecular and atomic hydrogen are detected butnot particularly strong. the dominant spectral features are emission lines frommoderately ionized species of argon, neon, and sulphur, which are used todetermine the physical conditions in the ionized gas. the ionized gasexcitation shows strong variations on parsec scales, some of which canplausibly be associated with individual hot stars. we fit the ionic linestrengths with photoionization and shock models, and find that photoionizationdominates in the region. the ionization parameter u traces the rim of thecentral bubble, as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization, and atleast one quiescent clump. the hardness of the ionizing radiation field t_radreveals several "hot spots" that are either the result of individual very hotstars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through thesurrounding neutral cloud. consistent with other measurements of giantmolecular hydrogen regions, log(u) ranges between -3 and -0.75, and t_radbetween 30000 and 85000k.

0902.0064	the optical structure of the starburst galaxy m82 - i: dynamics of the  disk and inner-wind	[abridged] we present gemini-n gmos-ifu observations of the central starburstclumps and inner wind of m82, together with wiyn densepak ifu observations ofthe inner 2x0.9kpc of the disk. these cover the emission lines of h$\alpha$,[nii], [sii], and [siii]. we were able to accurately decompose the emissionline profiles into multiple narrow components (fwhm~30-130kms) superimposed ona broad (fwhm 150-350kms) feature. this paper is the first of a seriesexamining the optical structure of m82's disk and inner wind; here we focus onthe ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevantemission line properties.  our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of m82 isdynamically complex. localised line splitting of up to 100kms in the narrowcomponent is associated with expanding shells of compressed, cool, photoionizedgas. we have been able to associate some of this inner-wind gas with a distinctoutflow channel characterised by its dynamics and gas density patterns, and wediscuss the consequences of this discovery in terms of the developing windoutflow.  the broad optical emission line component is observed to become increasinglyimportant moving outward along the outflow channel, and in general withincreasing height above/below the plane. following our recent work on theorigins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clumpinterface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulentmixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasinglyimportant with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existenceof mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area.

0905.1328	spitzer sage infrared photometry of massive stars in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the large magellanic cloud,with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometriccatalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring theirinfrared properties. the photometric catalog consists of stars with infraredcounterparts in the spitzer sage survey database, for which we present uniformphotometry from 0.3-24 microns in the ubvijhks+irac+mips24 bands. the resultinginfrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant b[e], redsupergiant and luminous blue variable (lbv) stars are among the brightestinfrared point sources in the large magellanic cloud, due to their intrinsicbrightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. we detect infrared excessesdue to free-free emission among ~900 ob stars, which correlate with luminosityclass. we confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant b[e] stars, findingthe shape of their spectral energy distributions (seds) to be very similar, incontrast to the variety of sed shapes among the spectrally variable lbvs. thesimilar luminosities of b[e] supergiants (log l/lo&gt;=4) and the rare, dustyprogenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. sn 2008s and ngc 300ot), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests acommon origin for them. we find the infrared colors for wolf-rayet stars to beindependent of spectral type and their seds to be flatter than what modelspredict. the results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap forinterpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxiesat infrared wavelengths.

0906.2006	a spectroscopic census of the m82 stellar cluster population	we present a spectroscopic study of the stellar cluster population of m82,the archetype starburst galaxy, based primarily on new gemini-northmulti-object spectroscopy of 49 star clusters. these observations constitutethe largest to date spectroscopic dataset of extragalactic young clusters,giving virtually continuous coverage across the galaxy; we use these data todeduce information about the clusters as well as the m82 post-starburst diskand nuclear starburst environments. spectroscopic age-dating places clusters inthe nucleus and disk between (7, 15) and (30, 270) myr, with distribution peaksat ~10 and ~140 myr respectively. we find cluster radial velocities in therange (-160, 220) km/s (wrt the galaxy centre) and line of sight na i dinterstellar absorption line velocities in (-75, 200) km/s, in many casesentirely decoupled from the clusters. as the disk cluster radial velocities lieon the flat part of the galaxy rotation curve, we conclude that they comprise aregularly orbiting system. our observations suggest that the largest part ofthe population was created as a result of the close encounter with m81 ~220 myrago. clusters in the nucleus are found in solid body rotation on the bar. thepossible detection of wr features in their spectra indicates that clusterformation continues in the central starburst zone. we also report the potentialdiscovery of two old populous clusters in the halo of m82, aged &gt;8 gyr. usingthese measurements and simple dynamical considerations, we derive a toy modelfor the invisible physical structure of the galaxy, and confirm the existenceof two dominant spiral arms.

0907.3162	the optical structure of the starburst galaxy m82. ii. nebular  properties of the disk and inner-wind	(abridged) in this second paper of the series, we present the results fromoptical gemini-north gmos-ifu and wiyn densepak ifu spectroscopic observationsof the starburst and inner wind zones of m82, with a focus on the state of thet~10^4 k ionized interstellar medium. our electron density maps show peaks of afew 1000 cm-3, local small spatial-scale variations, and a fall-off in theminor axis direction. we discuss the implications of these results with regardsto the conditions/locations that may favour the escape of individual clusterwinds. our findings imply that the starburst environment is highly fragmentedinto a range of clouds from small/dense clumps with low filling factors (&lt;1pc,n_e&gt;10^4 cm-3) to larger filling factor, less dense gas. the near-constantstate of the ionization state of the ~10^4 k gas throughout the starburst canbe explained as a consequence of the small cloud sizes, which allow the gasconditions to respond quickly to any changes. we have examined in more detailboth the broad (fwhm 150-350 km/s) line component found in paper i that weassociated with emission from turbulent mixing layers on the gas clouds, andthe discrete outflow channel identified within the inner wind. the channelappears as a coherent, expanding cylindrical structure of length &gt;120 pc andand width 35-50 pc and the walls maintain an approximately constant (butsubsonic) expansion velocity of ~60 km/s. we use the channel to examine furtherthe relationship between the narrow and broad component emitting gas within theinner wind. within the starburst energy injection zone, we find that turbulentmotions (as traced by the broad component) appear to play an increasing rolewith height.

0910.4191	vlt/flames-argus observations of stellar wind--ism cloud interactions in  ngc 6357	we present optical/near-ir ifu observations of a gas pillar in the galactichii region ngc 6357 containing the young open star cluster pismis 24. theseobservations have allowed us to examined in detail the gas conditions of thestrong wind-clump interactions taking place on its surface. we identify thepresence of a narrow (~20 km/s) and broad (50-150 km/s) component to theh_alpha emission line, where the broadest broad component widths are found in aregion that follows the shape of the eastern pillar edge. these connectionshave allowed us to firmly associate the broad component with emission fromionized gas within turbulent mixing layers on the pillar's surface set up bythe shear flows of the o-star winds from the cluster. we discuss theimplications of our findings in terms of the broad emission line component thatis increasingly found in extragalactic starburst environments. although thebroad line widths found here are narrower, we conclude that the mechanismsproducing both must be the same. the difference in line widths may result fromthe lower total mechanical wind energy produced by the o stars in pismis 24compared to that from a typical young massive star cluster found in a starburstgalaxy. the pillar's edge is also clearly defined by dense (&lt;5000 cm^-3), hot(&gt;20000 k), and excited (via [nii]/h_a and [sii]/h_a ratios) gas conditions,implying the presence of a d-type ionization front propagating into the pillarsurface. although there must be both photoevaporation outflows produced by theionization front, and mass-loss through mechanical ablation, we see no evidencefor any significant bulk gas motions on or around the pillar. we postulate thatthe evaporated/ablated gas must be rapidly heated before being entrained.

0708.2379	gemini gmos/ifu spectroscopy of ngc 1569 - i: mapping the properties of  a young star cluster and its environment	[abridged] we present gemini-north gmos/ifu observations of a young starcluster (cluster 10) and its environment near the centre of the dwarf irregularstarburst galaxy ngc 1569. this forms part of a larger and on-going study ofthe formation and collimation mechanisms of galactic winds, including threeadditional ifu pointings in ngc 1569 covering the base of the galactic windwhich are analysed in a companion paper. the good spatial- andspectral-resolution of these gmos/ifu observations, covering 4740-6860 a, allowus to probe the interactions between clusters and their environments on smallscales. combining our gmos spectrum with hst imaging, we find that cluster 10is composed of two very close components with ages of 5-7 myr and &lt;5 myr, and acombined mass of 7 +/- 5 x 10^3 msun.  a detailed analysis of the h_alpha emission line profile shapes across thewhole field-of-view shows them to be composed of a bright narrow feature(intrinsic fwhm ~ 50 km/s) superimposed on a fainter broad component (fwhm &lt;300 km/s). by mapping the properties of each individual component, weinvestigate the small-scale structure and properties of the ionized ism,including reddening, excitation and electron densities, and for the first timefind spatial correlations between the line component properties. we discuss indetail the possible mechanisms that could give rise to the two components andthese correlations, and conclude that the most likely explanation for the broademission is that it is produced in a turbulent mixing layer on the surface ofthe cool gas clumps embedded within the hot, fast-flowing cluster winds. weconclude we are sampling well within the outer bounding shocks of the expandingsuperbubbles and within the outflow 'energy injection zone'.

1106.2427	evidence for environmentally dependent cluster disruption in m83	using multi-wavelength imaging from the wide field camera 3 on the hubblespace telescope we study the stellar cluster populations of two adjacent fieldsin the nearby face-on spiral galaxy, m83. the observations cover the galacticcentre and reach out to ~6 kpc, thereby spanning a large range of environmentalconditions, ideal for testing empirical laws of cluster disruption. theclusters are selected by visual inspection to be centrally concentrated,symmetric, and resolved on the images. we find that a large fraction of objectsdetected by automated algorithms (e.g. sextractor or daofind) are not clusters,but rather are associations. these are likely to disperse into the field ontimescales of tens of myr due to their lower stellar densities and not due togas expulsion (i.e. they were never gravitationally bound). we split the sampleinto two discrete fields (inner and outer regions of the galaxy) and search forevidence of environmentally dependent cluster disruption. colour-colourdiagrams of the clusters, when compared to simple stellar population models,already indicate that a much larger fraction of the clusters in the outer fieldare older by tens of myr than in the inner field. this impression is quantifiedby estimating each cluster's properties (age, mass, and extinction) andcomparing the age/mass distributions between the two fields. our results areinconsistent with "universal" age and mass distributions of clusters, andinstead show that the ambient environment strongly affects the observedpopulations.

0710.0558	the stellar mass distribution in the giant star forming region ngc 346	deep f555w and f814w hubble space telescope acs images are the basis for astudy of the present day mass function (pdmf) of ngc346, the largest activestar forming region in the small magellanic cloud (smc). we find a pdmf slopeof gamma=-1.43+/-0.18 in the mass range 0.8-60 mo, in excellent agreement withthe salpeter initial mass function (imf) in the solar neighborhood. caveats onthe conversion of the pdmf to the imf are discussed. the pdmf slope changes, asa function of the radial distance from the center of the ngc 346 star cluster,indicating a segregation of the most massive stars. this segregation is likelyprimordial considering the young age (~3 myr) of ngc346, and its clumpystructure which suggests that the cluster has likely not had sufficient time torelax. comparing our results for ngc346 with those derived for other starclusters in the smc and the milky way (mw), we conclude that, while the starformation process might depend on the local cloud conditions, the imf does notseem to be affected by general environmental effects such as galaxy type,metallicity, and dust content.

0710.1028	gemini spectroscopy and hst imaging of the stellar cluster population in  region b of m82	we present new spectroscopic observations of the stellar cluster populationof region b in the prototype starburst galaxy m82 obtained with the gillettgemini-north 8.1-metre telescope. by coupling the spectroscopy with ubviphotometry acquired with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubblespace telescope (hst), we derive ages, extinctions and radial velocities forseven young massive clusters (ymcs) in region b. we find the clusters to haveages between 70 and 200 myr and velocities in the range 230 to 350 km/s, whileextinctions av vary between ~1-2.5 mag. we also find evidence of differentialextinction across the faces of some clusters which hinders the photometricdetermination of ages and extinctions in these cases. the cluster radialvelocities indicate that the clusters are located at different depths withinthe disk, and are on regular disk orbits. our results overall contradict thefindings of previous studies, where region b was thought to be a bound regionpopulated by intermediate-age clusters that formed in an independent, offsetstarburst episode that commenced 600 myr-1 gyr ago. our findings insteadsuggest that region b is optically bright because of low extinction patches,and this allows us to view the cluster population of the inner m82 disk, whichprobably formed as a result of the last encounter with m81. this study formspart of a series of papers aimed at studying the cluster population of m82using deep optical spectroscopy and multi-band photometry.

1109.6015	stellar clusters in m83: formation, evolution, disruption and the  influence of environment	we study the stellar cluster population in two adjacent fields in the nearby,face-on spiral galaxy, m83, using wfc3/hst imaging. the clusters are selectedthrough visual inspection to be centrally concentrated, symmetric, and resolvedon the images, which allows us to differentiate between clusters and likelyunbound associations. we compare our sample with previous studies and show thatthe differences between the catalogues are largely due to the inclusion oflarge numbers of diffuse associations within previous catalogues. theluminosity function of the clusters is well approximated by a power-law withindex, -2, over most of the observed range, however a steepening is seen at m_v= -9.3 and -8.8 in the inner and outer fields, respectively. additionally, weshow that the cluster population is inconsistent with a pure power-law massdistribution, but instead exhibits a truncation at the high mass end. ifdescribed as a schechter function, the characteristic mass is 1.6 and 0.5 *10^5 msun, for the inner and outer fields, respectively, in agreement withprevious estimates of other cluster populations in spiral galaxies. comparingthe predictions of the mass independent disruption (mid) and mass dependentdisruption (mdd) scenarios with the observed distributions, we find that bothmodels can accurately fit the data. however, for the mid case, the fraction ofclusters destroyed (or mass lost) per decade in age is dependent on theenvironment, hence, the age/mass distributions of clusters are not universal.in the mdd case, the disruption timescale scales with galactocentric distance(being longer in the outer regions of the galaxy) in agreement with analyticand numerical predictions. finally, we discuss the implications of our resultson other extragalactic surveys, focussing on the fraction of stars that form inclusters and the need (or lack thereof) for infant mortality.

0710.4354	studying the galactic outflow in ngc 1569	we present deep wiyn h-alpha imaging of the dwarf irregular starburst galaxyngc 1569, together with wiyn sparsepak spatially-resolved optical spectroscopyof the galactic outflow. this leads on from our previous detailed analyses ofthe state of the ism in the central regions of this galaxy. our deep imagingreveals previously undetected ionized filaments in the outer halo. throughcombining these results with our spectroscopy we have been able to re-definethe spatial extent of the previously catalogued superbubbles, and deriveestimates for their expansion velocities, which we find to be in the range50-100 km/s. the implied dynamical ages of &lt;25 myr are consistent with therecent star- and cluster-formation histories of the galaxy. detaileddecomposition of the multi-component h-alpha line has shown that within adistinct region ~700x500 pc in size, roughly centred on the bright super starcluster a, the profile is composed of a bright, narrow (fwhm &lt;= 70 km/s)feature with an underlying, broad component (fwhm ~ 150 km/s). applying theconclusions found in our previous work regarding the mechanism through whichthe broad component is produced, we associate the faint, broad emission withthe interaction of the hot, fast-flowing winds from the young star clusterswith cool clumps of ism material. this interaction generates turbulent mixinglayers on the surface of the clouds and the evaporation and/or ablation ofmaterial into the outflow. under this interpretation, the extent of the broadcomponent region may indicate an important transition point in the outflow,where ordered expansion begins to dominate over turbulent motion. in thiscontext, we present a multi-wavelength discussion of the evolutionary state ofthe outflow.

1302.6598	the snapshot hubble u-band cluster survey (shucs). i. survey description  and first application to the mixed star cluster population of ngc 4041	we present the snapshot hubble u-band cluster survey (shucs), a project aimedat characterizing the star cluster populations of ten nearby galaxies (d&lt;23mpc, half within 12 mpc) through new f336w (u band equivalent) imaging fromwfc3, and archival bvi-equivalent data with hst. completing the ubvi baselinereduces the age-extinction degeneracy of optical colours, thus enabling themeasurement of reliable ages and masses for the thousands of clusters coveredby our survey. the sample consists chiefly of face-on spiral galaxies at lowinclination, in various degrees of isolation (isolated, in group, merging), andincludes two agn hosts. this first paper outlines the survey itself, theobservational datasets, the analysis methods, and presents a proof-of-conceptstudy of the large-scale properties and star cluster population of ngc 4041, amassive sabc galaxy at a distance of 23 mpc, and part of a small grouping ofsix giant members. we resolve two structural components with distinct stellarpopulations, a morphology more akin to merging and interacting systems. we alsofind strong evidence of a truncated, schechter-type mass function, and asimilarly segmented luminosity function. these results indicate that binningmust erase much of the substructure present in the mass and luminosityfunctions, and might account for the conflicting reports on the intrinsic shapeof these functions in the literature. we also note a tidal feature in theoutskirts of the galaxy in galex uv imaging, and follow it up with acomprehensive multi-wavelength study of ngc 4041 and its parent group. wededuce a minor merger as a likely cause of its segmented structure and theobserved pattern of a radially decreasing star formation rate. we propose thatcombining the study of star cluster populations with broad-band metrics is notonly advantageous, but often easily achievable through archival datasets.

1306.4813	optical ifu observations of gas pillars surrounding the super star  cluster ngc 3603	we present optical integral field unit (ifu) observations of two gas pillarssurrounding the galactic young massive star cluster ngc 3603. the high s/n andspectral resolution of these data have allowed us to accurately quantify theh-alpha, [nii] and [sii] emission line shapes, and we find a mixture of broad(fwhm~70-100 km/s) and narrow (&lt;50 km/s) components. the broad components arefound close to the edges of both pillars, suggesting that they originate inturbulent mixing layers (tmls) driven by the effect of the star cluster wind.both pillars exhibit surprisingly high ionized gas densities of &gt;10000 cm-3. inone pillar we found that these high densities are only found in the narrowcomponent, implying it must originate from deeper within the pillar than thebroad component. from this, together with our kinematical data, we concludethat the narrow component traces a photoevaporation flow, and that the tmlforms at the interface with the hot wind. on the pillar surfaces we find aconsistent offset in radial velocity between the narrow (brighter) componentsof h-alpha and [nii] of ~5-8 km/s, for which we were unable to find asatisfactory explanation. we urge the theoretical community to simulatemechanical and radiative cloud interactions in more detail to address the manyunanswered questions raised by this study.

1312.0706	shocks and star formation in stephan's quintet. i. gemini spectroscopy  of h{\alpha}-bright knots	we present a gemini-gmos spectroscopic study of hst-selectedh{\alpha}-emitting regions in stephan's quintet (hcg 92), a nearby compactgalaxy group, with the aim of disentangling the processes of shock-inducedheating and star formation in its intra-group medium. the $\approx$40 sourcesare distributed across the system, but most densely concentrated in the$\sim$kpc-long shock region. their spectra neatly divide them into narrow- andand broad-line emitters, and we decompose the latter into three or moreemission peaks corresponding to spatial elements discernible in hst imaging.the emission line ratios of the two populations of h{\alpha}-emitters confirmtheir nature as h ii regions (90% of the sample) or molecular gas heated by ashock-front propagating at $\lesssim$300 km/s. their redshift distributionreveals interesting three-dimensional structure with respect to gas-phasebaryons, with no h ii regions associated with shocked gas, no shocked regionsin the intruder galaxy ngc 7318b, and a sharp boundary between shocks and starformation. we conclude that star formation is inhibited substantially, if notentirely, in the shock region. attributing those h ii regions projected againstthe shock to the intruder, we find a lopsided distribution of star formation inthis galaxy, reminiscent of pile-up regions in models of interacting galaxies.the h{\alpha} luminosities imply mass outputs, star formation rates, andefficiencies similar to nearby star-forming regions. two large knots are anexception to this, being comparable in stellar output to the prolific 30doradus region. we also examine stephan's quintet in the context of compactgalaxy group evolution, as a paradigm for intermittent star formation historiesin the presence of a rich, x-ray emitting intra-group medium.

astro-ph;0008221	physical parameters of erupting luminous blue variables: ngc 2363-v1  caught in the act	a quantitative study of the luminous blue variable ngc 2363-v1 in themagellanic galaxy ngc 2366 (d = 3.44 mpc) is presented, based on ultravioletand optical hst/stis spectroscopy. contemporary wfpc2 and wht imaging reveals amodest v-band brightness increase of ~ 0.2 mag per year between 1996 januaryand 1997 november, reaching v=17.4 mag, corresponding to mv=-10.4 mag.subsequently, v1 underwent a similar decrease in v-band brightness, togetherwith a uv brightening of 0.35 mag from 1997 november to 1999 november.  the optical spectrum of v1 is dominated by h emission lines, with fe ii, he iand na i also detected. in the ultraviolet, a forest of fe absorption featuresand numerous absorption lines typical of mid-b supergiants are observed. from aspectral analysis with the non-lte, line-blanketed code of hillier &amp; miller(1998), we derive stellar parameters of t*=11kk, r*=420ro, log(l/lo)=6.35during 1997 november, and t*=13kk, r*=315ro, log(l/lo)=6.4 for 1999 july. thewind properties of v1 are also exceptional, with mdot ~ 4.4 x 10e-4 mo/yr and$v_{\infty} ~ $300 km/s, allowing for a clumped wind (filling factor = 0.3),and assuming h/he ~ 4 by number.  the presence of fe lines in the uv and optical spectrum of v1 permits anestimate of the heavy elemental abundance of ngc 2363 from our spectralsynthesis. although some deficiencies remain, allowance for charge exchangereactions in our calculations supports a smc-like metallicity, that haspreviously been determined for ngc 2363 from nebular oxygen diagnostics.  considering a variety of possible progenitor stars, v1 has definitelyundergone a giant eruption, with a substantial increase in stellar luminosity,radius, and almost certainly mass-loss rate.

astro-ph;0104429	m82-f: a doomed super star cluster?	we present high dispersion echelle spectroscopy of the very luminous, youngsuper star cluster (ssc) `f' in m82, obtained with the 4.2-m william herscheltelescope (wht), for the purpose of deriving its dynamical mass and assessingwhether it will survive to become an old globular cluster. we measure a stellarvelocity dispersion of 13.4 +/- 0.7 km/s, a projected half-light radius of 2.8+/- 0.3 pc from archival hst/wfpc2 images, and derive a dynamical mass of 1.2+/- 0.1 x 10^6 solar masses, demonstrating that m82-f is a very massive,compact cluster. we determine that the current visual luminosity-to-mass ratiofor m82-f is 45 +/- 13. comparison with spectral synthesis models shows thatthe visual luminosity-to-mass ratio is a factor of 5 higher than that predictedfor a standard kroupa (2001) initial mass function (imf) at the well-determinedage for m82-f of 60 +/- 20 myr. this high value of the visualluminosity-to-mass ratio indicates a deficit of low mass stars in m82-f; thecurrent mass function (mf) evidently is `top-heavy'. we find that a lower masscutoff of 2-3 solar masses is required to match the observations for a mf witha slope of 2.3. since the cluster apparently lacks long-lived low mass stars,it will not become an old globular cluster. we also derive up-datedluminosity-to-mass ratios for the younger sscs ngc 1569a and ngc 1705-1. wediscuss the implications of our findings in the context of large scale imfvariations; with the present data the top-heavy mf could reflect a local masssegregation effect during the birth of the cluster.

astro-ph;0301454	quantitative spectroscopy of o stars at low metallicity. o dwarfs in ngc  346	we present the results of a detailed uv and optical spectral analysis of theproperties of 6 dwarf o-type stars in the smc h ii region ngc 346. stellarparameters, chemical abundances, and wind parameters have been determined usingnlte line blanketed models calculated with the photospheric code, tlusty, andwith the wind code, cmfgen. the results, in particular iron abundances,obtained with the two nlte codes compare very favorably, demonstrating thatbasic photospheric parameters of o dwarfs can be reliably determined using nltestatic model atmospheres. the two nlte codes require a microturbulent velocityto match the observed spectra. our results hint at a decrease of themicroturbulent velocity from early o stars to late o stars. similarly toseveral recent studies of galactic, lmc and smc stars, we derive effectivetemperatures lower than predicted from the widely-used relation betweenspectral type and teff, resulting in lower stellar luminosities and lowerionizing fluxes. from evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram, we find an age of3 10^6 years for ngc 346. a majority of the stars in our sample revealcno-cycle processed material at their surface during the ms stage, indicatingthus fast stellar rotation and/or very efficient mixing processes. we obtain anoverall metallicity, z = 0.2 zsun, in good agreement with other recent analysesof smc stars. the derived mass loss rate of the three most luminous starsagrees with recent theoretical predictions. however, the three other stars ofour sample reveal very weak wind signatures. we obtain mass loss rates that aresignificantly lower than 10^{-8} msun/yr, which is below the predictions ofradiative line-driven wind theory by an order of magnitude or more.

astro-ph;0404422	cirpass near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy of massive star  clusters in the starburst galaxy ngc 1140	[abridged] we analyse near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of thecentral starburst region of ngc 1140, obtained at the gemini-south telescopeequipped with cirpass. our ~1.45-1.67 um wavelength coverage includes thebright [fe ii] emission line, as well as high-order brackett (hydrogen) lines.while strong [fe ii] emission, thought to originate in the thermal shocksassociated with supernova remnants, is found throughout the galaxy, both br12-4 and br 14-4 emission, and weak co(6,3) absorption, is predominantlyassociated with the northern starburst region. the brackett lines originatefrom recombination processes occurring on smaller scales in (young) hiiregions. the time-scale associated with strong [fe ii] emission implies thatmost of the recent star-formation activity in ngc 1140 was induced in the past35-55 myr. based on the spatial distributions of the [fe ii] versus brackettline emission, we conclude that a galaxy-wide starburst was induced severaltens of myr ago, with more recent starburst activity concentrated around thenorthern starburst region. this scenario is (provisionally) confirmed by ouranalysis of the spectral energy distributions of the compact, young massivestar clusters (ymcs) detected in new and archival broad-band hst images. theymc ages in ngc 1140 are all &lt;= 20 myr, consistent with independentlydetermined estimates of the galaxy's starburst age, while there appears to bean age difference between the northern and southern ymc complexes in the senseexpected from our cirpass analysis. our photometric mass estimates of the ngc1140 ymcs, likely upper limits, are comparable to those of the highest-massgalactic globular clusters and to spectroscopically confirmed masses of(compact) ymcs in other starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0605095	hst/stis spectroscopy of five super star clusters in the starburst  galaxy m82	we present optical spectroscopy obtained with the space telescope imagingspectrograph (stis) of five young massive star clusters in the starburst galaxym82. a detailed analysis is performed for one cluster `m82-a1' and itsimmediate environment in the starburst core. from hst archive images, we findthat it is elliptical with an effective radius of 3.0+/-0.5 pc and issurrounded by a compact (r=4.5+/-0.5 pc) h ii region. we determine the age andreddening of m82-a1 using synthetic spectra from population synthesis models byfitting both the continuum energy distribution and the depth of the balmerjump. we find an age of 6.4+/-0.5 myr and a photometric mass estimate of m=7-13x 10^5 solar masses. we associate its formation with the most recent starburstevent 4-6 myr ago. we find that the oxygen abundance of the h ii regionsurrounding m82-a1 is solar or slightly higher. the h ii region has a highpressure p/k = 1-2 x 10^7 cm^-3 k. the diffuse gas in region a has a slightlylower pressure, which together with the broad h alpha emission line width,suggests that both the thermal and turbulent pressures in the m82 starburstcore are unusually high. we discuss how this environment has affected theevolution of the cluster wind for m82-a1. we find that the high pressure mayhave caused the pressure-driven bubble to stall. we also obtain spectroscopicages for clusters b1-2 and b2-1 in the `fossil' starburst region and for theintermediate age clusters f and l. these are consistent with earlier studiesand demonstrate that star formation activity, sufficiently intense to producesuper star clusters, has been going on in m82 during the past gyr, perhaps indiscrete and localized episodes.

astro-ph;0609330	past and present star formation in the smc: ngc 346 and its neighborhood	in the quest of understanding how star formation occurs and propagates in thelow metallicity environment of the small magellanic cloud (smc), we acquireddeep f555w (~v), and f814w (~i) hst/acs images of the young and massive starforming region ngc 346. these images and their photometric analysis provide uswith a snapshot of the star formation history of the region. we find evidencefor star formation extending from ~10 gyr in the past until ~150 myr in thefield of the smc. the youngest stellar population (~3 +/- 1 myr) is associatedwith the ngc 346 cluster. it includes a rich component of low mass pre-mainsequence stars mainly concentrated in a number of sub-clusters, spatially co-located with co clumps previously detected by rubio et al. (2000). within ouranalysis uncertainties, these sub-clusters appear coeval with each other. themost massive stars appear concentrated in the central sub-clusters, indicatingpossible mass segregation. a number of embedded clusters are also observed.this finding, combined with the overall wealth of dust and gas, could implythat star formation is still active. an intermediate age star cluster, bs90,formed ~4.3 +/-0.1 gyr ago, is also present in the region. thus, this region ofthe smc has supported star formation with varying levels of intensity over muchof the cosmic time.

astro-ph;9601153	the chemical evolution of galaxies at high redshift	observations of absorption lines in the spectra of distant qsos offer a newapproach for tracking the evolution of normal galaxies from early epochs to thepresent day. the damped ly alpha systems are particularly suitable formeasuring the properties of what are likely to be the progenitors ofpresent-day luminous galaxies. we have recently concluded a long-term survey of30 damped absorbers (including eight from the literature) aimed at measuringthe metallicity and dust content of the universe from redshift z = 3.39 to0.69. the major conclusions are that the epoch of chemical enrichment ingalaxies may have begun at z = 2.5-3--corresponding to a look-back time of 14gyr--and that at z = 2 the typical metallicity was 1/15 of solar. there isclear evidence for the presence of interstellar dust at z = 2, although severalhigh-redshift galaxies, particularly the most metal-poor, appear to beessentially dust-free. we discuss the nature of the damped ly alpha galaxies inthe light of these and other new results.

0706.0543	a detailed study of the enigmatic cluster m82f	we present a detailed study of the stellar cluster m82f, using multi-bandhigh resolution hst imaging and deep ground based optical slit and integralfield spectroscopy. using the imaging we create colour maps of the cluster andsurrounding region in order to search for substructure. we find a large amountof substructure, which we interpret as the result of differential extinctionacross the projected face of the cluster. with this interpretation, we are ableto construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which isused to derive the intrinsic flux distribution. fitting cluster profiles (kingand eff) to the intrinsic images we find that the cluster is 15-30% larger thanprevious estimates, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation in thiscluster exists. using the optical spectra, we find that the age of m82f is60-80 myr and from its velocity conclude that the cluster is not physicallyassociated with a large hii region that it is projected upon, both in agreementwith previous studies. the reconstructed integral field maps show that thatmajority of the line emission comes from a nearby hii region. the spatialdependence of the line widths (implying the presence of multiplecomponents)measured corresponds to the extinction map derived from photometry,indicating that the gas/dust clouds responsible for the extinction are alsopartially ionised. even with the wealth of observations presented here, we donot find a conclusive solution to the problem of the high light-to-mass ratiopreviously found for this cluster and its possible top-heavy stellar imf.
