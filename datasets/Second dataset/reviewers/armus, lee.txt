0901.4774	strong water absorption in the dayside emission spectrum of the planet  hd 189733b	recent observations of the extrasolar planet hd 189733b did not reveal thepresence of water in the emission spectrum of the planet. yet models of such'hot jupiter' planets predict an abundance of atmospheric water vapour.validating and constraining these models is crucial for understanding thephysics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres in extreme environments.indications of the presence of water in the atmosphere of hd 189733b haverecently been found in transmission spectra, where the planet's atmosphereselectively absorbs the light of the parent star, and in broadband photometry.here we report on the detection of strong water absorption in a highsignal-to-noise, mid-infrared emission spectrum of the planet itself. we findboth a strong downturn in the flux ratio below 10 microns and discrete spectralfeatures that are characteristic of strong absorption by water vapour. thedifferences between these and previous observations are significant and admitthe possibility that predicted planetary-scale dynamical weather structuresmight alter the emission spectrum over time. models that match the observedspectrum and the broadband photometry suggest that heat distribution from thedayside to the night side is weak. reconciling this with the high night sidetemperature will require a better understanding of atmospheric circulation orpossible additional energy sources.

0706.2164	spitzer mid-to-far-infrared flux densities of distant galaxies	we study the infrared (ir) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deepspitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. our primary interest is to improve theconstraints on the total ir luminosities, l(ir), of these galaxies. we combinethe spitzer data in the southern extended chandra deep field with ak-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile. we used a stacking analysis to measurethe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 galaxies as afunction of 24 micron flux density, x-ray activity, and rest-frame near-ircolor. galaxies with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 and s(24)=53-250 micro-jy have l(ir) derivedfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of thosederived from the 24 micron flux densities only. however, l(ir) derived from theaverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy and1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron fluxdensity by factors of 2-10. galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy have s(70)/s(24)flux ratios comparable to sources with x-ray detections or red rest-frame ircolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by agn may contribute to thehigh 24 micron emission. based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 have l(ir) &lt; 6 x 10^12solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to &lt; 1000solar masses per year. this suggests that high redshift galaxies may havesimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.objects with l(ir) &gt; 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with asurface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6mpc^-3 over 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

0902.4704	the sins survey: broad emission lines in high-redshift star-forming  galaxies	high signal-to-noise, representative spectra of star-forming galaxies at z~2,obtained via stacking, reveal a high-velocity component underneath the narrowh-alpha and [nii] emission lines. when modeled as a single gaussian, this broadcomponent has fwhm &gt; 1500 km/s; when modeled as broad wings on the h-alpha and[nii] features, it has fwhm &gt; 500 km/s. this feature is preferentially found inthe more massive and more rapidly star-forming systems, which also tend to beolder and larger galaxies. we interpret this emission as evidence of eitherpowerful starburst-driven galactic winds or active supermassive black holes. ifgalactic winds are responsible for the broad emission, the observed luminosityand velocity of this gas imply mass outflow rates comparable to the starformation rate. on the other hand, if the broad line regions of active blackholes account for the broad feature, the corresponding black holes masses areestimated to be an order of magnitude lower than those predicted by localscaling relations, suggesting a delayed assembly of supermassive black holeswith respect to their host bulges.

0903.1272	a complete view of galaxy evolution: panchromatic luminosity functions  and the generation of metals	when and how did galaxies form and their metals accumulate? over the lastdecade, this has moved from an archeological question to a live investigation:there is now a broad picture of the evolution of galaxies in dark matter halos:their masses, stars, metals and supermassive blackholes. galaxies have beenfound and studied in which these formation processes are taking place mostvigorously, all the way back in cosmic time to when the intergalactic medium(igm) was still largely neutral. however, the details of how and why theinterstellar medium (ism) in distant galaxies cools, is processed, recycled andenriched in metals by stars, and fuels active galactic nuclei (agns) remainuncertain. in particular, the cooling of gas to fuel star formation, and thechemistry and physics of the most intensely active regions is hidden from viewat optical wavelengths, but can be seen and diagnosed at mid- &amp; far-infrared(ir) wavelengths. rest-frame ir observations are important first to identifythe most luminous, interesting and important galaxies, secondly to quantifyaccurately their total luminosity, and finally to use spectroscopy to trace theconditions in the molecular and atomic gas out of which stars form. in order tomap out these processes over the full range of environments and large-scalestructures found in the universe - from the densest clusters of galaxies to theemptiest voids - we require tools for deep, large area surveys, of millions ofgalaxies out to z~5, and for detailed follow-up spectroscopy. the necessarytools can be realized technically. here, we outline the requirements forgathering the crucial information to build, validate and challenge models ofgalaxy evolution.

0903.1495	the extreme star formation activity of arp299 revealed by spitzer irs  spectral mapping	we present spitzer/irs spectral mapping observations of the luminous infraredgalaxy (lirg) arp299 (ic694 + ngc3690) covering the central 45arcsec ~ 9kpc.the integrated mid-ir spectrum of arp299 is similar to that of local starburstsdespite its strongly interacting nature and high infrared luminosity, l_ir ~6x10^11 lsun. this is explained because the star formation (probed by e.g. high[neiii]15.56micron/[neii]micron line ratios) is spread across at least 6-8kpc.moreover, a large fraction of this star formation is taking place in youngregions of moderate mid-ir optical depths such as the c+c' complex in theoverlap region between the two galaxies and in hii regions in the disks of thegalaxies. it is only source a, the nuclear region of ic694, that shows thetypical mid-ir characteristics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, l_ir&gt; 10^12 lsun), that is, very compact (less than 1kpc) and dust-enshrouded starformation resulting in a deep silicate feature and moderate equivalent widthsof the pahs. the nuclear region of ngc3690, known as source b1, hosts alow-luminosity agn and is surrounded by regions of star formation. although thehigh excitation [nev]14.32micron line typical of agn is not detected in b1, itsupper limit is consistent with the value expected from the x-ray luminosity.the agn emission is detected in the form of a strong hot dust component thataccounts for 80-90% of the 6micron luminosity of b1. the similarity between thearp299 integrated mid-ir spectrum and those of high-z ulirgs suggests thatarp299 may represent a local example, albeit with lower ir luminosity andpossibly higher metallicity, of the star-formation processes occurring athigh-z.

0903.4017	mid-infrared spectroscopy of submillimeter galaxies: extended star  formation in massive high redshift galaxies	we used the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) to study the mid-irproperties and investigate the energetics of 24 submillimeter galaxies (smgs).this is the largest sample of smgs observed with spitzer irs and covers thefull extent of properties of the radio-identified population of smgs in theredshift range of z ~ 0.65-3.2. we observe broad emission features frompolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) in more than 80% of our sample. we findthat the median mid-ir spectrum is well described by a starburst component withan additional power law, fnu ~ nu^-2, likely representing a &lt; 32% agncontribution to the bolometric luminosity. our results thus confirm thatstarburst activity dominates the bolometric luminosity in smgs. we find thatsmgs show weaker silicate absorption at 9.7um than local ulirgs. we also findstronger 6.2um pah emission in smgs (relative to the 7.7um pah feature) than inlocal nuclear starbursts, which may be attributed to lower extinction by icealong the line of sight to smgs. this suggests that the continuum and pahemitting regions of smgs are less obscured than in local starbursts andsimilarly luminous low-redshift ulirgs. we interpret these results as evidencefor a more extended distribution of cool and warm dust in smgs compared to themore compact emitting regions in local ulirgs and starbursts. together theseresults suggest that smgs are not simple high-redshift analogs of local ulirgsor nuclear starbursts, but instead they appear to have star formation whichresembles that seen in less-extreme star-forming environments at z~0 --suggesting their intense activity is distributed across a far larger regionthan the ~1-kpc nuclear bursts in local ulirgs.

0905.4274	strong pah emission from z~2 ulirgs	using the infrared spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope, wepresent low-resolution (64 &lt; lambda / dlambda &lt; 124), mid-infrared (20-38micron) spectra of 23 high-redshift ulirgs detected in the bootes field of thenoao deep wide-field survey. all of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24micron) &gt; 0.5 mjy; 2) r-[24] &gt; 14 vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6micron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into spitzer's 3-8 micron iracbands. of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs),usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. the pah features indicateredshifts in the range 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, with a mean of &lt;z&gt;=1.96 and a dispersionof 0.30. based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infraredluminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. our results confirmprevious indications that the rest-frame 1.6 micron stellar bump can beefficiently used to select highly obscured starforming galaxies at z~2, andthat the fraction of starburst-dominated ulirgs increases to faint 24 micronflux densities. using local templates, we find that the observed narrowredshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 micron detectability ofpah-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. we can analogously explain thebroader redshift distribution of spitzer-detected agn-dominated ulirgs based onthe shapes of their seds. finally, we conclude that z~2 sources with adetectable 1.6 micron stellar opacity feature lack sufficient agn emission toveil the 7.7 micron pah band.

0910.1363	an infrared comparison of type-1 and type-2 quasars	we model the optical to far-infrared seds of a sample of six type-1 and sixtype-2 quasars selected in the mid-infrared. the objects in our sample arematched in mid-ir luminosity and selected based on their spitzer irac colors.we obtained new targeted spitzer irs and mips observations and used archivalphotometry to examine the optical to far-ir seds. we investigate whether theobserved differences between samples are consistent with orientation-basedunification schemes. the type-1 objects show significant emission at 3 micron.they do not show strong pah emission and have less far-ir emission on averagewhen compared to the type-2 objects. the seds of the type-2 objects show a wideassortment of silicate features, ranging from weak emission to deep silicateabsorption. some also show strong pah features. in comparison, silicate is onlyseen in emission in the type-1 objects. this is consistent with some of thetype-2s being reddened by a foreground screen of cooler dust, perhaps in thehost galaxy itself. we investigate the agn contribution to the far-ir emissionand find it to be significant. we also estimate the star formation rate foreach of the objects by integrating the modeled far-ir flux and compare thiswith the sfr found from pah emission. we find the type-2 quasars have a higheraverage sfr than the type-1 quasars based on both methods, though this could bedue to differences in bolometric luminosities of the objects. while we findpronounced differences between the two types of objects, none of them areinconsistent with orientation-based unification schemes.

1008.3160	optical vs. infrared studies of dusty galaxies and agn: (i) nebular  emission lines	optical nebular emission lines are commonly used to estimate the starformation rate of galaxies and the black hole accretion rate of their centralactive nucleus. the accuracy of the conversion from line strengths to physicalproperties depends upon the accuracy to which the lines can be corrected fordust attenuation. for studies of single galaxies with normal amounts of dust,most dust corrections result in the same derived properties within the errors.however, for statistical studies of populations of galaxies, or for studies ofgalaxies with higher dust contents such as might be found in some classes of"transition" galaxies, significant uncertainty arises from the dust attenuationcorrection. we compare the strength of the predominantly unobscured mid-ir[neii]15.5um + [neiii]12.8um emission lines to the optical h alpha emissionlines in four samples of galaxies: (i) ordinary star forming galaxies, (ii)optically selected dusty galaxies, (iii) ulirgs, (iv) seyfert 2 galaxies. weshow that a single dust attenuation curve applied to all samples can correct halpha emission for dust attenuation to a factor better than 2. similarly, wecompare mid-ir [oiv] and optical [oiii] luminosities to find that [oiii] can becorrected to a factor better than 3. this shows that the total dust attenuationsuffered by the agn narrow line region is not significantly different to thatsuffered by the starforming hii regions in the galaxy. we provide explicit dustattenuation corrections, together with errors, for [oii], [oiii] and h alpha.the best-fit average attenuation curve is slightly greyer than the milky-wayextinction law, indicating either that external galaxies have slightlydifferent typical dust properties to the milky way, or that there is asignificant contribution from scattering. finally, we uncover an intriguingcorrelation between silicate absorption and balmer decrement.

1011.6098	dust attenuation in uv-selected starbursts at high redshift and their  local counterparts: implications for the cosmic star formation rate density	we present a new analysis of the dust obscuration in starburst galaxies atlow and high redshift. this study is motivated by our unique sample of the mostextreme uv-selected starburst galaxies in the nearby universe (z&lt;0.3), found tobe good analogs of high-redshift lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in most of theirphysical properties. we find that the dust properties of the lyman breakanalogs (lbas) are consistent with the relation derived previously by meurer etal. (m99) that is commonly used to dust-correct star formation ratemeasurements at a very wide range of redshifts. we directly compare our resultswith high redshift samples (lbgs, bzk, and sub-mm galaxies at z=2-3) having irdata either from spitzer or herschel. the attenuation in typical lbgs at z=2-3and lbas is very similar. because lbas are much better analogs to lbgs comparedto previous local star-forming samples, including m99, the practice ofdust-correcting the sfrs of high redshift galaxies based on the localcalibration is now placed on a much more solid ground. we illustrate theimportance of this result by showing how the locally calibrated relationbetween uv measurements and extinction is used to estimate the integrated,dust-corrected star formation rate density at z=2-6.

1012.2174	modeling ir spectral energy distributions: a pilot study of starburst  parameters and silicate absorption curves for some goals galaxies	this paper describes a pilot study into the spectral energy distribution(sed) fitting and the derivation of physical parameters for 19 galaxiesobserved as part of the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) surveyas observed with the \emph{spitzer space telescope}. for this we have used thepan-spectral fitting tools developed in a series of papers by dopita and hisco-workers. we show that the standard lee and draine `astronomical silicate'model cannot provide a good fit to the silicate absorption features as observedin the heavily dust-extinguished ($a_{\rm v} \sim 50$mag.) starbursts. we havederived an empirical fit to the `starburst silicate' absorption in theseobjects. this absorption curve is consistent with the silicate grains beingsystematically larger in starburst environments than in the local galacticinterstellar medium. we demonstrate the sensitivity of the sed fitting to eachof the fitted parameters, and derive these parameters for those galaxies whichdo not have an embedded agn. this technique is simple and provides reasonablyrobust and uniform parameters for the starburst, especially as far as the starformation rate, population of old stars, compactness of the starburst regionand total foreground extinction are concerned. however, the chemical abundancesand the optical extinction cannot be reliably determined by this analysis, andoptical seds will also be required to provide a complete characterization ofthe starburst region and of the surrounding galaxy.

1101.4941	mid-infrared properties of oh megamaser host galaxies. i: spitzer irs  low- and high-resolution spectroscopy	we present mid-infrared spectra and photometry from the infrared spectrographon the spitzer space telescope for 51 oh megamasers (ohms), along with 15galaxies confirmed to have no megamaser emission above l_oh = 10^2.3 l_sun. themajority of galaxies display moderate-to-deep 9.7 um amorphous silicateabsorption, with ohm galaxies showing stronger average absorption and steeper20-30 um continuum emission than non-masing galaxies. emission from multiplepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), especially at 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 um,is detected in almost all systems. fine-structure atomic emission (including[ne ii], [ne iii], [s iii], and [s iv]) and multiple h2 rotational transitionsare observed in more than 90% of the sample. a subset of galaxies show emissionfrom rarer atomic lines, such as [ne v], [o iv], and [fe ii]. 50% of the ohmsshow absorption from water ice and hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains (hacs),while absorption features from co2, hcn, c2h2, and crystalline silicates arealso seen in several ohms. column densities of oh derived from 34.6 um ohabsorption are similar to those derived from 1667 mhz oh absorption innon-masing galaxies, indicating that the abundance of masing molecules issimilar for both samples. this data paper presents full mid-infrared spectrafor each galaxy, along with measurements of line fluxes and equivalent widths,absorption feature depths, and spectral indices.

1101.4946	mid-infrared properties of oh megamaser host galaxies. ii: analysis and  modeling of the maser environment	we present a comparison of spitzer irs data for 51 oh megamaser (ohm) hostsand 15 non-masing ulirgs. 10-25% of ohms show evidence for the presence of anagn, significantly lower than the estimated agn fraction from previous opticaland radio studies. non-masing ulirgs have a higher agn fraction (50-95%) thanohms, although some galaxies in both samples show evidence of co-existingstarbursts and agn. radiative transfer models of the dust environment revealthat non-masing galaxies tend to have clumpy dust geometries commonlyassociated with agn, while ohms have deeper absorption consistent with asmooth, thick dust shell. statistical analyses show that the major differencesbetween masing and non-masing ulirgs in the mid-ir relate to the optical depthand dust temperature, which we measure using the 9.7 um silicate depth and30-20 um spectral slope from the irs data. dust temperatures of 40-80 k derivedfrom the irs data are consistent with predictions of oh pumping models and witha minimum t_dust required for maser production. the best-fit dust opacities({\tau}_v ~ 100 - 400), however, are nearly an order of magnitude larger thanthose predicted for oh inversion, and suggest that modifications to the modelmay be required. these diagnostics offer the first detailed test of an ohmpumping model based only on the properties of its host galaxy and provideimportant restrictions on the physical conditions relevant to ohm production.

1103.3711	extended schmidt law: role of existing stars in current star formation	we propose an "extended schmidt law" with explicit dependence of the starformation efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) on the stellar mass surface density. thisrelation has a power-law index of 0.48+-0.04 and an 1-sigma observed scatter onthe sfe of 0.4 dex, which holds over 5 orders of magnitude in the stellardensity for individual global galaxies including various types especially thelow-surface-brightness (lsb) galaxies that deviate significantly from thekennicutt-schmidt law. when applying it to regions at sub-kpc resolution of asample of 12 spiral galaxies, the extended schmidt law not only holds for lsbregions but also shows significantly smaller scatters both within and acrossgalaxies compared to the kennicutt-schmidt law. we argue that this new relationpoints to the role of existing stars in regulating the sfe, thus encodingbetter the star formation physics. comparison with physical models of starformation recipes shows that the extended schmidt law can be reproduced by somemodels including gas free-fall in a stellar-gravitational potential andpressure-supported star formation. by implementing this new law into theanalytic model of gas accretion in lambda cdm, we show that it can re-producethe observed main sequence of star-forming galaxies (a relation between the sfrand stellar mass) from z=0 up to z=2.

0709.3119	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of 70um-selected distant luminous  infrared galaxies	we present mid-infrared spectroscopy obtained with the spitzer spacetelescope of a sample of 11 optically faint, infrared luminous galaxiesselected from a spitzer mips 70um imaging survey of the ndwfs bootes field.these are the first spitzer irs spectra presented of distant 70um-selectedsources. all the galaxies lie at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.3 and have very largeinfrared luminosities of l_ir~ 0.1-17 x 10^12 solar luminosities. seven of thegalaxies exhibit strong emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs). the average irs spectrum of these sources ischaracteristic of classical starburst galaxies, but with much larger infraredluminosities. the pah luminosities of l(7.7) ~ 0.4 - 7 x 10^11 solarluminosities imply star formation rates of ~ 40 - 720 solar masses per year.four of the galaxies show deep 9.7um silicate absorption features and nosignificant pah emission features (6.2um equivalent widths &lt; 0.03um). the largeinfrared luminosities and low f70/f24 flux density ratios suggests that thesesources have agn as the dominant origin of their large mid-infraredluminosities, although deeply embedded but luminous starbursts cannot be ruledout. if the absorbed sources are agn-dominated, a significant fraction of allfar-infrared bright, optically faint sources may be dominated by agn.

1104.0687	the mid-ir luminosity function at z&lt;0.3 from 5muses: understanding the  star-formation/agn balance from a spectroscopic view	we present rest-frame 15 and 24 um luminosity functions and the correspondingstar-forming luminosity functions at z&lt;0.3 derived from the 5muses sample.spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for ~98% of the objects and themedian redshift is ~0.12. the 5-35 um irs spectra allow us to estimateaccurately the luminosities and build the luminosity functions. using acombination of starburst and quasar templates, we quantify the star-formationand agn contributions in the mid-ir sed. we then compute the star-formationluminosity functions at 15 um and 24 um, and compare with the total 15 um and24 um luminosity functions. when we remove the contribution of agn, the brightend of the luminosity function exhibits a strong decline, consistent with theexponential cutoff of a schechter function. integrating the differentialluminosity function, we find that the fractional contribution by star formationto the energy density is 58% at 15 um and 78% at 24 um, while it goes up to~86% when we extrapolate our mid-ir results to the total ir luminosity density.we confirm that the active galactic nuclei play more important rolesenergetically at high luminosities. finally, we compare our results with workat z~0.7 and confirm that evolution on both luminosity and density is requiredto explain the difference in the lfs at different redshifts.

1106.4022	the emission by dust and stars of nearby galaxies in the herschel  kingfish survey	using new far-infrared imaging from the herschel space observatory withancillary data from ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths, we estimate thetotal emission from dust and stars of 62 nearby galaxies in the kingfish surveyin a way that is as empirical and model-independent as possible. we collect andexploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions(seds) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated bydust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. by including spiredata, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previousanalyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dusttemperatures and masses.  the dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the seds, has arange of nearly three decades. the inclusion of spire data shows that estimatesbased on data not reaching these far-ir wavelengths are biased low. we findthat the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total irluminosity. we also find that dust/stellar flux ratios are related to gas-phasemetallicity, while the dust/stellar mass ratios are less so. the substantialscatter between dust/stellar flux and dust/stellar mass indicates that theformer is a poor proxy of the latter. comparing the dust/stellar flux ratiosand dust temperatures, we show that early-types tend to have slightly warmertemperatures than spiral galaxies, which may be due to more intenseinterstellar radiation fields, or to different dust grain compositions.finally, we show that early-types and early-type spirals have a strongcorrelation between the dust/stellar flux ratio and specific star formationrate, which suggests that the relatively bright far-ir emission of some ofthese galaxies is due to ongoing star formation and the radiation field fromolder stars.

1107.4109	complex radio spectral energy distributions in luminous and  ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we use the expanded very large array to image radio continuum emission fromlocal luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) in 1 ghzwindows centered at 4.7, 7.2, 29, and 36 ghz. this allows us to probe theintegrated radio spectral energy distribution (sed) of the most energeticgalaxies in the local universe. the 4-8 ghz flux densities agree well withprevious measurements. they yield spectral indices \alpha \approx -0.67 (wheref_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha) with \pm 0.15 (1\sigma) scatter, typical ofnonthermal (synchrotron) emission from star-forming galaxies. the contrast ofour 4-8 ghz data with literature 1.5 and 8.4 ghz flux densities gives furtherevidence for curvature of the radio sed of u/lirgs. the sed appears flatternear \sim 1 ghz than near \sim 6 ghz, suggesting significant optical deptheffects at the lower frequencies. the high frequency (28-37 ghz) flux densitiesare low compared to extrapolations from the 4-8 ghz data. we confirm and extendto higher frequency a previously observed deficit of high frequency radioemission for luminous starburst galaxies.

1107.5958	the spatial extent of (u)lirgs in the mid-infrared. ii. feature emission	we present results from the second part of our analysis of the extendedmid-infrared (mir) emission of the great observatories all-sky lirg survey(goals) sample based on 5-14 micron low-resolution spectra obtained with theirs on spitzer. we calculate the fraction of extended emission as a function ofwavelength for all galaxies in the sample, fee_lambda, and spatially separatethe mir spectrum of galaxies into their nuclear and extended components.  we find that the [neii] emission line is as compact as the hot dust mircontinuum, while the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission is moreextended. the 6.2 and 7.7 micron pah emission is more compact than that of the11.3 micron pah, which is consistent with the formers being enhanced in a moreionized medium. the presence of an agn or a powerful nuclear starburstincreases the compactness of the hot dust mir continuum, but has a negligibleeffect on the spatial extent of the pah emission on kpc-scales. globally, thespectra of the extended emission component are homogeneous for all galaxies ingoals. this suggests that the physical properties of star formation takingplace at distances farther than 1.5 kpc from the nuclei of (u)lirgs are verysimilar, resembling local star-forming galaxies with l_ir &lt; 10^11 lsun, as wellas star formation-dominated ulirgs at z~2. in contrast, the mir spectra of thenuclear component of local (u)lirgs are very diverse. this implies that theobserved variety of their integrated mir properties arise, on average, onlyfrom the processes that are taking place in their cores.

1204.6659	luminous infrared galaxies with the submillimeter array. iii. the dense  kiloparsec molecular concentrations of arp 299	we have used high resolution (~2.3") observations of the local (d = 46 mpc)luminous infrared galaxy arp 299 to map out the physical properties of themolecular gas which provides the fuel for its extreme star formation activity.the 12co j=3-2, 12co j=2-1 and 13co j=2-1 lines were observed with thesubmillimeter array and the short spacings of the 12co j=2-1 and j=3-2observations have been recovered using james clerk maxwell telescope singledish observations. we use the radiative transfer code radex to estimate thephysical properties (density, column density and temperature) of the differentregions in this system. the radex solutions of the two galaxy nuclei, ic 694and ngc 3690, are consistent with a wide range of gas components, from warmmoderately dense gas with t_{kin} &gt; 30 k and n(h_{2}) ~ 0.3 - 3 x 10^{3}cm^{-3} to cold dense gas with t_{kin} ~ 10-30 k and n(h_{2}) &gt; 3 x 10^{3}cm^{-3}. the overlap region is shown to have a better constrained solution witht_{\rm{kin}}$ ~ 10-50 k and n(h_{2}) ~ 1-30 x 10^{3} cm^{-3}. we estimate thegas masses and star formation rates of each region in order to derive moleculargas depletion times. the depletion times of all regions (20-60 myr) are foundto be about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of normal spiral galaxies.this rapid depletion time can probably be explained by a high fraction of densegas on kiloparsec scales in arp 299. we estimate the co-to-h_{2} factor,\alpha_{co} to be 0.4 \pm 0.3 (3 x 10^{-4}/ x_{co}) m_{sol} (k km s^{-1}pc^{2})^{-1} for the overlap region. this value agrees well with valuesdetermined previously for more advanced merger systems.

0711.1553	mid-infrared spectral diagnosis of submillimeter galaxies	we present deep mid-infrared spectroscopy with the spitzer space telescope of13 submillimeter galaxies (smgs) in the great observatories origins deep surveynorth (goods-n) field. we find strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission in all of our targets which allows us to measure mid-ir spectroscopicredshifts and place constraints on the contribution from star formation andactive galactic nuclei (agn) activity to the mid-ir emission. in the highsignal-to-noise ratio composite spectrum of smgs, we find that the hot dustcontinuum from an agn contributes at most 30% of the mid-ir luminosity. we findthat the mid-ir properties of smgs are distinct from those of 24 micron-selected ulirgs at z~2; the former are predominantly dominated by starformation while the latter are a more heterogeneous sample with many showingsignificant agn activity. we fit the irs spectrum and the mid-ir to radiophotometry of smgs with template spectral energy distributions to determine thebest estimate of the total infrared luminosity from star formation. while manysmgs contain an agn as evinced by their x-ray properties, our multi-wavelengthanalysis shows that the total infrared luminosity, lir, in smgs, is dominatedby star formation and not agn activity. we find that high redshift smgs lie onthe relation between lir and lpah6.2 (or lpah7.7 or lpah11.3) that has beenestablished for local starburst galaxies. this suggests that pah luminosity canbe used as a proxy for the star formation rate in smgs. smgs are consistentwith being a short lived cool phase in a massive merger. although there appearsto be an agn present in many smgs, it does not appear to have become strongenough to heat the dust and dominate the mid- or far-infrared emission.

1209.1611	spectral energy distributions of local luminous and ultraluminous  infrared galaxies	luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ((u)lirgs) are the most extremestar forming galaxies in the universe. the local (u)lirgs provide a uniqueopportunity to study their multi-wavelength properties in detail for comparisonto their more numerous counterparts at high redshifts. we present common largeaperture photometry at radio through x-ray wavelengths, and spectral energydistributions (seds) for a sample of 53 nearby lirgs and 11 ulirgs spanning log(lir/lsun) = 11.14-12.57 from the flux-limited great observatories all-sky lirgsurvey (goals). the seds for all objects are similar in that they show a broad,thermal stellar peak and a dominant fir thermal dust peak, where nulnu(60um) /nulnu(v) increases from ~2-30 with increasing lir. when normalized atiras-60um, the largest range in the luminosity ratio,r(lambda)=log[nulnu(lambda)/nulnu(60um)] observed over the full sample is seenin the hard x-rays (hx=2-10 kev). a small range is found in the radio (1.4ghz),where the mean ratio is largest. total infrared luminosities, lir(8-1000um),dust temperatures, and dust masses were computed from fitting thermal dustemission modified blackbodies to the mid-infrared (mir) through submillimeterseds. the new results reflect an overall ~0.02 dex lower luminosity than theoriginal iras values. total stellar masses were computed by fitting stellarpopulation synthesis models to the observed near-infrared (nir) throughultraviolet (uv) seds. mean stellar masses are found to be log(m/msun) =10.79+/-0.40. star formation rates have been determined from the infrared(sfr_ir~45msun/yr) and from the monochromatic uv luminosities(sfr_uv~1.3msun/yr), respectively. multiwavelength agn indicators have be usedto select putative agn: about 60% of the ulirgs would have been classified asan agn by at least one of the selection criteria.

1210.1644	the 3.3 micron pah emission as a star formation rate indicator	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features dominate themid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and can be useful to calibratestar formation rates and diagnose ionized states of grains. however, the pah3.3 micron feature has not been studied as much as other pah features since itis weaker than others and resides outside of spitzer capability. in order todetect and calibrate the 3.3 micron pah emission and investigate its potentialas a star formation rate indicator, we carried out an akari mission program,akari mjy unbiased survey of extragalactic survey (amuses) and compare itssample with various literature samples. we obtained 2 ~5 micron low resolutionspectra of 20 flux-limited galaxies with mixed sed classes, which yields thedetection of the 3.3 micron pah emission from three out of 20 galaxies. for thecombined sample of amuses and literature samples, the 3.3 micron pahluminosities correlate with the infrared luminosities of star-forming galaxies,albeit with a large scatter (1.5 dex). the correlation appears to break down atthe domain of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), and the power of the3.3 micron pah luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity is hampered atlog[l(pah3.3)/(erg/sec)] &gt; -42.0. possible origins for this deviation in thecorrelation are discussed, including contribution from agn and stronglyobscured ysos, and the destruction of pah molecules in ulirgs.

1306.1831	probing the interstellar medium of z~1 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies  through interferometric observations of co and spitzer mid-infrared  spectroscopy	we explore the relationship between gas, dust and star formation in a sampleof 12 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at high redshift compared to asimilar sample of local galaxies. we present new co observations and/or spitzermid-ir spectroscopy for 6 70 micron selected galaxies at z~1 in order toquantify the properties of the molecular gas reservoir, the contribution of anactive galactic nuclei (agn) to the mid-ir luminosity and the star formationefficiency (sfe=lir/l'co). the mid-ir spectra show strong polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission and our spectral decomposition suggests that the agnmakes a minimal contribution (&lt;25%) to the mid-ir luminosity. the 70 micronselected ulirgs which we find to be spectroscopic close pairs, are observed tohave high sfe, similar to local ulirgs and high redshift submillimetergalaxies, consistent with enhanced ir luminosity due to an ongoing majormerger. combined with existing observations of local and high redshift ulirgs,we further compare the pah, ir and co luminosities. we show that the ratiolpah6.2/lir decreases with increasing ir luminosity for both local and highredshift galaxies but the trend for high redshift galaxies is shifted to higherir luminosities; the average lpah6.2/lir ratio at a given lir is ~3 timeshigher at high redshift. when we normalize by the molecular gas, we find thistrend to be uniform for galaxies at all redshifts and that the molecular gas iscorrelated with the pah dust emission.the similar trends seen in the [cii] tomolecular gas ratios in other studies suggests that pah emission, like [cii],continues to be a good tracer of photodissociation regions even at highredshift. together the co, pah and far-ir fine structure lines should be usefulfor constraining the interstellar medium conditions in high redshift galaxies.

1306.5235	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and mid-infrared continuum emission in a  z&gt;4 submillimeter galaxy	we report the detection of 6.2um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) andrest-frame 4-7um continuum emission in the z=4.055 submillimeter galaxy gn20,using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on board the spitzer space telescope.this represents the first detection of pah emission at z&gt;4. the strength of thepah emission feature is consistent with a very high star formation rate of~1600msun/yr. we find that this intense starburst powers at least ~1/3 of thefaint underlying 6um continuum emission, with an additional, significant (andperhaps dominant) contribution due to a power-law-like hot dust source, whichwe interpret to likely be a faint, dust-obscured active galactic nucleus (agn).the inferred 6um agn continuum luminosity is consistent with a sensitive upperlimit on the hard x-ray emission as measured by the chandra x-ray observatoryif the previously undetected agn is compton-thick. this is in agreement withthe finding at optical/infrared wavelengths that the galaxy and its nucleus areheavily dust-obscured. despite the strong power-law component enhancing themid-infrared continuum emission, the intense starburst associated with thephoton-dominated regions that give rise to the pah emission appears to dominatethe total energy output in the infrared. gn20 is one of the most luminousstarburst galaxies known at any redshift, embedded in a rich protocluster ofstar-forming galaxies. this investigation provides an improved understanding ofthe energy sources that power such exceptional systems, which represent theextreme end of massive galaxy formation at early cosmic times.

1307.8440	the inner kiloparsec of mrk 273 with keck adaptive optics	there is x-ray, optical, and mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopic evidencethat the late-stage ultraluminous infrared galaxy merger mrk 273 hosts apowerful active galactic nucleus (agn). however, the exact location of the agnand the nature of the nuclei have been difficult to determine due to dustobscuration and the limited wavelength coverage of available high-resolutiondata. here we present near-infrared integral-field spectra and images of thenuclear region of mrk 273 taken with osiris and nirc2 on the keck ii telescopewith laser guide star adaptive optics. we observe three spatially resolvedcomponents, and analyze the local molecular and ionized gas emission lines andtheir kinematics. we confirm the presence of the hard x-ray agn in thesouthwest nucleus. in the north nucleus, we find a strongly rotating gas diskwhose kinematics indicate a central black hole of mass 1.04 +/- 0.1 x 10^9msun. the h2 emission line shows an increase in velocity dispersion along theminor axis in both directions, and an increased flux with negative velocitiesin the southeast direction; this provides direct evidence for a collimatedmolecular outflow along the axis of rotation of the disk. the third spatiallydistinct component appears to the southeast, 640 and 750 pc from the north andsouthwest nuclei, respectively. this component is faint in continuum emissionbut shows several strong emission line features, including [si vi] 1.964 {\mu}mwhich traces an extended coronal-line region. the geometry of the [si vi]emission combined with shock models and energy arguments suggest that [si vi]in the southeast component must be at least partly ionized by the sw agn or aputative agn in the northern disk, either through photoionization or throughshock-heating from strong agn- and circumnuclear starburst-driven outflows.this lends support to a scenario in which mrk 273 may be a dual agn system.

1309.1202	a joint model of x-ray and infrared backgrounds. ii. compton-thick agn  abundance	we estimate the abundance of compton-thick (ct) active galactic nuclei (agn)based on our joint model of x-ray and infrared backgrounds. at l_{rest 2-10kev} &gt; 10^42 erg/s, the ct agn density predicted by our model is a few 10^-4mpc^-3 from z=0 up to z=3. ct agn with higher luminosity cuts (&gt; 10^43, 10^44 &amp;10^45 erg/s) peak at higher z and show a rapid increase in the number densityfrom z=0 to z~2-3. the ct to all agn ratio appears to be low (2-5%) atf_{2-10kev} &gt; 10^-15 erg/s/cm^2 but rises rapidly toward fainter flux levels.the ct agn account for ~ 38% of the total accreted smbh mass and contribute ~25% of the cosmic x-ray background spectrum at 20 kev. our model predicts thatthe majority (90%) of luminous and bright ct agn (l_{rest 2-10 kev} &gt; 10^44erg/s or f_{2-10kev} &gt; 10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) have detectable hot dust 5-10 umemission which we associate with a dusty torus. the fraction drops for fainterobjects, to around 30% at l_{rest 2-10 kev} &gt; 10^42 erg/s or f_{2-10kev} &gt;10^-17 erg/s/cm^2. our model confirms that heavily-obscured agn (n_hi &gt; 10^23cm^-2) can be separated from unobscured and mildly-obscured ones (n_hi &lt; 10^23cm^-2) in the plane of observed-frame x-ray hardness vs. mid-ir/x-ray ratio.

1310.0456	investigating the presence of 500 um submillimeter excess emission in  local star forming galaxies	submillimeter excess emission has been reported at 500 microns in a handfulof local galaxies, and previous studies suggest that it could be correlatedwith metal abundance. we investigate the presence of an excess submillimeteremission at 500 microns for a sample of 20 galaxies from the key insights onnearby galaxies: a far infrared survey with herschel (kingfish) that span arange of morphologies and metallicities (12+log(o/h)=7.8-8.7). we probe thefar-infrared (ir) emission using images from the spitzer space telescope andherschel space observatory in the wavelength range 24-500 microns. we model thefar-ir peak of the dust emission with a two-temperature modified blackbody andmeasure excess of the 500 micron photometry relative to that predicted by ourmodel. we compare the submillimeter excess, where present, with global galaxymetallicity and, where available, resolved metallicity measurements. we do notfind any correlation between the 500 micron excess and metallicity. a fewindividual sources do show excess (10-20%) at 500 microns; conversely, forother sources, the model overpredicts the measured 500 micron flux density byas much as 20%, creating a 500 micron "deficit". none of our sources has anexcess larger than the calculated 1-sigma uncertainty, leading us to concludethat there is no substantial excess at submillimeter wavelengths at or shorterthan 500 microns in our sample. our results differ from previous studiesdetecting 500 micron excess in kingfish galaxies largely due to new, improvedphotometry used in this study.

0801.4578	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of distant x-ray luminous agn	we present mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 16 optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope. these sources were jointly selected from spitzer andchandra imaging surveys in the ndwfs bootes field and were selected from theirbright x-ray fluxes to host luminous agn. none of the spectra show significantemission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs; 6.2um equivalent widths&lt;0.2um), consistent with their infrared emission being dominated by agn. nineof the x-ray sources show 9.7um silicate absorption features. their redshiftsare in the range 0.9&lt;z&lt;2.6, implying infrared luminosities oflog(l{ir})=12.5-13.6 solar luminosities. the average silicate absorptionstrength is not as strong as that of previously targeted optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies with similar mid-infrared luminosities implying thatthe x-ray selection favors sources behind a smaller column of si-rich dust thannon-x-ray selection. seven of the x-ray sources have featureless power-lawmid-ir spectra. we argue that the featureless spectra likely result from thesources having weak or absent silicate and pah features rather than the sourceslying at higher redshifts where these features are shifted out of the irsspectral window. we investigate whether there are any correlations betweenx-ray and infrared properties and find that sources with silicate absorptionfeatures tend to have fainter x-ray fluxes and harder x-ray spectra, indicatinga weak relation between the amount of silicate absorption and column density ofx-ray-absorbing gas.

1401.7338	stellar and gaseous nuclear disks observed in nearby (u)lirgs	we present near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of the centralkiloparsec of 17 nearby luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxiesundergoing major mergers. these observations were taken with osiris assisted bythe keck i and ii adaptive optics systems, providing spatial resolutions of afew tens of parsecs. the resulting kinematic maps reveal gas disks in at least16 out of 19 nuclei and stellar disks in 11 out of 11 nuclei observed in thesegalaxy merger systems. in our late-stages mergers, these disks are young(stellar ages $&lt;30$ myr) and likely formed as gas disks which became unstableto star formation during the merger. on average, these disks have effectiveradii of a few hundred parsecs, masses between $10^{8}$ and $10^{10} m_{sun}$,and $v/\sigma$ between 1 and 5. these disks are similar to those created inhigh-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, andfavor short coalescence times for binary black holes. the few galaxies in oursample in earlier stages of mergers have disks which are larger($r_{eff}\sim200-1800$ pc) and likely are remnants of the galactic disks thathave not yet been completely disrupted by the merger.

0802.2489	redshift distribution of extragalactic 24 micron sources	we present the redshift distribution of a complete, unbiased sample of 24micron sources down to fnu(24 micron) = 300 ujy (5-sigma). the sample consistsof 591 sources detected in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey.we have obtained optical spectroscopic redshifts for 421 sources (71%). thesehave a redshift distribution peaking at z~0.3, with a possible additional peakat z~0.9, and objects detected out to z=4.5. the spectra of the remaining 170(29%) exhibit no strong emission lines from which to determine a redshift. wedevelop an algorithm to estimate the redshift distribution of these sources,based on the assumption that they have emission lines but that these lines arenot observable due to the limited wavelength coverage of our spectroscopicobservations. the redshift distribution derived from all 591 sources exhibitsan additional peak of extremely luminous (l(8-1000 micron) &gt; 3 x 10^{12} lsun)objects at z~2, consisting primarily of sources without observable emissionlines. we use optical line diagnostics and irac colors to estimate that 55% ofthe sources within this peak are agn-dominated. we compare our results topublished models of the evolution of infrared luminous galaxies. the modelswhich best reproduce our observations predict a large population ofstar-formation dominated ulirgs at z &gt; 1.5 rather than the agn-dominatedsources we observe.

1406.3891	mid-infrared properties of luminous infrared galaxies ii: probing the  dust and gas physics of the goals sample	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) is a comprehensive,multiwavelength study of luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) in the localuniverse. here we present the results of a multi-component, spectraldecomposition analysis of the low resolution mid-ir spitzer irs spectra from5-38um of 244 lirg nuclei. the detailed fits and high quality spectra allow forcharacterization of the individual pah features, warm molecular hydrogenemission, and optical depths for silicate dust grains and water ices. we findthat starbursting lirgs, which make up the majority of goals, are veryconsistent in their mir properties (i.e. tau_9.7um, tau_ice, neon line and pahfeature ratios). however, as their pah eqw decreases, usually an indicator ofan increasingly dominant agn, lirgs cover a larger spread in these mirparameters. the contribution from pahs to the total l(ir) in lirgs varies from2-29% and lirgs prior to their first encounter show higher l(pah)/l(ir) ratioson average. we observe a correlation between the strength of the starburst(ir8) and the pah fraction at 8um but not with the 7.7 to 11.3 pah ratio,suggesting the fractional pdr emission, and not the overall grain properties,is associated with the rise in ir8 for galaxies off the starburst mainsequence. we detect crystalline silicate features in 6% of the sample but onlyin the most obscured sources (s_9.7um &lt; -1.24). ice absorption features areobserved in 11% (56%) of goals lirgs (ulirgs). most goals lirgs havel(h2)/l(pah) ratios elevated above those observed for normal star-forminggalaxies and exhibit a trend for increasing l(h2)/l(pah) ratio with increasingl(h2). while star formation appears to be the dominant process responsible forexciting the h2 in most of the goals galaxies, a subset of lirgs (10%) showexcess h2 emission that is inconsistent with pdr models and may be excited byshocks or agn-induced outflows.

1408.2511	the fuv to near-ir morphologies of luminous infrared galaxies in the  goals sample	we compare the morphologies of a sample of 20 lirgs from the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) in the fuv, b, i and h bands, usingthe gini (g) and m20 parameters to quantitatively estimate the distribution andconcentration of flux as a function of wavelength. hst images provide anaverage spatial resolution of ~80 pc. while our lirgs can be reliablyclassified as mergers across the entire range of wavelengths studied here,there is a clear shift toward more negative m20 (more bulge-dominated) and aless significant decrease in g values at longer wavelengths. we find nocorrelation between the derived fuv g-m20 parameters and the global measures ofthe ir to fuv flux ratio, irx. given the fine resolution in our hst data, thissuggests either that the uv morphology and irx are correlated on very smallscales, or that the regions emitting the bulk of the ir emission emit almost nofuv light. we use our multi-wavelength data to simulate how merging lirgs wouldappear from z~0.5-3 in deep optical and near-infrared images such as the hudf,and use these simulations to measure the g-m20 at these redshifts. oursimulations indicate a noticeable decrease in g, which flattens at z &gt;= 2 by asmuch as 40%, resulting in mis-classifying our lirgs as disk-like, even in therest-frame fuv. the higher redshift values of m20 for the goals sources do notappear to change more than about 10% from the values at z~0. the change ing-m20 is caused by the surface brightness dimming of extended tidal featuresand asymmetries, and also the decreased spatial resolution which reduced thenumber of individual clumps identified. this effect, seen as early as z~0.5,could easily lead to an underestimate of the number of merging galaxies athigh-redshift in the rest-frame fuv.

1503.02052	measuring star-formation rate and far-infrared color in high-redshift  galaxies using the co (7-6) and [nii] 205 micron lines	to better characterize the global star formation (sf) activity in a galaxy,one needs to know not only the star formation rate (sfr) but also therest-frame, far-infrared (fir) color (e.g., the 60-to-100 $\mu$m color,$c(60/100)$] of the dust emission. the latter probes the average intensity ofthe dust heating radiation field and scales statistically with the effectivesfr surface density in star-forming galaxies including (ultra-)luminousinfrared galaxies [(u)lirgs]. to this end, we exploit here a new spectroscopicapproach involving only two emission lines: co\,(7$-$6) at 372 $\mu$m and [nii]at 205 $\mu$m. for local (u)lirgs, the ratios of the co (7$-$6) luminosity($l_{\rm co\,(7-6)}$) to the total infrared luminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$; 8$-$1000$\mu$m) are fairly tightly distributed (to within $\sim$0.12 dex) and showlittle dependence on $c(60/100)$. this makes $l_{\rm co\,(7-6)}$ a good sfrtracer, which is less contaminated by active galactic nuclei (agn) than $l_{\rmir}$ and may also be much less sensitive to metallicity than $l_{\rmco\,(1-0)}$. furthermore, the logarithmic [nii] 205 $\mu$m to co (7$-$6)luminosity ratio is fairly steeply (at a slope of $\sim$$-1.4$) correlated with$c(60/100)$, with a modest scatter ($\sim$0.23 dex). this makes it a usefulestimator on $c(60/100)$ with an implied uncertainty of $\sim$0.15 [or$\lesssim$4 k in the dust temperature ($t_{\rm dust}$) in the case of agraybody emission with $t_{\rm dust} \gtrsim 30$ k and a dust emissivity index$\beta \ge 1$]. our locally calibrated sfr and $c(60/100)$ estimators are shownto be consistent with the published data of (u)lirgs of $z$ up to $\sim$6.5.

1510.06431	next generation very large array memo no. 7 science working group 2:  "galaxy ecosystems": the matter cycle in and around galaxies	this white paper discusses how a "next-generation" very large array (ngvla)operating in the frequency range 1-116 ghz could be a groundbreaking tool tostudy the detailed astrophysics of the "matter cycle" in the milky way andother galaxies. if optimized for high brightness sensitivity, the ngvla wouldbring detailed microwave spectroscopy and modeling of the full radio spectralenergy distribution into regular use as survey tools at resolutions of 0.1- 1arcseconds. this wavelength range includes powerful diagnostics of density,excitation, and chemistry in the cold ism, as well as multiple tracers of therate of recent star formation, the magnetic field, shocks, and properties ofthe ionized ism. we highlight design considerations that would make thisfacility revolutionary in this area, the foremost of which is a large amount ofcollecting area on ~km-length baselines. we also emphasize the strong case forharnessing the large proposed collecting area of the ngvla for very longbaseline applications as part of the core design. this would allow measurementsof the three dimensional space motions of galaxies to beyond the local groupand mapping of the milky way out to the far side of the disk. finally, wediscuss the gains from the proposed combination of very high resolution andsensitivity to thermal emission, which include observing the feeding of blackholes and resolving forming protoclusters.

0806.3002	luminous infrared galaxies with the submillimeter array: i. survey  overview and the central gas to dust ratio	we present new data obtained with the submillimeter array for a sample offourteen nearby luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies. the galaxies wereselected to have luminosity distances d &lt; 200 mpc and far-infrared luminositieslog(l_fir) &gt; 11.4. the galaxies were observed with spatial resolutions of order1 kpc in the co j=3-2, co j=2-1, 13co j=2-1, and hco+ j=4-3 lines as well asthe continuum at 880 microns and 1.3 mm. we have combined our co and continuumdata to measure an average gas-to-dust mass ratio of 120 +/- 28 (rms deviation109) in the central regions of these galaxies, very similar to the value of 150determined for the milky way. this similarity is interesting given the moreintense heating from the starburst and possibly accretion activity in theluminous infrared galaxies compared to the milky way. we find that the peak h_2surface density correlates with the far-infrared luminosity, which suggeststhat galaxies with higher gas surface densities inside the central kiloparsechave a higher star formation rate. the lack of a significant correlationbetween total h_2 mass and far-infrared luminosity in our sample suggests thatthe increased star formation rate is due to the increased availability ofmolecular gas as fuel for star formation in the central regions. in contrast toprevious analyses by other authors, we do not find a significant correlationbetween central gas surface density and the star formation efficiency, as traceby the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to nuclear gas mass. our data show thatit is the star formation rate, not the star formation efficiency, thatincreases with increasing central gas surface density in these galaxies.

astro-ph;0002526	absorption-line probes of gas and dust in galactic superwinds	we discuss moderate resolution spectra of the nad absorption-line in a sampleof 32 far-ir-bright starburst galaxies. in 18 cases, the line is producedprimarily by interstellar gas, and in 12 of these it is blueshifted by over 100km/s relative to the galaxy systemic velocity. the absorption-line profiles inthese outflow sources span the range from near the galaxy systemic velocity toa maximum blueshift of 400 to 600 km/s. the outflows occur in galaxiessystematically viewed more nearly face-on than the others. we therefore arguethat the absorbing material consists of ambient interstellar gas acceleratedalong the minor axis of the galaxy by a hot starburst-driven superwind. the nadlines are optically-thick, but indirect arguments imply total hydrogen columndensities of n_h = few x 10^{21} cm^{-2}. this implies that the superwind isexpelling matter at a rate comparable to the star-formation rate. thisoutflowing material is very dusty: we find a strong correlation between thedepth of the nad profile and the line-of-sight reddening (e(b-v) = 0.3 to 1over regions several-to-ten kpc in size). the estimated terminal velocities ofsuperwinds inferred from these data and extant x-ray data are typically 400 to800 km/s, are independent of the galaxy rotation speed, and are comparable to(substantially exceed) the escape velocities for $l_*$ (dwarf) galaxies. theresulting loss of metals can establish the mass-metallicity relation inspheroids, produce the observed metallicity in the icm, and enrich a generaligm to 10$^{-1}$ solar metallicity. if the outflowing dust grains survive theirjourney into the igm, their effect on observations of cosmologically-distantobjects is significant.

astro-ph;0508025	spitzer observations of the supergiant shell region in ic 2574	we present spatially resolved spitzer imaging of the supergiant shell regionof the m81 group dwarf galaxy ic 2574 obtained as part of the spitzer infrarednearby galaxies survey. this region harbors one of the best nearby examples ofa kinematically distinct hi shell, with an associated remnant stellar cluster;the shell is initiating sequential star formation as it interacts with thesurrounding interstellar medium. this region dominates the infrared luminosityof ic 2574 and is spatially resolved in all spitzer imaging bands. we study thedifferences in dust temperature as a function of local environment and comparelocal star formation rates as inferred from h alpha and total infraredluminosities. we find that the strong h alpha sources are associated withregions of warm dust; however, the most luminous infrared and h alpha sourcesare not necessarilyco-spatial. the coolest dust is found in the regionsfarthest from the rim of the shell; these regions show the best agreementbetween star formation rates derived from h alpha and from total infraredluminosities (although discrepancies at the factor of 3-4 level still exist).there is considerable variation in the radio-far infrared correlation indifferent regions surrounding the shell. the low dust content of the region mayinfluence the scatter seen in these relations; these data demonstrate that theexpanding shell is dramatically affecting its surroundings by triggering starformation and altering the dust temperature.

astro-ph;0509145	van der kruit to spitzer: a new look at the fir-radio correlation	we present an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlation within thestar-forming disks of four nearby, nearly face-on galaxies (ngc~2403, ngc~3031,ngc~5194, and ngc~6946). using {\it spitzer} mips imaging and wsrt radiocontinuum data, we are able to probe variations in the logarithmic70~$\mu$m/22~cm ($q_{70}$) flux density ratios across each disk at sub-kpcscales. we find general trends of decreasing $q_{70}$ with declining surfacebrightness and with increasing radius. we also find that the dispersion in$q_{70}$ within galaxies is comparable to what is measured {\it globally} amonggalaxies at around 0.2 dex. we have also performed preliminary phenomenologicalmodeling of cosmic ray electron (cr$e^{-}$) diffusion using an image-smearingtechnique, and find that smoothing the infrared maps improves their correlationwith the radio maps. the best fit smoothing kernels for the two less activestar-forming galaxies (ngc~2403 and ngc~3031) have much larger scale-lengthsthan that of the more active star-forming galaxies (ngc~5194 and ngc~6946).this difference may be due to the relative deficit of recent cr$e^{-}$injection into the interstellar medium (ism) for the galaxies having largelyquiescent disks.

astro-ph;0604604	warm dust and spatially variable pah emission in the dwarf starburst  galaxy ngc 1705	we present spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705obtained as part of sings. the galaxy morphology is very different shortwardand longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying redstellar population, with the central super star cluster (ssc) dominating theluminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from twooff-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the ssc. these regions show littleextinction at optical wavelengths. the galaxy has a relatively low global dustmass (~2e5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 timeslower than the milky way average). the off-nuclear dust emission appears to bepowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for theexcitation of the observed h alpha emission; these photons are unassociatedwith the ssc (though a contribution from embedded sources to the ir luminosityof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). low-resolution irsspectroscopy shows moderate-strength pah emission in the 11.3 micron band inthe eastern peak; no pah emission is detected in the ssc or the western dustemission complex. there is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scalingand subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable pah emissionstrengths revealed by the irs data suggest caution in the interpretation ofdiffuse 8 micron emission as arising from pah carriers alone. the metallicityof ngc 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by engelbracht andcollaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatiallyvariable pah emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8micron emission. a radio continuum non-detection, ngc 1705 deviatessignificantly from the canonical far-ir vs. radio correlation.

(2) 33% (17/52) have only deep silicateabsorption at 9.8um, indicative of deeply embedded dusty systems. the energeticnature of the heating sources in these systems can not be determined by thesedata alone.

0811.1398	the origin of the 24-micron excess in red galaxies	observations with the spitzer space telescope have revealed a population ofred-sequence galaxies with a significant excess in their 24-micron emissioncompared to what is expected from an old stellar population. we identify 900red galaxies with 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages)selected from the noao deep wide-field survey bootes field. using spitzer/mips,we classify 89 (~10%) with 24-micron infrared excess (f24&gt;0.3 mjy). wedetermine the prevalence of agn and star-formation activity in all the agesgalaxies using optical line diagnostics and mid-ir color-color criteria. usingthe irac color-color diagram from the irac shallow survey, we find that 64% ofthe 24-micron excess red galaxies are likely to have strong pah emissionfeatures in the 8-micron irac band. this fraction is significantly larger thanthe 5% of red galaxies with f24&lt;0.3 mjy that are estimated to have strong pahemission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due tostar-formation processes. only 15% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies haveoptical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64% are classifiedas agn and 21% are unclassifiable). the difference between the optical andinfrared results suggest that both agn and star-formation activity is occurringsimultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. these resultsshould serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical linediagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared andother bands. we find that ~40% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-onspiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. the remaining sources are likelyto be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination ofobscured agn and star-formation activity.
