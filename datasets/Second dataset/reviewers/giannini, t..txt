0704.1228	near- and far-infrared counterparts of millimeter dust cores in the vela  molecular ridge cloud d	the aim of this paper is to identify the young protostellar counterpartsassociated to dust millimeter cores of the vela molecular ridge cloud d throughnew ir observations (h_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and n broad band at 10.4micron) along with an investigation performed on the existing ir catalogues.the association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues(iras, msx, 2mass), jhk data from the literature and new observations, has beenestablished according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectralenergy distributions. only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. the otherones are clearly associated with: far-ir sources, h_2 jets or near-ir objectsshowing a high intrinsic colour excess. the distribution of the spectralindices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical ofclass i objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates class 0sources. we remark the high detection rate (30%) of h_2 jets driven by sourceslocated inside the mm-cores. they appear not driven by the most luminousobjects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.the presented results reliably describe the young population of vmr-d. however,the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seemsto reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than anyproperty intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

0906.0561	first detection of acceleration and deceleration in protostellar jets?  time variability in the cha ii outflows	we present a multi-epoch (20 years baseline) kinematical investigation ofhh52, 53, and 54 at optical and near-ir wavelengths, along with medium andhigh- resolution spectroscopic analyses, probing the kinematical and physicaltime variability conditions of the gas along the flows. by means of multi-epochand multi-wavelength narrow-band images, we derived proper motions, tangentialvelocities, velocity and flux variability of the knots. radial velocities andphysical parameters of the gas were derived from spectroscopy. finally, spatialvelocities and inclination of the flows were obtained by combining both imagingand spectroscopy. the p.m. analysis reveals three distinct, partiallyoverlapping outflows. in 20 years, about 60% of the knots show some degree offlux variability. our set of observations apparently indicates acceleration anddeceleration in a variety of knots along the jets. for about 20% of the knots,mostly coincident with working surfaces or interacting knots along the flows, arelevant variability in both flux and velocity is observed. we argue that bothvariabilities are related and that all or part of the kinetic energy lost bythe interacting knots is successively radiated. the analysis indicates thepresence of very light, ionised, and hot flows, impacting a denser medium.several knots are deflected. at least for a couple of them (hh54 g and g0), thedeflection originates from the collision of the two. for the more massive partsof the flow, the deflection is likely the result of the flow collision with adense cloud or with clumps.

0906.4060	pre-main sequence variables in the vmr-d : identification of t  tauri-like accreting protostars through spitzer-irac variability	we present a study of the infrared variability of young stellar objects bymeans of two spitzer-irac images of the vela molecular cloud d (vmr-d) obtainedin observations separated in time by about six months. by using the samespace-born ir instrumentation, this study eliminates all the unwanted effectsusually unavoidable when comparing catalogs obtained from differentinstruments. the vmr-d map covers about 1.5 square deg. of a site where starformation is actively ongoing. we are interested in accreting pre-main sequencevariables whose luminosity variations are due to intermittent events of diskaccretion (i.e. active t tauri stars and exor type objects). the variableobjects have been selected from a catalog of more than 170,000 sources detectedat a s/n ratio &gt; 5. we searched the sample of variables for ones whosephotometric properties are close to those of known exor's. these latter aremonitored in a more systematic way than t tauri stars and the mechanisms thatregulate the observed phenomenology are exactly the same. hence the modalitiesof the exor behavior is adopted as driving criterium for selecting variables ingeneral. we selected 19 bona fide candidates that constitute a well-definedsample of new variable targets for further investigation. out of these, 10sources present a spitzer mips 24 micron counterpart, and have been classifiedas 3 class i, 5 flat spectrum and 2 class ii objects, while the other 9 sourceshave spectral energy distribution compatible with phases older than class i.this is consistent with what is known about the small sample of known exor's,and suggests that the accretion flaring or exor stage might come as a classi/ii transition. we present also new prescriptions that can be useful in futuresearches for accretion variables in large ir databases.

0707.0967	an infrared view of the exor variables: on the case of v1118 ori	we investigate the relationship between the ir observed properties of theexor variables and the mechanisms active during their evolutionary stage. tothis aim, we have constructed a catalog of all the ir (1-100 micron)photometric and spectroscopic observations appearing during the last 30 yearsin the literature. new results of our monitoring program based on near- andmid-ir photometry and near-ir spectroscopy and polarimetry of one object (v1118ori) are presented, complementing those given in a previous paper and relatedto a different activity period. our catalog indicates how the databaseaccumulated so far is inadequate for any statistical study of the exor events.nevertheless, all the observational evidence can be interpreted into a coherentscheme. the sources that present the largest brightness variations tend tobecome bluer while brightening. the scenario of disk accretion based on viscousfriction between particles agrees with the observations. the new results onv1118 ori confirm such a general view. the striking novelty is represented by anear-ir spectrum of v1118 ori taken 1 yr after the last monitored outburst: anyemission line previously detected has now totally disappeared at oursensitivity. for the same source, mid-ir photometry is provided here for thefirst time and allows us to construct a meaningful sed. the first polarimetricdata show that v1118 ori is intrinsically polarized and its spotted, magnetizedsurface becomes recognizable during the less active phases.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1103.0183	simultaneous monitoring of the photometric and polarimetric activity of  the young star pv cep in the optical/near-infrared bands	we present the results of a simultaneous monitoring, lasting more than 2years, of the optical and near-infrared photometric and polarimetric activityof the variable protostar pv cep. during the monitoring period, an outburst hasoccurred in all the photometric bands, whose declining phase ($\delta$j$\approx$ 3 mag) lasted about 120 days. a time lag of $\sim$ 30 days betweenoptical and infrared light curves has been measured and interpreted in theframework of an accretion event. this latter is directly recognizable in thesignificant variations of the near-infrared colors, that appear bluer in theoutburst phase, when the star dominates the emission, and redder in decliningphase, when the disk emission prevails. all the observational data have beencombined to derive a coherent picture of the complex morphology of the whole pvcep system, that, in addition to the star and the accretion disk, is composedalso by a variable biconical nebula. in particular, the mutual interactionbetween all these components is the cause of the high value of the polarization($\approx$ 20%) and of its fluctuations. the observational data concur toindicate that pv cep is not a genuine exor star, but rather a more complexobject; moreover the case of pv cep leads to argue about the classification ofother recently discovered young sources in outburst, that have been considered,maybe over-simplifying, as exor.

1106.2722	spitzer spectral line mapping of protostellar outflows: iii - h_2  emission in l1448, bhr71, and ngc2071	spitzer-irs maps of h_2 pure rotational lines from s(0) to s(7) in 3 outflowsfrom class 0 sources - l1448, bhr71, and ngc2071 - are presented. these linesare used, in conjunction with available rovibrational, near-ir h_2 lines, toprobe the physical conditions of the warm gas between hundreds and thousands ofkelvin. we have constructed maps of the molecular hydrogen column density,ortho-to-para ratio and volume density, together with the index beta of thepower law describing the distribution of gas temperature. in all threeoutflows, the present ortho-to-para ratio significantly deviates from the hightemperature equilibrium of 3, being on average between 2.0 and 2.3. these lowvalues, that reflect the young age of these flows, are found also in regions ofrelatively high temperature (~ 1000 k), likely indicating that shocks areoccurring in a time shorter than that needed for a complete para to orthoconversion. density maps indicate upper limits close to lte conditions, i.e.between 10^6-10^7 cm^-3; moreover we demonstrate, based on the detections of hdemission spots (r(3) and r(4) lines), that a density stratification does exist,with the low density components (10^4-10^5 cm^-3) associated with the coldestgas. the beta index is found in all flows to be above 3.8: this value isconsistent with predictions of multiple c-type bow shocks with a range ofvelocities, some of which insufficient to achieve the temperature at which h_2partially dissociates. the contribution of h_2 to the total cooling isquantitatively similar to that of other abundant molecules emitting in thefar-infrared, such as water and co; moreover, the luminosity radiated away iscomparable with the estimated kinetic energy of the swept-out outflow: thissupports the scenario in which the shock from which h_2 is emitted is alsocapable of accelerating the molecular outflow driven at the shock workingsurface.

1106.5440	herschel observations of the herbig-haro objects hh52-54	we are aiming at the observational estimation of the relative contribution tothe cooling by co and h2o, as this provides decisive information for theunderstanding of the oxygen chemistry behind interstellar shock waves. methods.the high sensitivity of hifi, in combination with its high spectral resolutioncapability, allows us to trace the h2o outflow wings at unprecedentedsignal-to-noise. from the observation of spectrally resolved h2o and co linesin the hh52-54 system, both from space and from ground, we arrive at thespatial and velocity distribution of the molecular outflow gas. solving thestatistical equilibrium and non-lte radiative transfer equations provides uswith estimates of the physical parameters of this gas, including the coolingrate ratios of the species. the radiative transfer is based on an ali code,where we use the fact that variable shock strengths, distributed along thefront, are naturally implied by a curved surface. based on observations of coand h2o spectral lines, we conclude that the emission is confined to the hh54region. the quantitative analysis of our observations favours a ratio of theco-to-h2o-cooling-rate &gt;&gt; 1. from the best-fit model to the co emission, wearrive at an h2o abundance close to 1e-5. the line profiles exhibit twocomponents, one of which is triangular and another, which is a superposed,additional feature. this additional feature likely originates from a regionsmaller than the beam where the ortho-water abundance is smaller than in thequiescent gas. comparison with recent shock models indicate that a planar shockcan not easily explain the observed line strengths and triangular lineprofiles.we conclude that the geometry can play an important role. althoughabundances support a scenario where j-type shocks are present, higher coolingrate ratios than predicted by these type of shocks are derived.

1108.2622	poisson project - i - emission lines as accretion tracers in young  stellar objects: results from observations of chamaeleon i and ii sources	we present the results of the analysis of lr optical-nir spectra (0.6-2.4 um)of a sample 47 ysos in the chai and ii star-forming clouds. these data are partof the poisson project (protostellar optical-infrared spectral survey on ntt).the aim is to determine the accretion luminosity (lacc) and mass accretion rate(macc) of the sources through the analysis of the detected emission features.we also aim at verifying the reliability and consistency of the existingempirical relationships connecting emission line luminosity and lacc. we employfive tracers (oi-6300a, ha, caii-8542a, pab, and brg) to derive the accretionluminosity. the tracers provide lacc values showing different scatters whenplotted as a function of l*. the brg seems to be the most reliable, because itgives the minimum lacc dispersion over the entire range of l*, whereas theother tracers provide much more scattered lacc values, which are not expectedfor our homogeneous sample. the comparison between lacc(brg) and lacc obtainedfrom the other tracers also shows systematic differences among the empiricalrelationships. these may probably be ascribed to different excitationmechanisms contributing to the line emission, which may vary between our sampleand those where the relationships were calibrated. adopting the lacc derivedfrom brg, we find lacc=0.1l*-1l* for all sources, and macc of the order of10^-7-10^-9 msun/yr. the macc derived in chai are proportional to m*^2, asfound in other low-mass star-forming regions. the discrepancies observed in thecase of lacc(brg) and lacc(pab) can be related to different intrinsic pab/brg,ratios. the derived ratios show the existence of two different emissionmodalities, one that agrees with predictions of both wind and accretion models,the other suggesting optically thick emission from relatively small regions(10^21-10^22 cm^-3) with gas at low temperatures (&lt;4000k).

1108.3692	revisiting the shocks in bhr71: new observational constraints and h2o  predictions for herschel	during the formation of a star, material is ejected along powerful jets thatimpact the ambient material. this outflow phenomenon plays an important role inthe regulation of star formation. understanding the associated shocks and theirenergetic effects is therefore essential to the study of star formation. wepresent comparisons of shock models with observations of h$_2$ and sio emissionin the bipolar outflow bhr71, and predict water emission, under the basicassumption that the emission regions of the considered species coincide, at theresolution of currently available observations. new sio observations from apexare presented, and combined with \textit{spitzer} and ground-based observationsof h$_2$ to constrain shock models. the shock regions associated with targetedpositions in the molecular outflow are studied by means of a 1d code thatgenerates models of the propagation of stationary shock waves, andapproximations to non-stationary ones. the sio emission in the inner part ofthe outflow is concentrated near the apex of the corresponding bow-shock thatis also seen in the pure rotational transitions of h$_2$. simultaneousmodelling is possible for h$_2$ and sio and leads to constraints on the siliconpre-shock distribution on the grain mantles and/or cores. the best-fittingmodels are found to be of the non-stationary type, but the degeneracy of thesolutions is still large. pre-shock densities of 10$^4$ and 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$are investigated, and the associated best-model candidates have rather lowvelocity (respectively, 20-30 and 10-15 km s$^{-1}$) and are not older than1000 years. we provide emission predictions for water, focusing on thebrightest transitions, to be observed with the pacs and hifi instruments of the\textit{herschel} telescope.

1111.0461	water emission from the chemically rich outflow l1157	in the framework of the herschel-wish key program, several ortho-h2o andpara-h2o emission lines, in the frequency range from 500 to 1700 ghz, wereobserved with the hifi instrument in two bow-shock regions (b2 and r) of thel1157 cloud. the primary aim is to analyse water emission lines as a diagnosticof the physical conditions in the blue (b2) and red-shifted (r) lobes tocompare the excitation conditions. a total of 5 ortho- and para-h216o plus oneo-h218o transitions were observed in b2 and r with a wide range of excitationenergies (27 k&lt;=eu&lt;=215 k). the h2o spectra, observed in the two shockedregions, show that the h2o profiles are markedly different in the two regions.in particular, at the bow-shock r, we observed broad (~30 km s-1 with respectto the ambient velocity) red-shifted wings where lines at different excitationpeak at different red-shifted velocities. the b2 spectra are associated with anarrower velocity range (~6 km s-1), peaking at the systemic velocity. theexcitation analysis suggests, for b2, low values of column density nh2o&lt;=5{\times}1013 cm-2, a density range of 105 &lt;=nh2 &lt;=107 cm-3, and warmtemperatures (&gt;=300 k). the presence of the broad red-shifted wings andmultiple peaks in the spectra of the r region, prompted the modelling of twocomponents. high velocities are associated with relatively low temperatures(~100k),nh2o{\simeq}5{\times}1012-5{\times}1013 cm-2 and densitiesnh2{\simeq}106-108 cm-3.lower velocities are associated with higher excitationconditions with tkin&gt;=300 k, very dense gas (nh2 ~108 cm-3) and low columndensity (nh2o&lt;5{\times}1013 cm-2).

1111.2455	poisson project - ii - a multi-wavelength spectroscopic and photometric  survey of young protostars in l 1641	characterising stellar and circumstellar properties of embedded young stellarobjects (ysos) is mandatory for understanding the early stages of the stellarevolution. this task requires the combination of both spectroscopy andphotometry, covering the widest possible wavelength range, to disentangle thevarious protostellar components and activities. as part of the poisson project,we present a multi-wavelength spectroscopic and photometric investigation ofembedded ysos in l1641, aimed to derive the stellar parameters and evolutionarystages and to infer their accretion properties. our database includeslow-resolution optical-ir spectra from the ntt and spitzer (0.6-40 um) andphotometric data covering a spectral range from 0.4 to 1100 um, which allow usto construct the ysos spectral energy distributions (seds) and to infer themain stellar parameters. the sed analysis allows us to group our 27 ysos intonine class i, eleven flat, and seven class ii objects. however, on the basis ofthe derived stellar properties, only six class i ysos have an age of ~10^5 yr,while the others are older 5x10^5-10^6 yr), and, among the flat sources, threeout of eleven are more evolved objects (5x10^6-10^7 yr), indicating thatgeometrical effects can significantly modify the sed shapes. inferred massaccretion rates (macc) show a wide range of values (3.6x10^-9 to 1.2x10^-5m_sun yr^-1), which reflects the age spread observed in our sample. averagevalues of mass accretion rates, extinction, and spectral indices decrease withthe yso class. the youngest ysos have the highest macc, whereas the oldest ysosdo not show any detectable jet activity in either images and spectra. we alsoobserve a clear correlation among the yso macc, m*, and age, consistent withmass accretion evolution in viscous disc models.

1111.6016	the herschel hifi water line survey in the low-mass proto-stellar  outflow l1448	as part of the wish (water in star-forming regions with herschel) keyproject, we report on the observations of several ortho- and para-h2o linesperformed with the hifi instrument towards two bright shock spots (r4 and b2)along the outflow driven by the l1448 low-mass proto-stellar system, located inthe perseus cloud. these data are used to identify the physical conditionsgiving rise to the h2o emission and infer any dependence with velocity. theseobservations provide evidence that the observed water lines probe a warm(t_kin~400-600 k) and very dense (n 10^6 - 10^7 cm^-3) gas, not traced by othermolecules, such as low-j co and sio, but rather traced by mid-ir h2 emission.in particular, h2o shows strong differences with sio in the excitationconditions and in the line profiles in the two observed shocked positions,pointing to chemical variations across the various velocity regimes andchemical evolution in the different shock spots. physical and kinematicaldifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. at the r4 position, twovelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with thecomponent at higher velocity (r4-hv) being less extended and less dense thanthe low velocity component (r4-lv). h2o column densities of about 2 10^13 and 410^14 cm^-2 have been derived for the r4-lv and the r4-hv components,respectively. the conditions inferred for the b2 position are similar to thoseof the r4-hv component, with h2o column density in the range 10^14 - 5 10^14cm^-2, corresponding to h2o/h2 abundances in the range 0.5 - 1 10^-5. theobserved line ratios and the derived physical conditions seem to be moreconsistent with excitation in a low velocity j-type shock with largecompression rather than in a stationary c-shock, although none of thesestationary models seems able to reproduce all the characteristics of theobserved emission.

1209.0294	h2o line mapping at high spatial and spectral resolution - herschel  observations of the vla1623 outflow	apart from being an important coolant, h2o is known to be a tracer ofhigh-velocity molecular gas. recent models predict relatively high abundancesbehind interstellar shockwaves. the dynamical and physical conditions of theh2o emitting gas, however, are not fully understood yet. we aim to determinethe abundance and distribution of h2o, its kinematics and the physicalconditions of the gas responsible for the h2o emission. the observed lineprofile shapes help us understand the dynamics in molecular outflows. we mappedthe vla1623 outflow, in the ground-state transitions of o-h2o, with the hifiand pacs instruments. we also present observations of higher energy transitionsof o-h2o and p-h2o obtained with hifi and pacs towards selected outflowpositions. from comparison with non-lte radiative transfer calculations, weestimate the physical parameters of the water emitting regions. the observedwater emission line profiles vary over the mapped area. spectral features andcomponents, tracing gas in different excitation conditions, allow us toconstrain the density and temperature of the gas. the h2o emission originatesin a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm h2 gas(t\gtrsim200k). thus, the h2o emission traces a gas component significantlywarmer than the gas responsible for the low-j co emission. the h2o columndensities at the co peak positions are low, i.e. n(h2o) \simeq (0.03-10)x10e14cm-2. the h2o abundance with respect to h2 in the extended outflow is estimatedat x(h2o)&lt;1x10e-6, significantly lower than what would be expected from mostrecent shock models. the h2o emission traces a gas component moving atrelatively high velocity compared to the low-j co emitting gas. however, otherdynamical quantities such as the momentum rate, energy and mechanicalluminosity are estimated to be the same, independent of the molecular tracerused, co or h2o.

1210.7178	mapping water in protostellar outflows with herschel: pacs and hifi  observations of l1448-c	we investigate on the spatial and velocity distribution of h2o along thel1448 outflow, its relationship with other tracers, and its abundancevariations, using maps of the o-h2o 1_{10}-1_{01} and 2_{12}-1_{01} transitionstaken with the herschel-hifi and pacs instruments, respectively. water emissionappears clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along theoutflow. the bulk of the 557 ghz line is confined to radial velocities in therange \pm 10-50 km/s but extended emission associated with the l1448-c extremehigh velocity (ehv) jet is also detected. the h2o 1_{10}-1_{01}/co(3-2) ratioshows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect differentand changing physical conditions in the gas responsible for the emissions fromthe two species. in the ehv jet, a low h2o/sio abundance ratio is inferred,that could indicate molecular formation from dust free gas directly ejectedfrom the proto-stellar wind. we derive averaged tkin and n(h2) values of about300-500 k and 5 10^6 cm-3 respectively, while a water abundance with respect toh2 of the order of 0.5-1 10^{-6} along the outflow is estimated. the fairlyconstant conditions found all along the outflow implies that evolutionaryeffects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role inthe h2o chemistry. the results of our analysis show that the bulk of theobserved h2o lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after beingheated to high temperatures, has been already cooled down to a few hundred k.the relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism todiminish the h2o gas in the post-shock region. among the possible scenarios, wefavor h2o photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low velocitynon-dissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a fuvfield of sufficient strength.

1212.5033	oh far-infrared emission from low- and intermediate-mass protostars  surveyed with herschel-pacs	oh is a key species in the water chemistry of star-forming regions, becauseits presence is tightly related to the formation and destruction of water. thispaper presents oh observations from 23 low- and intermediate-mass young stellarobjects obtained with the pacs integral field spectrometer on-board herschel inthe context of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish) keyprogram. most low-mass sources have compact oh emission (&lt; 5000 au scale),whereas the oh lines in most intermediate-mass sources are extended over thewhole pacs detector field-of-view (&gt; 20000 au). the strength of the oh emissionis correlated with various source properties such as the bolometric luminosityand the envelope mass, but also with the oi and h2o emission. rotationaldiagrams for sources with many oh lines show that the level populations of ohcan be approximated by a boltzmann distribution with an excitation temperatureat around 70 k. radiative transfer models of spherically symmetric envelopescannot reproduce the oh emission fluxes nor their broad line widths, stronglysuggesting an outflow origin. slab excitation models indicate that the observedexcitation temperature can either be reached if the oh molecules are exposed toa strong far-infrared continuum radiation field or if the gas temperature anddensity are sufficiently high. using realistic source parameters and radiationfields, it is shown for the case of ser smm1 that radiative pumping plays animportant role in transitions arising from upper level energies higher than 300k. the compact emission in the low-mass sources and the required presence of astrong radiation field and/or a high density to excite the oh molecules pointstowards an origin in shocks in the inner envelope close to the protostar.

1309.5827	the diagnostic potential of fe lines applied to protostellar jets	we investigate the diagnostic capabilities of the iron lines for tracing thephysical conditions of the shock-excited gas in jets driven by pre-mainsequence stars. we have analyzed the 300-2500 nm x-shooter spectra of two jetsdriven by the pre-main sequence stars eso-halpha 574 and par-lup 3-4. bothspectra are very rich in [feii] lines over the whole spectral range; inaddition, lines from [feiii] are detected in the eso-h\alpha 574 spectrum. nltecodes along with codes for the ionization equilibrium are used to derive thegas excitation conditions of electron temperature and density, and fractionalionization. the iron gas-phase abundance is provided by comparing the ironlines emissivity with that of [oi] 630 nm. the [feii] lines indicate eso-halpha574 jet is, on average, colder (t_e = 9000 k), less dense (n_e = 2 10^4 cm^-3)and more ionized (x_e = 0.7) than the par-lup 3-4 jet (t_e = 13000 k, n_e = 610^4 cm^-3, x_e &lt; 0.4), even if the existence of a higher density component(n_e = 2 10^5 cm^-3) is probed by the [feiii] and [feii] ultra-violet lines.theoretical models suggest that the shock at work in eso-halpha 574 is fasterand likely more energetic than the par-lup 3-4 shock. this latter feature isconfirmed by the high percentage of gas-phase iron measured in eso-halpha 574(50-60% of its solar abundance in comparison with less than 30% in par-lup3-4), which testifies that the eso-halpha 574 shock is powerful enough topartially destroy the dust present inside the jet. this work demonstrates thata multiline fe analysis can be effectively used to probe the excitation andionization conditions of the gas in a jet without any assumption on ionicabundances. the main limitation on the diagnostics resides in the largeuncertainties of the atomic data, which, however, can be overcome through astatistical approach involving many lines.

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1403.3232	eso-h$\alpha$~574 and par-lup3-4 jets: exploring the spectral,  kinematical and physical properties	in this paper a comprehensive analysis of vlt / x-shooter observations of twojet systems, namely eso-h$\alpha$ 574 a k8 classical t tauri star and par-lup3-4 a very low mass (0.13~\msun) m5 star, is presented. both stars are known tohave near-edge on accretion disks. a summary of these first x-shooterobservations of jets was given in a 2011 letter. the new results outlined hereinclude flux tables of identified emission lines, information on themorphology, kinematics and physical conditions of both jets and, updatedestimates of $\dot{m}_{out}$ / $\dot{m}_{acc}$. asymmetries in the \eso floware investigated while the \para jet is much more symmetric. the density,temperature, and therefore origin of the gas traced by the balmer lines areinvestigated from the balmer decrements and results suggest an origin in a jetfor \eso while for \para the temperature and density are consistent with anaccretion flow. $\dot{m}_{acc}$ is estimated from the luminosity of variousaccretion tracers. for both targets, new luminosity relationships and are-evaluation of the effect of reddening and grey extinction (due to theedge-on disks) allows for substantial improvements on previous estimates of$\dot{m}_{acc}$. it is found that log($\dot{m}_{acc}$) = -9.15 $\pm$ 0.45~\msunyr$^{-1}$ and -9.30 $\pm$ 0.27~\msun yr$^{-1}$ for \eso and \para respectively.additionally, the physical conditions in the jets (electron density, electrontemperature, and ionisation) are probed using various line ratios and comparedwith previous determinations from iron lines. the results are combined with theluminosity of the [sii]$\lambda$6731 line to derive $\dot{m}_{out}$ through acalculation of the gas emissivity based on a 5-level atom model.

1406.6302	water distribution in shocked regions of the ngc1333-iras4a protostellar  outflow	we present the study of the h2o spatial distribution at two bright shockedregions along iras4a, one of the strongest h2o emitters among the class 0outflows. we obtained herschel-pacs maps of the iras4a outflow and hifiobservations of two shocked positions. the largest hifi beam of 38 arcsec at557 ghz was mapped in several key water lines with different upper energylevels, to reveal possible spatial variations of the line profiles. we detectfour h2o lines and co (16-15) at the two selected positions. in addition,transitions from related outflow and envelope tracers are detected. differentgas components associated with the shock are identified in the h2o emission. inparticular, at the head of the red lobe of the outflow, two distinct gascomponents with different excitation conditions are distinguished in the hifiemission maps: a compact component, detected in the ground-state water lines,and a more extended one. assuming that these two components correspond to twodifferent temperature components observed in previous h2o and co studies, theexcitation analysis of the h2o emission suggests that the compact (about 3arcsec) component is associated with a hot (t~1000 k) gas with densities~(1-4)x10^5 cm^{-3}, whereas the extended one (10-17 arcsec) traces a warm(t~300-500 k) and dense gas (~(3-5)x10^7 cm^{-3}). finally, using the co(16-15) emission observed at r2, we estimate the h2o/h2 abundance of the warmand hot components to be (7-10)x10^{-7} and (3-7)x10^{-5}. our data allowed us,for the first time, to resolve spatially the two temperature componentspreviously observed with hifi and pacs. we propose that the compact hotcomponent may be associated with the jet that impacts the surrounding material,whereas the warm, dense, and extended component originates from the compressionof the ambient gas by the propagating flow.

0803.2012	molecular jets driven by high-mass protostars: a detailed study of the  iras 20126+4104 jet	we present here an extensive analysis of the protostellar jet driven by iras20126+4104, deriving the kinematical, dynamical, and physical conditions of theh2 gas along the flow. the jet has been investigated by means of near-ir h2 and[feii] narrow-band imaging, high resolution spectroscopy of the 1-0s(1) line(2.12 um), nir (0.9-2.5 um) low resolution spectroscopy, along with iso-sws andlws spectra (from 2.4 to 200 um). the flow shows a complex morphology. inaddition to the large-scale jet precession presented in previous studies, wedetect a small-scale wiggling close to the source, that may indicate thepresence of a multiple system. the peak radial velocities of the h2 knots rangefrom -42 to -14 km s^-1 in the blue lobe, and from -8 to 47 km s^-1 in the redlobe. the low resolution spectra are rich in h_2 emission, and relatively faint[feii] (nir), [oi] and [cii] (fir) emission is observed in the region close tothe source. a warm h2 gas component has an average excitation temperature thatranges between 2000 k and 2500 k. additionally, the iso-sws spectrum revealsthe presence of a cold component (520 k), that strongly contributes to theradiative cooling of the flow and plays a major role in the dynamics of theflow. the estimated l(h2) of the jet is 8.2+/-0.7 l_sun, suggesting thatiras20126+4104 has an accretion rate significantly increased compared tolow-mass ysos. this is also supported by the derived mass flux rate from the h2lines (mflux(h2)~7.5x10^-4 m_sun yr^-1). the comparison between the h2 and theoutflow parameters strongly indicates that the jet is driving, at leastpartially, the outflow. as already found for low-mass protostellar jets, themeasured h2 outflow luminosity is tightly related to the source bolometricluminosity.

1409.2779	first spectrally-resolved h$_2$ observations towards hh 54 / low h$_2$o  abundance in shocks	context: herschel observations suggest that the h$_2$o distribution inoutflows from low-mass stars resembles the h$_2$ emission. it is still unclearwhich of the different excitation components that characterise the mid- andnear-ir h$_2$ distribution is associated with h$_2$o. aim: the aim is tospectrally resolve the different excitation components observed in the h$_2$emission. this will allow us to identify the h$_2$ counterpart associated withh$_2$o and finally derive directly an h$_2$o abundance estimate with respect toh$_2$. methods: we present new high spectral resolution observations of h$_2$0-0 s(4), 0-0 s(9), and 1-0 s(1) towards hh 54, a bright nearby shock region inthe southern sky. in addition, new herschel-hifi h$_2$o (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{01}$)observations at 1670~ghz are presented. results: our observations show for thefirst time a clear separation in velocity of the different h$_2$ lines: the 0-0s(4) line at the lowest excitation peaks at $-$7~km~s$^{-1}$, while the moreexcited 0-0 s(9) and 1-0 s(1) lines peak at $-$15~km~s$^{-1}$. h$_2$o andhigh-$j$ co appear to be associated with the h$_2$ 0-0 s(4) emission, whichtraces a gas component with a temperature of 700$-$1000 k. the h$_2$o abundancewith respect to h$_2$ 0-0 s(4) is estimated to be$x$(h$_2$o)$&lt;$1.4$\times$10$^{-5}$ in the shocked gas over an area of13$^{\prime\prime}$. conclusions: we resolve two distinct gas componentsassociated with the hh 54 shock region at different velocities and excitations.this allows us to constrain the temperature of the h$_2$o emitting gas($\leq$1000 k) and to derive correct estimates of h$_2$o abundance in theshocked gas, which is lower than what is expected from shock model predictions.

1410.0181	poisson project - iii - investigating the evolution of the mass  accretion rate	as part of the poisson project (protostellar optical-infrared spectral surveyon ntt), we present the results of the analysis of low-resolution nir spectra0.9-2.4 um) of two samples of ysos in lupus and serpens (52 and 17 objects),with masses 0.1-2.0 msun and ages from 10^5 to a few 10^7 yr. after determiningthe accretion parameters of the lup and ser targets by analysing their hinear-ir emission features, we added the results to those from previous regions(investigated in poisson with the same methodology). we obtained a finalcatalogue (143 objects) of mass accretion rates (macc) derived in a homogeneousfashion and analysed how macc correlates with m* and how it evolves in time. wederived the accretion luminosity (lacc) and macc for lup and ser objects fromthe br_gamma line by using relevant empirical relationships from the literaturethat connect hi line luminosity and lacc. to minimise the biases and also forself-consistency, we re-derived mass and age for each source using the same setof evolutionary tracks. we observe a correlation maccm*^2.2, similarly to whathas previously been observed in several star-forming clouds. the time variationof macc is roughly consistent with the expected evolution in viscous disks,with an asymptotic decay that behaves as t^-1.6. however, macc values arecharacterised by a large scatter at similar ages and are on average higher thanthe predictions of viscous models. although part of the scattering may berelated to the employed empirical relationship and to uncertainties on thesingle measurements, the general distribution and decay trend of the maccpoints are real. these findings might be indicative of a large variation in theinitial mass of the disks, of fairly different viscous laws among disks, ofvarying accretion regimes, and of other mechanisms that add to the dissipationof the disks, such as photo-evaporation.

1410.8304	empirical determination of einstein a-coefficient ratios of bright [fe  ii] lines	the einstein spontaneous rates (a-coefficients) of fe^+ lines have beencomputed by several authors, with results that differ from each other up to40%. consequently, models for line emissivities suffer from uncertainties whichin turn affect the determination of the physical conditions at the base of lineexcitation. we provide an empirical determination of the a-coefficient ratiosof bright [fe ii] lines, which would represent both a valid benchmark fortheoretical computations and a reference for the physical interpretation of theobserved lines. with the eso-vlt x-shooter instrument between 3,000 a, and24,700 a, we obtained a spectrum of the bright herbig-haro object hh1. wedetect around 100 [fe ii] lines, some of which with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;100. among these latter, we selected those emitted by the same level, whosede-reddened intensity ratio is a direct function of the einstein a-coefficientratios. from the same x-shooter spectrum, we got an accurate estimate of theextinction toward hh1 through intensity ratios of atomic species, hi,recombination lines and h_2 ro-vibrational transitions. we provide sevenreliable a-ooefficient ratios between bright [fe ii] lines, which are comparedwith the literature determinations. in particular, the a-coefficient ratiosinvolving the brightest near-infrared lines (12570a/16440a and 13209a/16440a)are better in agreement with the predictions by quinet et al. (1996)relativistic hartree-fock model. however, none of the theoretical modelspredicts a-coefficient ratios in agreement with all our determinations. we alsoshow that literature data of near-infrared intensity ratios better agree withour determinations than with theoretical expectations.

1501.05287	a long-lasting quiescence phase of the eruptive variable v1118 ori	v1118 ori is an eruptive variable belonging to the exor class of pre-mainsequence stars whose episodic outbursts are attributed to disk accretionevents. since 2006, v1118 ori is in the longest quiescence stage ever observedbetween two subsequent outbursts of its recent history. we presentnear-infrared photometry of v1118 ori carried out during the last eight years,along with a complete spectroscopic coverage from 0.35 to 2.5 um. a longtermsampling of v1118 ori in quiescence has never been done, hence we can benefitfrom the current circumstance to determine the lowest values (i.e. the zeroes)of the parameters to be used as a reference for evaluating the physical changestypical of more active phases. a quiescence mass accretion rate between 1--3$\times$ 10$^{-9}$ m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ can be derived and the difference withprevious determinations is discussed. from line emission and ir colors analysisa visual extinction of 1-2 mag is consistently derived, confirming that v1118ori (at least in quiescence) is a low-extinction t tauri star with a bolometricluminosity of about 2.1 l$_{\sun}$. an anti-correlation exists between theequivalent width of the emission lines and the underlying continuum. wesearched the literature for evaluating whether or not such a behaviour is acommon feature of the whole class. the anti-correlation is clearly recognizablefor all the available exors in the optical range (h$\beta$ and h$\alpha$lines), while it is not as much evident in the infrared (pa$\beta$ andbr$\gamma$ lines). the observed anti-correlation supports the accretion-drivenmechanism as the most likely to account for continuum variations.

0805.2841	ir diagnostics of embedded jets: velocity resolved observations of the  hh34 and hh1 jets	we present vlt-isaac medium resolution spectroscopy of the hh34 and hh1 jets.our aim is to derive the kinematics and the physical parameters and to studyhow they vary with jet velocity. we use several important diagnostic lines suchas [feii] 1.644um, 1.600um and h2 2.122um. in the inner jet region of hh34 wefind that both the atomic and molecular gas present two components at high andlow velocity. the [feii] lvc in hh34 is detected up to large distances from thesource (&gt;1000 au), at variance with ttauri jets. in h2 2.122um, the lvc and hvcare spatially separated. we detect, for the first time, the fainter red-shiftedcounterpart down to the central source. in hh1, we trace the jet down to ~1"from the vla1 driving source: the kinematics of this inner region is againcharacterised by the presence of two velocity components, one blue-shifted andone red-shifted with respect to the source lsr velocity. in the inner hh34 jetregion, ne increases with decreasing velocity. up to ~10" from the drivingsource, and along the whole hh1 jet an opposite behaviour is observed instead,with ne increasing with velocity. in both jets the mass flux is carried mainlyby the high-velocity gas. a comparison between the position velocity diagramsand derived electron densities with models for mhd jet launching mechanisms hasbeen performed for hh34. while the kinematical characteristics of the lineemission at the jet base can be, at least qualitatively, reproduced by bothx-winds and disc-wind models, none of these models can explain the extent ofthe lvc and the dependence of electron density with velocity that we observe.it is possible that the lvc in hh34 represents gas not directly ejected in thejet but instead denser ambient gas entrained by the high velocity collimatedjet.

1509.07730	first x-ray dectection of the young variable v1180 cas	v1180 cas is a young variable that has shown strong photometric fluctuations(delta_i~6mag) in the recent past, which have been attributed to events ofenhanced accretion. the source has entered a new high-brightness state insept.2013, which we have previously analyzed through optical and near-irspectroscopy. to investigate the current active phase of v1180 cas, weperformed observations with the chandra satellite to study the x-ray emissionfrom the object and its connection to accretion episodes. chandra observationswere performed in early aug.2014. complementary jhk photometry and j-bandspectra were taken at our campo imperatore facility to relate the x-ray andnear-ir emission from the target. we observe a peak of x-ray emission at thenominal position of v1180 cas. this signal corresponds to an x-ray luminosityl_x(0.5-7 kev) in the range 0.8-2.2e30 erg/s. based on the relatively shortduration of the dim states in the light curve and on stellar luminosityconsiderations, we explored the possibility that the brightness minima of v1180cas are driven by extinction variations. from the analysis of the spectralenergy distribution of the high state we infer a stellar luminosity of 0.8-0.9lsun and find that the derived l_x is comparable to the average x-rayluminosities of t tauri stars. moreover, the x-ray luminosity is lower than thex-ray emission levels of 5e30 -1e31 erg/s detected at outbursts in similarlow-mass objects. our analysis suggests that at least part of the photometricfluctuations of v1180 cas might be extinction effects rather than the result ofaccretion excess emission. however, as the source displays spectral featuresindicative of active accretion, we speculate that its photometric variationsmight be the result of a combination of accretion-induced and extinction-driveneffects, as suggested for other young variables, such as v1184 tau and v2492cyg.

astro-ph;0003031	iso spectroscopy of the hh 7-11 flow and its red-shifted counterpart	we have used the two spectrometers on the infrared space observatory toobserve the hh 7-11 flow, its red-shifted counterpart, and the candidateexciting source svs 13, in the star formation region ngc 1333. we detect atomic([oi]63um and 145um, [siii]34.8um, [cii]158um) and molecular (h_2, co, h_2o)lines at various positions along the bipolar flow.  most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock-excitedemission. in particular, our analysis shows that dissociative (j-type) andnon-dissociative (c-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere alongboth lobes of the flow. we confirm the low-excitation nature of the herbig-haronebulosities, with shock velocities &lt;40-50 km/s. toward both lobes of theoutflow we find pre-shock densities of n_0~10^4 cm-3 for both the j and ccomponents, implying b_0~100ug. in the central region of the flow, close to theexciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the c-shock component isn_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. we propose thatthe deficiency of gas-phase water in the post c-shock regions is due tofreezing onto warm grains processed through the j-shock front and travelingalong the magnetic field lines. the total observed cooling from thedissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slowmolecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral hi wind.  finally, the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears tobe weakly photo-ionised by bd +30 549, the dominant illuminating source of thengc 1333 reflection nebula.

astro-ph;0406262	on the excitation of the infrared knots in the hh99 outflow	we present near infrared (ir) spectra (0.98--2.5 mu m) from the group ofherbig-haro (hh) objects comprising hh99: a series of knots forming a bow,hh99b, and a separate knot, hh99a. observations of h2, [fe ii] and [c i] areused to constrain shock model parameters and determine the origin of theemission. previous work has shown that it is likely that the atomic and ionicemission arises in regions of higher ionization than the molecular emission. onthe basis of observations, it has often been suggested that the [fe ii] and [ci] emission could arise, for example, at the apex of a bow shock, with the h2emission produced in the wings. accordingly, we have combined models ofc-component and j-type shocks in order to reproduce the observed h2, [fe ii]and [c i] line spectra. we can account for the h2 emission towards the hh99bcomplex by means of j-type shocks with magnetic precursors. we derive shockvelocities of about 30 km s-1 and ages of order 100 yr; the pre-shock gas has adensity of approximately 10^4 cm-3 and the magnetic field is approximately 100mu g. the j-type shocks required to reproduce the intensities of the observed[fe ii] and [c i] lines have velocities of 50 km s-1. it is necessary to assumethat fe has been previously eroded from grains, probably by the earlier passageof a c-type shock wave. thus, our analysis supports the view that molecularoutflows are episodic phenomena whose observed emission arises in shock waves.

astro-ph;0408574	probing the embedded ysos of the r cra region through vlt-isaac  spectroscopy	near ir spectra obtained with isaac at vlt, have been used to poseconstraints on the evolutionary state and accretion properties of a sample offive embedded ysos located in the r cra core. this sample includes three classi sources (hh100 ir, irs2 and irs5), and two sources with nir excesses (irs6and irs3). absorption lines have been detected in the medium resolution spectraof all the observed targets, together with emission lines likely originating inthe disk-star-wind connected regions. we derived spectral types, veiling andstellar luminosity of the five observed sources, which in turn have been usedto infer their mass and age adopting pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. wefind that in hh100 ir and irs2 most of the bolometric luminosity is due toaccretion, while the other three investigated sources, including the class iobject irs5a, present a low accretion activity (l_{acc}/l_{bol} &lt; 0.2). weobserve a general correlation between the accretion luminosity, the ir veilingand the emission line activity of the sources. a correlation between theaccretion activity and the spectral energy distribution slope is recognizablebut with the notable exception of irs5a. our analysis therefore shows how thedefinition of the evolutionary stage of deeply embedded ysos by means of ircolors needs to be more carefully refined.

astro-ph;0512098	h2 active jets in the near ir as a probe of protostellar evolution	we present a nir analysis of a sample of h2 outflows from young embeddedsources to compare the physical properties and cooling mechanisms of thedifferent flows. the sample comprises 23 outflows driven by class 0 and isources having low-intermediate luminosity. we have obtained narrow band imagesin h2 2.12um and feii 1.64um and spectroscopic observations in the range1-2.5um. h2 line ratios have been used to estimate the visual extinction andaverage temperature of the molecular gas. av values range from 2 to 15mag;average temperatures range between 2000 and 4000k. in several knots astratification of temperatures is found with maximum values up to 5000k. such astratification is more commonly observed in those knots which also show feiiemission, while a thermalized gas at a single temperature is generally found inknots emitting only in molecular lines. combining narrow band imaging with theparameters derived from the spectral analysis, we are able to measure the totalluminosity of the h2 and feii shocked regions in each flow. h2 is the major ircoolant with an average l(h2)/l(feii) ratio of 10^{-2}. 83% of the sources havea l(h2)/l(bol) ratio of 0.04, irrespective of the class of the driving source,while a smaller group of sources have l(h2)/l(bol) an order of magnitudesmaller.such a separation reveals the non-homogeneous behaviour of classi,where sources with very different outflow activity can be found. this isconsistent with other studies showing that among classi one can find objectswith different accretion properties and it demonstrates that the h2 power inthe jet can be a powerful tool to identify the most active sources of thisclass.

astro-ph;0603388	evidence for t tauri-like emission in the exor v1118 ori from near-ir  and x-ray data	we present a near-ir study of the exor variable v1118 ori, performed byfollowing a slightly declining phase after a recent outburst. in particular,the near-ir (0.8 - 2.3 micron) spectrum, obtained for the first time, shows alarge variety of emission features of the hi and hei recombination and coovertone. by comparing the observed spectrum with a wind model, a mass lossrate value is derived along with other parameters whose values are typical ofan accreting t tauri star. in addition, we have used x-ray data from the xmmarchive, taken in two different epochs during the declining phase monitored inir. x-ray emission (in the range 0.5 - 10 kev) permits to derive severalparameters which confirm the t tauri nature of the source. in the near-ir theobject maintains a low visual extinction during all the activity phases,confirming that variable extinction does not contribute to brightnessvariations. the lack of both a significant amount of circumstellar material andany evidence of ir cooling from collimated jet/outflow driven by the source,indicates that, at least this member of the exor class, is in a late stage ofthe pre-main sequence evolution. in the x-ray regime, an evident fading ispresent, detected in the post-outburst phase, that cannot be reconciled withthe presence of any absorbing material. this circumstance, combined with thepersistence (in the pre- and post-outburst phases) of a temperature componentat about 10 mk, suggests that accretion has some influence in regulating thecoronal activity.

astro-ph;0607375	molecular line emission in hh54: a coherent view from near to far  infrared	aims. we present a detailed study of the infrared line emission (1-200micron) in the herbig-haro object hh54. our database comprises: high- (r~9000)and low- (r~600) resolution spectroscopic data in the near-infrared band (1-2.5micron); mid-infrared spectrophotometric images (5-12 micron); and, far-ir(45-200 micron, r~200) spectra acquired with the iso satellite. as a result, weprovide the detection of and the absolute fluxes for more than 60 molecularfeatures (mainly from h2 in the near- and mid-infrared and from h2o, co and ohin the far-infrared) and 23 ionic lines. methods. the h2 lines, coming fromlevels from v=0 to v=4 have been interpreted in the context of a state-of-artshock code, whose output parameters are adopted as input to a large velocitygradient computation in order to interpret the fir emission of co, h2o and oh.results. the h2 emission can be interpreted as originating in eithersteady-state j-type shocks or in quasi-steady j-type shocks with magneticprecursor. however, our multi-species analysis shows that only a model of aj-type shock with magnetic precursor (v_shock=18 km/s, n_h=10^4 cm^-3, b=100microg, age=400 yr) can account for both the observed h2 emission and the coand h2o lines. such a model predicts a h2o abundance of ~ 7 10^-5, in agreementwith estimations from other shock models for outflows associated with low massprotostars. we can exclude the possibility that the observed atomic lines arisein the same shock as the molecular lines, and give arguments in favour of thepresence of a further high-velocity, fully dissociative shock component in theregion. finally, in view of the forthcoming spectroscopic facilities on boardof the herschel satellite, we provide predictions for h2o lines considered tobe the most suitable for diagnostic purposes.

astro-ph;0609825	uves/vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb 050730 afterglow: probing  the features of the grb environment	we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of the opticalafterglow of grb050730, obtained with uves@vlt about hours after the grbtrigger. the spectrum shows that the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 3.967 iscomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorptionsystem. we detect strong cii*, siii*, oi* and feii* fine structure absorptionlines associated to the second and third component. for the first threecomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of thegrb explosion. component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not presentany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionizationfeatures, such as civ and ovi, suggesting that this component is very close tothe grb site. from the analysis of low and high ionization lines and finestructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from thesite of the grb explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. weevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. however, this should not be taken asrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to thehydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while thatof the other elements presumably comes from the ism closer to the grb site.furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modifysignificantly these values. the mean [c/fe] ratio agrees well with thatexpected by single star-formation event models. interestingly the [c/fe] ofcomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with grb dustdestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the grbsite.

astro-ph;0610037	warm sio gas in molecular bullets associated with protostellar outflows	in this paper we present the first sio multiline analysis (from j=2-1 toj=11-10) of the molecular bullets along the outflows of the class 0 sourcesl1448-mm and l1157-mm, obtained through observations with iram and jcmt. wehave computed the main physical parameters in each bullet and compared themwith other tracers of warm and dense gas and with models for the sio excitationin shocks. we find that the bullets close to l1448--mm, associated with highvelocity gas, have higher excitation conditions (n(h2) ~ 10^{6} cm^{-3}, t &gt;500 k) with respect to the l1157 bullets (n(h2) ~1-5 10^{5} cm^{-3}, t ~100-300 k). in both the sources, there is a clear evidence of the presence ofvelocity components having different excitation conditions, with the denserand/or warmer gas associated with the gas at the higher speed. in l1448 thebulk of the emission is due to the high-excitation and high velocity gas, whilein l1157 most of the emission comes from the low excitation gas at ambientvelocity. the observed velocity-averaged line ratios are well reproduced byshocks with speeds v_s larger than ~ 30 km/s and densities ~ 10^{5} - 10^{6}cm^{-3}. plane-parallel shock models, however, fail to predict all the observedline profiles and in particular the very similar profiles shown by both low andhigh excitation lines. the overall observations support the idea that the l1157clumps are shock interaction events older than the l1448 bullets close to thedriving source. in the latter objects, the velocity structure and thevariations of physical parameters with the velocity resemble very closely thosefound in optical/ir jets near the protostar, suggesting that similar launchingand excitation mechanisms are also at the origin of collimated jets seen atmillimetre wavelengths.

astro-ph;0610083	mapping molecular emission in vela molecular ridge cloud d	we present the 12co(1-0) and 13co(2-1) line maps obtained observing with thesest a $\sim 1\degr \times 1\degr$ region of the vela molecular ridge, cloud d.this cloud is part of an intermediate-mass star forming region that isrelatively close to the sun. our observations reveal, over a wide range ofspatial scales (from $\sim 0.1$ to a few parsecs), a variety of densestructures such as arcs, filaments and clumps, that are in many casesassociated with far-ir point-like sources, recognized as young stellar objectsand embedded star clusters. the velocity field analysis highlights the presenceof possible expanding shells, extending over several parsecs, probably relatedto the star forming activity of the cloud. furthermore, the analysis of theline shapes in the vicinity of the far-ir sources allowed the detection of 13molecular outflows. considering a hierarchical scenario for the gas structure,a cloud decomposition was obtained for both spectral lines by means of theclumpfind algorithm. the clumpfind output has been discussed critically and amethod is proposed to reasonably correct the list of the identified clumps. wefind that the corresponding mass spectrum shows a spectral index $\alpha\sim1.3\div 2.0$ and the derived clump masses are below the corresponding virialmasses. the mass-radius and velocity dispersion-radius relationships are alsobriefly discussed for the recovered clump population.

astro-ph;9909496	shock excited far-infrared molecular emission around t tau	the first complete far-infrared spectrum of t tau has been obtained with thelws spectrometer on-board the infrared space observatory, which detected strongemission from high-j (j=14-25) co, para- and ortho-h2o and oh transitions overthe wavelength range from 40 to 190 micron. most of the observed molecularemission can be explained by a single emission region at t~300-900 k andn(h_2)~10^(5-6) cm^(-3),with a diameter of about 2-3 arcsec. this correspondsto a very compact region of 300-400 au at the distance of 140 pc. an highertemperature component seems to be needed to explain the highest excitation coand water lines. we derive a water abundance of 1-7x10^(-5) and an oh abundanceof ~3x10^(-5) with respect to molecular hydrogen, implying water and ohenhancements by more than a factor of 10 with respect to the expected ambientgas abundance. the observed cooling in the various species amounts to 0.04l(sun),comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the outflow, indicating thatthe stellar winds could be responsible of the line excitation through shocks.in order to explain the observed molecular cooling in t tau in terms of c-typeshock models, we hypothesise that the strong far-ultraviolet radiation fieldphotodissociates water in favour of oh. this would explain the largeoverabundance of oh observed. the estimated relatively high density andcompactness of the observed emission suggest that it originates from the shockstaking place at the base of the molecular outflow emission, in the region wherethe action of the stellar winds from the two stars of the binary system isimportant.

0810.1651	atomic jets from class 0 sources detected by spitzer: the case of  l1448-c	we present spitzer-irs spectra obtained along the molecular jet from theclass 0 source l1448-c (or l1448-mm). atomic lines from the fundamentaltransitions of [feii], [siii] and [si] have been detected showing, for thefirst time, the presence of an embedded atomic jet at low excitation. purerotational h$_2$ lines are also detected, and a decrease of theatomic/molecular emission ratio is observed within 1 arcmin from the drivingsource. additional ground based spectra (ukirt/uist) were obtained to furtherconstrain the h$_2$ excitation along the jet axis and, combined with the 0--0lines, have been compared with bow-shock models. from the different lineratios, we find that the atomic gas is characterized by an electron density n_e~ 200-1000 cm^{-3}, a temperature t_e &lt; 2500 k and an ionization fraction &lt;~10^{-2}; the excitation conditions of the atomic jet are thus very differentfrom those found in more evolved class i and class ii jets. we also infer thatonly a fraction (0.05-0.2) of fe and si is in gaseous form, indicating thatdust still plays a major role in the depletion of refractory elements. acomparison with the sio abundance recently derived in the jet from an analysisof several sio sub-mm transitions, shows that the si/sio abundance ratio is~100, and thus that most of the silicon released from grains by sputtering andgrain-grain collisions remains in atomic form. finally, estimates of the atomicand molecular mass flux rates have been derived: values of the order of~10$^{-6}$ and ~10$^{-7}$ m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ are inferred from the[si]25$\mu$m and h$_2$ line luminosities, respectively. a comparison with themomentum flux of the co molecular outflow suggests that the detected atomic jethas the power to drive the large scale outflow.

0811.1164	near infrared spectroscopic monitoring of exor variables: first results	we present low resolution (r approximately 250) spectroscopy in the near-ir(0.8 to 2.5um) of the exor variables. these are the initial results (obtainedduring the period 2007-2008) from a long term photometric and spectroscopicprogram aimed to study the variability in the accretion processes of pre-mainsequence (pms) stars, by correlating the continuum fluctuations with thespectroscopical properties. eight sources have been observed in differentepochs, for a total of 25 acquired spectra. exor spectra show a wide variety ofemission features dominated by hi recombination (paschen and brackett series).we have investigated whether line and continuum variability could be due to avariable extinction, but such hypothesis is applicable only to the peculiarsource pv cep. by comparing the observed spectra with a wind model, mass lossrates in the range (2-10)x10^(-8) m_sun} yr^(-1) are derived, along with otherwind parameters. consistent results are also obtained by assuming that hi linesare due to accretion. co overtone is also detected in the majority of thesources both in absorption and in emission. it appears to come from regionsmore compact than winds, likely the stellar photosphere (when in absorption)and the circumstellar disk (when in emission). nai and cai ir lines behave asthe co does, thus they are thought to arise in the same locations. for sometargets multiple spectra correspond to different activity stages of the source.those exhibiting the largest continuum variation at 2um (deltak &gt; 1 mag)present a significant line flux fading during the continuum declining phases.in particular, co absorption (emission) appears associated to inactive (active)stages, respectively.
