0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

0906.4060	pre-main sequence variables in the vmr-d : identification of t  tauri-like accreting protostars through spitzer-irac variability	we present a study of the infrared variability of young stellar objects bymeans of two spitzer-irac images of the vela molecular cloud d (vmr-d) obtainedin observations separated in time by about six months. by using the samespace-born ir instrumentation, this study eliminates all the unwanted effectsusually unavoidable when comparing catalogs obtained from differentinstruments. the vmr-d map covers about 1.5 square deg. of a site where starformation is actively ongoing. we are interested in accreting pre-main sequencevariables whose luminosity variations are due to intermittent events of diskaccretion (i.e. active t tauri stars and exor type objects). the variableobjects have been selected from a catalog of more than 170,000 sources detectedat a s/n ratio &gt; 5. we searched the sample of variables for ones whosephotometric properties are close to those of known exor's. these latter aremonitored in a more systematic way than t tauri stars and the mechanisms thatregulate the observed phenomenology are exactly the same. hence the modalitiesof the exor behavior is adopted as driving criterium for selecting variables ingeneral. we selected 19 bona fide candidates that constitute a well-definedsample of new variable targets for further investigation. out of these, 10sources present a spitzer mips 24 micron counterpart, and have been classifiedas 3 class i, 5 flat spectrum and 2 class ii objects, while the other 9 sourceshave spectral energy distribution compatible with phases older than class i.this is consistent with what is known about the small sample of known exor's,and suggests that the accretion flaring or exor stage might come as a classi/ii transition. we present also new prescriptions that can be useful in futuresearches for accretion variables in large ir databases.

0911.1686	the globular cluster ngc 5286. ii. variable stars	we present the results of a search for variable stars in the globular clusterngc 5286, which has recently been suggested to be associated with the canismajor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. 57 variable stars were detected, only 19 ofwhich had previously been known. among our detections one finds 52 rr lyrae (22rrc and 30 rrab), 4 lpv's, and 1 type ii cepheid of the bl herculis type.periods are derived for all of the rr lyrae as well as the cepheid, and bvlight curves are provided for all the variables.  the mean period of the rrab variables is &lt;pab&gt; = 0.656 days, and the numberfraction of rrc stars is n(c)/n(rr) = 0.42, both consistent with an oosterhoffii (ooii) type -- thus making ngc 5286 one of the most metal-rich ([fe/h] =-1.67; harris 1996) ooii globulars known to date. the minimum period of the\rrab's, namely pab,min = 0.513 d, while still consistent with an ooiiclassification, falls towards the short end of the observed pab,mindistribution for ooii globular clusters. as was recently found in the case ofthe prototypical ooii globular cluster m15 (ngc 7078), the distribution ofstars in the bailey diagram does not strictly conform to the previouslyreported locus for ooii stars.  we provide fourier decomposition parameters for all of the rr lyrae starsdetected in our survey, and discuss the physical parameters derived therefrom.the values derived for the rrc's are not consistent with those typically foundfor ooii clusters, which may be due to the cluster's relatively highmetallicity -- the latter being confirmed by our fourier analysis of theab-type rr lyrae light curves. we derive for the cluster a revised distancemodulus of (m-m)v = 16.04 mag.

1002.3365	mid-infrared variability from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	we use the multi-epoch, mid-infrared spitzer deep, wide-field survey toinvestigate the variability of 474,179 objects in 8.1 deg^2 of the ndwfs bootesfield. we perform a difference image analysis of the four available epochsbetween 2004 and 2008, focusing on the deeper 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. we findthat 1.1% of the studied sample meet our standard selection criteria for beingclassed as a variable source. we require that the 3.6 and 4.5 micronlight-curves are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.8) and that their joint varianceexceeds that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2 sigma. we thenexamine the mid-ir colors of the variable sources and match them with x-raysources from the xbootes survey, radio catalogs, 24 micron-selected agncandidates, and spectroscopically identified agns from the agn and galaxyevolution survey (ages). based on their mid-ir colors, most of the variablesources are agns (76%), with smaller contributions from stars (11%), galaxies(6%), and unclassified objects. most of the stellar, galaxy and unclassifiedsources are false positives. for our standard selection criteria, 11-12% of themid-ir counterparts to x-ray sources, 24 micron-selected agn candidates andspectroscopically identified agns show variability. mid-ir agn variability canbe well described by a single power-law structure function with a power-lawindex of 0.5 at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and an amplitude of 0.1 mag onrest-frame time scales of 2 years. the variability amplitude is higher forshorter rest-frame wavelengths and lower luminosities.

0708.0405	variable stars in the fornax dsph galaxy. i. the globular cluster fornax  4	variable stars have been identified for the first time in fornax 4, theglobular cluster located near the center of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy.by applying the image subtraction technique to b,v time series photometryobtained with the magic camera of the 6.5-m magellan/clay telescope and withthe wide field imager of the 4-m blanco/ctio telescope, we detected 27 rr lyraestars (22 fundamental mode, 3 first overtone, and 2 double-mode pulsators) in a2.4'x2.4' area centered on fornax 4. the average and minimum periods of theab-type rr lyrae stars, &lt;pab&gt;= 0.594 d and p(ab,min)=0.5191 d, respectively, aswell as the revised position of the cluster in the horizontal branchtype--metallicity plane, all consistently point to an oosterhoff-intermediatestatus for the cluster, unlike what is seen for the vast majority of galacticglobular clusters, but in agreement with previous indications for the otherglobular clusters in fornax.  the average apparent magnitude of the rr lyrae stars located within 30 arcsecfrom the cluster center is &lt;v(rr)&gt;=21.43 +/- 0.03 mag (sigma=0.10 mag, averageon 12 stars), leading to a true distance modulus of (m-m)o=20.64 +/- 0.09 magor (m-m)o=20.53 +/- 0.09 mag, depending on whether a low ([fe/h]=-2.0) or amoderately high ([fe/h]=-1.5) metallicity is adopted.

1004.2559	on the stellar content of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present u,b,v,i photometry of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based onmore than 4,000 ccd images. special attention was given to the photometriccalibration, and the precision for the b,v,i bands is better than 0.01 mag. wecompared in the v,b-v and v,b-i color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) carina withthree globular clusters (gcs, m53, m55, m79). we find that only the moremetal-poor gcs (m55, [fe/h]=-1.85; m53, [fe/h]=-2.02 dex) provide a good matchwith the carina giant branch. we performed a similar comparison in the v,v-icmd with three smc intermediate-age clusters (iacs, kron3, ngc339, lindsay38).we find that the color extent of the sgb of the two more metal-rich iacs(kron3, [fe/h]=-1.08; ngc339, [fe/h]=-1.36 dex) is smaller than the range amongcarina's intermediate-age stars. however, the ridge line of the more metal-pooriac (lindsay38, [fe/h]=-1.59 dex) agrees quite well with the carinaintermediate-age stars. these findings indicate that carina's old stellarpopulation is metal-poor and seems to have a limited spread in metallicity(delta [fe/h]=0.2--0.3 dex). carina intermediate-age stars can hardly be moremetal-rich than lindsay38 and its spread in metallicity appears modest. we alsofind that the synthetic cmd constructed assuming a metallicity spread of 0.5dex for intermediate-age stars predicts evolutionary features not supported byobservations. the above results are at odds with recent spectroscopicinvestigations suggesting that carina stars cover a broad range in metallicity(delta [fe/h]~1--2 dex). we present a new method to estimate the metallicity ofcomplex stellar systems using the difference in color between the red clump andthe middle of the rr lyrae instability strip. the observed colors of carina'sevolved stars indicate a metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.70+-0.19 dex, which agreesquite well with spectroscopic measurements.

1005.1506	mapping the column density and dust temperature structure of irdcs with  herschel	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are cold and dense reservoirs of gas potentiallyavailable to form stars. many of these clouds are likely to be pristinestructures representing the initial conditions for star formation. the studypresented here aims to construct and analyze accurate column density and dusttemperature maps of irdcs by using the first herschel data from the hi-galgalactic plane survey. these fundamental quantities, are essential forunderstanding processes such as fragmentation in the early stages of theformation of stars in molecular clouds. we have developed a simplepixel-by-pixel sed fitting method, which accounts for the background emission.by fitting a grey-body function at each position, we recover the spatialvariations in both the dust column density and temperature within the irdcs.this method is applied to a sample of 22 irdcs exhibiting a range of angularsizes and peak column densities. our analysis shows that the dust temperaturedecreases significantly within irdcs, from background temperatures of 20-30 kto minimum temperatures of 8-15 k within the clouds, showing that densemolecular clouds are not isothermal. temperature gradients have most likely animportant impact on the fragmentation of irdcs. local temperature minima arestrongly correlated with column density peaks, which in a few cases reach nh2 =1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, identifying these clouds as candidate massive prestellarcores. applying this technique to the full hi-gal data set will provideimportant constraints on the fragmentation and thermal properties of irdcs, andhelp identify hundreds of massive prestellar core candidates.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1005.3317	clouds, filaments and protostars: the herschel hi-gal milky way	we present the first results from the science demonstration phase for thehi-gal survey, the herschel key-project that will map the inner galactic planeof the milky way in 5 bands. we outline our data reduction strategy and presentsome science highlights on the two observed 2{\deg} x 2{\deg} tilesapproximately centered at l=30{\deg} and l=59{\deg}. the two regions areextremely rich in intense and highly structured extended emission which shows awidespread organization in filaments. source seds can be built for hundreds ofobjects in the two fields, and physical parameters can be extracted, for a goodfraction of them where the distance could be estimated. the compact sources(which we will call 'cores' in the following) are found for the most part to beassociated with the filaments, and the relationship to the local beam-averagedcolumn density of the filament itself shows that a core seems to appear when athreshold around a_v of about 1 is exceeded for the regions in the l=59{\deg}field; a a_v value between 5 and 10 is found for the l=30{\deg} field, likelydue to the relatively larger distances of the sources. this outlines anexciting scenario where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments, whichlater fragment to cores where the column density has reached a critical level.in spite of core l/m ratios being well in excess of a few for many sources, wefind core surface densities between 0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. our results are ingood agreement with recent mhd numerical simulations of filaments forming fromlarge-scale converging flows.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

0709.1060	spitzer-mips survey of the young stellar content in the vela molecular  cloud-d	a new, unbiased spitzer-mips imaging survey (~1.8 square degs) of the youngstellar content of the vela molecular cloud-d is presented. the survey iscomplete down to 5mjy and 250mjy at 24micron (mu) and 70mu, respectively. 849sources are detected at 24mu and 52 of them also have a 70mu counterpart. thevmr-d region is one that we have already partially mapped in dust and gasmillimeter emission, and we discuss the correlation between the spitzer compactsources and the mm contours. about half of the 24mu sources are located insidethe region delimited by the 12co(1-0) contours (corresponding to only one thirdof the full area mapped with mips) with a consequent density increase of about100% of the 24mu sources [four times for 70mu ones] moving from outside toinside the co contours. about 400 sources have a 2mass counterpart. so we haveconstructed a ks vs. ks-[24] diagram and identified the protostellarpopulation. we find an excess of class i sources in vmr-d in comparison withother star forming regions. this result is reasonably biased by the sensitivitylimits, or, alternatively, may reflect a very short lifetime (&lt;=10^6yr) of theprotostellar content in this cloud. the mips images have identified embeddedcool objects in most of the previously identified starless cores; in addition,there are 6 very young, possibly class 0 objects identified. finally we reportfinding of the driving sources for a set of five out of six very compactprotostellar jets previously discovered in near-infrared images.

1101.3154	the initial conditions of high-mass star formation: radiative transfer  models of irdcs seen in the herschel hi-gal survey	the densest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) may represent the earliestobservable stage of high-mass star formation. these clouds are very cold, hencethey emit mainly at far-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths. for the first time,herschel has provided multi-wavelength, spatially resolved observations ofcores within irdcs, which, when combined with radiative transfer modelling, canconstrain their properties, such as mass, density profile and dust temperature.we use a 3d, multi-wavelength monte carlo radiative transfer code to model indetail the emission from six cores in three typical irdcs seen in the hi-galsurvey (g030.50+00.95, g031.03+00.26 and g031.03+00.76), and thereby todetermine the properties of these cores and compare them with their low-massequivalents. we found masses ranging from 90 to 290 solar masses withtemperatures from 8 to 11k at the centre of each core and 18 to 28k at thesurface. the maximum luminosity of an embedded star within each core wascalculated, and we rule out the possibility of significant high mass starformation having yet occurred in three of our cores.

1101.4977	exploreneos iii: physical characterization of 65 low-deltav neos	space missions to neos are being planned at all major space agencies, andrecently a manned mission to an neo was announced as a nasa goal. efforts tofind and select suitable targets (plus backup targets) are severely hampered byour lack of knowledge of the physical properties of dynamically favorable neos.in particular, current mission scenarios tend to favor primitive low-albedoobjects. for the vast majority of neos the albedo is unknown.  here we report new constraints on the size and albedo of 65 neos withrendezvous deltav &lt; 7 km/s. our results are based on thermal-ir flux dataobtained in the framework of our ongoing (2009--2011) exploreneos survey(trilling et al. 2010) using nasa's "warm spitzer" space telescope. as of 2010july 14, we have results for 293 objects in hand (including the 65 low-deltavneos presented here); before the end of 2011 we expect to have measured thesize and albedo of ~ 700 neos (including probably ~ 160 low-deltav neos).  while there are reasons to believe that primitive volatile-rich materials areuniversally low in albedo, the converse need not be true: the orbital evolutionof some dark objects likely has caused them to lose their volatiles by comingtoo close to the sun. for all our targets, we give the closest periheliondistance they are likely to have reached (using orbital integrations frommarchi et al. 2009) and corresponding upper limits on the past surfacetemperature. low-deltav objects for which both albedo and thermal history maysuggest a primitive composition include (162998) 2001 sk162, (68372) 2001 pm9,and (100085) 1992 uy4.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1202.0395	cores in infra-red dark clouds (irdcs) seen in the hi-gal survey between  l = 300{\deg} and l = 330{\deg}	we have used data taken as part of the herschel infrared galactic planesurvey (hi-gal) to study 3171 infrared-dark cloud (irdc) candidates that wereidentified in the mid-infrared (8 {\mu}m) by spitzer (we refer to these as'spitzer-dark' regions). they all lie in the range l=300 - 330 \circ and |b| 61 \circ. of these, only 1205 were seen in emission in the far-infrared (250-500{\mu}m) by herschel (we call these 'herschel-bright' clouds). it is predictedthat a dense cloud will not only be seen in absorption in the mid-infrared, butwill also be seen in emission in the far-infrared at the longest herschelwavebands (250-500 {\mu}m). if a region is dark at all wavelengths throughoutthe mid-infrared and far-infrared, then it is most likely to be simply a regionof lower background infrared emission (a 'hole in the sky'). hence, it appearsthat previous surveys, based on spitzer and other mid-infrared data alone, mayhave over-estimated the total irdc population by a factor of 2. this hasimplications for estimates of the star formation rate in irdcs in the galaxy.westudied the 1205 herschel-bright irdcs at 250 {\mu}m, and found that 972 ofthem had at least one clearly defined 250-{\mu}m peak, indicating that theycontained one or more dense cores. of these, 653 (67 per cent) contained an8-{\mu}m point source somewhere within the cloud, 149 (15 per cent) contained a24-{\mu}m point source but no 8-{\mu}m source, and 170 (18 per cent) containedno 24-{\mu}m or 8-{\mu}m point sources. we use these statistics to makeinferences about the lifetimes of the various evolutionary stages of irdcs.

1203.0568	infrared colors of the gamma-ray detected blazars	blazars constitute the most enigmatic class of extragalactic gamma-raysources, and their observational features have been ascribed to a relativisticjet closely aligned to the line of sight. they are generally divided in twomain classes: the bl lac objects (bl lacs) and the flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). in the case of bl lacs the double bumped spectral energy distribution(sed) is generally described by the synchrotron self compton (ssc) emission,while for the fsrqs it is interpreted as due to external compton (ec) emission.recently, we showed that in the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] micron color- color diagramthe blazar population covers a distinct region (i.e., the wise blazar strip,wbs), clearly separated from the other extragalactic sources that are dominatedby thermal emission. in this paper we investigate the relation between theinfrared and gamma-ray emission for a subset of confirmed blazars from theliterature, associated with fermi sources, for which wise archival observationsare available. this sample is a proper subset of the sample of sources usedpreviously, and the availability of fermi data is critical to constrain themodels on the emission mechanisms for the blazars. we found that the selectedblazars also lie on the wise blazar strip covering a narrower region of theinfrared color-color planes than the overall blazars population. we then foundan evident correlation between the ir and gamma-ray spectral indices expectedin the ssc and ec frameworks. finally, we determined the ratio between theirgamma-ray and infrared fluxes, a surrogate of the ratio of powers between theinverse compton and the synchrotron sed components, and used such parameter totest different emitting scenarios blazars.

0704.3609	the local galaxy 8 micron luminosity function	a sst survey in the noao deep-wide field in bo\"otes provides a complete,8-micron-selected sample of galaxies to a limiting (vega) magnitude of 13.5. inthe 6.88 deg$^2$ field sampled, 79% of the 4867 galaxies have spectroscopicredshifts, allowing an accurate determination of the local (z&lt;0.3) galaxyluminosity function. stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis ofobserved galaxy colors. dust emission (mostly pah) accounts for 80% of the 8micron luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19%, and agn emissionaccounts for roughly 1 %. a sub-sample of the 8 micron-selected galaxies haveblue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant pah emission.the luminosity functions for the total 8 micron luminosity and for the dustemission alone are both well fit by schechter functions. for the 8 micronluminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is \nu l_{\nu}^*(8.0\micron) = 1.8 \times 10^{10}$ \lsun while for the dust emission alone it is1.6 x 10^{10}$ \lsun\null. the average 8 \micron luminosity density at z&lt;0.3 is3.1 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}, and the average luminosity density from dust aloneis 2.5 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}. this luminos ity arises predominantly fromgalaxies with 8 \micron luminosities ($\nu l_{\nu}$) between $2\times 10^9$ and$2 x 10^{10}$ \lsun, i.e., normal galaxies, not lirgs or ulirgs.

(correctedaccording to bonifacio et al.) interstellar dust maps. differential reddeningacross the face of the cluster, which we find to be present at the level ofdelta e(b-v) ~ 0.17 mag, is taken into account in our analysis. we measureseveral metallicity indicators based on the position of the red giant branch(rgb) in the cluster cmd. these give a metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.38 +/- 0.07in the zinn &amp; west scale and [fe/h] = -1.28 +/- 0.08 in the new carretta et al.(uves) scale. we also provide measurements of other important photometricparameters for this cluster, including the position of the rgb luminosityfunction "bump" and the horizontal branch (hb) morphology. we compare the ngc6402 ridgeline with the one for ngc 5904 (m5) derived by sandquist et al., andfind evidence that ngc 6402 and m5 have approximately the same age, to withinthe uncertainties -- although the possibility that m14 may be slighlty oldercannot be ruled out.

1307.6224	diagnostics of agn-driven molecular outflows in ulirgs from  herschel-pacs observations of oh at 119um	we report on our observations of the 79 and 119um doublet transitions of ohfor 24 local (z&lt;0.262) ulirgs observed with herschel-pacs as part of theherschel ulirg survey (herus). some oh119 profiles display a clear p-cygnishape and therefore imply outflowing oh gas, other profiles are predominantlyin absorption or are completely in emission. we find that the relative strengthof the oh emission component decreases as the silicate absorption increases.this locates the oh outflows inside the obscured nuclei. the maximum outflowvelocities for our sources range from less than 100 to 2000 km/s, with 15/24(10/24) sources showing oh absorption at velocities exceeding 700 km/s (1000km/s). three sources show maximum oh outflow velocities exceeding that ofmrk231. since outflow velocities above 500-700 km/s are thought to require anactive galactic nucleus (agn) to drive them, about 2/3 of our ulirg sample mayhost agn-driven molecular outflows. this finding is supported by thecorrelation we find between the maximum oh outflow velocity and the ir-derivedbolometric agn luminosity. no such correlation is found with the ir-derivedstar formation rate. the highest outflow velocities are found among sourceswhich are still deeply embedded. we speculate that the molecular outflows inthese sources may be in an early phase of disrupting the nuclear dust veilbefore these sources evolve into less obscured agn. four of our sources showhigh-velocity wings in their [c ii] fine-structure line profiles implyingneutral gas outflow masses of at least 2-4.5 x 10^8 msun.

1405.3854	the historical vanishing of the blazhko effect of rr lyr from geos and  kepler surveys	rr lyr is one of the most studied variable stars. its light curve has beenregularly monitored since the discovery of the periodic variability in 1899.analysis of all observed maxima allows us to identify two primary pulsationstates defined as pulsation over a long (p0 longer than 0.56684 d) and a short(p0 shorter than 0.56682 d) primary pulsation period. these states alternatewith intervals of 13-16 yr, and are well defined after 1943. the 40.8 dperiodical modulations of the amplitude and the period (i.e. blazhko effect)were noticed in 1916. we provide homogeneous determinations of the blazhkoperiod in the different primary pulsation states. the blazhko period does notfollow the variations of p0 and suddenly diminished from 40.8 d to around 39.0d in 1975. the monitoring of these periodicities deserved and deserves acontinuous and intensive observational effort. for this purpose we have builtdedicated, transportable and autonomous small instruments, very tiny telescopes(vtts), to observe the times of maximum brightness of rr lyr. as immediateresults the vtts recorded the last change of p0 state in mid-2009 and extendedthe time coverage of the kepler observations, thus recording a maximum o-camplitude of the blazhko effect at the end of 2008, followed by thehistorically smallest o-c amplitude in late 2013. this decrease is stillongoing and vtt instruments are ready to monitor the expected increase in thenext few years.

1412.4694	high-lying oh absorption, [c ii] deficits, and extreme  $l_{\mathrm{fir}}/m_{\mathrm{h2}}$ ratios in galaxies	herschel/pacs observations of 29 local (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies,including both starburst and agn-dominated sources as diagnosed in themid-infrared/optical, show that the equivalent width of the absorbing oh 65 umpi_{3/2} j=9/2-7/2 line (w_{eq}(oh65)) with lower level energy e_{low}~300 k,is anticorrelated with the [c ii]158 um line to far-infrared luminosity ratio,and correlated with the far-infrared luminosity per unit gas mass and with the60-to-100 um far-infrared color. while all sources are in the activel_{ir}/m_{h2}&gt;50 lsun/msun mode as derived from previous co line studies, theoh65 absorption shows a bimodal distribution with a discontinuity atl_{fir}/m_{h2}~100 lsun/msun. in the most buried sources, oh65 probes materialpartially responsible for the silicate 9.7 um absorption. combined withobservations of the oh 71 um pi_{1/2} j=7/2-5/2 doublet (e_{low}~415 k),radiative transfer models characterized by the equivalent dust temperature,tdust, and the continuum optical depth at 100 um, tau_{100}, indicate thatstrong [c ii]158 um deficits are associated with far-ir thick (tau_{100}&gt;~0.7,n_{h}&gt;~10^{24} cm^{-2}), warm (tdust&gt;~60 k) structures where the oh 65 umabsorption is produced, most likely in circumnuclear disks/tori/cocoons. withtheir high l_{fir}/m_{h2} ratios and columns, the presence of these structuresis expected to give rise to strong [c ii] deficits. w_{eq}(oh65) probes thefraction of infrared luminosity arising from these compact/warm environments,which is &gt;~30-50% in sources with high w_{eq}({oh65}). sources with highw_{eq}({oh65}) have surface densities of both l_{ir} and m_{h2} higher thaninferred from the half-light (co or uv/optical) radius, tracing coherentstructures that represent the most buried/active stage of (circum)nuclearstarburst-agn co-evolution.

1501.02985	the herschel comprehensive (u)lirg emission survey (hercules): co  ladders, fine structure lines, and neutral gas cooling	(ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ((u)lirgs) are objects characterized bytheir extreme infrared (8-1000 $\mu$m) luminosities ($l_{lirg}&gt;10^{11}$l$_\odot$ and $l_{ulirg}&gt;10^{12}$ l$_\odot$). the herschel comprehensive ulirgemission survey (hercules; pi van der werf) presents a representativeflux-limited sample of 29 (u)lirgs that spans the full luminosity range ofthese objects (10$^{11}\leq l_\odot \geq10^{13}$). with the \emph{herschelspace observatory}, we observe [cii] 157 $\mu$m, [oi] 63 $\mu$m, and [oi] 145$\mu$m line emission with pacs, co j=4-3 through j=13-12, [ci] 370 $\mu$m, and[ci] 609 $\mu$m with spire, and low-j co transitions with ground-basedtelescopes. the co ladders of the sample are separated into three classes basedon their excitation level. in 13 of the galaxies, the [oi] 63 $\mu$m emissionline is self absorbed. comparing the co excitation to the iras 60/100 $\mu$mratio and to far infrared luminosity, we find that the co excitation is morecorrelated to the far infrared colors. we present cooling budgets for thegalaxies and find fine-structure line flux deficits in the [cii], [siii], [oi],and [ci] lines in the objects with the highest far ir fluxes, but do notobserve this for co $4\leq j_{upp}\leq13$. in order to study the heating of themolecular gas, we present a combination of three diagnostic quantities to helpdetermine the dominant heating source. using the co excitation, the co j=1-0linewidth, and the agn contribution, we conclude that galaxies with large colinewidths always have high-excitation co ladders, and often low agncontributions, suggesting that mechanical heating is important.

0804.4491	the mid-infrared colors of the ism and extended sources at the galactic  center	a mid-infrared (3.6-8 um) survey of the galactic center has been carried outwith the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. this survey covers thecentral 2x1.4 degree (~280x200 pc) of the galaxy. at 3.6 and 4.5 um theemission is dominated by stellar sources, the fainter ones merging into anunresolved background. at 5.8 and 8 um the stellar sources are fainter, andlarge-scale diffuse emission from the ism of the galaxy's central molecularzone becomes prominent. the survey reveals that the 8 to 5.8 um color of theism emission is highly uniform across the surveyed region. this uniform coloris consistent with a flat extinction law and emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs). models indicate that this broadband color should not beexpected to change if the incident radiation field heating the dust and pahs is&lt;10^4 times that of the solar neighborhood. the few regions with unusually redemission are areas where the pahs are underabundant and the radiation field islocally strong enough to heat large dust grains to produce significant 8 umemission. these red regions include compact h ii regions, sgr b1, and widerregions around the arches and quintuplet clusters. in these regions theradiation field is &gt;10^4 times that of the solar neighborhood. other regions ofvery red emission indicate cases where thick dust clouds obscure deeplyembedded objects or very early stages of star formation.

astro-ph;0508650	homogeneous photometry v: the globular cluster ngc 4147	new bvri broad-band photometry and astrometry are presented for the globularcluster ngc 4147, based upon measurements derived from 524 ground-based ccdimages mostly either donated by colleagues or retrieved from public archives.we have also reanalysed five exposures of the cluster obtained with wfpc2 onthe hubble space telescope in the f439w and f555w (b and v) filters. we presentcalibrated color-magnitude and color-color diagrams. analysis of thecolor-magnitude diagram reveals morphogical properties generally consistentwith published metal-abundance estimates for the cluster, and an age typical ofother galactic globular clusters of similar metallicity. we have alsoredetermined the periods and mean magnitudes for the rr lyrae variables,including a new c-type variable reported here for the first time. our data donot show clear evidence for photometric variability in candidate v18, recentlyreported by arellano ferro et al. (2004). these observations also support thenon-variable status of candidates v5, v9, and v15. the union of our light-curvedata with those of newburn (1957), mannino (1957) and arellano ferro et al.(op. cit.) permits the derivation of significantly improved periods. the meanperiods and the bailey period-amplitude diagrams support the classification ofthe cluster as oosterhoff i despite its predominantly blue horizontal branch.the number ratio of c- to ab-type rr lyrae stars, on the other hand, isunusually high for an oosterhoff i cluster. the calibrated results have beenmade available through the first author's web site.

astro-ph;0512215	irs spectra of two ultraluminous infrared galaxies at z=1.3	we present low-resolution (64 &lt; r &lt; 124) mid-infrared (8--38 micron)spitzer/irs spectra of two z~1.3 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lfir~10^13)discovered in a spitzer/mips survey of the bootes field of the noao deepwide-field survey (ndwfs). mips j142824.0+352619 is a bright 160 micron sourcewith a large infrared-to-optical flux density ratio and a possible lensingamplification of &lt;~10. the 6.2, 7.7, 11.3, and 12.8 micron pah emission bandsin its irs spectrum indicate a redshift of z~1.3. the large equivalent width ofthe 6.2 micron pah feature indicates that at least 50% of the mid-infraredenergy is generated in a starburst, an interpretation that is supported by alarge [neii]/[neiii] ratio and a low upper limit on the x-ray luminosity. sst24j142827.19+354127.71 has the brightest 24 micron flux (10.55 mjy) amongoptically faint (r &gt; 20) galaxies in the ndwfs. its mid-infrared spectrum lacksemission features, but the broad 9.7 micron silicate absorption band placesthis source at z~1.3. given this redshift, sst24 j142827.19+354127.71 has amongthe largest rest-frame 5 micron luminosities known. the similarity of its sedto those of known agn-dominated ulirgs and its lack of either pah features orlarge amounts of cool dust indicate that the powerful mid-infrared emission isdominated by an active nucleus rather than a starburst. our results illustratethe power of the irs in identifying massive galaxies in the ``redshift desert''and in discerning their power sources. because they are bright, mipsj142824.0+352619 (pending future observations to constrain its lensingamplification) and sst24 j142827.19+354127.71 are useful z&gt;1 templates of ahigh luminosity starburst and agn, respectively.

astro-ph;0602198	the agn contribution to the mid-ir emission of luminous infrared  galaxies	we determine the contribution of agn to the mid-ir emission of luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs) at z&gt;0.6 by measuring the mid-ir dust continuum slopeof 20,039 mid-ir sources. the 24 micron sources are selected from aspitzer/mips survey of the noao deep wide-field survey bo\"otes field and havecorresponding 8 micron data from the irac shallow survey. there is a clearbimodal distribution in the 24 micron to 8 micron flux ratio. the x-raydetected sources fall within the peak corresponding to a flat spectrum innufnu, implying that it is populated by agn-dominated lirgs, whereas the peakcorresponding to a higher 24 micron to 8 micron flux ratio is likely due tolirgs whose infrared emission is powered by starbursts. the 24 micron emissionis increasingly dominated by agn at higher 24 micron flux densities (f_24): theagn fraction of the z&gt;0.6 sources increases from ~9% at f_24 ~ 0.35 mjy to74+/-20% at f_24 ~ 3 mjy in good agreement with model predictions. deep 24micron, small area surveys, like goods, will be strongly dominated by starburstgalaxies. agn are responsible for ~ 3-7% of the total 24 micron background.

astro-ph;0606092	analysis of rr lyrae stars in the northern sky variability survey	we use data from the northern sky variability survey (nsvs), obtained fromthe first generation robotic optical transient search experiment (rotse-i), toidentify and study rr lyrae variable stars in the solar neighborhood. weinitially identified 1197 rrab (rr0) candidate stars brighter than the rotsemedian magnitude v = 14. periods, amplitudes, and mean v magnitudes aredetermined for a subset of 1188 rrab stars with well defined light curves.metallicities are determined for 589 stars by the fourier parameter method andby the relationship between period, amplitude, and [fe/h]. we comment upon thedifficulties of clearly classifying rrc (rr1) variables in the nsvs dataset.distances to the rrab stars are calculated using an adoptedluminosity-metallicity relation with corrections for interstellar extinction.the 589 rrab stars in our final sample are used to study the properties of therrab population within 5 kpc of the sun. the bailey diagram of period versusamplitude shows that the largest component of this sample belongs to oosterhofftype i. metal-rich ([fe/h] &gt; -1) rrab stars appear to be associated with thegalactic disk. our metal-rich rrab sample may include a thin disk as well as athick disk population, although the uncertainties are too large to establishthis. there is some evidence among the metal-rich rrab stars for a decline inscale height with increasing [fe/h], as was found by layden (1995). thedistribution of rrab stars with -1 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -1.25 indicates that within thismetallicity range the rrab stars are a mixture of stars belonging to halo anddisk populations.

astro-ph;0607272	aegis: enhancement of dust-enshrouded star formation in close galaxy  pairs and merging galaxies up to z ~ 1	using data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and hst/acs imaging in theextended groth strip, we select nearly 100 interacting galaxy systems includingkinematic close pairs and morphologically identified merging galaxies. spitzermips 24 micron fluxes of these systems reflect the current dusty star formationactivity, and at a fixed stellar mass (m_{*}) the median infrared luminosity(l_{ir}) among merging galaxies and close pairs of blue galaxies is twice (1.9+/- 0.4) that of control pairs drawn from isolated blue galaxies. enhancementdeclines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs and mergers andweaker in wide pairs compared to the control sample. at z ~ 0.9, 7.1% +/- 4.3%of massive interacting galaxies (m_{*} &gt; 2*10^{10} m_{solar}) are found to beulirgs, compared to 2.6% +/- 0.7% in the control sample. the large spread of irluminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting galaxies suggests that thisenhancement may depend on the merger stage as well as other as yet unidentifiedfactors (e.g., galaxy structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics, presenceof agn or bar). the contribution of interacting systems to the total irluminosity density is moderate (&lt;= 36 %).

astro-ph;9909496	shock excited far-infrared molecular emission around t tau	the first complete far-infrared spectrum of t tau has been obtained with thelws spectrometer on-board the infrared space observatory, which detected strongemission from high-j (j=14-25) co, para- and ortho-h2o and oh transitions overthe wavelength range from 40 to 190 micron. most of the observed molecularemission can be explained by a single emission region at t~300-900 k andn(h_2)~10^(5-6) cm^(-3),with a diameter of about 2-3 arcsec. this correspondsto a very compact region of 300-400 au at the distance of 140 pc. an highertemperature component seems to be needed to explain the highest excitation coand water lines. we derive a water abundance of 1-7x10^(-5) and an oh abundanceof ~3x10^(-5) with respect to molecular hydrogen, implying water and ohenhancements by more than a factor of 10 with respect to the expected ambientgas abundance. the observed cooling in the various species amounts to 0.04l(sun),comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the outflow, indicating thatthe stellar winds could be responsible of the line excitation through shocks.in order to explain the observed molecular cooling in t tau in terms of c-typeshock models, we hypothesise that the strong far-ultraviolet radiation fieldphotodissociates water in favour of oh. this would explain the largeoverabundance of oh observed. the estimated relatively high density andcompactness of the observed emission suggest that it originates from the shockstaking place at the base of the molecular outflow emission, in the region wherethe action of the stellar winds from the two stars of the binary system isimportant.

0810.0682	the globular cluster ngc 5286. i. a new ccd bv color-magnitude diagram	we present bv photometry of the galactic globular cluster ngc 5286, based on128 v frames and 133 b frames, and covering the entire face of the cluster. ourphotometry reaches almost two magnitudes below the turn-off level, and isaccordingly suitable for an age analysis. field stars were removedstatistically from the cluster's color-magnitude diagram (cmd), and adifferential reddening correction applied, thus allowing a precise ridgeline tobe calculated.  using the latter, a metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.70 +/- 0.10 in the zinn &amp; westscale, and [fe/h] = -1.47 +/- 0.02 in the carretta &amp; gratton scale, was derivedon the basis of several parameters measured from the red giant branch, in goodagreement with the value provided in the harris catalog.  comparing the ngc 5286 cmd with the latest photometry for m3 by p. b. stetson(2008, priv. comm.), and using vandenberg isochrones for a suitable chemicalcomposition, we find evidence that ngc 5286 is around 1.7 +/- 0.9 gyr olderthan m3. this goes in the right sense to help account for the blue horizontalbranch of ngc 5286, for which we provide a measurement of several morphologicalindicators. if ngc 5286 is a bona fide member of the canis major dwarfspheroidal galaxy, as previously suggested, our results imply that the latter'soldest components may be at least as old as the oldest milky way globularclusters.
