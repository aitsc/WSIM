0904.4307	chemical composition of extremely metal-poor stars in the sextans dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	chemical abundances of six extremely metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-2.5) stars in thesextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy are determined based on high resolutionspectroscopy (r=40,000) with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph.(1) the fe abundances derived from the high resolution spectra are in goodagreement with the metallicity estimated from the ca triplet lines in lowresolution spectra. the lack of stars with [fe/h]=&lt;-3 in sextans, found byprevious estimates from the ca triplet, is confirmed by our measurements,although we note that high resolution spectroscopy for a larger sample of starswill be necessary to estimate the true fraction of stars with such lowmetallicity. (2) while one object shows an overabundance of mg (similar togalactic halo stars), the mg/fe ratios of the remaining five stars are similarto the solar value. this is the first time that low mg/fe ratios at such lowmetallicities have been found in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. no evidence forover-abundances of ca and ti are found in these five stars, though themeasurements for these elements are less certain. possible mechanisms toproduce low mg/fe ratios, with respect to that of galactic halo stars, arediscussed. (3) ba is under-abundant in four objects, while the remaining twostars exhibit large and moderate excesses of this element. the abundancedistribution of ba in this galaxy is similar to that in the galactic halo,indicating that the enrichment of heavy elements, probably by the r-process,started at metallicities [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, as found in the galactic halo.

0904.4636	the dynamical and chemical evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies	we present a large sample of fully self-consistent hydrodynamicalnbody/tree-sph simulations of isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). ithas enabled us to identify the key physical parameters and mechanisms at theorigin of the observed variety in the local group dsph properties. the initialtotal mass (gas + dark matter) of these galaxies is the main driver of theirevolution. star formation (sf) occurs in series of short bursts. in massivesystems, the very short intervals between the sf peaks mimic a continuous starformation rate, while less massive systems exhibit well separated sf bursts, asidentified observationally. the delay between the sf events is controlled bythe gas cooling time dependence on galaxy mass. the observed global scalingrelations, luminosity-mass and luminosity-metallicity, are reproduced with lowscatter. we take advantage of the unprecedentedly large sample size and datahomogeneity of the eso large programme dart, and add to it a few independentstudies, to constrain the star formation history of five milky way dsphs,sextans, leoii, carina, sculptor and fornax. for the first time, [mg/fe] vs[fe/h] diagrams derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds ofindividual stars are confronted with model predictions. we find that thediversity in dsph properties may well result from intrinsic evolution. we note,however, that the presence of gas in the final state of our simulations, of theorder of what is observed in dwarf irregulars, calls for removal by externalprocesses.

0910.3211	galactic stellar haloes in the cdm model	we present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidaldisruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. ourmodel is based on the aquarius project, a suite of high resolution n-bodysimulations of individual dark matter haloes. we tag subsets of particles inthese simulations with stellar populations predicted by the galformsemi-analytic model. our method self-consistently tracks the dynamicalevolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. the luminosityfunction and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree wellwith observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. we find thataccreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1&lt;z&lt;7 from less than 5significant progenitors. these progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites withstellar masses similar to the brightest milky way dwarf spheroidals. incontrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of thesemajor contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. both thenumber of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherentlystochastic. this results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, whichamplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halohosts. the masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloesare consistent with expectations from the milky way and m31. each halo has acomplex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shellsand other subcomponents. this structure is not adequately described by smoothmodels. we find one example of an accreted thick disk. contrasts in age andmetallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broadagreement with recent observations.

1003.0758	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models	(abridged) aims:we develop a method for deriving distances from spectroscopicdata and obtaining full 6d phase-space coordinates for the rave survey's seconddata release. methods: we used stellar models combined with atmosphericproperties from rave (teff, logg and [fe/h]) and (j-ks) photometry fromarchival sources to derive absolute magnitudes. we are able to derive the full6d phase-space coordinates for a large sample of rave stars. this method istested with artificial data, hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes andobservations of the open cluster m67. results: when we applied our method to aset of 16 146 stars, we found that 25% (4 037) of the stars have relative(statistical) distance errors of &lt; 35%, while 50% (8 073) and 75% (12 110) haverelative (statistical) errors smaller than 45% and 50%, respectively. ourvarious tests show that we can reliably estimate distances for main-sequencestars, but there is an indication of potential systematic problems with giantstars. for the main-sequence star sample (defined as those with log(g) &gt; 4),25% (1 744) have relative distance errors &lt; 31%, while 50% (3 488) and 75% (5231) have relative errors smaller than 36% and 42%, respectively. our fulldataset shows the expected decrease in the metallicity of stars as a functionof distance from the galactic plane. the known kinematic substructures in the uand v velocity components of nearby dwarf stars are apparent in our dataset,confirming the accuracy of our data and the reliability of our technique. weprovide independent measurements of the orientation of the uv velocityellipsoid and of the solar motion, and they are in very good agreement withprevious work. conclusions: the distance catalogue for the rave second datarelease is available at http://www.astro.rug.nl/~rave

1006.2517	double-lined spectroscopic binary stars in the radial velocity  experiment survey	we devise a new method for the detection of double-lined binary stars in asample of the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey spectra. the method isboth tested against extensive simulations based on synthetic spectra, andcompared to direct visual inspection of all rave spectra. it is based on theproperties and shape of the cross-correlation function, and is able to recover~80% of all binaries with an orbital period of order 1 day. systems withperiods up to 1 year are still within the detection reach. we have applied themethod to 25,850 spectra of the rave second data release and found 123double-lined binary candidates, only eight of which are already marked asbinaries in the simbad database. among the candidates, there are seven thatshow spectral features consistent with the rs cvn type (solar type with activechromosphere) and seven that might be of w uma type (over-contact binaries).one star, hd 101167, seems to be a triple system composed of three nearlyidentical g-type dwarfs. the tested classification method could also beapplicable to the data of the upcoming gaia mission.

1007.1007	a high resolution vlt/flames study of individual stars in the centre of  the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy	for the first time we show the detailed late-stage chemical evolution historyof small nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the local group. we present theresults of a high resolution (r$\sim$20000) flames/giraffe abundance study ateso/vlt of 81 photometrically selected red giant branch stars in the central25$'$ of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. we present abundances of \alfe\(mg, si, ca and ti), iron-peak elements (fe, ni and cr) and heavy elements (y,ba, la, nd and eu). our sample was randomly selected, and is clearly dominatedby the younger and more metal rich component of fornax which represents themajor fraction of stars in the central region. this means that the majority ofour stars are 1$-$4 gyr old, and thus represent the end phase of chemicalevolution in this system. our sample of stars has unusually low [$\alpha$/fe],[ni/fe] and [na/fe] compared to the milky way stellar populations at the same[fe/h]. the particularly important role of stellar winds from low metallicityagb stars in the creation of s-process elements is clearly seen from the high[ba/y]. furthermore, we present evidence for an s-process contribution to eu.

1008.3721	extremely metal-poor stars in classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies:  fornax, sculptor and sextans	we present the results of a dedicated search for extremely metal-poor starsin the fornax, sculptor and sextans dsphs. five stars were selected from twoearlier vlt/giraffe and het/hrs surveys and subsequently followed up at highspectroscopic resolution with vlt/uves. all of them turned out to have [fe/h]&lt;= -3 and three stars are below [fe/h] -3.5. this constitutes the firstevidence that the classical dsphs fornax and sextans join sculptor incontaining extremely metal-poor stars and suggests that all of the classicaldsphs contain extremely metal-poor stars. one giant in sculptor at [fe/h]=-3.96+- 0.10 is the most metal-poor star ever observed in an external galaxy. wecarried out a detailed analysis of the chemical abundances of the alpha, ironpeak, and the heavy elements, and we performed a comparison with the milky wayhalo and the ultra faint dwarf stellar populations. carbon, barium andstrontium show distinct features characterized by the early stages of galaxyformation and can constrain the origin of their nucleosynthesis.

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1008.5114	assembly history and structure of galactic cold dark matter halos	we use the aquarius simulation series to study the imprint of assemblyhistory on the structure of galaxy-mass cold dark matter halos. our resultsconfirm earlier work regarding the influence of mergers on the mass densityprofile and the inside-out growth of halos. the inner regions that contain thevisible galaxies are stable since early times and are significantly affectedonly by major mergers. particles accreted diffusely or in minor mergers arefound predominantly in the outskirts of halos. our analysis reveals trends thatrun counter to current perceptions of hierarchical halo assembly. for example,major mergers (i.e. those with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10)contribute little to the total mass growth of a halo, on average less than 20per cent for our six aquarius halos. the bulk is contributed roughly equally byminor mergers and by "diffuse" material which is not resolved into individualobjects. this is consistent with modeling based on excursion-set theory whichsuggests that about half of this diffuse material should not be part of a haloof any scale. interestingly, the simulations themselves suggest that asignificantly fraction is not truly diffuse, since it was ejected from earlierhalos by mergers prior to their joining the main system. the aquariussimulations resolve halos to much lower mass scales than are expected to retaingas or form stars. these results thus confirm that most of the baryons fromwhich visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather than throughmergers, and they suggest that only relatively rare major mergers will affectgalaxy structure at later times.

1009.4857	study of the sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy from the dart caii triplet  survey	we use vlt/flames intermediate resolution (r~6500) spectra of individual redgiant branch stars in the near-infrared caii triplet (cat) region toinvestigate the wide-area metallicity properties and internal kinematics of thesextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dsph). our final sample consists of 174probable members of sextans with accurate line-of-sight velocities (+- 2 km/s)and cat [fe/h] measurements (+- 0.2 dex). we use the mgi line at 8806.8 \aa\,as an empirical discriminator for distinguishing between probable members ofthe dsph (giant stars) and probable galactic contaminants (dwarf stars).sextans shows a similar chemo-dynamical behaviour to other milky way dsphs,with its central regions being more metal rich than the outer parts and withthe more metal-rich stars displaying colder kinematics than the more metal-poorstars. hints of a velocity gradient are found along the projected major axisand along an axis at p.a.=191 deg, however a larger and more spatially extendedsample may be necessary to pin down the amplitude and direction of thisgradient. we detect a cold kinematic substructure at the centre of sextans,consistent with being the remnant of a disrupted very metal poor stellarcluster. we derive the most extended line-of-sight velocity dispersion profilefor sextans, out to a projected radius of 1.6 deg. from jeans modelling of theobserved line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile we find that this isconsistent with both a cored dark matter halo with large core radius and cuspyhalo with low concentration. the mass within the last measured point is in therange 2-4 x 10^8 m_sun, giving very large mass-to-light ratios, from 460 to 920(m/l)_(v,sun).

1010.4491	the rave survey: rich in very metal-poor stars	very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemicalevolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. finding complete samples ofsuch stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individualanalyses is of considerable interest. we demonstrate here that stars with ironabundances [fe/h] &lt; -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficientlyidentified within the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey of bright stars,without requiring additional confirmatory observations. we determine acalibration of the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines measured fromthe rave spectra onto true [fe/h], using high spectral resolution data for asubset of the stars. these rave iron abundances are accurate enough to obviatethe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. our initial study hasidentified 631 stars with [fe/h] &lt;= -2, from a rave database containingapproximately 200,000 stars. this rave-based sample is complete for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. we identify three starswith [fe/h] &lt;= -4. of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [fe/h]= -4.0,rather than the published [fe/h]=-3.3, and derive [c/fe] = +0.9, and [n/fe] =+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our s/n. rave observations are on-goingand should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poorstars.

1011.4092	detection of a radial velocity gradient in the extended local disc with  rave	using a sample of 213,713 stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave)survey, limited to a distance of 2 kpc from the sun and to |z|&lt;1 kpc, we reportthe detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,directed radially from the galactic centre. in the direction of the galacticcentre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and ofgalactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the rave data.this velocity gradient corresponds to |k+c| &lt; 3 km/s/kpc, where k and c are theoort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocityfield, respectively. in order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radialvelocity of the local standard of rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensionalgalactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions andphotometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on k-bandmagnitudes, and considering two sets of values for the galactocentric radius ofthe sun and local circular speed. further observational confirmation of ourfinding with line-of-sight velocities of stars at low latitudes, together withfurther modelling, should help constrain the non-axisymmetric components of thegalactic potential, including the bar, the spiral arms and possibly theellipticity of the dark halo.

1105.1673	single-lined spectroscopic binary star candidates in the rave survey	repeated spectroscopic observations of stars in the radial velocityexperiment (rave) database are used to identify and examine single-lined binary(sb1) candidates. the rave latest internal database (vdr3) includes radialvelocities, atmospheric and other parameters for approximately quarter millionof different stars with little less than 300,000 observations. in the sample of~20,000 stars observed more than once, 1333 stars with variable radialvelocities were identified. most of them are believed to be sb1 candidates. thefraction of sb1 candidates among stars with several observations is between 10%and 15% which is the lower limit for binarity among rave stars. due to thedistribution of time spans between the re-observation that is biased towardsrelatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified sb1candidates are most likely in the same range. because of the rave's narrowmagnitude range most of the dwarf candidates belong to the thin galactic diskwhile the giants are part of the thick disk with distances extending to up to afew kpc. the comparison of the list of sb1 candidates to the vsx catalog ofvariable stars yielded several pulsating variables among the giant populationwith the radial velocity variations of up to few tens of km/s. there are 26matches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) and the wholerave sample for which the given periastron time and the time of raveobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. rave measurementsof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with theirpublished radial velocity curves.

0709.4219	is the sky falling? searching for stellar streams in the local milky way  disc in the coravel and rave surveys	we have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local milky waydisc in the coravel and rave surveys. the coravel survey consists of localdwarf stars (nordstrom et al. geneva-copenhagen survey) and local famaey et al.giant stars. we select rave stars with radial velocities that are sensitive tothe galactic vertical space velocity (galactic latitude b &lt; -45 deg). kuiperstatistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the galactic verticalvelocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net verticalflow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with verticallycoherent kinematics. in contrast to the `field of streams' found in the outerhalo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by thecoravel dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), coravel giants (completewithin ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and rave (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoidof any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. this issufficiently sensitive to allow our rave sample to rule out the passing of thetidal stream of the disrupting sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solarneighbourhood. this agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit anddissociates it from the helmi et al. halo stream. our constraints on theabsence of the sgr stream near the sun could prove a useful tool fordiscriminating between galactic potential models. the lack of a net verticalflow through the solar neighbourhood in the coravel giants and rave samplesargues against the virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the sun. there areno vertical streams in the coravel giants and rave samples with stellardensities &gt;1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore noevidence for locally enhanced dark matter.

1110.5221	a spectroscopic survey of thick disc stars outside the solar  neighbourhood	we performed a spectroscopic survey of nearly 700 stars probing the galacticthick disc far from the solar neighbourhood towards the galactic coordinates(l~277, b~47). the derived effective temperatures, surface gravities andoverall metallicities were then combined with stellar evolution isochrones,radial velocities and proper motions to derive the distances, kinematics andorbital parameters of the sample stars. the targets belonging to each galacticcomponent (thin disc, thick disc, halo) were selected either on theirkinematics or according to their position above the galactic plane, and thevertical gradients were also estimated. we present here atmospheric parameters,distances and kinematics for this sample, and a comparison of our kinematic andmetallicity distributions with the besancon model of the milky way. the thickdisc far from the solar neighbourhood is found to differ only slightly from thethick disc properties as derived in the solar vicinity. for regions where thethick disc dominates, we measured vertical velocity and metallicity trends ofd(v_phi)/dz = 19 +/- 8 km/s/kpc and d[m/h]/dz = -0.14 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc,respectively. these trends can be explained as a smooth transition between thedifferent galactic components, although intrinsic gradients could not beexcluded. in addition, a correlation d(v_phi)/d[m/h] = -45 +/- 12 km/s/dexbetween the orbital velocity and the metallicity of the thick disc is detected.this gradient is inconsistent with the sdss photometric survey analysis, whichdid not detect any such trend, and challenges radial migration models of thickdisc formation. estimations of the scale heights and scale lengths fordifferent metallicity bins of the thick disc result in consistent values, withhr~3.4 \pm 0.7 kpc, and hz~694 \pm 45 pc, showing no evidence of relics ofdestroyed massive satellites.

1205.4712	orbit-based dynamical models of the sculptor dsph galaxy	we have developed spherically symmetric dynamical models of dwarf spheroidalgalaxies using schwarzschild's orbit superposition method. this type ofmodelling yields constraints both on the total mass distribution (e.g. enclosedmass and scale radius) as well as on the orbital structure of the system (e.g.velocity anisotropy). this method is thus less prone to biases introduced byassumptions in comparison to the more commonly used jeans modelling, and itallows us to derive the dark matter content in a robust way. here we presentour results for the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, after testing our methodson mock data sets. we fit both the second and fourth velocity moment profile tobreak the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. for an nfw dark matter halo profile, wefind that the mass of sculptor within 1 kpc is m_1kpc = 1.03 \pm 0.07 x 10^8msol, and that its velocity anisotropy profile is tangentially biased andnearly constant with radius. the preferred concentration (c ~ 15) is low forits dark matter mass but consistent within the scatter found in n-bodycosmological simulations. when we let the value of the central logarithmicslope \alpha{} vary, we find that the best-fit model has \alpha{} = 0, althoughan nfw cusp or shallower is consistent at 1 \sigma{} confidence level. on theother hand, very cuspy density profiles with logarithmic central slopes\alpha{} &lt; -1.5 are strongly disfavoured for sculptor.

1207.0363	the properties of the local spiral arms from rave data: two-dimensional  density wave approach	using the rave survey, we recently brought to light a gradient in the meangalactocentric radial velocity of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.this gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of thepotential, among which a perturbation by spiral arms is a possible explanation.here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model theradial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. provided that theradial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms thatcan affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model providesnew independent estimates for the parameters of the milky way spiral structure.our analysis favours a two-armed perturbation with the sun close to the innerultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance, with a pattern speed \omega_p=18.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}km/s/kpc and a small amplitude a=0.55 \pm 0.02% of the background potential(14% of the background density). this model can serve as a basis for numericalsimulations in three dimensions, additionally including a possible influence ofthe galactic bar and/or other non-axisymmetric modes.

1211.1406	velocity and abundance precisions for future high-resolution  spectroscopic surveys: a study for 4most	in preparation for future, large-scale, multi-object, high-resolutionspectroscopic surveys of the galaxy, we present a series of tests of theprecision in radial velocity and chemical abundances that any such project canachieve at a 4m class telescope. we briefly discuss a number of science casesthat aim at studying the chemo-dynamical history of the major galacticcomponents (bulge, thin and thick disks, and halo) - either as a follow-up tothe gaia mission or on their own merits. based on a large grid of syntheticspectra that cover the full range in stellar parameters of typical surveytargets, we devise an optimal wavelength range and argue for a moderatelyhigh-resolution spectrograph. as a result, the kinematic precision is notlimited by any of these factors, but will practically only suffer fromsystematic effects, easily reaching uncertainties &lt;1 km/s. under realisticsurvey conditions (namely, considering stars brighter than r=16 mag withreasonable exposure times) we prefer an ideal resolving power of r~20000 onaverage, for an overall wavelength range (with a common two-arm spectrographdesign) of [395;456.5] nm and [587;673] nm. we show for the first time on ageneral basis that it is possible to measure chemical abundance ratios tobetter than 0.1 dex for many species (fe, mg, si, ca, ti, na, al, v, cr, mn,co, ni, y, ba, nd, eu) and to an accuracy of about 0.2 dex for other speciessuch as zr, la, and sr. while our feasibility study was explicitly carried outfor the 4most facility, the results can be readily applied to and used for anyother conceptual design study for high-resolution spectrographs.

1302.2468	the wobbly galaxy: kinematics north and south with rave red clump giants	the rave survey, combined with proper motions and distance estimates, can beused to study in detail stellar kinematics in the extended solar neighbourhood(solar suburb). using the red clump, we examine the mean velocity components in3d between an r of 6 and 10 kpc and a z of -2 to 2 kpc, concentrating onnorth-south differences. simple parametric fits to the r, z trends for vphi andthe velocity dispersions are presented. we confirm the recently discoveredgradient in mean galactocentric radial velocity, vr, finding that the gradientis more marked below the plane, with a z gradient also present. the verticalvelocity, vz, also shows clear structure, with indications of ararefaction-compression pattern, suggestive of wave-like behaviour. we performa rigorous error analysis, tracing sources of both systematic and randomerrors. we confirm the north-south differences in vr and vz along theline-of-sight, with the vr estimated independent of the proper motions. thecomplex three-dimensional structure of velocity space presents challenges forfuture modelling of the galactic disk, with the galactic bar, spiral arms andexcitation of wave-like structures all probably playing a role.

1302.3466	the relation between chemical abundances and kinematics of the galactic  disc with rave	aims: we study the relations between stellar kinematics and chemicalabundances of a large sample of rave giants in search for selection criterianeeded for disentangling different galactic stellar populations. methods: weselect a sample of 2167 giant stars with signal-to-noise per spectralmeasurements above 75 from the rave chemical catalogue and follow the analysisperformed by gratton and colleagues on 150 subdwarf stars spectroscopicallyobserved at high-resolution. we then use a larger sample of 9131 giants (withsignal-to-noise above 60) to investigate the chemo-kinematical characteristicsof our stars by grouping them into nine subsamples with common eccentricity($e$) and maximum distance achieved above the galactic plane ($z_max$).results: the rave kinematical and chemical data proved to be reliable byreproducing the results by gratton et al. obtained with high-resolutionspectroscopic data. our analysis, based on the $e$-$z_max$ plane combined withadditional orbital parameters and chemical information, provides an alternativeway of identifying different populations of stars. in addition to extractingcanonical thick- and thin-disc samples, we find a group of stars in thegalactic plane ($z_max&lt;1$ kpc and 0.4 $&lt; e &lt; $0.6), which show homogeneouskinematics but differ in their chemical properties. we interpret this as aclear sign that some of these stars have experienced the effects of heatingand/or radial migration, which have modified their original orbits. theaccretion origin of such stars cannot be excluded.

1304.2976	model comparison of the dark matter profiles of fornax, sculptor, carina  and sextans	we use orbit based dynamical models to fit the 2nd and 4th moments of theline of sight velocity distributions of the fornax, sculptor, carina andsextans dwarf spheroidal galaxies. our goal is to compare dark matter profilemodels of these four systems using bayesian evidence. we consider nfw, einastoand several cored profiles for their dark halos and present the probabilitydistribution functions of the model parameters. when considering each systemseparately, we find there is no preference for one of these specific parametricdensity profiles. however, the combined evidence shows that it is unlikely thatall galaxies are embedded in the same type of cored profiles of the form\rho_{dm} \propto 1/(1 + r^2)^{\beta/2}, where \beta = 3, 4. for each galaxy,we also obtain an almost model independent, and therefore accurate, measurementof the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density distribution at a radius ~r_{-3}, i.e. where the logarithmic slope of the stellar density profile is -3.this slope ranges from ~ -1.4 for fornax to ~ -1.1 for sextans, both at ~ 1kpc. all our best fit models essentially have the same mass distribution over alarge range in radius (from just below r_{-3} to the last measured data point).this remarkable finding likely implies much stronger constraints on thecharacteristics that subhalos extracted from cosmological simulations shouldhave in order to host the dsph galaxies around the milky way.

0801.2120	galactic kinematics with rave data: i. the distribution of stars towards  the galactic poles	we analyze the distribution of g and k type stars towards the galactic polesusing rave and elodie radial velocities, 2mass photometric star counts, anducac2 proper motions. the combination of photometric and 3d kinematic dataallows us to disentangle and describe the vertical distribution of dwarfs,sub-giants and giants and their kinematics. we identify discontinuities withinthe kinematics and magnitude counts that separate the thin disk, thick disk anda hotter component. the respective scale heights of the thin disk and thickdisk are 225$\pm$10 pc and 1048$\pm$36 pc. we also constrain the luminosityfunction and the kinematic distribution function. the existence of a kinematicgap between the thin and thick disks is incompatible with the thick disk havingformed from the thin disk by a continuous process, such as scattering of starsby spiral arms or molecular clouds. other mechanisms of formation of the thickdisk such as `created on the spot' or smoothly `accreted' remain compatiblewith our findings.

1309.4272	constraints on the galactic bar from the hercules stream as traced with  rave across the galaxy	non-axisymmetries in the galactic potential (spiral arms and bar) inducekinematic groups such as the hercules stream. assuming that hercules is causedby the effects of the outer lindblad resonance of the galactic bar, we modelanalytically its properties as a function of position in the galaxy and itsdependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. using data from the ravesurvey we find that the azimuthal velocity of the hercules structure decreasesas a function of galactocentric radius, in a manner consistent with ouranalytical model. this allows us to obtain new estimates of the parameters ofthe milky way's bar. the combined likelihood function of the bar's patternspeed and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\omega_b=(1.89 \pm0.08) \times \omega_0$ where $\omega_0$ is the local circular frequency.assuming a solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular velocity of 238 km/s,this corresponds to $\omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. on the other hand, the bar'sorientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. in fact,the likelihood function shows that a tight correlation exists between thepattern speed and the orientation, implying that a better description of ourbest fit results is given by the linear relation $\omega_b/\omega_0=1.91 +0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. for example, for anangle of $\phi_b=30\deg$ the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. theseresults are not very sensitive to the other galactic parameters such as thecircular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the sun, and are robust tobiases in distance.

1309.4293	the rave survey: the galactic escape speed and the mass of the milky way	we construct new estimates on the galactic escape speed at variousgalactocentric radii using the latest data release of the radial velocityexperiment (rave dr4). compared to previous studies we have a database largerby a factor of 10 as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars.our analysis is based on the statistical analysis of a rigorously selectedsample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from rave and a previously published dataset. we calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of milky way-sized galaxies. our best estimate ofthe local galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed requiredto reach three virial radii $r_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%confidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $r_{340}$ isthe galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times thecritical density for closure in the universe. from the escape speed we furtherderive estimates of the mass of the galaxy using a simple mass model with twooptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and anadiabatically contracted navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) sphere. if we fix thelocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher massthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on haloconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint wefind very similar masses for both models. our best estimate for $m_{340}$, themass interior to $r_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times 10^{12}$ m$_\odot$ (corresponding to $m_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times10^{12}$ m$_\odot$). this estimate is in good agreement with recently publishedindependent mass estimates based on the kinematics of more distant halo starsand the satellite galaxy leo i.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

0802.4220	the kinematic status and mass content of the sculptor dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	we present vlt/flames spectroscopic observations (r~6500) in the caii tripletregion for 470 probable kinematic members of the sculptor (scl) dwarfspheroidal galaxy. the accurate velocities (+- 2 km/s) and large area coverageof scl allow us to measure a velocity gradient of 7.6_{-2.2}^{+3.0} km/sdeg^{-1} along the scl projected major axis, likely a signature of intrinsicrotation. we also use our kinematic data to measure the mass distributionwithin this system. by considering independently the kinematics of the distinctstellar components known to be present in scl, we are able to relieve knowndegeneracies, and find that the observed velocity dispersion profiles are bestfitted by a cored dark matter halo with core radius r_c= 0.5 kpc and massenclosed within the last measured point m(&lt; 1.8 kpc)=3.4 +- 0.7 x 10^8 m_sun,assuming an increasingly radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid. this resultsin a mass-to-light ratio of 158+-33 (m/l)_sun inside 1.8 kpc. an nfw profilewith concentration c=20 and mass m(&lt; 1.8 kpc) = 2.2_{-0.7}^{+1.0} x 10^8 m_sunis also statistically consistent with the observations, but it tends to yieldpoorer fits for the metal rich stars.

1405.7435	kinematic modelling of the milky way using the rave and gcs stellar  surveys	we investigate the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using the raveand gcs stellar surveys. we do this by fitting a kinematic model to the datataking the selection function of the data into account. for stars in the gcs weuse all phase-space coordinates, but for rave stars we use only $(l,b,v_{\rmlos})$. using mcmc technique, we investigate the full posterior distributionsof the parameters given the data. we investigate the `age-velocity dispersion'relation for the three kinematic components($\sigma_r,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocitydispersions, the solar peculiar motion ($u_{\odot},v_{\odot}, w_{\odot} $), thecircular speed $\theta_0$ at the sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion withheight above the mid-plane. we confirm that the besan\c{c}on-style gaussianmodel accurately fits the gcs data, but fails to match the details of the morespatially extended rave survey. in particular, the shu distribution function(df) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit tothe kinematic data. the gaussian distribution function not only fits the datapoorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion withradius. we find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, whichhighlights the importance of doing joint fits. the large size of the ravesurvey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. however, largesystematic uncertainties remain, especially in $v_{\odot}$ and $\theta_0$. wefind that, for an extended sample of stars, $\theta_0$ is underestimated by asmuch as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion isneglected. using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we findthat it is possible to match the sgr a* proper motion without any need for$v_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like gcs.

1406.4130	constraining the galaxy's dark halo with rave stars	we use the kinematics of $\sim200\,000$ giant stars that lie within $\sim1.5$ kpc of the plane to measure the vertical profile of mass density near thesun. we find that the dark mass contained within the isodensity surface of thedark halo that passes through the sun($(6\pm0.9)\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$), and the surface density within$0.9$ kpc of the plane ($(69\pm10)\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$) are almostindependent of the (oblate) halo's axis ratio $q$. if the halo is spherical, 46per cent of the radial force on the sun is provided by baryons, and only 4.3per cent of the galaxy's mass is baryonic. if the halo is flattened, thebaryons contribute even less strongly to the local radial force and to thegalaxy's mass. the dark-matter density at the location of the sun is$0.0126\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-3}}=0.48\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{gev\,cm^{-3}}$.when combined with other literature results we find hints for a mildly oblatedark halo with $q \simeq 0.8$. our value for the dark mass within the solarradius is larger than that predicted by cosmological dark-matter-onlysimulations but in good agreement with simulations once the effects of baryonicinfall are taken into account. our mass models consist of threedouble-exponential discs, an oblate bulge and a navarro-frenk-white dark-matterhalo, and we model the dynamics of the rave stars in the correspondinggravitational fields by finding distribution functions $f(\mathbf{j})$ thatdepend on three action integrals. statistical errors are completely swamped bysystematic uncertainties, the most important of which are the distance to thestars in the photometric and spectroscopic samples and the solar distance tothe galactic centre. systematics other than the flattening of the dark haloyield overall uncertainties $\sim 15$ per cent.

1503.02072	the imprints of the galactic bar on the thick disk with rave	we study the kinematics of a local sample of stars, located within a cylinderof 500 pc radius centered on the sun, in the rave dataset. we find clearasymmetries in the $v_r$-$v_\phi$ velocity distributions of thin and thick diskstars: here are more stars moving radially outwards for low azimuthalvelocities and more radially inwards for high azimuthal velocities. suchasymmetries have been previously reported for the thin disk as being due to thegalactic bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures areseen in the thick disk. our findings imply that the velocities of thick diskstars should no longer be described by schwarzschild's, multivariate gaussianor purely axisymmetric distributions. furthermore, the nature of previouslyreported substructures in the thick disk needs to be revisited as these couldbe associated with dynamical resonances rather than to accretion events. it isclear that dynamical models of the galaxy must fit the 3d velocitydistributions of the disks, rather than the projected 1d, if we are tounderstand the galaxy fully.

0806.0546	the radial velocity experiment (rave): second data release	we present the second data release of the radial velocity experiment (rave),an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities (rvs) andstellar atmosphere parameters of up to one million stars using the 6dfmulti-object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidt telescope of theanglo-australian observatory (aao). it is obtaining medium resolution spectra(median r=7,500) in the ca-triplet region (8,410--8,795 \aa) for southernhemisphere stars in the magnitude range 9&lt;i&lt;12. following the first datarelease (steinmetz et al. 2006) the current release doubles the sample ofpublished rvs, now containing 51,829 rvs for 49,327 individual stars observedon 141 nights between april 11 2003 and march 31 2005. comparison with externaldata sets shows that the new data collected since april 3 2004 show a standarddeviation of 1.3 km/s, about twice better than for the first data release. forthe first time this data release contains values of stellar parameters from22,407 spectra of 21,121 individual stars. they were derived by a penalized\chi^2 method using an extensive grid of synthetic spectra calculated from thelatest version of kurucz models. from comparison with external data sets, ourconservative estimates of errors of the stellar parameters (for a spectrum withs/n=40) are 400 k in temperature, 0.5 dex in gravity, and 0.2 dex inmetallicity. we note however that the internal errors estimated from repeatrave observations of 822 stars are at least a factor 2 smaller. we demonstratethat the results show no systematic offsets if compared to values derived fromphotometry or complementary spectroscopic analyses. the data release includesproper motion and photometric measurements. it can be accessed via the ravewebpage: http://www.rave-survey.org and through cds.

0808.1456	diffuse interstellar bands in rave survey spectra	we have used spectra of hot stars from the rave survey in order toinvestigate the visibility and properties of five diffuse interstellar bandspreviously reported in the literature. the rave spectroscopic survey forgalactic structure and kinematics records ccd spectra covering the 8400-8800ang wavelength region at 7500 resolving power. the spectra are obtained withthe uk schmidt at the aao, equipped with the 6df multi-fiber positioner. thedib at 8620.4 ang is by far the strongest and cleanest of all dibs occurringwithin the rave wavelength range, with no interference by underlying absorptionstellar lines in hot stars. it correlates so tightly with reddening that itturns out to be a reliable tool to measure it, following the relation e(b-v) =2.72 (+/- 0.03) x e.w.(ang), valid throughout the general interstellar mediumof our galaxy. the presence of a dib at 8648 ang is confirmed. its intensityappears unrelated to reddening, in agreement with scanty and preliminaryreports available in the literature, and its measurability is stronglycompromised by severe blending with underlying stellar hei doublet at 8649 ang.the two weak dibs at 8531 and 8572 ang do not appear real and should actuallybe blends of underlying stellar lines. the very weak dib at 8439 ang cannot beresolved within the profile of the much stronger underlying hydrogen paschen 18stellar line.

astro-ph;0409709	spectroscopic survey of the galaxy with gaia i. design and performance  of the radial velocity spectrometer	the definition and optimisation studies for the gaia satellite spectrograph,the radial velocity spectrometer (rvs), converged in late 2002 with theadoption of the instrument baseline. this paper reviews the characteristics ofthe selected configuration and presents its expected performance. the rvs is a2.0 by 1.6 degree integral field spectrograph, dispersing the light of allsources entering its field of view with a resolving power r=11 500 over thewavelength range [848, 874] nm. the rvs will continuously and repeatedly scanthe sky during the 5 years of the gaia mission. on average, each source will beobserved 102 times over this period. the rvs will collect the spectra of about100-150 million stars up to magnitude v~17-18. at the end of the mission, thervs will provide radial velocities with precisions of ~2 km/s at v=15 and\~15-20 km/s at v=17, for a solar metallicity g5 dwarf. the rvs will alsoprovide rotational velocities, with precisions (at the end of the mission) forlate type stars of sigma_vsini ~5 km/s at v~15 as well as atmosphericparameters up to v~14-15. the individual abundances of elements such as siliconand magnesium, vital for the understanding of galactic evolution, will beobtained up to v~12-13. finally, the presence of the 862.0 nm diffuseinterstellar band (dib) in the rvs wavelength range will make it possible toderive the three dimensional structure of the interstellar reddening.

astro-ph;0411029	two distinct ancient components in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy:  first results from dart	we have found evidence for the presence of two distinct ancient stellarcomponents (both geq 10 gyr old) in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. weused the eso wide field imager (wfi) in conjunction with the vlt/flamesspectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population ofsculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. we find that two components arediscernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in ourimaging, and in the [fe/h] and v_hel distributions for our large sample ofspectroscopic measurements. they can be generally described as a ``metal-poor''component ([fe/h]&lt; -1.7) and a ``metal-rich'' component ([fe/h]&gt; -1.7). themetal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, andthey also appear to be kinematically distinct. these results provide animportant insight into the formation processes of small systems in the earlyuniverse and the conditions found there. even this simplest of galaxies appearsto have had a surprisingly complex early evolution.

astro-ph;0506083	spectroscopic survey of the galaxy with gaia ii. the expected science  yield from the radial velocity spectrometer	the gaia mission is designed as a galaxy explorer, and will measuresimultaneously, in a survey mode, the five or six phase space parameters of allstars brighter than 20th magnitude, as well as providing a description of theirastrophysical characteristics. these measurements are obtained by combining anastrometric instrument with micro-arcsecond capabilities, a photometric systemgiving the magnitudes and colours in 15 bands and a medium resolutionspectrograph named the radial velocity spectrometer (rvs). the latterinstrument will produce spectra in the 848 to 874 nm wavelength range, with aresolving power r = 11 500, from which radial velocities, rotationalvelocities, atmospheric parameters and abundances can be derived. a companionpaper (katz et al. 2004) presents the characteristics of the rvs and itsperformance. this paper details the outstanding scientific impact of thisimportant part of the gaia satellite on some key open questions in present dayastrophysics. the unbiased and simultaneous acquisition of multi-epoch radialvelocities and individual abundances of key elements in parallel with theastrometric parameters is essential for the determination of the dynamicalstate and formation history of our galaxy. moreover, for stars brighter thanv=15, the resolving power of the rvs will give information about most of theeffects which influence the position of a star in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram, placing unprecedented constraints on the age, internal structure andevolution of stars of all types. finally, the rvs multi-epoch observations areideally suited to the identification, classification and characterisation ofthe many types of double, multiple and variable stars.

astro-ph;0506102	the radial velocity dispersion profile of the galactic halo:  constraining the density profile of the dark halo of the milky way	we have compiled a new sample of 240 halo objects with accurate distance andradial velocity measurements, including globular clusters, satellite galaxies,field blue horizontal branch stars and red giant stars from the spaghettisurvey. the new data lead to a significant increase in the number of knownobjects for galactocentric radii beyond 50 kpc, which allows a reliabledetermination of the radial velocity dispersion profile out to very largedistances. the radial velocity dispersion shows an almost constant value of 120km/s out to 30 kpc and then continuously declines down to 50 km/s at about 120kpc. this fall-off puts important constraints on the density profile and totalmass of the dark matter halo of the milky way. for a constant velocityanisotropy, the isothermal profile is ruled out, while both a dark halofollowing a truncated flat model of mass $1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$m_sun and an nfw profile of mass $0.8^{+1.2}_{-0.2}\times 10^{12}$ m_sun andc=18 are consistent with the data. the significant increase in the number oftracers combined with the large extent of the region probed by these hasallowed a more precise determination of the milky way mass in comparison toprevious works. we also show how different assumptions for the velocityanisotropy affect the performance of the mass models.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0606211	the radial velocity experiment (rave): first data release	we present the first data release of the radial velocity experiment (rave),an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellaratmosphere parameters (temperature, metallicity, surface gravity) of up to onemillion stars using the 6df multi-object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidttelescope of the anglo-australian observatory (aao). the rave program startedin 2003, obtaining medium resolution spectra (median r=7,500) in the ca-tripletregion ($\lambda\lambda$ 8,410--8,795 \aa) for southern hemisphere stars drawnfrom the tycho-2 and supercosmos catalogs, in the magnitude range 9&lt;i&lt;12. thefirst data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocitiesfor 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when includingre-observations). those data were obtained on 67 nights between 11 april 2003to 03 april 2004. the total sky coverage within this data release is$\sim$4,760 square degrees. the average signal to noise ratio of the observedspectra is 29.5, and 80% of the radial velocities have uncertainties betterthan 3.4 km/s. combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode isfound to be 2 km/s. repeat observations are used to assess the stability of ourradial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km/s. we demonstratethat the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show anysystematic trend with color or signal to noise. the rave radial velocities arecomplemented in the data release with proper motions from starnet 2.0, tycho-2and supercosmos, in addition to photometric data from the major optical andinfrared catalogs (tycho-2, usno-b, denis and 2mass). the data release can beaccessed via the rave webpage: http://www.rave-survey.org.

astro-ph;0608370	the dart imaging and cat survey of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy	as part of the dart project we have used the eso/2.2m wide field imager inconjunction with the vlt/flames giraffe spectrograph to study the detailedproperties of the resolved stellar population of the fornax dwarf spheroidalgalaxy out to and beyond its tidal radius. we re-derived the structuralparameters of the fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field imaging coveringthe galaxy out to its tidal radius, and analysed the spatial distribution ofthe fornax stars of different ages as selected from colour-magnitude diagramanalysis. we have obtained accurate velocities and metallicities from spectrain the caii triplet wavelength region for 562 red giant branch stars which havevelocities consistent with membership in fornax dwarf spheroidal. we have foundevidence for the presence of at least three distinct stellar components: ayoung population (few 100 myr old) concentrated in the centre of the galaxy,visible as a main sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram; an intermediate agepopulation (2-8 gyr old); and an ancient population (&gt; 10gyr),which aredistinguishable from each other kinematically, from the metallicitydistribution and in the spatial distribution of stars found in thecolour-magnitude diagram. from our spectroscopic analysis we find that the``metal rich'' stars ([fe/h]&gt; -1.3) show a less extended and more concentratedspatial distribution, and display a colder kinematics than the ``metal poor''stars ([fe/h&lt;-1.3). there is tentative evidence that the ancient stellarpopulation in the centre of fornax does not exhibit equilibrium kinematics.this could be a sign of a relatively recent accretion of external material.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.
