0907.0177	rave spectroscopy of luminous blue variables in the large magellanic  cloud	context: the rave spectroscopic survey for galactic structure and evolutionobtains 8400-8800 ang spectra at 7500 resolving power at the uk schmidttelescope using the 6df multi-fiber positioner. more than 300,000 9&lt;i&lt;12 and|b|&gt;25 deg southern stars have been observed to date. aims: this paper presentsthe first intrinsic examination of stellar spectra from the rave survey, aimedat evaluating their diagnostic potential for peculiar stars and at contributingto the general understanding of luminous blue variables (lbvs). methods: weused the multi-epoch spectra for all seven lbvs observed, between 2005 and2008, in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) by the rave survey. results: wedemonstrate that rave spectra possess significant diagnostic potential whenapplied to peculiar stars and, in particular, lbvs. the behaviour of the radialvelocities for both emission and absorption lines, and the spectral changesbetween outburst and quiescence states are described and found to agree withevidence gathered at more conventional wavelengths. the wind outflow signaturesand their variability are investigated, with multi-components detected in sdoradus. photoionisation modelling of the rich emission line spectrum of r 127shows evidence of a massive detached ionised shell that was ejected during the1982-2000 outburst. surface inhomogeneities in the nuclear-processed material,brought to the surface by heavy mass loss, could have been observed in sdoradus, even if alternative explanations are possible. we also detect thetransition from quiescence to outburst state in r 71. finally, our spectrum ofr 84 offers one of the clearest views of its cool companion.

0704.1770	satellites of simulated galaxies: survival, merging, and their relation  to the dark and stellar halos	we study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite ofn-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a lcdm universe. we findlittle spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellitepopulation. the velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator ofthe virial velocity of the halo: \sigma_{sat}/v_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. applied tothe milky way and m31 this gives v_{vir}^{mw}=109 +/- 22$ km/s andv_{vir}^{m31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than therotation speed of their disk components. the detailed kinematics of simulatedsatellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. by contrast, the stellarhalo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from thepopulation of surviving satellites. this is because the survival of a satellitedepends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biasedtoward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. ourresults support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differencesbetween stars in the galactic halo and in galactic satellites: the elusive``building blocks'' of the milky way stellar halo were on average more massive,and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs thathas survived self-bound until the present.

0704.1773	cosmic m\'enage \`a trois: the origin of satellite galaxies on extreme  orbits	we examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite ofn-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of $l_*$ galaxies in a lcdmuniverse. most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around,they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radiiare steadily eroded by dynamical friction. however, a number of outliers arealso present, we find that ~1/3 of satellites identified at $z=0$ are onunorthodox orbits, with apocenters that exceed their turnaround radii. thispopulation of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faintmember of a satellite pair that has been ejected onto a highly-energetic orbitduring its first approach to the primary. since the concurrent accretion ofmultiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models ofgalaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may bethe origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around m31(such as andromeda xiv); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding local groupmembers, such as leo i; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals cetusand tucana in the outskirts of the local group. our results suggest that caremust be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites toplace constraints on the total mass of the local group.

1003.0758	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models	(abridged) aims:we develop a method for deriving distances from spectroscopicdata and obtaining full 6d phase-space coordinates for the rave survey's seconddata release. methods: we used stellar models combined with atmosphericproperties from rave (teff, logg and [fe/h]) and (j-ks) photometry fromarchival sources to derive absolute magnitudes. we are able to derive the full6d phase-space coordinates for a large sample of rave stars. this method istested with artificial data, hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes andobservations of the open cluster m67. results: when we applied our method to aset of 16 146 stars, we found that 25% (4 037) of the stars have relative(statistical) distance errors of &lt; 35%, while 50% (8 073) and 75% (12 110) haverelative (statistical) errors smaller than 45% and 50%, respectively. ourvarious tests show that we can reliably estimate distances for main-sequencestars, but there is an indication of potential systematic problems with giantstars. for the main-sequence star sample (defined as those with log(g) &gt; 4),25% (1 744) have relative distance errors &lt; 31%, while 50% (3 488) and 75% (5231) have relative errors smaller than 36% and 42%, respectively. our fulldataset shows the expected decrease in the metallicity of stars as a functionof distance from the galactic plane. the known kinematic substructures in the uand v velocity components of nearby dwarf stars are apparent in our dataset,confirming the accuracy of our data and the reliability of our technique. weprovide independent measurements of the orientation of the uv velocityellipsoid and of the solar motion, and they are in very good agreement withprevious work. conclusions: the distance catalogue for the rave second datarelease is available at http://www.astro.rug.nl/~rave

1006.2517	double-lined spectroscopic binary stars in the radial velocity  experiment survey	we devise a new method for the detection of double-lined binary stars in asample of the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey spectra. the method isboth tested against extensive simulations based on synthetic spectra, andcompared to direct visual inspection of all rave spectra. it is based on theproperties and shape of the cross-correlation function, and is able to recover~80% of all binaries with an orbital period of order 1 day. systems withperiods up to 1 year are still within the detection reach. we have applied themethod to 25,850 spectra of the rave second data release and found 123double-lined binary candidates, only eight of which are already marked asbinaries in the simbad database. among the candidates, there are seven thatshow spectral features consistent with the rs cvn type (solar type with activechromosphere) and seven that might be of w uma type (over-contact binaries).one star, hd 101167, seems to be a triple system composed of three nearlyidentical g-type dwarfs. the tested classification method could also beapplicable to the data of the upcoming gaia mission.

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1010.4491	the rave survey: rich in very metal-poor stars	very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemicalevolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. finding complete samples ofsuch stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individualanalyses is of considerable interest. we demonstrate here that stars with ironabundances [fe/h] &lt; -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficientlyidentified within the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey of bright stars,without requiring additional confirmatory observations. we determine acalibration of the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines measured fromthe rave spectra onto true [fe/h], using high spectral resolution data for asubset of the stars. these rave iron abundances are accurate enough to obviatethe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. our initial study hasidentified 631 stars with [fe/h] &lt;= -2, from a rave database containingapproximately 200,000 stars. this rave-based sample is complete for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. we identify three starswith [fe/h] &lt;= -4. of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [fe/h]= -4.0,rather than the published [fe/h]=-3.3, and derive [c/fe] = +0.9, and [n/fe] =+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our s/n. rave observations are on-goingand should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poorstars.

1011.4092	detection of a radial velocity gradient in the extended local disc with  rave	using a sample of 213,713 stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave)survey, limited to a distance of 2 kpc from the sun and to |z|&lt;1 kpc, we reportthe detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,directed radially from the galactic centre. in the direction of the galacticcentre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and ofgalactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the rave data.this velocity gradient corresponds to |k+c| &lt; 3 km/s/kpc, where k and c are theoort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocityfield, respectively. in order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radialvelocity of the local standard of rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensionalgalactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions andphotometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on k-bandmagnitudes, and considering two sets of values for the galactocentric radius ofthe sun and local circular speed. further observational confirmation of ourfinding with line-of-sight velocities of stars at low latitudes, together withfurther modelling, should help constrain the non-axisymmetric components of thegalactic potential, including the bar, the spiral arms and possibly theellipticity of the dark halo.

1104.1577	observing pulsars and fast transients with lofar	low frequency radio waves, while challenging to observe, are a rich source ofinformation about pulsars. the low frequency array (lofar) is a new radiointerferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric "radiowindow": 10-240mhz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radiofrequencies. through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexibledigital hardware, it is expected that lofar will revolutionize radio astronomyat the lowest frequencies visible from earth. lofar is a next-generation radiotelescope and a pathfinder to the square kilometre array (ska), in that itincorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individualelements. we discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations ingeneral and the potential of lofar in addressing these science goals. wepresent lofar as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations ofpulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observingmodes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implementedto facilitate these observations. a number of results obtained fromcommissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potentialof the telescope. this paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsarobservations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcomingpulsar/fast transient science papers with lofar.

1105.1673	single-lined spectroscopic binary star candidates in the rave survey	repeated spectroscopic observations of stars in the radial velocityexperiment (rave) database are used to identify and examine single-lined binary(sb1) candidates. the rave latest internal database (vdr3) includes radialvelocities, atmospheric and other parameters for approximately quarter millionof different stars with little less than 300,000 observations. in the sample of~20,000 stars observed more than once, 1333 stars with variable radialvelocities were identified. most of them are believed to be sb1 candidates. thefraction of sb1 candidates among stars with several observations is between 10%and 15% which is the lower limit for binarity among rave stars. due to thedistribution of time spans between the re-observation that is biased towardsrelatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified sb1candidates are most likely in the same range. because of the rave's narrowmagnitude range most of the dwarf candidates belong to the thin galactic diskwhile the giants are part of the thick disk with distances extending to up to afew kpc. the comparison of the list of sb1 candidates to the vsx catalog ofvariable stars yielded several pulsating variables among the giant populationwith the radial velocity variations of up to few tens of km/s. there are 26matches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) and the wholerave sample for which the given periastron time and the time of raveobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. rave measurementsof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with theirpublished radial velocity curves.

0709.4219	is the sky falling? searching for stellar streams in the local milky way  disc in the coravel and rave surveys	we have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local milky waydisc in the coravel and rave surveys. the coravel survey consists of localdwarf stars (nordstrom et al. geneva-copenhagen survey) and local famaey et al.giant stars. we select rave stars with radial velocities that are sensitive tothe galactic vertical space velocity (galactic latitude b &lt; -45 deg). kuiperstatistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the galactic verticalvelocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net verticalflow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with verticallycoherent kinematics. in contrast to the `field of streams' found in the outerhalo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by thecoravel dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), coravel giants (completewithin ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and rave (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoidof any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. this issufficiently sensitive to allow our rave sample to rule out the passing of thetidal stream of the disrupting sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solarneighbourhood. this agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit anddissociates it from the helmi et al. halo stream. our constraints on theabsence of the sgr stream near the sun could prove a useful tool fordiscriminating between galactic potential models. the lack of a net verticalflow through the solar neighbourhood in the coravel giants and rave samplesargues against the virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the sun. there areno vertical streams in the coravel giants and rave samples with stellardensities &gt;1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore noevidence for locally enhanced dark matter.

1204.6502	exploring the morphology of rave stellar spectra	the radial velocity experiment (rave) is a medium resolution r~7500spectroscopic survey of the milky way which already obtained over half amillion stellar spectra. they present a randomly selected magnitude-limitedsample, so it is important to use a reliable and automated classificationscheme which identifies normal single stars and discovers different types ofpeculiar stars. to this end we present a morphological classification of350,000 rave survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding, adimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectralmorphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving theproperties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. we find that the majority ofall spectra in the database ~90-95% belong to normal single stars, but there isalso a significant population of several types of peculiars. among them themost populated groups are those of various types of spectroscopic binary andchromospherically active stars. both of them include several thousands ofspectra. particularly the latter group offers significant further investigationopportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of stellar ages.applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single starsalone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional spacecorrelates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.

1205.0546	kinematic groups beyond the solar neighbourhood with rave	we analyse the kinematics of disc stars observed by the rave survey in andbeyond the solar neighbourhood.we detect significant overdensities in thevelocity distributions using a technique based on the wavelet transform.we findthat the main local kinematic groups are large scale features, surviving atleast up to ~1 kpc from the sun in the direction of anti-rotation, and also at~700 pc below the galactic plane.we also find that for regions located atdifferent radii than the sun, the known groups appear shifted in the velocityplane. for example, the hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity forregions inside the solar circle and a lower value outside. we have alsodiscovered a new group at (u, v) = (92,-22) km/s in the solar neighbourhood andconfirmed the significance of other previously found groups. some of thesetrends detected for the first time are consistent with dynamical models of theeffects of the bar and the spiral arms. more modelling is required todefinitively characterise the non-axisymmetric components of our galaxy usingthese groups.

1207.0363	the properties of the local spiral arms from rave data: two-dimensional  density wave approach	using the rave survey, we recently brought to light a gradient in the meangalactocentric radial velocity of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.this gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of thepotential, among which a perturbation by spiral arms is a possible explanation.here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model theradial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. provided that theradial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms thatcan affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model providesnew independent estimates for the parameters of the milky way spiral structure.our analysis favours a two-armed perturbation with the sun close to the innerultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance, with a pattern speed \omega_p=18.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}km/s/kpc and a small amplitude a=0.55 \pm 0.02% of the background potential(14% of the background density). this model can serve as a basis for numericalsimulations in three dimensions, additionally including a possible influence ofthe galactic bar and/or other non-axisymmetric modes.

1209.0456	thick disk kinematics from rave and the solar motion	radial velocity surveys such as the radial velocity experiment (rave) provideus with measurements of hundreds of thousands of nearby stars most of whichbelong to the galactic thin, thick disk or halo. ideally, to study the galacticdisks (both thin and thick) one should make use of the multi-dimensionalphase-space and the whole pattern of chemical abundances of their stellarpopulations. in this paper, with the aid of the rave survey, we study the thinand thick disks of the milky way, focusing on the latter. we present atechnique to disentangle the stellar content of the two disks based on thekinematics and other stellar parameters such as the surface gravity of thestars. using the padova galaxy model, we checked the ability of our method tocorrectly isolate the thick disk component from the galaxy mixture of stellarpopulations. we introduce selection criteria in order to clean the observedradial velocities from the galactic differential rotation and to take intoaccount the partial sky coverage of rave. we developed a numerical technique tostatistically disentangle thin and thick disks from their mixture. we deducethe components of the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest (lsr)in the radial and vertical direction, the rotational lag of the thick diskcomponent relative to the lsr, and the square root of the absolute value of thevelocity dispersion tensor for the thick disk alone. the analysis of the thindisk is presented in another paper. we find good agreement with previousindependent parameter determinations. in our analysis we used photometricallydetermined distances. in the appendix we show that similar values can be foundfor the thick disk alone as derived in the main sections of our paper evenwithout the knowledge of photometric distances.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

0712.3289	is agn feedback necessary to form red elliptical galaxies?	we have used gadget2 to simulate the formation of an elliptical galaxy in acosmological dark matter halo with mass 3x10^12m_sun/h. using a stellarpopulation synthesis model has allowed us to compute magnitudes, colours andsurface brightness profiles. we have included a model to follow the growth of acentral black hole and we have compared the results of simulations with andwithout feedback from agns. we have studied the interplay between cold gasaccretion and merging in the development of galactic morphologies, the linkbetween colour and morphology evolution, the effect of agn feedback on thephotometry of early type galaxies, the redshift evolution in the properties ofquasar hosts, and the impact of agn winds on the chemical enrichment of theintergalactic medium (igm). we have found that the early phases of galaxyformation are driven by the accretion of cold filamentary flows, which form adisc at the centre of the dark matter halo. when the dark matter halo issufficiently massive to support the propagation of a stable shock, coldaccretion is shut down, and the star formation rate begins to decline. mergerstransform the disc into an elliptical galaxy, but also bring gas into thegalaxy. without a mechanism that removes gas from the merger remnants, thegalaxy ends up with blue colours, atypical for its elliptical morphology. agnfeedback can solve this problem even with a fairly low heating efficiency. wehave also demonstrated that agn winds are potentially important for the metalenrichment of the igm a high redshift.(abridged)

0801.1232	the milky way's circular velocity curve to 60 kpc and an estimate of the  dark matter halo mass from kinematics of ~2400 sdss blue horizontal branch  stars	we derive new constraints on the mass of the milky way's dark matter halo,based on a set of halo stars from sdss as kinematic tracers. our samplecomprises 2401 rigorously selected blue horizontal-branch (bhb) halo starsdrawn from sdss dr-6. to interpret these distributions, we compare them tomatched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxyformation simulations designed to resemble the milky way, which we presume tohave an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. we then determine whichvalue of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$ brings the observed distribution into agreement withthe corresponding distributions from the simulations. this procedure results inan estimate of the milky way's circular velocity curve to $\sim 60$ kpc, whichis found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of $\rm 220 km s^{-1}$at the sun's location, and implies m$(&lt;60 \rm kpc) = 4.0\pm 0.7\times10^{11}$m$_\odot$. the radial dependence of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$, derived instatistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectationsfrom an nfw dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components atits center. if we assume an nfw halo profile of characteristic concentrationholds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the milkyway's dark matter halo, m$_{\rm vir}=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times10^{12}$m$_\odot$, which is lower than many previous estimates. this estimateimplies that nearly 40% of the baryons within the virial radius of the milkyway's dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our galaxy. a valuefor m$_{\rm vir}$ of only $\sim 1\times10^{12}$m$_\odot$ also (re-)opens thequestion of whether all of the milky way's satellite galaxies are on boundorbits.

1307.6073	the asymmetric drift, the local standard of rest, and implications from  rave data	the determination of the lsr is still a matter of debate. the classical valueof the tangential peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the lsr waschallenged in recent years, claiming a significantly larger value. we show thatthe radial velocity experiment (rave) sample of dwarf stars is an excellentdata set to derive tighter boundary conditions to chemodynamical evolutionmodels of the extended solar neighbourhood. we present an improved jeansanalysis, which allows a better interpretation of the measured kinematics ofstellar populations in the milky way disc. we propose an improved version ofthe str\"omberg relation with the radial scalelengths as the only unknown.binning rave stars in metallicity reveals a bigger asymmetric drift(corresponding to a smaller radial scalelength) for more metal-richpopulations. with the standard assumption of velocity-dispersion independentradial scalelengths in each metallicity bin, we redetermine the lsr. the newstr\"omberg equation yields a joint lsr value of v_\sun=3.06 \pm 0.68 km/s,which is even smaller than the classical value based on hipparcos data. thecorresponding radial scalelength increases from 1.6 kpc for the metal-rich binto 2.9 kpc for the metal-poor bin, with a trend of an even larger scalelengthfor young metal-poor stars. when adopting the recent sch\"onrich value ofv_\sun=12.24 km/s for the lsr, the new str\"omberg equation yields much largerindividual radial scalelengths of the rave subpopulations, which seemunphysical in part. the new str\"omberg equation allows a cleanerinterpretation of the kinematic data of disc stars in terms of radialscalelengths. lifting the lsr value by a few km/s compared to the classicalvalue results in strongly increased radial scalelengths with a trend of smallervalues for larger velocity dispersions.

1309.4272	constraints on the galactic bar from the hercules stream as traced with  rave across the galaxy	non-axisymmetries in the galactic potential (spiral arms and bar) inducekinematic groups such as the hercules stream. assuming that hercules is causedby the effects of the outer lindblad resonance of the galactic bar, we modelanalytically its properties as a function of position in the galaxy and itsdependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. using data from the ravesurvey we find that the azimuthal velocity of the hercules structure decreasesas a function of galactocentric radius, in a manner consistent with ouranalytical model. this allows us to obtain new estimates of the parameters ofthe milky way's bar. the combined likelihood function of the bar's patternspeed and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\omega_b=(1.89 \pm0.08) \times \omega_0$ where $\omega_0$ is the local circular frequency.assuming a solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular velocity of 238 km/s,this corresponds to $\omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. on the other hand, the bar'sorientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. in fact,the likelihood function shows that a tight correlation exists between thepattern speed and the orientation, implying that a better description of ourbest fit results is given by the linear relation $\omega_b/\omega_0=1.91 +0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. for example, for anangle of $\phi_b=30\deg$ the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. theseresults are not very sensitive to the other galactic parameters such as thecircular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the sun, and are robust tobiases in distance.

1309.4293	the rave survey: the galactic escape speed and the mass of the milky way	we construct new estimates on the galactic escape speed at variousgalactocentric radii using the latest data release of the radial velocityexperiment (rave dr4). compared to previous studies we have a database largerby a factor of 10 as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars.our analysis is based on the statistical analysis of a rigorously selectedsample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from rave and a previously published dataset. we calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of milky way-sized galaxies. our best estimate ofthe local galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed requiredto reach three virial radii $r_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%confidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $r_{340}$ isthe galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times thecritical density for closure in the universe. from the escape speed we furtherderive estimates of the mass of the galaxy using a simple mass model with twooptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and anadiabatically contracted navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) sphere. if we fix thelocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher massthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on haloconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint wefind very similar masses for both models. our best estimate for $m_{340}$, themass interior to $r_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times 10^{12}$ m$_\odot$ (corresponding to $m_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times10^{12}$ m$_\odot$). this estimate is in good agreement with recently publishedindependent mass estimates based on the kinematics of more distant halo starsand the satellite galaxy leo i.

1310.1919	in the thick of it: metal-poor disc stars in rave	by selecting in the rave-dr4 survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpcabove the galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplestthree-component model (thin disc, thick disc, halo) for the milky way. weconfirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions ofthe thick disc are not gaussian. in particular, we find that the thick disc hasan extended metallicity tail going at least down to [m/h]=-2 dex, contributingroughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorterscale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. the mean azimuthal velocityof these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between themetallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on theformation mechanisms of the galactic thick disc. given our simple approach, wefind dvphi/d[m/h] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement withprevious literature values. we complete the study with a brief discussion onthe implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggestthat given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed byradial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

1404.3907	the shape of the radio wavefront of extensive air showers as measured  with lofar	extensive air showers, induced by high energy cosmic rays impinging on theearth's atmosphere, produce radio emission that is measured with the lofarradio telescope. as the emission comes from a finite distance of a fewkilometers, the incident wavefront is non-planar. a spherical, conical orhyperbolic shape of the wavefront has been proposed, but measurements ofindividual air showers have been inconclusive so far. for a selectedhigh-quality sample of 161 measured extensive air showers, we havereconstructed the wavefront by measuring pulse arrival times to sub-nanosecondprecision in 200 to 350 individual antennas. for each measured air shower, wehave fitted a conical, spherical, and hyperboloid shape to the arrival times.the fit quality and a likelihood analysis show that a hyperboloid is the bestparametrization. using a non-planar wavefront shape gives an improved angularresolution, when reconstructing the shower arrival direction. furthermore, adependence of the wavefront shape on the shower geometry can be seen. thissuggests that it will be possible to use a wavefront shape analysis to get anadditional handle on the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, which issensitive to the mass of the primary particle.

1406.4130	constraining the galaxy's dark halo with rave stars	we use the kinematics of $\sim200\,000$ giant stars that lie within $\sim1.5$ kpc of the plane to measure the vertical profile of mass density near thesun. we find that the dark mass contained within the isodensity surface of thedark halo that passes through the sun($(6\pm0.9)\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$), and the surface density within$0.9$ kpc of the plane ($(69\pm10)\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$) are almostindependent of the (oblate) halo's axis ratio $q$. if the halo is spherical, 46per cent of the radial force on the sun is provided by baryons, and only 4.3per cent of the galaxy's mass is baryonic. if the halo is flattened, thebaryons contribute even less strongly to the local radial force and to thegalaxy's mass. the dark-matter density at the location of the sun is$0.0126\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-3}}=0.48\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{gev\,cm^{-3}}$.when combined with other literature results we find hints for a mildly oblatedark halo with $q \simeq 0.8$. our value for the dark mass within the solarradius is larger than that predicted by cosmological dark-matter-onlysimulations but in good agreement with simulations once the effects of baryonicinfall are taken into account. our mass models consist of threedouble-exponential discs, an oblate bulge and a navarro-frenk-white dark-matterhalo, and we model the dynamics of the rave stars in the correspondinggravitational fields by finding distribution functions $f(\mathbf{j})$ thatdepend on three action integrals. statistical errors are completely swamped bysystematic uncertainties, the most important of which are the distance to thestars in the photometric and spectroscopic samples and the solar distance tothe galactic centre. systematics other than the flattening of the dark haloyield overall uncertainties $\sim 15$ per cent.

1406.7242	lofar sparse image reconstruction	context. the low frequency array (lofar) radio telescope is a giant digitalphased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in europe. itprovides discrete sets of fourier components of the sky brightness. recoveringthe original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverseproblem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methodsaims. recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete natureof radio interferometry measurement and the "compressed sensing" (cs) theory,which supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measuredvisibilities. empowered by proximal theory, cs offers a sound framework forefficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fastalgorithms. combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (dde) in thescope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based onthis framework methods. we implemented a sparse reconstruction method in thestandard lofar imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolutionperformance of this new imager with that of clean-based methods (clean andms-clean) with simulated and real lofar data results. we show that i) sparsereconstruction performs as well as clean in recovering the flux of pointsources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean squareerror is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with aneffective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the clean images.conclusions. sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic andwide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (ofsimulated and real lofar datasets). this sparse reconstruction method iscompatible with modern interferometric imagers that handle dde corrections (a-and w-projections) required for current and future instruments such as lofarand ska

1407.2093	initial lofar observations of epoch of reionization windows: ii. diffuse  polarized emission in the elais-n1 field	this study aims to characterise the polarized foreground emission in theelais-n1 field and to address its possible implications for the extraction ofthe cosmological 21-cm signal from the low-frequency array - epoch ofreionization (lofar-eor) data. we use the high band antennas of lofar to imagethis region and rm-synthesis to unravel structures of polarized emission athigh galactic latitudes. the brightness temperature of the detected galacticemission is on average 4 k in polarized intensity and covers the range from -10to +13rad m^-2 in faraday depth. the total polarized intensity and polarizationangle show a wide range of morphological features. we have also used thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) at 350 mhz to image the sameregion. the lofar and wsrt images show a similar complex morphology, atcomparable brightness levels, but their spatial correlation is very low. thefractional polarization at 150 mhz, expressed as a percentage of the totalintensity, amounts to 1.5%. there is no indication of diffuse emission in totalintensity in the interferometric data, in line with results at higherfrequencies. the wide frequency range, good angular resolution and goodsensitivity make lofar an exquisite instrument for studying galactic polarizedemission at a resolution of 1-2 rad m^-2 in faraday depth. the differentpolarised patterns observed at 150 mhz and 350 mhz are consistent withdifferent source distributions along the line of sight wring in a variety offaraday thin regions of emission. the presence of polarised foregrounds is aserious complication for epoch of reionization experiments. to avoid theleakage of polarized emission into total intensity, which can depend onfrequency, we need to calibrate the instrumental polarization across the fieldof view to a small fraction of 1%.

1408.6236	spectroscopic signatures of extra-tidal stars around the globular  clusters ngc 6656 (m22), ngc 3201 and ngc 1851 from rave	stellar population studies of globular clusters have suggested that thebrightest clusters in the galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarfspheroidal galaxies. if the present galactic globular clusters formed withinlarger stellar systems, they are likely surrounded by extra-tidal halos and/ortails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems.the stellar surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the bestplaces to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. here an attempt ismade to search for tidal debris around the supernovae enriched globularclusters m22 and ngc 1851 as well as the kinematically unique cluster ngc 3201.the stellar parameters from the radial velocity experiment (rave) are used toidentify stars with rave metallicities, radial velocities andelemental-abundances consistent with the abundance patterns and properties ofthe stars in m22, ngc 1851 and ngc 3201. the discovery of rave stars that maybe associated with m22 and ngc 1851 are reported, some of which are atprojected distances of ~10 degrees away from the core of these clusters.numerous rave stars associated with ngc 3201 suggest that either the tidalradius of this cluster is underestimated, or that there are some unbound starsextending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. no furtherextra-tidal stars associated with ngc 3201 could be identified. the brightmagnitudes of the rave stars make them easy targets for high resolutionfollow-up observations, allowing an eventual further chemical tagging tosolidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidaldebris. in both our radial velocity histograms of the regions surrounding ngc1851 and ngc 3201, a peak of stars at 230 km/s is seen, consistent withextended tidal debris from omega centauri.

1409.5437	lofar low-band antenna observations of the 3c295 and bootes fields:  source counts and ultra-steep spectrum sources	we present lofar low band observations of the bootes and 3c295 fields. ourimages made at 34, 46, and 62 mhz reach noise levels of 12, 8, and 5 mjybeam$^{-1}$, making them the deepest images ever obtained in this frequencyrange. in total, we detect between 300 and 400 sources in each of these images,covering an area of 17 to 52 deg$^{2}$. from the observations we deriveeuclidean-normalized differential source counts. the 62 mhz source counts agreewith previous gmrt 153 mhz and vla 74 mhz differential source counts, scalingwith a spectral index of $-0.7$. we find that a spectral index scaling of$-0.5$ is required to match up the lofar 34 mhz source counts. this result isalso in agreement with source counts from the 38 mhz 8c survey, indicating thatthe average spectral index of radio sources flattens towards lower frequencies.we also find evidence for spectral flattening using the individual fluxmeasurements of sources between 34 and 1400 mhz and by calculating the spectralindex averaged over the source population. to select ultra-steep spectrum($\alpha &lt; -1.1$) radio sources, that could be associated with massive highredshift radio galaxies, we compute spectral indices between 62 mhz, 153 mhzand 1.4 ghz for sources in the bo\"otes field. we cross-correlate these radiosources with optical and infrared catalogues and fit the spectral energydistribution to obtain photometric redshifts. we find that most of theseultra-steep spectrum sources are located in the $ 0.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.5$range.

1412.1484	characterizing the high-velocity stars of rave: the discovery of a  metal-rich halo star born in the galactic disk	we aim to characterize high-velocity (hivel) stars in the solar vicinity bothchemically and kinematically using the fourth data release of the radialvelocity experiment (rave). we used a sample of 57 hivel stars with galacticrest-frame velocities larger than 275 km s$^{-1}$. with 6d position andvelocity information, we integrated the orbits of the hivel stars and foundthat, on average, they reach out to 13 kpc from the galactic plane and haverelatively eccentric orbits consistent with the galactic halo. using thestellar parameters and [$\alpha$/fe] estimates from rave, we found themetallicity distribution of the hivel stars peak at [m/h] = -1.2 dex and ischemically consistent with the inner halo. there are a few notable exceptionsthat include a hypervelocity star (hvs) candidate, an extremely high-velocitybound halo star, and one star that is kinematically consistent with the halobut chemically consistent with the disk. high-resolution spectra were obtainedfor the metal-rich hivel star candidate and the second highest velocity star inthe sample. using these high-resolution data, we report the discovery of ametal-rich halo star that has likely been dynamically ejected into the halofrom the galactic thick disk. this discovery could aid in explaining theassembly of the most metal-rich component of the galactic halo.

1412.5649	the rich are different: evidence from the rave survey for stellar radial  migration	using the radial velocity experiment fourth data release (rave dr4), and anew metallicity calibration that will be also taken into account in the futurerave dr5, we investigate the existence and the properties of super-solarmetallicity stars ([m/h] &gt; +0.1 dex) in the sample, and in particular in thesolar neighbourhood. we find that rave is rich in super-solar metallicitystars, and that the local metallicity distribution function declines remarkablyslowly up to +0.4 dex. our results show that the kinematics and heightdistributions of the super-solar metallicity stars are identical to those ofthe [m/h] &lt; 0 thin-disc giants that we presume were locally manufactured. theeccentricities of the super-solar metallicity stars indicate that half of themare on a roughly circular orbit (e &lt; 0.15), so under the assumption that themetallicity of the interstellar medium at a given radius never decreases withtime, they must have increased their angular momenta by scattering atcorotation resonances of spiral arms from regions far inside the solar annulus.the likelihood that a star will migrate radially does not seem to decreasesignificantly with increasing amplitude of vertical oscillations within rangeof oscillation amplitudes encountered in the disc.

1502.06606	on the formation of galactic thick disks	recent spectroscopic observations in the milky way suggest that thechemically defined thick disk (stars with high [alpha/fe] ratios and thus old)has a significantly smaller scale-length than the thin disk. this is inapparent contradiction with observations of external edge-on galaxies, wherethe thin and thick components have comparable scale-lengths. moreover, whileobserved disks do not flare (scale-height does not increase with radius),numerical simulations suggest that disk flaring is unavoidable, resulting fromboth environmental effects and secular evolution. here we address theseproblems by studying two different suites of simulated galactic disks formed inthe cosmological context. we show that the scale-heights of coeval populationsalways increase with radius. however, the total population can be decomposedmorphologically into thin and thick disks, which do not flare. we relate thisto the disk inside-out formation, where younger populations have increasinglylarger scale-lengths and flare at progressively larger radii. in this newpicture, thick disks are composed of the imbedded flares of mono-age stellarpopulations. assuming that disks form inside out, we predict thatmorphologically defined thick disks must show a decrease in age (or [alpha/fe]ratios) with radius and that coeval populations should always flare. this alsoexplains the observed inversion in the metallicity and [alpha/fe] gradients forstars away from the disk midplane in the milky way. the results of this workare directly linked to, and can be seen as evidence of, inside-out disk growth.

1503.02072	the imprints of the galactic bar on the thick disk with rave	we study the kinematics of a local sample of stars, located within a cylinderof 500 pc radius centered on the sun, in the rave dataset. we find clearasymmetries in the $v_r$-$v_\phi$ velocity distributions of thin and thick diskstars: here are more stars moving radially outwards for low azimuthalvelocities and more radially inwards for high azimuthal velocities. suchasymmetries have been previously reported for the thin disk as being due to thegalactic bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures areseen in the thick disk. our findings imply that the velocities of thick diskstars should no longer be described by schwarzschild's, multivariate gaussianor purely axisymmetric distributions. furthermore, the nature of previouslyreported substructures in the thick disk needs to be revisited as these couldbe associated with dynamical resonances rather than to accretion events. it isclear that dynamical models of the galaxy must fit the 3d velocitydistributions of the disks, rather than the projected 1d, if we are tounderstand the galaxy fully.

1503.06990	young [$\alpha$/fe]-enhanced stars discovered by corot and apogee: what  is their origin?	we report the discovery of a group of apparently young corot red-giant starsexhibiting enhanced [alpha/fe] abundance ratios (as determined from apogeespectra) with respect to solar values. their existence is not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the milky way, and shows that thechemical-enrichment history of the galactic disc is more complex. we findsimilar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could berobustly obtained, although in smaller relative numbers, which could explainwhy these stars have not received prior attention. the young [alpha/fe]-richstars are much more numerous in the corot-apogee (corogee) inner-field samplethan in any other high-resolution sample available at present, as only corogeecan explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. thekinematic properties of the young [$\alpha$/fe]-rich stars are not clearlythick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the galacticmid-plane. our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguingobservations in the milky way is that these stars were formed close to the endof the galactic bar, near corotation -- a region where gas can be kept inertfor longer times, compared to other regions shocked more frequently by thepassage of spiral arms. moreover, that is where the mass return from olderinner-disc stellar generations should be maximal (according to an inside-outdisc-formation scenario), further diluting the in-situ gas. other possibilitiesto explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are alsodiscussed.

1504.06642	the peculiar radio galaxy 4c 35.06: a case for recurrent agn activity?	using observations obtained with the low fequency array (lofar), thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and archival very large array (vla)data, we have traced the radio emission to large scales in the complex source4c 35.06 located in the core of the galaxy cluster abell 407. at higher spatialresolution (~4"), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offsetby about 11 kpc (in projection).  at 62 mhz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to210 kpc. at 1.4 ghz and intermediate spatial resolution (~30"), the structureappears to have a helical morphology.  we have derived the characteristics of the radio spectral index across thesource. we show that the source morphology is most likely the result of atleast two episodes of agn activity separated by a dormant period of around 35myr.  the agn is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of abell407. we propose that it is intermittently active as it moves in the denseenvironment in the cluster core. using lofar, we can trace the relic plasmafrom that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than everbefore.  using the the wsrt, we detect hi in absorption against the center of theradio source. the absorption profile is relatively broad (fwhm of 288 km/s),similar to what is found in other clusters.  understanding the duty cycle of the radio emission as well as the triggeringmechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provideimportant constraints to quantify the impact of agn feedback on galaxyevolution. the study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphologicaland spectral information promises to bring new important insights in thisfield.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1511.09118	imaging jupiter's radiation belts down to 127 mhz with lofar	context. observing jupiter's synchrotron emission from the earth remainstoday the sole method to scrutinize the distribution and dynamical behavior ofthe ultra energetic electrons magnetically trapped around the planet (becausein-situ particle data are limited in the inner magnetosphere). aims. we performthe first resolved and low-frequency imaging of the synchrotron emission withlofar at 127 mhz. the radiation comes from low energy electrons (~1-30 mev)which map a broad region of jupiter's inner magnetosphere. methods (see articlefor complete abstract) results. the first resolved images of jupiter'sradiation belts at 127-172 mhz are obtained along with total integrated fluxdensities. they are compared with previous observations at higher frequenciesand show a larger extent of the synchrotron emission source (&gt;=4 $r_j$). theasymmetry and the dynamic of east-west emission peaks are measured and thepresence of a hot spot at lambda_iii=230 {\deg} $\pm$ 25 {\deg}. spectral fluxdensity measurements are on the low side of previous (unresolved) ones,suggesting a low-frequency turnover and/or time variations of the emissionspectrum. conclusions. lofar is a powerful and flexible planetary imager. theobservations at 127 mhz depict an extended emission up to ~4-5 planetary radii.the similarities with high frequency results reinforce the conclusion that: i)the magnetic field morphology primarily shapes the brightness distribution ofthe emission and ii) the radiating electrons are likely radially andlatitudinally distributed inside about 2 $r_j$. nonetheless, the larger extentof the brightness combined with the overall lower flux density, yields newinformation on jupiter's electron distribution, that may shed light on theorigin and mode of transport of these particles.

1512.00014	lofar msss: detection of a low-frequency radio transient in 400 hrs of  monitoring of the north celestial pole	we present the results of a four-month campaign searching for low-frequencyradio transients near the north celestial pole with the low-frequency array(lofar), as part of the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss). the datawere recorded between 2011 december and 2012 april and comprised 2149 11-minutesnapshots, each covering 175 deg^2. we have found one convincing candidateastrophysical transient, with a duration of a few minutes and a flux density at60 mhz of 15-25 jy. the transient does not repeat and has no obvious optical orhigh-energy counterpart, as a result of which its nature is unclear. thedetection of this event implies a transient rate at 60 mhz of 3.9 (+14.7, -3.7)x 10^-4 day^-1 deg^-2, and a transient surface density of 1.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2,at a 7.9-jy limiting flux density and ~10-minute time-scale. the campaign datawere also searched for transients at a range of other time-scales, from 0.5 to297 min, which allowed us to place a range of limits on transient rates at 60mhz as a function of observation duration.

astro-ph;0012337	the power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations	high-resolution n-body simulations are used to examine the power spectrumdependence of the concentration of galaxy-sized dark matter halos. it is foundthat dark halo concentrations depend on the amplitude of mass fluctuations aswell as on the ratio of power between small and virial mass scales. thisfinding is consistent with the original results of navarro, frenk &amp; white(nfw), and allows their model to be extended to include power spectrasubstantially different from cold dark matter (cdm). in particular, thesingle-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halomass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm darkmatter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for theconcentration of cdm halos than proposed by nfw. the latter conclusion confirmsrecent suggestions by bullock et al., although this new modeling differs fromtheirs in detail. these findings imply that observational limits on theconcentration, such as those provided by estimates of the dark matter contentwithin individual galaxies, may be used to constrain the amplitude of massfluctuations on galactic and subgalactic scales. the constraints on$\lambda$cdm models posed by the dark mass within the solar circle in the milkyway and by the zero-point of the tully-fisher relation are revisited, with theresult that neither dataset is clearly incompatible with the `concordance'($\omega_0=0.3$, $\lambda_0=0.7$, $\sigma_8=0.9$) $\lambda$cdm cosmogony. thisconclusion differs from that reached recently by navarro &amp; steinmetz, adisagreement that can be traced to inconsistencies in the normalization of the$\lambda$cdm power spectrum used in that work.

0808.1456	diffuse interstellar bands in rave survey spectra	we have used spectra of hot stars from the rave survey in order toinvestigate the visibility and properties of five diffuse interstellar bandspreviously reported in the literature. the rave spectroscopic survey forgalactic structure and kinematics records ccd spectra covering the 8400-8800ang wavelength region at 7500 resolving power. the spectra are obtained withthe uk schmidt at the aao, equipped with the 6df multi-fiber positioner. thedib at 8620.4 ang is by far the strongest and cleanest of all dibs occurringwithin the rave wavelength range, with no interference by underlying absorptionstellar lines in hot stars. it correlates so tightly with reddening that itturns out to be a reliable tool to measure it, following the relation e(b-v) =2.72 (+/- 0.03) x e.w.(ang), valid throughout the general interstellar mediumof our galaxy. the presence of a dib at 8648 ang is confirmed. its intensityappears unrelated to reddening, in agreement with scanty and preliminaryreports available in the literature, and its measurability is stronglycompromised by severe blending with underlying stellar hei doublet at 8649 ang.the two weak dibs at 8531 and 8572 ang do not appear real and should actuallybe blends of underlying stellar lines. the very weak dib at 8439 ang cannot beresolved within the profile of the much stronger underlying hydrogen paschen 18stellar line.

astro-ph;0106049	tidal torques and galactic warps	we investigate the tilting and warping of galactic disks in response to tidaltorquing. the strength of the torque is determined from cosmological n-bodysimulations. we find the tidal torques to be dominated by substructure in thegalactic halo, such as dwarf satellites, and by a misalignment between the diskangular momentum and the figure axes of the dark matter halo. the radialdependence of the torque can approximated by a power law of index -2.5. amassless disk subjected to such a torque develops a trailing warp similar tothose seen in a large number of disk galaxies, i.e. the inner regions of thedisk tilt faster than the outer disk. in the case of massive disks, selfgravity causes the inner disk to stay locally flat and only the outer regionsshow the signatures of warps. the radius outside of which a massive disk iswarped depends on the local surface density of the disk and on the product ofthe strength of the torque and the exposure time to this torque.

astro-ph;0112038	b1422+231: the influence of mass substructure on strong lensing	in this work we investigate the gravitationally lensed system b1422+231.high--quality vlbi image positions, fluxes and shapes as well as an optical hstlens galaxy position are used. first, two simple and smooth models for the lensgalaxy are applied to fit observed image positions and fluxes; no even remotelyacceptable model was found. such models also do not accurately reproduce theimage shapes. in order to fit the data successfully, mass substructure has tobe added to the lens, and its level is estimated. to explore expectations aboutthe level of substructure in galaxies and its influence on strong lensing,n-body simulation results of a model galaxy are employed. by using the massdistribution of this model galaxy as a lens, synthetic data sets of differentfour image system configurations are generated and simple lens models are againapplied to fit them. the difficulties in fitting these lens systems turn out tobe similar to the case of some real gravitationally lensed systems, thuspossibly providing evidence for the presence and strong influence ofsubstructure in the primary lens galaxy.

astro-ph;0202466	the hierarchical origin of galaxy morphologies	we report first results from a series of n-body/gasdynamical simulationsdesigned to study the origin of galaxy morphologies in a cold darkmatter-dominated universe. the simulations include star formation and feedbackand have numerical resolution sufficiently high to allow for a directinvestigation of the morphology of simulated galaxies. we find, in agreementwith previous theoretical work, that the presence of the main morphologicalcomponents of galaxies--disks, spheroids, bars--is regulated by the mode of gasaccretion and intimately linked to discrete accretion events. in the case wepresent, disks arise from the smooth deposition of cooled gas at the center ofdark halos, spheroids result from the stirring of preexisting disks duringmergers, and bars are triggered by tides generated by satellites. thisdemonstrates that morphology is a transient phenomenon within the lifetime of agalaxy and that the hubble sequence reflects the varied accretion histories ofgalaxies in hierarchical formation scenarios. in particular, we demonstratedirectly that disk/bulge systems can be built and rebuilt by the smoothaccretion of gas onto the remnant of a major merger and that the present-dayremnants of late dissipative mergers between disks are spheroidal stellarsystems with structure resembling that of field ellipticals. the perplexingvariety of galaxy morphologies is thus highly suggestive of--and may actuallyeven demand--a universe where structures have evolved hierarchically.

astro-ph;0207012	using vlbi data to investigate the galaxy structure in the  gravitationally lensed system b1422+231	gravitationally lensed systems with multiply imaged quasars are an excellenttool for studying the properties of distant galaxies. in particular, theyprovide the most accurate mass measures for the lensing galaxy. the systemb1422+231 is a well studied example of a quadruply imaged quasar, withhigh-quality vlbi data available. very accurate data on image positions, fluxesand deconvolved image sizes provide good constraints for lensing models. wediscuss here the failure of smooth models in fitting the data. since it isintuitively clear that the mass of a lens galaxy is not a smooth entity, wehave investigated how deviation from a smooth model can influence lensingphenomena, especially the image flux ratios. to explore expectations about thelevel of substructure in galaxies and its influence on strong lensing, n-bodysimulations of a model galaxy are employed. by using the mass distribution ofthis model galaxy as a lens, synthetic data sets of different four image systemconfigurations are generated. their analysis can possibly provide evidence forthe presence and strong influence of substructure in the primary lens galaxy.

astro-ph;0306238	the signature of substructure on gravitational lensing in the lcdm  cosmological model	we present a study of the lens properties of quadruply imaged systems, lensedby numerically simulated galaxies. we investigate a simulated elliptical anddisc galaxy drawn from high resolution simulations of galaxy formation in aconcordance $\lambda$cdm universe. the simulations include the effects of gasdynamics, star formation and feedback processes. flux-ratio anomalies observedin strong gravitational lensing potentially provide an indicator for thepresence of mass substructure in lens galaxies as predicted from cdmsimulations. we particularly concentrate on the prediction that, for an idealcusp caustic, the sum of the signed magnifications of the three highlymagnified images should vanish when the source approaches the cusp. strongviolation of this cusp relation indicates the presence of substructure,regardless of the global, smooth mass model of the lens galaxy. we draw thefollowing conclusions: (1) the level of substructure present in simulationsproduces violations of the cusp relation comparable to those observed, (2)higher-order catastrophes (e.g. swallowtails) can also cause changes of theorder of 0.6 in the cusp relation as predicted by a smooth model, (3) the fluxanomaly distribution depends on the image parity and flux and both thebrightest minimum and saddle-point images are more affected by substructurethan the fainter images. in addition, the brightest saddle point is demagnifiedw.r.t. the brightest minimum. our results are fully numerical and properlyinclude all mass scales, without making semi-analytic assumptions. they areultimately limited by the mass resolution of single particles in the simulationdetermined by current computational limits, however show that our results arenot affected by shot-noise due to the finite number of particles.

astro-ph;0505401	pieces of the puzzle: ancient substructure in the galactic disk	we search for signatures of past accretion events in the milky way in therecently published catalogue by nordstrom et al.(2004), containing accuratespatial and kinematic information as well as metallicities for 13240 nearbystars. to optimize our strategy, we use numerical simulations to characterizethe properties of the debris from disrupted satellites. we find that stars witha common progenitor should show distinct correlations between their orbitalparameters; in particular, between the apocentre a and pericentre p, as well astheir z-angular momentum (l_z). in the apl-space, such stars are expected tocluster around regions of roughly constant eccentricity.  the apl space for the nordstrom catalogue exhibits a wealth of substructure,much of which can be linked to dynamical perturbations induced by spiral armsand the galactic bar. however, our analysis also reveals a statisticallysignificant excess of stars on orbits of common (moderate) eccentricity,analogous to the pattern expected for merger debris. besides being dynamicallypeculiar, the 274 stars in these substructures have very distinct metallicityand age distributions, providing further evidence of their extra-galacticprovenance. it is possible to identify among these stars, three coherent groupswith characteristic ages and metallicities, that, in all likelihood, correspondto the remains of disrupted satellites.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0606360	the dependence of the mass assembly history of cold dark matter halos on  environment	we show by means of a high-resolution n-body simulation how the mass assemblyhistories of galaxy-size cold dark matter (cdm) halos depend on environment.halos in high density environments form earlier and a higher fraction of theirmass is assembled in major mergers, compared to low density environments. thedistribution of the present-day specific mass aggregation rate is stronglydependent on environment. while in low density environments only ~20% of thehalos are not accreting mass at the present epoch, this fraction rises to ~80%at high densities. at z=1 the median of the specific aggregation rate is ~4times larger than at z=0 and almost independent on environment. all thedependences on environment found here are critically enhanced by localprocesses associated to subhalos because the fraction of subhalos increases asthe environment gets denser. the distribution of the halo specific massaggregation rate as well as its dependence on environment resemble therelations for the specific star formation rate distribution of galaxies. ananalogue of the morphology-density relation is also present at the level of cdmhalos, being driven by the halo major merging history. nevertheless, baryonicprocesses are necessary in order to explain further details and the evolutionof the star formation rate-, color- and morphology-environment relations.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.

astro-ph;9703014	the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies in different  cosmogonies	the formation of galaxy clusters in hierarchically clustering universes isinvestigated by means of high resolution n-body simulations. the simulationsare performed using a newly developed multi-mass scheme which combines a pmcode with a high resolution n-body code. numerical effects due to time steppingand gravitational softening are investigated as well as the influence of thesimulation box size and of the assumed boundary conditions. special emphasis islaid on the formation process and the influence of various cosmologicalparameters. cosmogonies with massive neutrinos are also considered. differencesbetween clusters in the same cosmological model seem to dominate overdifferences due differing background cosmogony. the cosmological model canalter the time evolution of cluster collapse, but the merging pattern remainsfairly similar, e.g. number of mergers and mass ratio of mergers. the grossproperties of a halo, such as its size and total angular momentum, also evolvein a similar manner for all cosmogonies and can be described using analyticalmodels. it is shown that the density distribution of a halo shows acharacteristic radial dependence which follows a power law with a slope of$\alpha=-1$ at small and $\alpha=-3$ at large radii, independent of thebackground cosmogony or the considered redshift. the shape of the densityprofiles follows the generic form proposed by navarro et al. (1996) for allhierarchically clustering scenarios and retains very little information aboutthe formation process or the cosmological model. only the central matterconcentration of a halo is correlated to the formation time and therefore tothe corresponding cosmogony. we emphasise the role of non-radial motions of thehalo particles in the evolution of the density profile.

astro-ph;9906160	the santa barbara cluster comparison project: a comparison of  cosmological hydrodynamics solutions	we have simulated the formation of an x-ray cluster in a cold dark matteruniverse using 12 different codes. the codes span the range of numericaltechniques and implementations currently in use, including sph and grid methodswith fixed, deformable or multilevel meshes. the goal of this comparison is toassess the reliability of cosmological gas dynamical simulations of clusters inthe simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed tobe non-radiative. we compare images of the cluster at different epochs, globalproperties such as mass, temperature and x-ray luminosity, and radial profilesof various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. on the whole, theagreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number ofdiscrepancies exist. agreement is best for properties of the dark matter andworst for the total x-ray luminosity. even in this case, simulations thatadequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total x-rayluminosities that agree to within a factor of two. other quantities arereproduced to much higher accuracy. for example, the temperature and gas massfraction within the virial radius agree to about 10%, and the ratio of specifickinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5%. various factorscontribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties, includingdifferences in the internal timing of the simulations. based on the overallconsistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of thecluster we have modelled.
