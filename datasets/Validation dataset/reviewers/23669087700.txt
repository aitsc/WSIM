84906925520	Research on multi-model predictive control strategy of three-level PWM rectifier	In order to explore the three-level PWM rectifier high-performance control method when inductor and equivalent resistance parameters mismatch, a novel multi-model predictive control strategy is proposed combining multi-model adaptive control with model predictive control. In this control strategy a multi-model control system is designed for the three-phase PWM rectifier based on the parameter measurements and range of disturbance. Several sub-models are selected by judging the deviation between each sub-model predicted output and actual output. The optimal system parameters are determined through a weighted sum. To solve online computational burden caused by the combination of multi-model adaptive control and model predictive control, comme a simplified algorithm is designed by optimizing the moving subset and designing multi-level fast predictive control method. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method and the feasibility of the control strategy.

84907104129	Instantaneous switching frequency suppression method for three-level PWM rectifier based on satisfactory optimization	This paper proposed an improved finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for three-level PWM rectifier. In order to avoid the complex adjusting process of weighting coefficient, the concept of satisfactory optimization was introduced into the online optimization for FCS-MPC. However, considering that a three-level PWM rectifier can only provide 27 practical voltage vectors, it is easy to cause the rolling optimization insoluble if too many constraints are added into the online optimization. Principle of the insoluble phenomenon was analyzed by the geometric method. Meanwhile the inner link between the no solution phenomenon and the high instantaneous switching frequency was also demonstrated. The optimized content at low priority can participate in the online optimization, by relaxing constraints to weaken the boundary between the satisfaction and uncontrollability. Simulation and experimental results show that under the condition of keeping the system power, neutral point voltage and some other optimized content reaching the allowed error, the method tries its best to reduce the switching frequency, avoids the local overheating of power device by the high sampling frequency. Compared with the classical field oriented control (FOC), the proposed MPC can obtain more excellent dynamic and steady state performance at low switching frequency (f
