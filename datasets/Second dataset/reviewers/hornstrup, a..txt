0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0903.2139	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. i. the transiting  planetary system wasp-5	we present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolarplanetary system wasp-5, obtained with the danish 1.54m telescope at eso lasilla. in order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussedthe telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter40 pixels (16 arcsec). data reduction was undertaken using standard aperturephotometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparisonstars. the resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag forthe first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. we construct detailed signal tonoise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to ourobservations. we model the light curves with the jktebop code and combine theresults with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary modelsto derive the physical properties of the wasp-5 system. we find that the planethas a mass of m_b = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033 mjup, a radius of r_b = 1.171 +/-0.056 +/- 0.012 rjup, a large surface gravity of g_b = 29.6 +/- 2.8 m/s2 and adensity of rho_b = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematicuncertainties). the planet's high equilibrium temperature of t_eq = 1732 +/- 80k makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1203.1291	ogle-2008-blg-510: first automated real-time detection of a weak  microlensing anomaly - brown dwarf or stellar binary?	the microlensing event ogle-2008-blg-510 is characterised by an evidentasymmetric shape of the peak, promptly detected by the artemis system in realtime. the skewness of the light curve appears to be compatible both withbinary-lens and binary-source models, including the possibility that the lenssystem consists of an m dwarf orbited by a brown dwarf. the detection of thismicrolensing anomaly and our analysis demonstrates that: 1) automated real-timedetection of weak microlensing anomalies with immediate feedback is feasible,efficient, and sensitive, 2) rather common weak features intrinsically comewith ambiguities that are not easily resolved from photometric light curves, 3)a modelling approach that finds all features of parameter space rather thanjust the `favourite model' is required, and 4) the data quality is mostcrucial, where systematics can be confused with real features, in particularsmall higher-order effects such as orbital motion signatures. it moreoverbecomes apparent that events with weak signatures are a silver mine forstatistical studies, although not easy to exploit. clues about the apparentpaucity of both brown-dwarf companions and binary-source microlensing eventsmight hide here.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1208.2323	microlensig binaries with candidate brown dwarf companions	brown dwarfs are important objects because they may provide a missing linkbetween stars and planets, two populations that have dramatically differentformation history. in this paper, we present the candidate binaries with browndwarf companions that are found by analyzing binary microlensing eventsdiscovered during 2004 - 2011 observation seasons. based on the low mass ratiocriterion of q &lt; 0.2, we found 7 candidate events, including ogle-2004-blg-035,ogle-2004-blg-039, ogle-2007-blg-006, ogle-2007-blg-399/moa-2007-blg-334,moa-2011-blg-104/ogle-2011-blg-0172, moa-2011-blg-149, andmoa-201-blg-278/ogle-2011-blg-012n. among them, we are able to confirm that thecompanions of the lenses of moa-2011-blg-104/ogle-2011-blg-0172 andmoa-2011-blg-149 are brown dwarfs by determining the mass of the lens based onthe simultaneous measurement of the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured mass of the brown dwarf companions are (0.02 +/- 0.01) m_sun and(0.019 +/- 0.002) m_sun for moa-2011-blg-104/ogle-2011-blg-0172 andmoa-2011-blg-149, respectively, and both companions are orbiting low mass mdwarf host stars. more microlensing brown dwarfs are expected to be detected asthe number of lensing events with well covered light curves increases with newgeneration searches.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1305.3606	estimating the parameters of globular cluster m 30 (ngc 7099) from  time-series photometry	we present the analysis of 26 nights of v and i time-series observations from2011 and 2012 of the globular cluster m 30 (ngc 7099). we used our data tosearch for variable stars in this cluster and refine the periods of knownvariables; we then used our variable star light curves to derive values for thecluster's parameters. we used difference image analysis to reduce our data toobtain high-precision light curves of variable stars. we then estimated thecluster parameters by performing a fourier decomposition of the light curves ofrr lyrae stars for which a good period estimate was possible. we also derive anestimate for the age of the cluster by fitting theoretical isochrones to ourcolour-magnitude diagram (cmd). out of 13 stars previously catalogued asvariables, we find that only 4 are bona fide variables. we detect two new rrlyrae variables, and confirm two additional rr lyrae candidates from theliterature. we also detect four other new variables, including an eclipsingblue straggler system, and an sx phoenicis star. this amounts to a total numberof confirmed variable stars in m 30 of 12. we perform fourier decomposition ofthe light curves of the rr lyrae stars to derive cluster parameters usingempirical relations. we find a cluster metallicity [fe/h]_zw=-2.01 +- 0.04, or[fe/h]_uves=-2.11 +- 0.06, and a distance of 8.32 +- 0.20 kpc (using rr0variables), 8.10 kpc (using one rr1 variable), and 8.35 +- 0.42 kpc (using oursx phoenicis star detection in m 30). fitting isochrones to the cmd, weestimate an age of 13.0 +- 1.0 gyr for m 30.

1305.5720	the gravitational universe	the last century has seen enormous progress in our understanding of theuniverse. we know the life cycles of stars, the structure of galaxies, theremnants of the big bang, and have a general understanding of how the universeevolved. we have come remarkably far using electromagnetic radiation as ourtool for observing the universe. however, gravity is the engine behind many ofthe processes in the universe, and much of its action is dark. opening agravitational window on the universe will let us go further than anyalternative. gravity has its own messenger: gravitational waves, ripples in thefabric of spacetime. they travel essentially undisturbed and let us peer deepinto the formation of the first seed black holes, exploring redshifts as largeas z ~ 20, prior to the epoch of cosmic re-ionisation. exquisite andunprecedented measurements of black hole masses and spins will make it possibleto trace the history of black holes across all stages of galaxy evolution, andat the same time constrain any deviation from the kerr metric of generalrelativity. elisa will be the first ever mission to study the entire universewith gravitational waves. elisa is an all-sky monitor and will offer a wideview of a dynamic cosmos using gravitational waves as new and unique messengersto unveil the gravitational universe. it provides the closest ever view of theearly processes at tev energies, has guaranteed sources in the form ofverification binaries in the milky way, and can probe the entire universe, fromits smallest scales around singularities and black holes, all the way tocosmological dimensions.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1403.4723	planck intermediate results. xviii the millimetre and sub-millimetre  emission from planetary nebulae	late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-lossevents whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (cse).planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on asample of galactic planetary nebulae (pne) in the important and relativelyunexplored observational band between 30 and 857ghz. planck enables theassembly of comprehensive pne spectral energy distributions (seds) from radio{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. modelling of the derived seds provides uswith information on physical properties of cses and the mass content of bothmain components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-ir emission. in particular,the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. such quantities havealso been estimated for the very young pn crl618, where the strong variabilityobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented theconstruction of its sed. a morphological study of the helix nebula has alsobeen performed. planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatialdistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify differentcomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope isinteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

1403.4978	asymmetries in core-collapse supernovae from maps of radioactive  $^{44}$ti in cassiopeiaa	asymmetry is required by most numerical simulations of stellar core-collapseexplosions, but the form it takes differs significantly among models. thespatial distribution of radioactive 44ti, synthesized in an exploding star nearthe boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and thatejected into the surrounding medium, directly probes the explosion asymmetries.cassiopeiaa is a young, nearby, core-collapse remnant from which 44ti emissionhas previously been detected but not imaged. asymmetries in the explosion havebeen indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44ti emission toestimated 56ni emission, from optical light echoes, and from jet-like featuresseen in the x-ray and optical ejecta. here we report spatial maps and spectralproperties of the 44ti in cassiopeia a. this may explain the unexpected lack ofcorrelation between the 44ti and iron x-ray emission, the latter being visibleonly in shock-heated material. the observed spatial distribution rules outsymmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well ashighly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor.instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development oflow-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

1406.7482	planck intermediate results. xxiv. constraints on variation of  fundamental constants	any variation of the fundamental physical constants, and more particularly ofthe fine structure constant, $\alpha$, or of the mass of the electron, $m_e$,would affect the recombination history of the universe and cause an imprint onthe cosmic microwave background angular power spectra. we show that the planckdata allow one to improve the constraint on the time variation of the finestructure constant at redshift $z\sim 10^3$ by about a factor of 5 compared towmap data, as well as to break the degeneracy with the hubble constant, $h_0$.in addition to $\alpha$, we can set a constraint on the variation of the massof the electron, $m_{\rm e}$, and on the simultaneous variation of the twoconstants. we examine in detail the degeneracies between fundamental constantsand the cosmological parameters, in order to compare the limits obtained fromplanck and wmap and to determine the constraining power gained by includingother cosmological probes. we conclude that independent time variations of thefine structure constant and of the mass of the electron are constrained byplanck to ${\delta\alpha}/{\alpha}= (3.6\pm 3.7)\times10^{-3}$ and ${\deltam_{\rm e}}/{m_{\rm e}}= (4 \pm 11)\times10^{-3}$ at the 68% confidence level.we also investigate the possibility of a spatial variation of the finestructure constant. the relative amplitude of a dipolar spatial variation of$\alpha$ (corresponding to a gradient across our hubble volume) is constrainedto be $\delta\alpha/\alpha=(-2.4\pm 3.7)\times 10^{-2}$.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1408.6526	the large observatory for x-ray timing	the large observatory for x-ray timing (loft) was studied within esa m3cosmic vision framework and participated in the final down-selection for alaunch slot in 2022-2024. thanks to the unprecedented combination of effectivearea and spectral resolution of its main instrument, loft will study thebehaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitationalfield in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes andneutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutronstars. the science payload is based on a large area detector (lad, 10 m 2effective area, 2-30 kev, 240 ev spectral resolution, 1 deg collimated field ofview) and a widefield monitor (wfm, 2-50 kev, 4 steradian field of view, 1arcmin source location accuracy, 300 ev spectral resolution). the wfm isequipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. grb) localization. thetrigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30s from discovery. in this paper we present the status of the mission at the endof its phase a study.

1410.8252	ogle-2011-blg-0265lb: a jovian microlensing planet orbiting an m dwarf	we report the discovery of a jupiter-mass planet orbiting an m-dwarf starthat gave rise to the microlensing event ogle-2011-blg-0265. such a system isvery rare among known planetary systems and thus the discovery is important fortheoretical studies of planetary formation and evolution. high-cadence temporalcoverage of the planetary signal combined with extended observations throughoutthe event allows us to accurately model the observed light curve. the finalmicrolensing solution remains, however, degenerate yielding two possibleconfigurations of the planet and the host star. in the case of the preferredsolution, the mass of the planet is $m_{\rm p} = 0.9\pm 0.3\ m_{\rm j}$, andthe planet is orbiting a star with a mass $m = 0.22\pm 0.06\ m_\odot$. thesecond possible configuration (2$\sigma$ away) consists of a planet with$m_{\rm p}=0.6\pm 0.3\ m_{\rm j}$ and host star with $m=0.14\pm 0.06\ m_\odot$.the system is located in the galactic disk 3 -- 4 kpc towards the galacticbulge. in both cases, with an orbit size of 1.5 -- 2.0 au, the planet is a"cold jupiter" -- located well beyond the "snow line" of the host star.currently available data make the secure selection of the correct solutiondifficult, but there are prospects for lifting the degeneracy with additionalfollow-up observations in the future, when the lens and source star separate.

1411.1573	a nustar observation of the center of the coma cluster	we present the results of a 55ks nustar observation of the core of the comacluster. the global spectrum can be explained by thermal gas emission, with aconservative 90% upper limit to non-thermal inverse compton (ic) emission of$5.1 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in a 12 arcmin $\times$ 12 arcminfield of view . the brightness of the thermal component in this central regiondoes not allow more stringent upper limits on the ic component when comparedwith non-imaging instruments with much larger fields of view where claims ofdetections have been made. future mosaic nustar observations of coma willfurther address this issue. the temperature map shows a relatively uniformtemperature distribution with a gradient from the hot northwest side to thecooler southeast, in agreement with previous measurements. the temperaturedetermination is robust given the flat effective area and low background in the3-20 kev band, making nustar an ideal instrument to measure high temperaturesin the intracluster medium.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1502.01582	planck 2015 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the european space agency's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the earlyuniverse and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14~may 2009 and scanned themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12~august 2009 and23~october 2013. in february~2015, esa and the planck collaboration releasedthe second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire planckmission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set ofscientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. thispaper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the dataproducts in the release, as well as the associated cosmological andastrophysical science results and papers. the science products include maps ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb), the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect,and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compactgalactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues ofsunyaev-zeldovich clusters and galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulationsof signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methodsand assessment of uncertainties. the likelihood code used to assesscosmological models against the planck data are described, as well as a cmblensing likelihood. scientific results include cosmological parameters derivingfrom cmb power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well asconstraints on inflation, non-gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, darkenergy, and modified gravity.

1502.01584	planck 2015 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions, and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). the structure of the paper is similar to that presented inthe 2013 planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalizationand the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on measurements performedduring observations of jupiter. by stacking data from seven jupiter transits,the main beam profiles are measured down to -25 db at 30 and 44 ghz, and downto -30 db at 70 ghz. it has been confirmed that the agreement between thesimulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequencyband (within the 20 db contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and70 ghz; 0.2% at 44 ghz). simulated polarized beams are used for the computationof the effective beam window functions. the error budget for the windowfunctions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, andaccounts for the radiometer band shapes. the total uncertainties in theeffective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively(at $\ell \approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 ghz (at $\ell \approx 1000$).

1502.01586	planck 2015 results. vii. hfi toi and beam processing	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) has observed the full sky at sixfrequencies (100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 ghz) in intensity and at fourfrequencies in linear polarization (100, 143, 217, and 353 ghz). in order toobtain sky maps, the time-ordered information (toi) containing the detector andpointing samples must be processed and the angular response must be assessed.the full mission toi is included in the planck 2015 release. this paperdescribes the hfi toi and beam processing for the 2015 release. hfi calibrationand map-making are described in a companion paper. the main pipeline has beenmodified since the last release (2013 nominal mission in intensity only), byincluding a correction for the non-linearity of the warm readout and byimproving the model of the bolometer time response. the beam processing is anessential tool that derives the angular response used in all the planck sciencepapers and we report an improvement in the effective beam window functionuncertainty of more than a factor 10 relative to the 2013 release. noisecorrelations introduced by pipeline filtering function are assessed usingdedicated simulations. angular cross-power spectra using datasets that aredecorrelated in time are immune to the main systematic effects.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1502.04699	rapid variability of blazar 3c 279 during flaring states in 2013-2014  with joint fermi-lat, nustar, swift, and ground-based multi-wavelength  observations	we report the results of a multi-band observing campaign on the famous blazar3c 279 conducted during a phase of increased activity from 2013 december to2014 april, including first observations of it with nustar. the $\gamma$-rayemission of the source measured by fermi-lat showed multiple distinct flaresreaching the highest flux level measured in this object since the beginning ofthe fermi mission, with $f(e &gt; 100\,{\rm mev})$ of $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, and with a flux doubling time scale as short as 2 hours. the$\gamma$-ray spectrum during one of the flares was very hard, with an index of$\gamma_\gamma = 1.7 \pm 0.1$, which is rarely seen in flat spectrum radioquasars. the lack of concurrent optical variability implies a very high comptondominance parameter $l_\gamma/l_{\rm syn} &gt; 300$. two 1-day nustar observationswith accompanying swift pointings were separated by 2 weeks, probing differentlevels of source activity. while the 0.5$-$70 kev x-ray spectrum obtainedduring the first pointing, and fitted jointly with swift-xrt is well-describedby a simple power law, the second joint observation showed an unusual spectralstructure: the spectrum softens by $\delta\gamma_{\rm x} \simeq 0.4$ at $\sim$4kev. modeling the broad-band sed during this flare with the standardsynchrotron plus inverse compton model requires: (1) the location of the$\gamma$-ray emitting region is comparable with the broad line region radius,(2) a very hard electron energy distribution index $p \simeq 1$, (3) total jetpower significantly exceeding the accretion disk luminosity $l_{\rm j}/l_{\rmd} \gtrsim 10$, and (4) extremely low jet magnetization with $l_{\rm b}/l_{\rmj} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. we also find that single-zone models that match theobserved $\gamma$-ray and optical spectra cannot satisfactorily explain theproduction of x-ray emission.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1504.03339	planck intermediate results. xxxvii. evidence of unbound gas from the  kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect	by looking at the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz) in planck nominalmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating inlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (cgs) at redshift $z\approx0.1$. we estimate the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations atthe positions of the cgc (central galaxy catalogue) samples extracted fromsloan digital sky survey (dr7) data. for the foreground-cleaned maps, we find$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the ksz signal, which are consistent with theksz evidence found in individual planck raw frequency maps, although lower thanfound in the wmap-9yr w band ($3.3\sigma$). we further reconstruct the peculiarvelocity field from the cg density field, and compute for the first time thecross-correlation function between ksz temperature fluctuations and estimatesof cg radial peculiar velocities. this correlation function yields a$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on mpcscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ mpc. both thepairwise momentum estimates and ksz temperature-velocity field correlation findevidence for ksz signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,corresponding to a physical radius of $&gt; 1$ mpc, more than twice the meanvirial radius of halos. this is consistent with the predictions from hydrosimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. we fit asimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation isproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon n-bodysimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective"optical depth to thomson scattering. we find $\tau_t=(1.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of thegas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to x-ray or thermalsz observations.

1505.08022	planck 2015 results. v. lfi calibration	we present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the planck lowfrequency instrument (lfi) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for theplanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. asin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronousmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use theorbital component, rather than adopting the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) solar dipole. this allows our 2015 lfi analysis to provide anindependent solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that ofhfi and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the wmap value. this 0.3% shiftin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from wmap and a global overhaul of theiterative calibration code increases the overall level of the lfi maps by 0.45%(30 ghz), 0.64% (44 ghz), and 0.82% (70 ghz) in temperature with respect to the2013 planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrummeasured by wmap. we estimate that the lfi calibration uncertainty is now atthe level of 0.20% for the 70 ghz map, 0.26% for the 44 ghz map, and 0.35% forthe 30 ghz map. we provide a detailed description of the impact of all thechanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.

1508.03375	planck 2013 results. xxxi. consistency of the planck data	the planck design and scanning strategy provide many levels of redundancythat can be exploited to provide tests of internal consistency. one of the mostimportant is the comparison of the 70ghz and 100ghz channels. based ondifferent instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focalplane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, andnear the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effecttwo different experiments. the 143ghz channel has the lowest noise level onplanck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. in thispaper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 planck data. weconcentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143ghz channel maps and powerspectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acousticpeaks, on maps masked for diffuse galactic emission and for strong unresolvedsources. difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin areconsistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave backgroundstructure. including small but important corrections for unresolved-sourceresiduals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100ghz power spectraaveraged over 70&lt;l&lt;390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100ghzpower spectra of 0.4% over the same l range. these values are within andconsistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the planck2013 results. we also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysisshowing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100/143/217ghz power spectra. weanalyse calibration procedures and beams to determine what fraction of thesedifferences can be accounted for by known approximations or systematic errorsthat could be controlled even better in the future, reducing uncertaintiesstill further. several possible small improvements are described...(abridged)

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

1511.04183	the nustar extragalactic surveys: the number counts of active galactic  nuclei and the resolved fraction of the cosmic x-ray background	we present the 3-8 kev and 8-24 kev number counts of active galactic nuclei(agn) identified in the nustar extragalactic surveys. nustar has now resolvedapproximately 35% of the x-ray background in the 8-24 kev band, directlyidentifying agn with obscuring columns up to 1e25 / cm2. in the softer 3-8 kevband the number counts are in general agreement with those measured byxmm-newton and chandra over the flux range 5e-15 &lt; s(3 - 8 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt;1e-12 probed by nustar. in the hard 8-24 kev band nustar probes fluxes over therange 2e-14 &lt; s(8-24 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt; 1e-12, a factor of approximately 100fainter than previous measurements covering this energy range. the slope of the8-24 kev number counts closely matches predictions from agn populationsynthesis models that account for the shape and intensity of the diffuse cosmicx-ray background. this directly confirms the existence of a population ofobscured and/or hard x-ray sources inferred from the shape of the integrateddiffuse cosmic x-ray background. the measured nustar counts lie significantlyabove simple extrapolations of the swift/bat 15-55 kev number counts measuredat higher fluxes, s(15-55 kev) &gt; 1e-11 erg/cm2/s, for any realistic agnspectral model. the most natural explanation for the difference is an evolutionin the agn poulation between the very local objects seen by bat and the moredistant (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1) nustar sample that is not accounted for in the currentmodels.

1511.05156	planck intermediate results. xl. the sunyaev-zeldovich signal from the  virgo cluster	the virgo cluster is the largest sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) source in the sky,both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. planck's wide angularscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow adetailed study of this large object through the sz effect. virgo is wellresolved by planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well withthe morphology observed from x-rays, but extends beyond the observed x-raysignal. we find a good agreement between the sz signal (or compton paranmeter,y_c) observed by planck and the expected signal inferred from x-rayobservations and simple analytical models. due to its proximity to us, the gasbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity byintegrating the sz signal over tens of square degrees. we study the signal inthe outskirts of virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrainedsimulation of the environment of virgo. planck data suggest that significantamounts of low-density plasma surround virgo out to twice the virial radius. wefind the sz signal in the outskirts of virgo to be consistent with a simplemodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assumingthat the temperature stays in the kev range beyond the virial radius. theobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallowpressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. this reservoir of gas atlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hotintergalactic medium. taking the lack of symmetry of virgo into account, wefind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of sz and x-ray data,in agreement with predictions.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

astro-ph;0308037	chandra observations of the ngc 1550 galaxy group -- implication for the  temperature and entropy profiles of 1 kev galaxy groups	we present a detailed \chandra study of the galaxy group ngc 1550. for itstemperature (1.37$\pm$0.01 kev) and velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 300 kms$^{-1}$), the ngc 1550 group is one of the most luminous known galaxy groups(l$_{\rm bol}$ = 1.65$\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ within 200 kpc, or 0.2 \rv).we find that within $\sim 60$ kpc, where the gas cooling time is less than ahubble time, the gas temperature decreases continuously toward the center,implying the existence of a cooling core. the temperature also declines beyond$\sim$ 100 kpc (or 0.1 \rv). there is a remarkable similarity of thetemperature profile of ngc 1550 with those of two other 1 kev groups withaccurate temperature determination. the temperature begins to decline at 0.07 -0.1 \rv, while in hot clusters the decline begins at or beyond 0.2 \rv. thus,there are at least some 1 kev groups that have significantly differenttemperature profiles from those of hot clusters, which may reflect the role ofnon-gravitational processes in icm/igm evolution. ngc 1550 has no isentropiccore in its entropy profile, in contrast to the predictions of `entropy-floor'simulations. we compare the scaled entropy profiles of three 1 kev groups(including ngc 1550) and three 2 - 3 kev groups. the scaled entropy profiles of1 kev groups show much larger scatter than those of hotter systems, whichimplies varied pre-heating levels. we also discuss the mass content of the ngc1550 group and the abundance profile of heavy elements.

astro-ph;0405511	eso 3060170 -- a massive fossil galaxy group with a heated gas core?	we present a detailed study of the eso 3060170 galaxy group combiningchandra, xmm and optical observations. the system is found to be a fossilgalaxy group. the group x-ray emission is composed of a central dense cool core(10 kpc in radius) and an isothermal medium beyond the central 10 kpc. theregion between 10 and 50 kpc (the cooling radius) has the same temperature asthe gas from 50 kpc to 400 kpc although the gas cooling time between 10 and 50kpc (2 - 6 gyr) is shorter than the hubble time. thus, the eso 3060170 groupdoes not have a group-sized cooling core. we suggest that the group coolingcore may have been heated by a central agn outburst in the past and the smalldense cool core is the truncated relic of a previous cooling core. the chandraobservations also reveal a variety of x-ray features in the central region,including a ``finger'', an edge-like feature and a small ``tail'', all alignedalong a north-south axis, as are the galaxy light and group galaxydistribution. the proposed agn outburst may cause gas ``sloshing'' around thecenter and produce these asymmetric features. the observed flat temperatureprofile to 1/3 r_vir is not consistent with the predicted temperature profilein recent numerical simulations. we compare the entropy profile of the eso3060170 group with those of three other groups and find a flatter relation thanthat predicted by simulations involving only shock heating, s $\propto$ r$^{~0.85}$. this is direct evidence for the importance of non-gravitationalprocesses in group centers. we derive the mass profiles within 1/3 r_vir andfind the eso 3060170 group is the most massive fossil group known (1 - 2 x10$^{14}$ m$_{\odot}$). the m/l ratio of the system, ~ 150 at 0.3 r_vir, isnormal.

astro-ph;0610739	the 400 square degrees rosat pspc galaxy cluster survey: catalog and  statistical calibration	we present a catalog of galaxy clusters detected in a new rosat pspc survey.the survey is optimized to sample, at high redshifts, the mass rangecorresponding to t&gt; kev clusters at z=0. technically, our survey is theextension of the 160 square degrees survey (vikhlinin etal 98a, mullis etal2003). we use the same detection algorithm, thus preserving high quality of theresulting sample; the main difference is a significant increase in skycoverage. the new survey covers 397 square degrees and is based on 1610 highgalactic latitude rosat pspc pointings, virtually all pointed rosat datasuitable for the detection of distant clusters. the search volume for x-rayluminous clusters within z&lt;1 exceeds that of the entire local universe (z&lt;0.1).we detected 287 extended x-ray sources with fluxes f&gt;1.4e-13 erg/s/cm^2 in the0.5-2 kev energy band, of which 266 (93%) are optically confirmed as galaxyclusters, groups or individual elliptical galaxies. this paper provides adescription of the input data, the statistical calibration of the survey viamonte-carlo simulations, and the catalog of detected clusters. we also comparethe basic results to those from previous, smaller area surveys and find goodagreement for the log n - log s distribution and the local x-ray luminosityfunction. our sample clearly shows a decrease in the number density for themost luminous clusters at z&gt;0.3. the comparison of our rosat-derived fluxeswith the accurate chandra measurements for a subset of high-redshift clustersdemonstrates the validity of the 400 square degree survey's statisticalcalibration.

astro-ph;9803099	a catalog of 200 galaxy clusters serendipitously detected in the rosat  pspc pointed observations	we present a catalog of 200 clusters of galaxies serendipitously detected in647 rosat pspc pointings covering 158 square degrees. this is one of thelargest x-ray selected cluster samples, comparable in size only to the rosatall-sky survey sample of nearby clusters (ebeling et al. 1997). we detectclusters in the inner 17.5 arcmin of the rosat pspc field of view using thespatial extent of their x-ray emission. cluster x-ray luminosities range from10^42 erg/s to ~5x10^44 erg/s, i.e. from poor groups to rich clusters. thecluster redshifts range from z=0.015 to z&gt;0.5. the catalog lists x-ray fluxes,core-radii, spectroscopic redshifts for 73 clusters and photometric redshiftsfor the remainder. we have optically confirmed 200 of 223 x-ray sources asclusters of galaxies. of the remaining 23 sources, 18 are likely falsedetections arising from blends of unresolved point x-ray sources, and for 5 wehave not obtained deep ccd images. above a flux of 2e-13 erg/s/cm**2, 98\% ofextended x-ray sources are optically confirmed clusters. the log n-log srelation derived from our catalog shows excellent agreement with previousresults: emss and rosat all-sky survey bcs in teh bright end and warps atintermediate fluxes. our cluster counts appear to be systematically higher thanthose from a 50 deg^2 survey of rosati et al. (1998). in particular, at a fluxof 2e-13 erg/s/cm**2, we find a surface density of clusters of 0.57+/-0.07 persquare degree, which is a factor of 1.3 more than found by rosati et al. thisdifference is marginally significant at the ~2 sigma level. the large area ofour survey makes it possible to study the evolution of the x-ray luminosityfunction in the high luminosity range inaccessible with other, smaller arearosat surveys.

astro-ph;9803101	evolution of cluster x-ray luminosities and radii: results from the 160  square degree rosat survey	we searched for cluster x-ray luminosity and radius evolution using oursample of 200 galaxy clusters detected in the 160 deg^2 survey with the rosatpspc (vikhlinin et al. 1998, astro-ph/9803099). with such a large area survey,it is possible, for the first time with rosat, to test the evolution ofluminous clusters, lx &gt; 3x10^44 erg/s, in the 0.5-2 kev band. we detect afactor of 3-4 deficit of such luminous clusters at z&gt;0.3 compared to thepresent. the evolution is much weaker or absent at modestly lower luminosities,1-3x10^44 erg/s. at still lower luminosities, we find no evolution from theanalysis of the log n - log s relation. the results in the two upper lx binsare in agreement with the einstein emss evolution result (gioia et al. 1990a,henry et al. 1992) while being obtained using a completely independent clustersample. the low-lx results are in agreement with other rosat surveys (e.g.rosati et al. 1998, jones et al. 1998).  we also compare the distribution of core radii of nearby and distant (z&gt;0.4)luminous (with equivalent temperatures 4-7 kev) clusters, and detect noevolution. the ratio of average core radius for z~0.5 and z&lt;0.1 clusters is0.9+/-0.1, and the core radius distributions are remarkably similar. a decreaseof cluster sizes incompatible with our data is predicted by self-similarevolution models for high-omega universe.

astro-ph;9903052	x-ray over-luminous elliptical galaxies: a new class of mass  concentrations in the universe?	we detect four isolated, x-ray over-luminous (lx&gt;2e43 [h/0.5]**-2 erg/s)elliptical galaxies (olegs) in our 160 square degree rosat pspc survey. theextent of their x-ray emission, total x-ray luminosity, total mass, and mass ofthe hot gas in these systems correspond to poor clusters, and the opticalluminosity of the central galaxies (m_r&lt;-22.5 + 5 lg h) is comparable to thatof cluster cds. however, there are no detectable fainter galaxy concentrationsaround the central elliptical. the mass-to-light ratio within the radius ofdetectable x-ray emission is in the range 250-450 msun/lsun, which is 2-3 timeshigher than typically found in clusters or groups. these objects can be theresult of galaxy merging within a group. however, their high m/l values aredifficult to explain in this scenario. olegs must have been undisturbed for avery long time, which makes them the ultimate examples of systmes inhydrostatic equilibrium. the number density of olegs is n=2.4(+3.1-1.2}x10**-7(h/0.5)**-3 mpc**-3 at the 90% confidence. they comprise 20% of all clustersand groups of comparable x-ray luminosity, and nearly all galaxies brighterthan m_r=-22.5. the estimated contirubution of olegs to the total mass densityin the universe is close to that of t&gt;7 kev clusters.

0812.2720	chandra cluster cosmology project iii: cosmological parameter  constraints	chandra observations of large samples of galaxy clusters detected in x-raysby rosat provide a new, robust determination of the cluster mass functions atlow and high redshifts. statistical and systematic errors are now sufficientlysmall, and the redshift leverage sufficiently large for the mass functionevolution to be used as a useful growth of structure based dark energy probe.in this paper, we present cosmological parameter constraints obtained fromchandra observations of 36 clusters with &lt;z&gt;=0.55 derived from 400deg^2 rosatserendipitous survey and 49 brightest z=~0.05 clusters detected in the all-skysurvey. evolution of the mass function between these redshifts requiresomega_lambda&gt;0 with a ~5sigma significance, and constrains the dark energyequation of state parameter to w0=-1.14+-0.21, assuming constant w and flatuniverse. cluster information also significantly improves constraints whencombined with other methods. fitting our cluster data jointly with the latestsupernovae, wmap, and baryonic acoustic oscillations measurements, we obtainw0=-0.991+-0.045 (stat) +-0.039 (sys), a factor of 1.5 reduction in statisticaluncertainties, and nearly a factor of 2 improvement in systematics compared toconstraints that can be obtained without clusters. the joint analysis of thesefour datasets puts a conservative upper limit on the masses of light neutrinos,sum m_nu&lt;0.33 ev at 95% cl. we also present updated measurements of omega_m*hand sigma_8 from the low-redshift cluster mass function.
