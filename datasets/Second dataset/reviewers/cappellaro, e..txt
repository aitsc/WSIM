0903.1286	sn 2008s: an electron capture sn from a super-agb progenitor?	we present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of thefaint transient sn 2008s discovered in ngc 6946. sn 2008s exhibited slowphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first ninemonths, implying a high density cs medium. the light curve is similar in shapeto that of sn 1998s and sn 1979c, although significantly fainter at maximumlight. our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tailphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}co. we propose that this isevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 m_sun).the large mir flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a lightecho from pre-exisiting dust. the late nir flux excess is plausibly due to acombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust inthe cs environment. we reassess the progenitor object detected previously inspitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the mirspectral energy distribution. this supports the idea of a dusty, opticallythick shell around sn 2008s with an inner radius of nearly 90au and outerradius of 450au, and an inferred heating source of 3000 k and luminosity of l ~10^{4.6} l_sun. the combination of our monitoring data and the evidence fromthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electroncapture supernova explosion in a super-agb progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8m_sun) embedded within a thick cs gaseous envelope. we suggest that all of mainproperties of the electron capture sn phenomenon are observed in sn 2008s andfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0908.0942	vlt spectropolarimetry of the optical transient in ngc300. evidence for  asymmetry in the circumstellar dust	aims: the main goal of this work is to study possible signs of asymmetry inthe bright optical transient in ngc300, with the aim of getting independentinformation on the explosion mechanism, the progenitor star and itscircumstellar environment.  methods: using vlt-fors1 we have obtained low-resolution optical linearspectropolarimetry of ngc300 ot2008-1 on two epochs, 48 and 55 days after thediscovery, covering the spectral range 3600--9330a.  results: the data show a continuum polarization at a very significant level.at least two separate components are identified. the first is characterized bya strong wavelength dependency and a constant position angle (68.6+/-0.3degrees), which is parallel to the local spiral arm of the host galaxy. thesecond shows a completely different position angle (151.3+/-0.4) and displays amild but statistically significant evolution between the two epochs. while theformer is identified as arising in the interstellar dust associated withngc300, the latter is most likely due to continuum polarization by dustscattering in the circumstellar environment. no line depolarization is detectedin correspondence of the most intense emission lines, disfavoring electronscattering as the source of intrinsic polarization. this implies a very smalldeviation from symmetry in the continuum-forming region. given the observedlevel of intrinsic polarization, the transient must be surrounded by asignificant amount of dust (&gt;4x10^-5 msun), asymmetrically distributed within afew thousand au. this most likely implies that one or more asymmetric outflowepisodes took place during the past history of the progenitor.

0708.3698	upper limit for circumstellar gas around the type ia sn 2000cx	the nature of the companion stars in type ia supernova (sne) progenitorsystems remains unclear. one possible way to discriminate between differentscenarios is the presence (or absence) of circumstellar material, the leftovers from the progenitor evolution that may be revealed by their interactionwith the sn. a new method to probe the circumstellar environment has beenexploited for the normal type ia sn 2006x, leading for the first time to thedirect detection of material which escaped the progenitor system. in this paperwe apply the same analysis to the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx, with the aim ofconstraining the properties of its progenitor system. using multi-epoch,high-resolution spectroscopy we have studied the spectral region where narrow,time-variable naid absorption features are expected in case circumstellarmaterial is present along the line of sight. no naid absorption is detected inthe rest-frame of the host galaxy to a level of a few ma, setting a stringentupper limit to the column density of the absorbing material (n(nai)&lt;=2 x 10^10cm-2). in this respect the peculiar type ia sn 2000cx is different from thenormal ia sn 2006x. whether this is to be attributed to a different progenitorsystem, to viewing-angle effects or to a low metallicity remains to beclarified.

1210.1411	moderately luminous type ii supernovae	core-collapse supernovae (cc-sne) descend from progenitors more massive thanabout 8 msun. because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta mayeventually interact with the circumstellar medium (csm) via highly energeticprocesses detectable in the radio, x-ray, ultraviolet (uv) and, sometimes, inthe optical domains. in this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and nearinfrared observations of five type ii sne, namely sne 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,1995ad, and 1996w. together with few other sne they form a group of moderatelyluminous type ii events. we collected photometry and spectroscopy with severaltelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectralevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. both photometry andspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. the lightcurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95&lt;m_{b}&lt;-18.70$). the ejectedmasses of ^56\ni for three sne span a wide range of values($2.8\times10^{-2}$msun$&lt;$m(\ni)$&lt;1.4\times10^{-1}$msun), while for a fourth(sn2010aj) we could determine a stringent upper limit ($7\times10^{-3}$msun).clues of interaction, such as the presence of high velocity (hv) features ofthe balmer lines, are visible in the photospheric spectra of sne 2009dd and1996w. for sn2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type iin to astandard type ii sn. modelling the observations of sne 2009dd, 2010aj and1995ad with radiation hydrodynamics codes, we infer kinetic plus thermalenergies of about 0.2-0.5 foe, initial radii of 2-5$\times10^{13}$ cm andejected masses of $\sim$5.0-9.5 msun. these values suggest moderate-mass,super-asymptotic giant branch (sagb) or red super-giants (rsg) stars as snprecursors, in analogy with other luminous type iip sne 2007od and 2009bw.

1303.3803	hawk-i infrared supernova search in starburst galaxies	the use of sn rates to probe explosion scenarios and to trace the cosmic starformation history received a boost from a number of synoptic surveys. there hasbeen a recent claim of a mismatch by a factor of two between star formation andcore collapse sn rates, and different explanations have been proposed for thisdiscrepancy.} we attempted an independent test of the relation between starformation and supernova rates in the extreme environment of starburst galaxies,where both star formation and extinction are extremely high. to this aim weconducted an infrared supernova search in a sample of local starburts galaxies.the rational to search in the infrared is to reduce the bias due to extinction,which is one of the putative reasons for the observed discrepancy between starformation and supernova rates. to evaluate the outcome of the search wedeveloped a montecarlo simulation tool that is used to predict the number andproperties of the expected supernovae based on the search characteristics andthe current understanding of starburst galaxies and supernovae. during thesearch we discovered 6 supernovae (4 with spectroscopic classification) whichis in excellent agreement with the prediction of the montecarlo simulation toolthat is, on average, $5.3\pm2.3$ events. the number of supernovae detected instarburst galaxies is consistent with that predicted from their high starformation rate when we recognize that a major fraction ($\sim 60%$) of theevents remains hidden in the unaccessible, high density nuclear regions becauseof a combination of reduced search efficiency and high extinction.

1305.1851	optical and near-infrared observations of sn 2011dh - the first 100 days	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry and spectroscopy of thetype iib supernova (sn) 2011dh for the first 100 days. we complement ourextensive dataset with swift ultra-violet (uv) and spitzer mid-infrared (mir)data to build a uv to mir bolometric lightcurve using both photometric andspectroscopic data. hydrodynamical modelling of the sn based on this bolometriclightcurve have been presented in bersten (2012). we find that the absorptionminimum for the hydrogen lines is never seen below ~11000 km/s but approachesthis value as the lines get weaker. this suggests that the interface betweenthe helium core and hydrogen rich envelope is located near this velocity inagreement with the bersten et al. (2012) he4r270 ejecta model. spectralmodelling of the hydrogen lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusionand we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar masses to be consistent with theobserved spectral evolution. we estimate that the photosphere reaches thehelium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15days, close to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40days. this suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasingoptical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.we also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the sn sitewhich shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellowsupergiant coincident with sn 2011dh. the b, v and r band decline rates of0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with theremaining flux being emitted by the sn. hence we find that the star was indeedthe progenitor of sn 2011dh as previously suggested by maund et al. (2011) andwhich is also consistent with the results from the hydrodynamical modelling.

1305.5789	comparison of progenitor mass estimates for the type iip sn 2012a	we present the one-year long observing campaign of sn 2012a which exploded inthe nearby (9.8 mpc) irregular galaxy ngc 3239. the photometric evolution isthat of a normal type iip supernova. the absolute maximum magnitude, with mb =-16.23 +- 0.16 mag. sn2012a reached a peak luminosity of about 2x10**42 erg/s,which is brighter than those of other sne with a similar 56ni mass. the latterwas estimated from the luminosity in the exponential tail of the light curveand found to be m(56ni) = 0.011 +-0.004 msun. the spectral evolution of sn2012a is also typical of sn iip, from the early spectra dominated by a bluecontinuum and very broad (~10**4 km/s) balmer lines, to the late-photosphericspectra characterized by prominent p-cygni features of metal lines (fe ii, scii, ba ii, ti ii, ca ii, na id). the photospheric velocity is moderately low,~3x10**3 km/s at 50 days, for the low optical depth metal lines. the nebularspectrum obtained 394 days after the shock breakout shows the typical featuresof sne iip and the strength of the [o i] doublet suggests a progenitor ofintermediate mass, similar to sn 2004et (~15 msun). a candidate progenitor forsn 2012a has been identified in deep, pre-explosion k'-band gemini north (niri)images, and found to be consistent with a star with a bolometric magnitude-7.08+-0.36 (log l/lsun = 4.73 +- 0.14$ dex). the magnitude of the recoveredprogenitor in archival images points toward a moderate-mass 10.5 (-2/+4.5) msunstar as the precursor of sn 2012a. the explosion parameters and progenitor masswere also estimated by means of a hydrodynamical model, fitting the bolometriclight curve, the velocity and the temperature evolution. we found a best fitfor a kinetic energy of 0.48 foe, an initial radius of 1.8x10**13 cm and ejectamass of 12.5 msun.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1401.2368	sn2011hs: a fast and faint type iib supernova from a supergiant  progenitor	observations spanning a large wavelength range, from x-ray to radio, of thetype iib supernova 2011hs are presented, covering its evolution during thefirst year after explosion. the optical light curve presents a narrower shapeand a fainter luminosity at peak than previously observed for type iib sne.high expansion velocities are measured from the broad absorption h i and he ilines. from the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the time evolutionof the photospheric velocities with hydrodynamical models, we found that sn2011hs is consistent with the explosion of a 3-4 msun he-core progenitor star,corresponding to a main sequence mass of 12-15 msun, that ejected a mass of56ni of about 0.04 msun, with an energy of e= 8.5 x 10^50 erg. such a low-massprogenitor scenario is in full agreement with the modelling of the nebularspectrum taken at $\sim$215 days from maximum. from the modelling of theadiabatic cooling phase, we infer a progenitor radius of $\approx$500-600 rsun,clearly pointing to an extended progenitor star. the radio light curve of sn2011hs yields a peak luminosity similar to that of sn 1993j, but with a highermass loss rate and a wind density possibly more similar to that of sn 2001ig.although no significant deviations from a smooth decline have been found in theradio light curves, we cannot rule out the presence of a binary companion star.

1401.5426	underluminous type ii plateau supernovae: ii. pointing towards moderate  mass precursors	we present new data for five under-luminous type ii-plateau supernovae (sneiip), namely sn 1999gn, sn 2002gd, sn 2003z, sn 2004eg and sn 2006ov. this newsample of low-luminosity sne iip (ll sne iip) is analyzed together with similarobjects studied in the past. all of them show a flat light curve plateaulasting about 100 days, an under luminous late-time exponential tail, intrinsiccolours that are unusually red, and spectra showing prominent and narrowp-cygni lines. a velocity of the ejected material below 10^3 km/s is inferredfrom measurements at the end of the plateau. the 56ni masses ejected in theexplosion are very small (less than 10^-2 solar masses). we investigate thecorrelations among 56ni mass, expansion velocity of the ejecta and absolutemagnitude in the middle of the plateau, confirming the main findings of hamuy(2003), according to which events showing brighter plateau and larger expansionvelocities are expected to produce more 56ni. we propose that these faintobjects represent the low luminosity tail of a continuous distribution inparameters space of sne iip. the physical properties of the progenitors at theexplosion are estimated through the hydrodynamical modeling of the observablesfor two representative events of this class, namely sn 2005cs and sn 2008in. wefind that the majority of ll sne iip, and quite possibly all, originate in thecore-collapse of intermediate mass stars, in the mass range 10-15 solar masses.

0805.1089	optical and ir observations of sn 2002dj: some possible common  properties of fast expanding sne ia	as part of the european supernova collaboration we obtained extensivephotometry and spectroscopy of the type ia sn 2002dj covering epochs from 11days before to nearly two years after maximum. detailed optical andnear-infrared observations show that this object belongs to the class of thehigh-velocity gradient events as indicated by si, s and ca lines. the lightcurve shape and velocity evolution of sn 2002dj appear to be nearly identicalto sn 2002bo. the only significant difference is observed in the optical tonear-ir colours and a reduced spectral emission beyond 6500 a. forhigh-velocity gradient type ia supernovae, we tentatively identify a fasterrise to maximum, a more pronounced inflection in the v and r light curves aftermaximum and a brighter, slower declining late-time b light curve as commonphotometric properties of this class of objects. they also seem to becharacterized by a different colour and colour evolution with respect to``normal'' sne ia. the usual light curve shape parameters do not distinguishthese events. stronger, more blueshifted absorption features ofintermediate-mass elements and lower temperatures are the most prominentspectroscopic features of type ia supernovae displaying high velocitygradients. it appears that these events burn more intermediate-mass elements inthe outer layers. possible connections to the metallicity of the progenitorstar are explored.

1505.02668	sudare-voice variability-selection of active galaxies in the chandra  deep field south and the servs/swire region	one of the most peculiar characteristics of active galactic nuclei (agn) istheir variability over all wavelengths. this property has been used in the pastto select agn samples and is foreseen to be one of the detection techniquesapplied in future multi-epoch surveys, complementing photometric andspectroscopic methods.  in this paper, we aim to construct and characterise an agn sample using amulti-epoch dataset in the r band from the sudare-voice survey.  our work makes use of the vst monitoring program of an area surrounding thechandra deep field south to select variable sources. we use data spanning a sixmonth period over an area of 2 square degrees, to identify agn based on theirphotometric variability.  the selected sample includes 175 agn candidates with magnitude r &lt; 23 mag. wedistinguish different classes of variable sources through their lightcurves, aswell as x-ray, spectroscopic, sed, optical and ir information overlapping withour survey.  we find that 12% of the sample (21/175) is represented by sn. of theremaining sources, 4% (6/154) are stars, while 66% (102/154) are likely agnsbased on the available diagnostics. we estimate an upper limit to thecontamination of the variability selected agn sample of about 34%, but we pointout that restricting the analysis to the sources with availablemulti-wavelength ancillary information, the purity of our sample is close to80% (102 agn out of 128 non-sn sources with multi-wavelength diagnostics). ourwork thus confirms the efficiency of the variability selection method inagreement with our previous work on the cosmos field; in addition we show thatthe variability approach is roughly consistent with the infrared selection.

0805.2948	variability-selected active galactic nuclei from supernova search in the  chandra deep field south	variability is a property shared by virtually all active galactic nuclei(agns), and was adopted as a criterion for their selection using data frommulti epoch surveys. low luminosity agns (llagns) are contaminated by the lightof their host galaxies, and cannot therefore be detected by the usual colourtechniques. for this reason, their evolution in cosmic time is poorly known.consistency with the evolution derived from x-ray detected samples has not beenclearly established so far, also because the low luminosity population consistsof a mixture of different object types. llagns can be detected by the nuclearoptical variability of extended objects. several variability surveys have been,or are being, conducted for the detection of supernovae (sne). we propose tore-analyse these sne data using a variability criterion optimised for agndetection, to select a new agn sample and study its properties. we analysedimages acquired with the wide field imager at the 2.2 m eso/mpi telescope, inthe framework of the stress supernova survey. we selected the axaf fieldcentred on the chandra deep field south where, besides the deep x-ray survey,various optical data exist, originating in the eis and combo-17 photometricsurveys and the spectroscopic database of goods. we obtained a catalogue of 132variable agn candidates. several of the candidates are x-ray sources. wecompare our results with an hst variability study of x-ray and ir detectedagns, finding consistent results. the relatively high fraction of confirmedagns in our sample (60%) allowed us to extract a list of reliable agncandidates for spectroscopic follow-up observations.

1509.04496	supernova rates from the sudare vst-omegacam search. i	we describe the observing strategy, data reduction tools and early results ofa supernova (sn) search project, named sudare, conducted with the eso vsttelescope aimed at measuring the rate of the different types of sne in theredshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. the search was performed in two of the best-studiedextragalactic fields, cdfs and cosmos, for which a wealth of ancillary data areavailable in the literature or public archives.  (abridged)  we obtained a final sample of 117 sne, most of which are snia (57%) and theremaining core collapse events of which 44% type ii, 22% type iin and 34% typeib/c. in order to link the transients, we built a catalog of ~1.3x10^5 galaxiesin the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 with a limiting magnitude k_ab=23.5 mag. wemeasured the sn rate per unit volume for sn ia and core collapse sne indifferent bin of redshifts. the values are consistent with other measurementsfrom the literature. the dispersion of the rate measurements for sne ia iscomparable with the scatter of the theoretical tracks for single (sd) anddouble degenerate (dd) binary systems models, therefore the data do not allowto disentangle among the two different progenitor scenarios. however, we maynotice that among the three tested models, sd and two flavours of dd, eitherwith a steep (ddc) or a wide (ddw) delay time distribution, the sd gives abetter fit across the whole redshift range whereas the ddc better matches thesteep rise up to redshift ~1.2. the ddw appears instead less favoured. the corecollapse sn rate is fully consistent, unlike recent claims, with the predictionbased on recent estimates of the star formation history, and standardprogenitor mass range.

1509.09062	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium - vii. the  metamorphosis of asassn-15ed from a narrow line type ibn to a normal type ib  supernova	we present the results of the spectroscopic and photometric monitoringcampaign of asassn-15ed. the transient was discovered quite young by the allsky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn). amateur astronomers allowed usto sample the photometric sn evolution around maximum light, which we estimateto have occurred on jd = 2457087.4 +- 0.6 in the r-band. its apparent r-bandmagnitude at maximum was r = 16.91 +- 0.10, providing an absolute magnitudem(r) ~ -20.04 +- 0.20, which is slightly more luminous than the typicalmagnitudes estimated for type ibn sne. the post-peak evolution was wellmonitored, and the decline rate (being in most bands around 0.1 mag/d duringthe first 25 d after maximum) is marginally slower than the average declinerates of sne ibn during the same time interval. the object was initiallyclassified as a type ibn sn because early-time spectra were characterized by ablue continuum with superimposed narrow p-cygni lines of he i, suggesting thepresence of a slowly moving (1200-1500 km/s), he-rich circumstellar medium.later on, broad p-cygni he i lines became prominent. the inferred velocities,as measured from the minimum of the broad absorption components, were between6000 and 7000 km/s. as we attribute these broad features to the sn ejecta, thisis the first time we have observed the transition of a type ibn sn to a type ibsn.

astro-ph;0309264	low luminosity type ii supernovae: spectroscopic and photometric  evolution	in this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric observations for fourcore collapse supernovae (sne), namely sne 1994n, 1999br, 1999eu and 2001dc.together with sn 1997d, we show that they form a group of exceptionallylow-luminosity events. these sne have narrow spectral lines (indicating lowexpansion velocities) and low luminosities at every phase (significantly lowerthan those of typical core-collapse supernovae). the very low luminosity duringthe ^{56}co radioactive decay tail indicates that the mass of ^{56}ni ejectedduring the explosion is much smaller (m(ni) ~ 2-8 x 10^{-3} mo) than theaverage (m(ni) ~ 6-10 x 10^{-2} mo). two supernovae of this group (sn 1999brand sn 2001dc) were discovered very close to the explosion epoch, allowing usto determine the lengths of their plateaux (~ 100 days) as well asestablishiing the explosion epochs of the other, less-completely observed sne.it is likely that this group of sne represent the extreme low-luminosity tailof a single continuous distribution of sn ii-p events. their kinetic energy isalso exceptionally low. although an origin from low mass progenitors has alsobeen proposed for low-luminosity core-collapse sne, recent work providesevidence in favour of the high mass progenitor scenario. the incidence of theselow--luminosity sne could be as high as 4-5$ $ of all type ii sne.

astro-ph;9806382	a `hypernova' model for sn 1998bw associated with gamma-ray burst of 25  april 1998	the discovery of the peculiar supernova (sn) 1998bw and its possibleassociation with the gamma-ray burst (grb) 980425$^{1,2,3}$ provide new cluesto the understanding of the explosion mechanism of very massive stars and tothe origin of some classes of gamma-ray bursts. its spectra indicate thatsn~1998bw is a type ic supernova$^{3,4}$, but its peak luminosity is unusuallyhigh compared with typical type ic supernovae$^3$. here we report our findingsthat the optical spectra and the light curve of sn 1998bw can be wellreproduced by an extremely energetic explosion of a massive carbon+oxygen (c+o)star. the kinetic energy is as large as $\sim 2-5 \times 10^{52}$ ergs, morethan ten times the previously known energy of supernovae. for this reason, theexplosion may be called a `hypernova'. such a c+o star is the stripped core ofa very massive star that has lost its h and he envelopes. the extremely largeenergy, suggesting the existence of a new mechanism of massive star explosion,can cause a relativistic shock that may be linked to the gamma-ray burst.

astro-ph;9808013	a new faint type ia supernova: sn 1997cn in ngc 5490	observations of the recent sn 1991bg in the elliptical galaxy ngc 5490 showthat this objects closely resembles, both photometrically andspectroscopically, the faint snia 1991bg.  the two objects have similar light curves, which do not show secondary maximain the near ir as normal type ia supernovae. the host galaxy, ngc5490, lies inthe hubble flow. adopting for sn1997cn a reddening e(b-v)=0, the absolutemagnitude is faint: mv = -17.98 using ho=65 and mv = -17.40 using ho=85 km/(smpc). the latter value is in close agreement with the absolute magnitude of sn1991bg on the sbf--pnlf--tf distance scale. the photospheric spectra of the twosne show the same peculiarities, the deep tiii trough between 4000 and 4500a,the strong caii ir triplet, the narrow absorption at about 5700a and the slowexpansion velocity. in analogy to sn 1991bg the observed spectrum of sn1997cnhas been successfully modeled by scaling down the w7 model by a factor of 2,assuming a rise time to b maximum of 18 days, a photospheric velocity and aneffective temperature low compared to normal snia. the influence of thedistance scale adopted on the input parameters of the best fit model is alsodiscussed.  these data demonstrate that peculiar snia like sn 1991bg are notonce--in--a--lifetime events and that deep sn searches can be contaminated byunderluminous sn ia in a fairly large volume.

astro-ph;9901345	supernova 1996l: evidence of a strong wind episode before the explosion	observations of the type ii sn 1996l reveal the presence of a slowlyexpanding (v~700$ km/s) shell at ~ 10^(16) cm from the exploding star. narrowemission features are visible in the early spectra superposed on the normal snspectrum. within about two months these features develop narrow symmetricp-cygni profiles. about 100 days after the explosion the light curve suddenlyflattens, the spectral lines broaden and the halpha flux becomes larger thanwhat is expected from a purely radioactive model. these events are interpretedas signatures of the onset of the interaction between the fast moving ejectaand a slowly moving outer shell of matter ejected before the sn explosion. atabout 300 days the narrow lines disappear and the flux drops until the sn fadesaway, suggesting that the interaction phase is over and that the shell has beenswept away. simple calculations show that the superwind episode started 9 yrbefore the sn explosion and lasted 6 yr, with an average dm/dt=10^(-3)m_solar/yr. even at very late epochs (up to day 335) the typical forbiddenlines of [oi], caii], [feii] remain undetected or very weak. spectra after day270 show relatively strong emission lines of hei. these lines are narrower thanother emission lines coming from the sn ejecta, but broader than those from thecsm. these high excitation lines are probably the result of non-thermalexcitation and ionization caused by the deposition of the gamma-rays emitted inthe decay of radioactive material mixed in the he layer.

astro-ph;9904225	a new determination of supernova rates and a comparison with indicators  for galactic star formation	we have computed new estimates of the local rates of supernovae (sne) addingthe updated log of evans' visual search to our sn search database. in this way,we have accumulated the largest sn statistics ever assembled for this purpose.the new sn rates are corrected on an empirical basis for the bias in the innerregions of galaxies and that in inclined spirals. we also tested an alternativeapproach based on the simple model proposed by hatano et al. (1998) for the snand dust distribution in spirals. it turns out that, although the twoapproaches give similar average rates, the hatano et al. model appears toovercorrect the sn rate of distant galaxies. we used these updated statisticsto probe the sn rates with different tracers of the star formation activity ingalaxies, namely integrated colors, infrared luminosities and nuclearactivities. we found a clear relation between the core-collapse sn rate and theintegrated galaxy color, which appears consistent with the prediction of galaxyevolutionary models. we also compared sn rates in galaxies with different l_firwith unfavorable outcome, and we argue that l_fir is not a universalmeasurement of sfr. finally, we confirm that the sn rate is not enhanced in agnhost galaxies which indicates that the nuclear engine does not significantlystimulate the extranuclear sf.

astro-ph;9910324	the properties of supernova 1997cy associated to grb970514	the extraordinary sn 1997cy associated with grb 970514 has been observedphotometrically and spectroscopically for nearly 2 yr. at the time of discoverysn 1997cy was the brightest sn ever observed (mv=&lt;-20.1, v(hel)=19140 km/s,h_0=65 km/s/mpc). up to the last available observations (600 days after thegrb) the total time-integrated flux was equal to or larger than that expectedfrom the complete thermalization of the gamma-rays produced by 2.3 mo of 56co.however, starting already on day 60 the luminosity decline is slower than the56co decay rate, indicating that the sn ejecta was interacting withcircumstellar material (csm). the interaction appeared to weaken around day550. the spectra of sn 1997cy are dominated at all epochs by halpha emission,which shows at least 3 components of different widths, as in sn 1988z. severalother lines with different widths are also visible, especially at early epochs.the entire light curve of sn 1997cy is reproduced by a model of the interactionof the very energetic (e=5 x 10^(52) ergs) ejecta of a massive star (25 mo)with the csm, with some contribution from radioactive decays. the csm couldhave been ejected with a mass-loss rate of mdot ~ 4x10^(-4) mo yr^(-1) as theprogenitor star evolved from a bsg to a rsg about 10^4 yr before the explosion.the lack of oxygen and magnesium lines in the spectra at nebular phases poses aproblem for models requiring high mass progenitors. the possibility that mostof the core material of the progenitor has fallen onto a massive black hole sothat the reverse shock dies at the inner edge of the h/he envelope isdiscussed.

0810.0635	sn 2006gy: was it really extra-ordinary?	we present an optical photometric and spectroscopic study of the veryluminous type iin sn 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. inphotometry, a broad, bright (m_r~-21.7) peak characterizes all bvri lightcurves. afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slowluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. at late phases (&gt;237 days),because of the large luminosity drop (&gt;3 mag), only upper visibility limits areobtained in the b, r and i bands. in the near-infrared, two k-band detectionson days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or ir echoesscenarios. at all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broadp-cygni profiles and a multicomponent halpha profile, which are the typicalsignatures of type iin sne. after maximum, spectroscopic and photometricsimilarities are found between sn 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated sne(e.g. sn 1997cy, sn 1999e and sn 2002ic). this suggests that ejecta-csminteraction plays a key role in sn 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,sustaining the late-time-light curve. alternatively, the late luminosity may berelated to the radioactive decay of ~3m_sun of 56ni. models of the light curvein the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (r~6-810^(12)cm, m_ej~5-14m_sun), and that the sn ejecta collided with massive(6-10m_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. these clumps do notcompletely obscure the sn photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity isdue both to the decay of 56ni and to interaction with csm. a supermassive staris not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarilylarge explosion energy.
