0907.0233	the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in wmap data	using wmap 5 year data, we look for the average sunyaev-zel'dovich effect(sze) signal from clusters of galaxies by stacking the regions around hundredsof known x-ray clusters. we detect the average sze at a very high significancelevel. the average cluster signal is spatially resolved in the w band. thismean signal is compared with the expected signal from the same clusterscalculated on the basis of archival rosat data. from the comparison we concludethat the observed sze seems to be less than the expected signal derived fromx-ray measurements when a standard beta-model is assumed for the gasdistribution. this conclusion is model dependent. our predictions depend mostlyon the assumptions made about the core radius of clusters and the slope of thegas density profile. models with steeper profiles are able to simultaneouslyfit both x-ray and wmap data better than a beta-model. however, the agreementis not perfect and we find that it is still difficult to make the x-ray and szeresults agree. a model assuming point source contamination in sze clustersrenders a better fit to the one-dimensional sze profiles thus suggesting thatcontamination from point sources could be contributing to a diminution of thesze signal. selecting a model that better fits both x-ray and wmap data awayfrom the very central region, we estimate the level of contamination and findthat on average, the point source contamination is on the level of 16 mjy (at41 ghz), 26 mjy (at 61 ghz) and 18 mjy (at 94 ghz). these estimated fluxes aremarginally consistent with the estimated contamination derived from radio andinfrared surveys thus suggesting that the combination of a steeper gas profileand the contribution from point sources allows us to consistently explain thex-ray emission and sze in galaxy clusters as measured by rosat and wmap.

1001.2934	the atacama cosmology telescope: a measurement of the 600&lt; ell &lt;8000  cosmic microwave background power spectrum at 148 ghz	we present a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation observed at 148 ghz. the measurement usesmaps with 1.4' angular resolution made with data from the atacama cosmologytelescope (act). the observations cover 228 square degrees of the southern sky,in a 4.2-degree-wide strip centered on declination 53 degrees south. the cmb atarcminute angular scales is particularly sensitive to the silk damping scale,to the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect from galaxy clusters, and to emission byradio sources and dusty galaxies. after masking the 108 brightest point sourcesin our maps, we estimate the power spectrum between 600 &lt; \ell &lt; 8000 using theadaptive multi-taper method to minimize spectral leakage and maximize use ofthe full data set. our absolute calibration is based on observations of uranus.to verify the calibration and test the fidelity of our map at large angularscales, we cross-correlate the act map to the wmap map and recover the wmappower spectrum from 250 &lt; ell &lt; 1150. the power beyond the silk damping tail ofthe cmb is consistent with models of the emission from point sources. wequantify the contribution of sz clusters to the power spectrum by fitting to amodel normalized at sigma8 = 0.8. we constrain the model's amplitude asz &lt; 1.63(95% cl). if interpreted as a measurement of sigma8, this implies sigma8^sz &lt;0.86 (95% cl) given our sz model. a fit of act and wmap five-year data jointlyto a 6-parameter lcdm model plus terms for point sources and the sz effect isconsistent with these results.

1007.5256	the atacama cosmology telescope: extragalactic sources at 148 ghz in the  2008 survey	we report on extragalactic sources detected in a 455 square-degree map of thesouthern sky made with data at a frequency of 148 ghz from the atacamacosmology telescope 2008 observing season. we provide a catalog of 157 sourceswith flux densities spanning two orders of magnitude: from 15 to 1500 mjy.comparison to other catalogs shows that 98% of the act detections correspond tosources detected at lower radio frequencies. three of the sources appear to beassociated with the brightest cluster galaxies of low redshift x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters. estimates of the radio to mm-wave spectral indices anddifferential counts of the sources further bolster the hypothesis that they arenearly all radio sources, and that their emission is not dominated byre-emission from warm dust. in a bright (&gt;50 mjy) 148 ghz-selected sample withcomplete cross-identifications from the australia telescope 20 ghz survey, weobserve an average steepening of the spectra between 5, 20, and 148 ghz withmedian spectral indices of $\alpha_{\rm 5-20} = -0.07 \pm 0.06$, $\alpha_{\rm20-148} = -0.39 \pm0.04$, and $\alpha_{\rm 5-148} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$. when themeasured spectral indices are taken into account, the 148 ghz differentialsource counts are consistent with previous measurements at 30 ghz in thecontext of a source count model dominated by radio sources. extrapolating withan appropriately rescaled model for the radio source counts, the poissoncontribution to the spatial power spectrum from synchrotron-dominated sourceswith flux density less than 20 mjy is $c^{\rm sync} = (2.8 \pm 0.3) \times10^{-6} \micro\kelvin^2$.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1301.0776	the atacama cosmology telescope: likelihood for small-scale cmb data	the atacama cosmology telescope has measured the angular power spectra ofmicrowave fluctuations to arcminute scales at frequencies of 148 and 218 ghz,from three seasons of data. at small scales the fluctuations in the primordialcosmic microwave background (cmb) become increasingly obscured by extragalacticforegounds and secondary cmb signals. we present results from a nine-parametermodel describing these secondary effects, including the thermal and kinematicsunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz and ksz) power; the clustered and poisson-like powerfrom cosmic infrared background (cib) sources, and their frequency scaling; thetsz-cib correlation coefficient; the extragalactic radio source power; andthermal dust emission from galactic cirrus in two different regions of the sky.in order to extract cosmological parameters, we describe a likelihood functionfor the act data, fitting this model to the multi-frequency spectra in themultipole range 500&lt;ell&lt;10000. we extend the likelihood to include spectra fromthe south pole telescope at frequencies of 95, 150, and 220 ghz. accounting fordifferent radio source levels and galactic cirrus emission, the same modelprovides an excellent fit to both datasets simultaneously, with chi2/dof=675/697 for act, and 96/107 for spt. we then use the multi-frequency likelihoodto estimate the cmb power spectrum from act in bandpowers, marginalizing overthe secondary parameters. this provides a simplified `cmb-only' likelihood inthe range 500&lt;ell&lt;3500 for use in cosmological parameter estimation.

1302.2114	long-term variability of extragalactic radio sources in the planck early  release compact source catalogue	combining measurements taken using the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap) from 2001 to 2008 with measurements taken using planck from 2009 to2010, we investigate the long-term flux density variability of extragalacticradio sources selected from the planck early release compact source catalogue.the single-year, single-frequency wmap maps are used to estimateyearly-averaged flux densities of the sources in the four wmap bands: ka (33ghz), q (41 ghz), v (61 ghz), and w (94 ghz). we identify 82, 67, 32, and 15sources respectively as variable at greater than 99% confidence level in thesefour bands. the amplitudes of variation are comparable between bands, and arenot correlated with either the flux densities or the spectral indices of thesources. the number counts of wmap ka-band sources are stable from year to yeardespite the fluctuation caused by individual source variability. most of oursources show strong correlation in variability between bands. almost all thesources that show variability are blazars. we have attempted to fit two simple,four-parameter models to the time-series of 32 sources showing correlatedvariability at multiple frequencies - a long-term flaring model and arotating-jet model. we find that 19 sources (60%) can be fit with the simplerotating-jet model, and ten of these also fit the simple long-term flaringmodel. the remaining 13 sources (40%) show more complex variability behaviourthat is not consistent with either model. extended radio galaxies in our sampleshow no sign of variability, as expected, with the exception of pictor a forwhich we report evidence for a millimetre flare lasting between 2002 and 2010.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5063	planck 2013 results. ii. low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the data processing pipeline of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi) data processing centre (dpc) to create and characterizefull-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44 and 70ghz. in particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,starting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. data are continuouslycalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. skysignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based onsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. noise propertiesare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. a destriping code(madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information intosky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. noise covariancematrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on lfi and planckproducts, are also produced. main beams are estimated down to the -20 db levelusing jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration ofthe focal plane.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01582	planck 2015 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the european space agency's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the earlyuniverse and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14~may 2009 and scanned themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12~august 2009 and23~october 2013. in february~2015, esa and the planck collaboration releasedthe second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire planckmission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set ofscientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. thispaper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the dataproducts in the release, as well as the associated cosmological andastrophysical science results and papers. the science products include maps ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb), the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect,and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compactgalactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues ofsunyaev-zeldovich clusters and galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulationsof signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methodsand assessment of uncertainties. the likelihood code used to assesscosmological models against the planck data are described, as well as a cmblensing likelihood. scientific results include cosmological parameters derivingfrom cmb power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well asconstraints on inflation, non-gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, darkenergy, and modified gravity.

1502.01584	planck 2015 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions, and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). the structure of the paper is similar to that presented inthe 2013 planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalizationand the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on measurements performedduring observations of jupiter. by stacking data from seven jupiter transits,the main beam profiles are measured down to -25 db at 30 and 44 ghz, and downto -30 db at 70 ghz. it has been confirmed that the agreement between thesimulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequencyband (within the 20 db contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and70 ghz; 0.2% at 44 ghz). simulated polarized beams are used for the computationof the effective beam window functions. the error budget for the windowfunctions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, andaccounts for the radiometer band shapes. the total uncertainties in theeffective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively(at $\ell \approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 ghz (at $\ell \approx 1000$).

1502.01585	planck 2015 results. vi. lfi mapmaking	this paper describes the mapmaking procedure applied to planck lfi (lowfrequency instrument) data. the mapmaking step takes as input the calibratedtimelines and pointing information. the main products are sky maps of $i,q$,and $u$ stokes components. for the first time, we present polarization maps atlfi frequencies. the mapmaking algorithm is based on a destriping technique,enhanced with a noise prior. the galactic region is masked to reduce errorsarising from bandpass mismatch and high signal gradients. we apply horn-uniformradiometer weights to reduce effects of beam shape mismatch. the algorithm isthe same as used for the 2013 release, apart from small changes in parametersettings. we validate the procedure through simulations. special emphasis isput on the control of systematics, which is particularly important for accuratepolarization analysis. we also produce low-resolution versions of the maps, andcorresponding noise covariance matrices. these serve as input in later analysissteps and parameter estimation. the noise covariance matrices are validatedthrough noise monte carlo simulations. the residual noise in the map productsis characterized through analysis of half-ring maps, noise covariance matrices,and simulations.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01597	planck 2015 results. xxiv. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  counts	we present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from theplanck full mission data set. our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detectedvia their sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal down to a signal-to-noise of six, andis more than a factor of two larger than the 2013 planck cluster cosmologysample. the counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatibleconstraints under the same modelling assumptions. taking advantage of thelarger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution inredshift and signal-to-noise. we use mass estimates from two recent studies ofgravitational lensing of background galaxies by planck clusters to providepriors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $1-b$. in addition, we use lensing ofcosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations by planck clustersas a third independent constraint on this parameter. these various calibrationsimply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations invarying degrees of tension with those coming from planck analysis of primaryfluctuations in the cmb; for the lowest estimated values of $1-b$ the tensionis mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while for the largestestimated value it remains substantial. we also examine constraints onextensions to the base flat $\lambda cdm$ model by combining the cluster andcmb constraints. the combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses,but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because itsimultaneously lowers the implied value of the hubble parameter, therebyexacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates.improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10%-levelto 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide astringent test of the base $\lambda cdm$ model.

1505.08022	planck 2015 results. v. lfi calibration	we present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the planck lowfrequency instrument (lfi) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for theplanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. asin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronousmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use theorbital component, rather than adopting the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) solar dipole. this allows our 2015 lfi analysis to provide anindependent solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that ofhfi and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the wmap value. this 0.3% shiftin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from wmap and a global overhaul of theiterative calibration code increases the overall level of the lfi maps by 0.45%(30 ghz), 0.64% (44 ghz), and 0.82% (70 ghz) in temperature with respect to the2013 planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrummeasured by wmap. we estimate that the lfi calibration uncertainty is now atthe level of 0.20% for the 70 ghz map, 0.26% for the 44 ghz map, and 0.35% forthe 30 ghz map. we provide a detailed description of the impact of all thechanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.

1508.03375	planck 2013 results. xxxi. consistency of the planck data	the planck design and scanning strategy provide many levels of redundancythat can be exploited to provide tests of internal consistency. one of the mostimportant is the comparison of the 70ghz and 100ghz channels. based ondifferent instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focalplane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, andnear the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effecttwo different experiments. the 143ghz channel has the lowest noise level onplanck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. in thispaper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 planck data. weconcentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143ghz channel maps and powerspectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acousticpeaks, on maps masked for diffuse galactic emission and for strong unresolvedsources. difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin areconsistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave backgroundstructure. including small but important corrections for unresolved-sourceresiduals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100ghz power spectraaveraged over 70&lt;l&lt;390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100ghzpower spectra of 0.4% over the same l range. these values are within andconsistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the planck2013 results. we also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysisshowing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100/143/217ghz power spectra. weanalyse calibration procedures and beams to determine what fraction of thesedifferences can be accounted for by known approximations or systematic errorsthat could be controlled even better in the future, reducing uncertaintiesstill further. several possible small improvements are described...(abridged)

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

1511.06770	on the redshift distribution and physical properties of dsfgs from act	we present multi-wavelength detections of nine candidategravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected at 218 ghz($\sim$1.4 mm) from the act equatorial survey. these represent the subset ofthe total act sample lying in herschel spire fields, and all nine of the 218ghz detections were found to have bright herschel counterparts. by fittingtheir spectral energy distributions (seds) with a modified blackbody model withpower-law temperature distribution, we find the sample has a median redshift of$z=4.1^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ (68 percent confidence interval), as expected for 218 ghzselection, and an apparent total infrared luminosity of $\log_{10}({\mu l_{\rmir}}/l_\odot) = 13.32^{+0.25}_{-0.19}$, which suggests that they are eitherstrongly lensed sources with magnification $\mu=5-10$ or unresolved collectionsof unlensed dsfgs. the effective apparent diameter of the sample is ${\sqrt{\mu}\,d} \sim 4.2^{+1.7}_{-1.0}$ kpc, further evidence of strong lensingor multiplicity as the typical diameter of dusty star-forming galaxies is $1-3$kpc. additionally, we find that the sources have substantial optical depth($\tau = 4.2^{+3.7}_{-1.9}$) around the peak in the modified blackbody spectrum($\lambda_{\rm obs} \le 500$ $\mu$m).
