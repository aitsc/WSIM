0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

0912.3597	pinpointing the tev gamma-ray emission region in m87 using tev and 43  ghz radio monitoring	the tev radio galaxy m87 is the first radio galaxy detected in the tevregime. the structure of its jet, which is not pointing towards our line ofsight, is spatially resolved in x-ray (by chandra), optical and radioobservations. in 2008, the three main atmospheric cherenkov telescopeobservatories veritas, magic and h.e.s.s. coordinated their observations in ajoint campaign from january to may with a total observation time of approx. 120hours. in february, strong and rapid day-scale tev flares were detected. vlbamonitoring observations during the same period showed that the 43 ghz radioflux density of the unresolved core began to rise at the time of the tev flaresand eventually reached levels above any previously seen with vlbi. new jetcomponents appeared during the flare. the localization accuracy of the tevinstruments of many arcseconds, even for strong sources, is inadequate toconstrain the origin of the emission in the inner jets of agns. for m87, with a6 billion solar mass black hole and a distance of 16.7 mpc, the vlba resolutioninstead corresponds to 30 by 60 schwarzschild radii. this is starting toresolve the jet collimation region. the temporal coincidence of the tev andradio flares indicates that they are related and provides the first directevidence that the tev radiation from this source is produced within a few tensof rs of the radio core, thought to be coincident to within the vlba resolutionwith the black hole.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1005.0367	veritas 2008 - 2009 monitoring of the variable gamma-ray source m87	m87 is a nearby radio galaxy that is detected at energies ranging from radioto vhe gamma-rays. its proximity and its jet, misaligned from ourline-of-sight, enable detailed morphological studies and extensive modeling atradio, optical, and x-ray energies. flaring activity was observed at allenergies, and multi-wavelength correlations would help clarify the origin ofthe vhe emission. in this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectralanalysis of the veritas vhe gamma-ray observations of m87 in 2008 and 2009. inthe 2008 observing season, veritas detected an excess with a statisticalsignificance of 7.2 sigma from m87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoringcampaign conducted by three major vhe experiments along with the chandra x-rayobservatory. in february 2008, veritas observed a vhe flare from m87 occurringover a 4-day timespan. the peak nightly flux above 250gev was 7.7% of the crabnebula flux. m87 was marginally detected before this 4-day flare period, andwas not detected afterwards. spectral analysis of the veritas observationsshowed no significant change in the photon index between the flare andpre-flare states. shortly after the vhe flare seen by veritas, the chandrax-ray observatory detected the flux from the core of m87 at a historicalmaximum, while the flux from the nearby knot hst-1 remained quiescent. acciariet al. (2009) presented the 2008 contemporaneous vhe gamma-ray, chandra x-ray,and vlba radio observations which suggest the core as the most likely source ofvhe emission, in contrast to the 2005 vhe flare that was simultaneous with anx-ray flare in the hst-1 knot. in 2009, veritas continued its monitoring of m87and marginally detected a 4.2 sigma excess corresponding to a flux of ~1% ofthe crab nebula. no vhe flaring activity was observed in 2009.

1006.5955	veritas search for vhe gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies	indirect dark matter searches with ground-based gamma-ray observatoriesprovide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter thatis complementary to that of direct search or accelerator productionexperiments. we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies draco, ursa minor, bootes 1, and willman 1 conducted by veritas. thesegalaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distanceof several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of thedark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. since theconventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from theseobjects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for thesecondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matterparticles. no significant gamma-ray flux above 200 gev was detected from thesefour dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. the 95% confidenceupper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12photons cm^-2s^-1. we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints onthe thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section andthe relative velocity of the wimps. the limits are obtained under conservativeassumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and areapproximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoreticalprediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as wellas the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions couldfurther lower the limits.

1106.4594	multiwavelength observations of the vhe blazar 1es 2344+514	multiwavelength observations of the high-frequency-peaked blazar 1es2344+514were performed from 2007 october to 2008 january. the campaign represents thefirst contemporaneous data on the object at very high energy (vhe, e &gt;100 gev){\gamma}-ray, x-ray, and uv energies. observations with veritas in vhe{\gamma}-rays yield a strong detection of 20 {\sigma} with 633 excess events ina total exposure of 18.1 hours live-time. a strong vhe {\gamma}-ray flare on2007 december 7 is measured at f(&gt;300 gev) = (6.76 \pm 0.62) \times 10-11 phcm-2 s-1, corresponding to 48% of the crab nebula flux. excluding this flaringepisode, nightly variability at lower fluxes is observed with a time-averagedmean of f(&gt;300 gev) = (1.06 \pm 0.09) \times 10-11 ph cm-2 s-1 (7.6% of thecrab nebula flux). the differential photon spectrum between 390 gev and 8.3 tevfor the time-averaged observations excluding 2007 december 7 is well describedby a power law with a photon index of {\gamma} = 2.78 \pm 0.09stat \pm0.15syst. over the full period of veritas observations contemporaneous x-rayand uv data were taken with swift and rxte. the measured 2-10 kev flux rangedby a factor of ~7 during the campaign. on 2007 december 8 the highest everobserved x-ray flux from 1es 2344+514 was measured by swift xrt at a flux off(2-10 kev) = (6.28 \pm 0.31) \times 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1. evidence for acorrelation between the x-ray flux and vhe {\gamma}-ray flux on nightlytime-scales is indicated with a pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.60 \pm0.11. contemporaneous spectral energy distributions (seds) of 1es 2344+514 arepresented for two distinct flux states. a one-zone synchrotron self-compton(ssc) model describes both seds using parameters consistent with previous sscmodeling of 1es 2344+514 from non-contemporaneous observations.

0710.2655	detailed studies of pixelated czt detectors grown with the modified  horizontal bridgman method	the detector material cadmium zinc telluride (czt), known for its highresolution over a broad energy range, is produced mainly by two methods: themodified high-pressure bridgman (mhb) and the high-pressure bridgman (hpb)process. this study is based on mhb czt substrates from the company orbotechmedical solutions ltd. with a detector size of 2.0x2.0x0.5 cm^3, 8x8 pixels anda pitch of 2.46 mm. former studies have emphasized only on the cathode materialshowing that high-work-function improve the energy resolution at lowerenergies. therfore, we studied the influence of the anode material whilekeeping the cathode material constant. we used four different materials:indium, titanium, chromium and gold with work-functions between 4.1 ev and 5.1ev. the low work-function materials indium and titanium achieved the bestperformance with energy resolutions: 2.0 kev (at 59 kev) and 1.9 kev (at 122kev) for titanium; 2.1 kev (at 59 kev) and 2.9 kev (at 122 kev) for indium.these detectors are very competitive compared with the more expensive onesbased on hpb material if one takes the large pixel pitch of 2.46 mm intoaccount. we present a detailed comparison of our detector response with 3-dsimulations, from which we determined the mobility-lifetime-products forelectrons and holes. finally, we evaluated the temperature dependency of thedetector performance and mobility-lifetime-products, which is important formany applications. with decreasing temperature down to -30c the breakdownvoltage increases and the electron mobility-lifetime-product decreases by about30% over a range from 20c to -30c. this causes the energy resolution todeteriorate, but the concomitantly increasing breakdown voltage makes itpossible to increase the applied bias voltage and restore the full performance.

1310.6498	long term observations of b2 1215+30 with veritas	we report on veritas observations of the bl lac object b2 1215+30 between2008 and 2012. during this period, the source was detected at very highenergies (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) by veritas with a significance of $8.9\sigma$ andshowed clear variability on time scales larger than months. in 2011, the sourcewas found to be in a relatively bright state and a power-law fit to thedifferential photon spectrum yields a spectral index of $3.6 \pm0.4_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{syst}}$ with an integral flux above 200gev of $(8.0 \pm 0.9_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 3.2_{\mathrm{syst}}) \times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. no short term variability could be detectedduring the bright state in 2011. multi-wavelength data were obtainedcontemporaneous with the veritas observations in 2011 and cover optical(super-lotis, mdm, swift-uvot), x-ray (swift-xrt), and gamma-ray (fermi-lat)frequencies. these were used to construct the spectral energy distribution(sed) of b2 1215+30. a one-zone leptonic model is used to model the blazaremission and the results are compared to those of magic from early 2011 andother veritas-detected blazars. the sed can be well reproduced with modelparameters typical for vhe-detected bl lacs.

1310.8150	observation of markarian 421 in tev gamma rays over a 14-year time span	the variability of the blazar markarian 421 in tev gamma rays over a 14-yeartime period has been explored with the whipple 10 m telescope. it is shown thatthe dynamic range of its flux variations is large and similar to that inx-rays. a correlation between the x-ray and tev energy bands is observed duringsome bright flares and when the complete data sets are binned on longtimescales. the main database consists of 878.4 hours of observation with thewhipple telescope, spread over 783 nights. the peak energy response of thetelescope was 400 gev with 20% uncertainty. this is the largest database of anytev-emitting active galactic nucleus (agn) and hence was used to explore thevariability profile of markarian 421. the time-averaged flux from markarian 421over this period was 0.446$\pm$0.008 crab flux units. the flux exceeded 10 crabflux units on three separate occasions. for the 2000-2001 season the averageflux reached 1.86 crab units, while in the 1996-1997 season the average fluxwas only 0.23 crab units.

1405.1082	a strong radio brightening at the jet base of m87 during the elevated  very-high-energy gamma-ray state in 2012	we report our intensive radio monitoring observations of the jet in m87 withthe vlbi exploration of radio astrometry (vera) and the european vlbi network(evn) from february 2011 to october 2012, together with contemporaneoushigh-energy gamma-ray light curves obtained by the fermi-lat. during thisperiod, an elevated level of the m87 flux is reported at vhe gamma rays. wedetected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolvedjet base (radio core) with vera at 22 and 43ghz coincident with the vheactivity. meanwhile, we confirmed with evn at 5ghz that hst-1 (an alternativegamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its fluxdensity and structure. these results in the radio bands strongly suggest thatthe vhe gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or56 schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. we furtherconducted vera astrometry for the m87 core during the flaring period, anddetected core shifts between 22 and 43ghz. we also discovered a clearfrequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5ghz; theradio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a largeramplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at22 and 43ghz. this indicates that a new radio-emitting component was creatednear the black hole in the period of the vhe event, and then propagated outwardwith progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. by combining these results,we estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived asub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. this value is significantly slower thanthe super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during theprominent vhe flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger vhe activitycan be associated with the production of the higher lorentz factor jet.

1409.6214	analyzing the data from x-ray polarimeters with stokes parameters	x-ray polarimetry promises to deliver unique information about the geometryof the inner accretion flow of astrophysical black holes and the nature ofmatter and electromagnetism in and around neutron stars. in this paper, wediscuss the possibility to use stokes parameters - a commonly used tool inradio, infrared, and optical polarimetry - to analyze the data from x-raypolarimeters such as scattering polarimeters and photoelectric effectpolarimeters, which measure the linear polarization of the detected x-rays.based on the azimuthal scattering angle (in the case of a scatteringpolarimeter) or the azimuthal component of the angle of the electron ejection(in the case of a photoelectric effect polarimeter), the stokes parameters canbe calculated for each event recorded in the detector. owing to the additivenature of stokes parameters, the analysis reduces to adding the stokesparameters of the individual events and subtracting the stokes parameterscharacterizing the background (if present). the main strength of this kind ofanalysis is that the errors on the stokes parameters can be computed easily andare well behaved - in stark contrast of the errors on the polarization fractionand polarization direction. we demonstrate the power of the stokes analysis byderiving several useful formulae, e.g. the expected error on the polarizationfraction and polarization direction for a detection of $n_s$ signal and$n_{bg}$ background events, the optimal observation times of the signal andbackground regions in the presence of non-negligible background contaminationof the signal, and the minimum detectable polarization (mdp) that can beachieved when following this prescription.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

astro-ph;0109523	x-ray emission processes in radio jets	the emission processes responsible for the observed x-rays from radio jetsare commonly believed to be non-thermal, but in any particular case, it isunclear if synchrotron emission or one or more varieties of inverse comptonemission predominates. we present a formulation of inverse compton emissionfrom a relativistically moving jet (``ic/beaming'') which relies on radioemitting synchrotron sources for which the energy densities in particles andfields are comparable. we include the non-isotropic nature of inverse comptonscattering of the relativistic electrons on photons of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) and provide beaming parameters for a number of jets. a list ofx-ray emitting jets is given and the jets are classified on the basis of theirmorphology and spectral energy distribution to determine their likely emissionprocess. we conclude that these jets have significant bulk relativisticvelocities on kpc scales; that higher redshift sources require less beamingbecause the energy density of the cmb is significantly greater than locally;and that for some nearby sources, synchrotron x-ray emission predominatesbecause the jet makes a large angle to the line of sight.

astro-ph;0312454	the off-axis galaxy cluster merger abell 115	we have used a 50.4 ksec chandra obsffervation to examine the galaxy clusterabell 115 (z=0.1971). the x-ray surface brightness distribution shows a mergerof 2 sub-clusters with substantial off-axis motion. the northern sub-clustermoves toward the southwest and exhibits a strong x-ray surface brightnessgradient toward this direction as well as a "fan" of x-ray bright intra-clustermedium (icm) toward the northeast. the southern sub-cluster shows a pronouncednortheast-southwest elongation, probably as a consequence of the ongoingmerger. the temperature of the icm is highly non-uniform across the cluster.although the merger is well underway and has had a substantial influence on themorphology of the 2 sub-clusters, it has apparently not disturbed the coolsub-cluster cores. the icm in between the sub-clusters has a significantlyelevated temperature of ~8 kev. however, owing to the low surface brightness,we do not find direct evidence for shocks in this region. the x-ray surfacebrightness distribution of the northern sub-cluster is highly non-uniform. thedata show a bright central core region of about 10" (30 kpc) diameter. a highlysignificant surface brightness discontinuity separates the core from theambient icm. we discuss several possibilities to explain the compact core, andits relation to the central radio galaxy 3c 28.0 and the sub-cluster's coolingflow. further outwards, at about 24.6" (80 kpc) to the southwest of thesub-cluster core, the surface brightness distribution shows a jump associatedwith a contact discontinuity. the chandra imaging spectroscopy data do not showevidence for a shock associated with the surface brightness jump. we concludethat it is associated with denser plasma moving sub-sonically through theambient plasma.

astro-ph;0511575	thick pixelated czt detectors with isolated steering grids	we explore the possibility to improve the performance of 0.5 cm thick cadmiumzinc telluride (czt) detectors with the help of steering grids on the anodeside of the detectors. steering grids can improve the energy resolution of cztdetectors by enhancing the small pixel effect; furthermore, they can increasetheir detection efficiency by steering electrons to the anode pixels whichotherwise would drift to the area between pixels. previously, the benefit ofsteering grids had been compromised by additional noise associated withcurrents between the steering grids and the anode pixels. we use thin filmdeposition techniques to isolate the steering grid from the czt substrate by a150 nm thick layer of the isolator aluminiumoxide. while the thin layer doesnot affect the beneficial effect of the steering grid on the weightingpotentials and the electric field inside the detector, it suppresses thecurrents between the steering grid and the anode pixels. in this contribution,we present first results from a 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm czt detector with 8 x 8 pixelsthat we tested before and after deposition of an isolated steering grid. thesteering grid improves the 662 kev energy resolution of the detector by afactor of 1.3 (from about 2% to about 1.5%), while not reducing the detectionefficiency. to gain further insights into the detector response in the regionbetween pixels, we measured energy spectra with a collimated cs137 source. thecollimator measurements can be used to enhance our understanding of energyspectra measured under flood illumination of the detectors.
