0901.0486	turbulence and magnetic field amplification in supernova remnants:  interactions between a strong shock wave and multi-phase interstellar medium	we examine mhd simulations of the propagation of a strong shock wave throughthe interstellar two-phase medium composed of small-scale cloudlets and diffusewarm neutral medium in two-dimensional geometry. the pre-shock two-phase mediumis provided as a natural consequence of the thermal instability that isexpected to be ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. we show that theshock-compressed shell becomes turbulent owing to the preshock densityinhomogeneity and magnetic field amplification takes place in the shell. themaximum field strength is determined by the condition that plasma beta ~ 1,which gives the field strength on the order of 1 mg in the case of shockvelocity ~ 1,000 km/s. the strongly magnetized region shows filamentary andknot-like structures in two-dimensional simulations. the spatial scale of theregions with magnetic field of 1 mg in our simulation is roughly 0.05 pc whichis comparable to the spatial scale of the x-ray hot spots recently discoveredin supernova remnants where the magnetic field strength is indicated to beamplified up to the order of 1 mg. this result may also suggest that theturbulent region with locally strong magnetic field is expected to be spreadout in the region with frequent supernova explosions, such as in the galacticcenter and starburst galaxies.

0902.1887	local linear analysis of interaction between a planet and viscous disk  and an implication on type i planetary migration	we investigate the effects of viscosity on disk-planet interaction anddiscuss how type i migration of planets is modified. we have performed a linearcalculation using shearing-sheet approximation and obtained the detailed, highresolution density structure around the planet embedded in a viscous disk witha wide range of viscous coefficients. we use a time-dependent formalism that isuseful in investigating the effects of various physical processes ondisk-planet interaction. we find that the density structure in the vicinity ofthe planet is modified and the main contribution to the torque comes from thisregion, in contrast to inviscid case. although it is not possible to derivetotal torque acting on the planet within the shearing-sheet approximation, theone-sided torque can be very different from the inviscid case, depending on thereynolds number. this effect has been neglected so far but our results indicatethat the interaction between a viscous disk and a planet can be qualitativelydifferent from an inviscid case and the details of the density structure in thevicinity of the planet is critically important.

0905.4404	two-fluid instability of dust and gas in the dust layer of a  protoplanetary disk	instabilities of the dust layer in a protoplanetary disk are investigated. itis known that the streaming instability develops and dust density concentrationoccurs in a situation where the initial dust density is uniform. this workconsiders the effect of initial dust density gradient vertical to the midplane.dust and gas are treated as different fluids. pressure of dust fluid is assumedto be zero. the gas friction time is assumed to be constant. axisymmetrictwo-dimensional numerical simulation was performed using the spectral method.we found that an instability develops with a growth rate on the order of thekeplerian angular velocity even if the gas friction time multiplied by thekeplerian angular velocity is as small as 0.001.  this instability is powered by two sources: (1) the vertical shear of theazimuthal velocity, and (2) the relative motion of dust and gas coupled withthe dust density fluctuation due to advection. this instability diffuses dustby turbulent advection and the maximum dust density decreases. this means thatthe dust concentration by the streaming instability which is seen in the caseof a uniform initial dust density becomes ineffective as dust density gradientincreases by the dust settling toward the midplane.

0907.3255	first direct simulation of brown dwarf formation in a compact cloud core	brown dwarf formation and star formation efficiency are studied using anested grid simulation that covers five orders of magnitude in spatial scale(10^4 - 0.1au). starting with a rotating magnetized compact cloud with a massof 0.22 m_sun, we follow the cloud evolution until the end of main accretionphase. outflow of about 5 km/s emerges about 100 yr before the protostarformation and does not disappear until the end of the calculation. the massaccretion rate declines from 10^-6 m_sun/yr to 10^-8 - 10^-12 m_sun/yr in ashort time (about 10^4 yr) after the protostar formation. this is because (1) alarge fraction of mass is ejected from the host cloud by the protostellaroutflow and (2) the gas escapes from the host cloud by the thermal pressure. atthe end of the calculation, 74% (167 m_jup) of the total mass (225 m_jup) isoutflowing from the protostar, in which 34% (77 m_jup) of the total mass isejected by the protostellar outflow with supersonic velocity and 40% (90 m_jup)escapes with subsonic velocity. on the other hand, 20% (45 m_jup) is convertedinto the protostar and 6% (13 m_jup) remains as the circumstellar disk. thus,the star formation efficiency is epsilon = 0.2. the resultant protostellar massis in the mass range of brown dwarfs. our results indicate that brown dwarfscan be formed in compact cores in the same manner as hydrogen-burning stars,and the magnetic field and protostellar outflow are essential in determiningthe star formation efficiency and stellar mass.

0907.3257	binary formation with different metallicities: dependence on initial  conditions	the fragmentation process in collapsing clouds with various metallicities isstudied using three-dimensional nested-grid hydrodynamics. initial clouds arespecified by three parameters: cloud metallicity, initial rotation energy andinitial cloud shape. for different combinations of these parameters, wecalculate 480 models in total and study cloud evolution, fragmentationconditions, orbital separation and binary frequency. for the cloud to fragmentduring collapse, the initial angular momentum must be higher than a thresholdvalue, which decreases with decreasing metallicity. although the exactfragmentation conditions depend also on the initial cloud shape, thisdependence is only modest. our results indicate a higher binary frequency inlower-metallicity gas. in particular, with the same median rotation parameteras in the solar neighbourhood, a majority of stars are born as members ofbinary/multiple systems for &lt; 10^-4 z_sun. with initial mass &lt; 0.1 m_sun, iffragments are ejected in embryo from the host clouds by multi-body interaction,they evolve to substellar-mass objects. this provides a formation channel forlow-mass stars in zero- or low-metallicity environments.

0907.3260	the circumbinary outflow: a protostellar outflow driven by a  circumbinary disk	the protostellar outflows have indispensable role in the formation of singlestars, because they carry off the excess angular momentum from the centre ofthe shrinking gas cloud, and permits further collapse to form a star. on theother hand, a significant fraction of stars is supposed to be born as binarieswith circumbinary disk that are frequently observed. here, we investigate theevolution of a magnetized rotating cloud using three-dimensional resistive mhdnested-grid code, and show that the outflow is driven by the circumbinary diskand has an important role even in the binary formation. after the adiabaticcore formation in the collapsing cloud core, the magnetic flux is significantlyremoved from the centre of the cloud by the ohmic dissipation. since thisremoval makes the magnetic braking ineffective, the adiabatic core continuouslyacquires the angular momentum to induce fragmentation and subsequent binaryformation. the magnetic field accumulates in the circumbinary disk where theremoval and accretion of magnetic field are balanced, and finally drivescircumbinary outflow. this result explains the spectacular morphology of somespecific young stellar objects such as l1551 irs5. we can infer that most ofthe bipolar molecular outflows observed by low density tracers (i.e., co) wouldcorrespond to circumbinary or circum-multiple outflows found in this report,since most of the young stellar objects are supposed to be binaries ormultiples.

0907.3265	protostellar jet and outflow in the collapsing cloud core	we investigate the driving mechanism of outflows and jets in star formationprocess using resistive mhd nested grid simulations. we found two distinctflows in the collapsing cloud core: low-velocity outflows (sim 5 km/s) with awide opening angle, driven from the first adiabatic core, and high-velocityjets (sim 50 km/s) with good collimation, driven from the protostar.high-velocity jets are enclosed by low-velocity outflow. the difference in thedegree of collimation between the two flows is caused by the strength of themagnetic field and configuration of the magnetic field lines. the magneticfield around an adiabatic core is strong and has an hourglass configuration.therefore, the low-velocity outflow from the adiabatic core are driven mainlyby the magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guided by the hourglass-like fieldlines. in contrast, the magnetic field around the protostar is weak and has astraight configuration owing to ohmic dissipation in the high-density gasregion. therefore, high-velocity jet from the protostar are driven mainly bythe magnetic pressure gradient force and guided by straight field lines.differing depth of the gravitational potential between the adiabatic core andthe protostar cause the difference of the flow speed. low-velocity outflowscorrespond to the observed molecular outflows, while high-velocity jetscorrespond to the observed optical jets. we suggest that the protostellaroutflow and the jet are driven by different cores (the first adiabatic core andprotostar), rather than that the outflow being entrained by the jet.

0908.3546	n-body simulation of planetesimal formation through gravitational  instability and coagulation. ii. accretion model	the gravitational instability of a dust layer is one of the scenarios forplanetesimal formation. if the density of a dust layer becomes sufficientlyhigh as a result of the sedimentation of dust grains toward the midplane of aprotoplanetary disk, the layer becomes gravitationally unstable andspontaneously fragments into planetesimals. using a shearing box method, weperformed local $n$-body simulations of gravitational instability of a dustlayer and subsequent coagulation without gas and investigated the basicformation process of planetesimals. in this paper, we adopted the accretionmodel as a collision model. a gravitationally bound pair of particles isreplaced by a single particle with the total mass of the pair. this accretionmodel enables us to perform long-term and large-scale calculations. weconfirmed that the formation process of planetesimals is the same as that inthe previous paper with the rubble pile models. the formation process isdivided into three stages: the formation of non-axisymmetric structures, thecreation of planetesimal seeds, and their collisional growth. we investigatedthe dependence of the planetesimal mass on the simulation domain size. we foundthat the mean mass of planetesimals formed in simulations is proportional to$l_y^{3/2}$, where $l_y$ is the size of the computational domain in thedirection of rotation. however, the mean mass of planetesimals is independentof $l_x$, where $l_x$ is the size of the computational domain in the radialdirection if $l_x$ is sufficiently large. we presented the estimation formulaof the planetesimal mass taking into account the simulation domain size.

0908.3701	two-fluid mhd simulations of converging hi flows in the interstellar  medium. ii: are molecular clouds generated directly from warm neutral medium?	formation of interstellar clouds as a consequence of thermal instability isstudied using two-dimensional two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic simulations. weconsider the situation of converging, supersonic flows of warm neutral mediumin the interstellar medium that generate a shocked slab of thermally unstablegas in which clouds form. we found, as speculated in paper i, that in theshocked slab magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure and the thermalinstability grows in the isochorically cooling, thermally unstable slab thatleads formation of hi clouds whose number density is typically n &lt; 100 cm^-3,even if the angle between magnetic field and converging flows is small. we alsofound that even if there is a large dispersion of magnetic field, evolution ofthe shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the meanmagnetic field and converging flows. thus, the direct formation of molecularclouds by piling up warm neutral medium does not seem a typical molecular cloudformation process, unless the direction of supersonic converging flows isbiased to the orientation of mean magnetic field by some mechanism. however,when the angle is small, the hi shell generated as a result of converging flowsis massive and possibly evolves into molecular clouds, provided gas in themassive hi shell is piled up again along the magnetic field line. we expectthat another subsequent shock wave can pile up again the gas of the massiveshell and produce a larger cloud. we thus emphasize the importance of multipleepisodes of converging flows, as a typical formation process of molecularclouds.

0911.0311	protoplanetary disk winds by magnetorotational instability : formation  of an inner hole and a crucial assist for planet formation	by constructing a global model based on 3d local magnetohydrodynamical (mhd)simulations, we show that the disk wind driven by magnetorotational instability(mri) plays a significant role in the dispersal of the gas component ofproto-planetary disks. because the mass loss time scale by the mri-driven diskwinds is proportional to the local keplerian rotation period, a gas diskdynamically evaporates from the inner region with possibly creating a graduallyexpanding inner hole, while a sizable amount of the gas remains in the outerregion. the disk wind is highly time-dependent with quasi-periodicity ofseveral times keplerian rotation period at each radius, which will be observedas time-variability of protostar-protoplanetary disk systems. these featurespersistently hold even if a dead zone exists because the disk winds are drivenfrom the surface regions where ionizing cosmic rays and high energy photons canpenetrate. moreover, the predicted inside-out clearing significantly suppressesthe infall of boulders to a central star and the type i migration ofproto-planets which are favorable for the formation and survival of planets.

1001.1404	formation process of the circumstellar disk: long-term simulations in  the main accretion phase of star formation	the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk in unmagnetizedmolecular clouds is investigated using three-dimensional hydrodynamicsimulations from the prestellar core until the end of the main accretion phase.in collapsing clouds, the first (adiabatic) core with a size of ~10au formsprior to the formation of the protostar. at its formation, the first core has athick disk-like structure, and is mainly supported by the thermal pressure.after the protostar formation, it decreases the thickness gradually, andbecomes supported by the centrifugal force. we found that the first core is aprecursor of the circumstellar disk. this indicates that the circumstellar diskis formed before the protostar formation with a size of ~10au, which means thatno protoplanetary disk smaller than &lt;10au exists. reflecting the thermodynamicsof the collapsing gas, at the protostar formation epoch, the circumstellar diskhas a mass of ~0.01-0.1 solar mass, while the protostar has a mass of ~10^-3solar mass. thus, just after the protostar formation, the circumstellar disk isabout 10-100 times more massive than the protostar. even in the main accretionphase that lasts for ~10^5yr, the circumstellar disk mass dominates theprotostellar mass. such a massive disk is unstable to gravitationalinstability, and tends to show fragmentation. our calculations indicate thatthe planet or brown-dwarf mass object may form in the circumstellar disk in themain accretion phase. in addition, the mass accretion rate onto the protostarshows strong time variability that is caused by the perturbation ofproto-planets and/or the spiral arms in the circumstellar disk. suchvariability provides a useful signature for detecting the planet-sizedcompanion in the circumstellar disk around very young protostars.

1006.2581	n-body simulation of planetesimal formation through gravitational  instability of a dust layer in laminar gas disk	we investigate the formation process of planetesimals from the dust layer bythe gravitational instability in the gas disk using local $n$-body simulations.the gas is modeled as a background laminar flow. we study the formation processof planetesimals and its dependence on the strength of the gas drag. oursimulation results show that the formation process is divided into three stagesqualitatively: the formation of wake-like density structures, the creation ofplanetesimal seeds, and their collisional growth. the linear analysis of thedissipative gravitational instability shows that the dust layer is secularlyunstable although toomre's $q$ value is larger than unity. however, in theinitial stage, the growth time of the gravitational instability is longer thanthat of the dust sedimentation and the decrease in the velocity dispersion.thus, the velocity dispersion decreases and the disk shrinks vertically. as thevelocity dispersion becomes sufficiently small, the gravitational instabilityfinally becomes dominant. then wake-like density structures are formed by thegravitational instability. these structures fragment into planetesimal seeds.the seeds grow rapidly owing to mutual collisions.

1009.2140	effect of magnetic braking on the circumstellar disk formation in a  strongly magnetized cloud	using resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we investigate circumstellardisk formation in a strongly magnetized cloud. as the initial state, anisolated cloud core embedded in a low-density interstellar medium with auniform magnetic field is adopted. the cloud evolution is calculated untilalmost all gas inside the initial cloud falls onto either the circumstellardisk or a protostar, and a part of the gas is ejected into the interstellarmedium by the protostellar outflow driven by the circumstellar disk. in theearly main accretion phase, the disk size is limited to \sim 10 au because theangular momentum of the circumstellar disk is effectively transferred by bothmagnetic braking and the protostellar outflow. in the later main accretionphase, however, the circumstellar disk grows rapidly and exceeds 100 au by theend of the main accretion phase. this rapid growth of the circumstellar disk iscaused by the depletion of the infalling envelope, while magnetic braking iseffective when the infalling envelope is more massive than the circumstellardisk. the infalling envelope cannot brake the circumstellar disk when thelatter is more massive than the former. in addition, the protostellar outflowweakens and disappears in the later main accretion phase, because the outflowis powered by gas accretion onto the circumstellar disk. although thecircumstellar disk formed in a magnetized cloud is considerably smaller thanthat in an unmagnetized cloud, a circumstellar disk exceeding 100 au can formeven in a strongly magnetized cloud.

1101.1997	recurrent planet formation and intermittent protostellar outflows  induced by episodic mass accretion	the formation and evolution of a circumstellar disk in magnetized cloud coresis investigated from prestellar core stage until sim 10^4 yr after protostarformation. in the circumstellar disk, fragmentation first occurs due togravitational instability in a magnetically inactive region, andsubstellar-mass objects appear. the substellar-mass objects lose their orbitalangular momenta by gravitational interaction with the massive circumstellardisk and finally fall onto the protostar. after this fall, the circumstellardisk increases its mass by mass accretion and again induces fragmentation. theformation and falling of substellar-mass objects are repeated in thecircumstellar disk until the end of the main accretion phase. in this process,the mass of fragments remain small, because the circumstellar disk loses itsmass by fragmentation and subsequent falling of fragments before it becomesvery massive. in addition, when fragments orbit near the protostar, theydisturb the inner disk region and promote mass accretion onto the protostar.the orbital motion of substellar-mass objects clearly synchronizes with thetime variation of the accretion luminosity of the protostar. moreover, as theobjects fall, the protostar shows a strong brightening for a short duration.the intermittent protostellar outflows are also driven by the circumstellardisk whose magnetic field lines are highly tangled owing to the orbital motionof fragments. the time-variable protostellar luminosity and intermittentoutflows may be a clue for detecting planetary-mass objects in thecircumstellar disk.

1205.6217	formation of turbulent and magnetized molecular clouds via accretion  flows of hi clouds	using 3d mhd simulation with the effects of radiative cooling/heating,chemical reactions, and thermal conduction, we investigate the formation ofmolecular cloud in the ism. we consider the formation of molecular cloud byaccretion of the hi clouds as suggested in recent observations. the simulationshows that the initial hi medium is compressed and piled up behind the shockwaves induced by the accretion flows. since the initial medium is highlyinhomogeneous as a consequence of the thermal instability, the formed molecularcloud becomes very turbulent owing to the development of the richtmyer-meshkovinstability. the structure of the post shock region is composed of dense coldgas (t&lt;100 k) and diffuse warm gas (t&gt;1,000 k), which are spatially well mixedowing to the turbulence. because the energy source of the turbulence is theaccretion flows, the turbulence is highly anisotropic biased toward thedirection of accretion flows. the kinetic energy of the turbulence dominatesthe thermal, magnetic, and gravitational energies in the total 10 myrevolution. however, the kinetic energy measured by using theco-fraction-weighted density is comparable to the other energies. this suggeststhat the true kinetic energy of turbulence in molecular cloud as a hole can bemuch larger than the kinetic energy of turbulence estimated by line-width ofmolecular emissions. the clumps in the molecular cloud show statisticallyhomogeneous evolution as follows: the typical plasma beta of the clumps isroughly constant &lt;beta&gt;~ 0.4. the size-velocity dispersion relation show dv ~1.5 km s^{-1} (l/1 pc)^{0.5}, irrespective of the density. the clumps evolvetoward magnetically supercritical, gravitationally unstable cores. the clumpsseem to evolve into cores that satisfy the condition for fragmentation intobinary. these statistical properties may provide the initial condition of starformation.

1210.2508	interdependence of electric discharge and the magnetorotational  instability in protoplanetary disks	we study how the magnetorotational instability (mri) in protoplanetary disksis affected by the electric discharge caused by the electric field in theresistive mhd. we have performed three-dimensional shearing box simulationswith various values of plasma beta and electrical breakdown models. we find theself-sustainment of the mri in spite of the high resistivity. the instabilitygives rise to the large electric field that causes the electrical breakdown,and the breakdown maintains the high ionization degree required for theinstability.  the condition for this self-sustained mri is set by the balance between theenergy supply from the shearing motion and the energy consumed by the ohmicdissipation. we apply the condition to various disk models and study where theactive, self-sustained, and dead zones of mri are. in the fiducial minimum-masssolar nebula (mmsn) model, the newly-found sustained zone occupies only thelimited volume of the disk. in the late-phase gas-depleted disk models,however, the sustained zone occupies larger volume of the disk.

0801.0486	two-fluid mhd simulations of converging hi flows in the interstellar  medium. i: methodology and basic results	we develop an unconditionally stable numerical method for solving thecoupling between two fluids (frictional forces/heatings, ionization, andrecombination), and investigate the dynamical condensation process of thermallyunstable gas that is provided by the shock waves in a weakly ionized andmagnetized interstellar medium by using two-dimensional two-fluidmagnetohydrodynamical simulations. if we neglect the effect of magnetic field,it is known that condensation driven by thermal instability can generate highdensity clouds whose physical condition corresponds to molecular clouds(precursor of molecular clouds). in this paper, we study the effect of magneticfield on the evolution of supersonic converging hi flows and focus on the casein which the orientation of magnetic field to converging flows is orthogonal.we show that the magnetic pressure gradient parallel to the flows prevents theformation of high density and high column density clouds, but instead generatesfragmented, filamentary hi clouds. with this restricted geometry, magneticfield drastically diminishes the opportunity of fast molecular cloud formationdirectly from the warm neutral medium, in contrast to the case without magneticfield.

1305.3413	a semi-analytical description for the formation and gravitational  evolution of protoplanetary disks	we investigate the formation process of self-gravitating protoplanetary disksin unmagnetized molecular clouds. the angular momentum is redistributed by theaction of gravitational torques in the massive disk during its early formation.we develop a simplified one-dimensional accretion disk model that takes intoaccount the infall of gas from the envelope onto the disk and the transfer ofangular momentum in the disk with an effective viscosity. first we evaluate thegas accretion rate from the cloud core onto the disk by approximatelyestimating the effects of gas pressure and gravity acting on the cloud core. weformulate the effective viscosity as a function of the toomre q parameter thatmeasures the local gravitational stability of the rotating thin disk. we use afunction for viscosity that changes sensitively with q when the disk isgravitationally unstable. we find a strong self-regulation mechanism in thedisk evolution. during the formation stage of protoplanetary disks, theevolution of the surface density does not depend on the other details of themodeling of effective viscosity, such as the prefactor of the viscositycoefficient. next, to verify our model, we compare the time evolution of thedisk calculated with our formulation with that of three-dimensionalhydrodynamical simulations. the structures of the resultant disks from theone-dimensional accretion disk model agree well with those of thethree-dimensional simulations. our model is a useful tool for the furthermodeling of chemistry, radiative transfer, and planet formation inprotoplanetary disks.

1307.1747	conditions for circumstellar disk formation: effects of initial  conditions and sink treatment	the formation of a circumstellar disk in collapsing cloud cores isinvestigated with three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. we preparefour types of initial cloud having different density profiles and calculatetheir evolution with or without a sink. to investigate the effect of magneticdissipation on disk formation, the ohmic dissipation is considered in somemodels. calculations show that disk formation is very sensitive to both theinitial cloud configuration and the sink treatment. the disk size considerablydiffers in clouds with different density profiles even when the initial cloudshave almost the same mass-to-flux ratio. only a very small disk (\sim 10 au insize) appears in clouds with a uniform density profile, whereas a large disk(\sim 100 au in size) forms in clouds with a bonnor-ebert density profile. inaddition, a large sink accretion radius numerically impedes disk formationduring the main accretion phase and tends to foster the misleading notion thatdisk formation is completely suppressed by magnetic braking. the protostellaroutflow is also greatly affected by the sink properties. a sink accretionradius of \lesssim 1 au and sink threshold density of \gtrsim 10^ 13 cm^-3 arenecessary for investigating disk formation during the main accretion phase.

0801.3305	angular momentum accretion onto a gas giant planet	we investigate the accretion of angular momentum onto a protoplanet systemusing three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. we consider a local regionaround a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk with sufficient spatialresolution. we describe the structure of the gas flow onto and around theprotoplanet in detail. we find that the gas flows onto the protoplanet systemin the vertical direction crossing the shock front near the hill radius of theprotoplanet, which is qualitatively different from the picture established bytwo-dimensional simulations. the specific angular momentum of the gas accretedby the protoplanet system increases with the protoplanet mass. at jovian orbit,when the protoplanet mass m_p is m_p &lt; 1 m_j, where m_j is jovian mass, thespecific angular momentum increases as j \propto m_p. on the other hand, itincreases as j \propto m_p^2/3 when the protoplanet mass is m_p &gt; 1 m_j. thestronger dependence of the specific angular momentum on the protoplanet massfor m_p &lt; 1 m_j is due to thermal pressure of the gas. the estimated totalangular momentum of a system of a gas giant planet and a circumplanetary diskis two-orders of magnitude larger than those of the present gas giant planetsin the solar system. a large fraction of the total angular momentum contributesto the formation of the circumplanetary disk. we also discuss the satelliteformation from the circumplanetary disk.

1309.6916	mhd simulations of global accretion disks with vertical magnetic fields	(abridged) we report results of three dimensional mhd simulations of globalaccretion disks threaded with weak vertical magnetic fields. we perform thesimulations in the spherical coordinates with different temperature profilesand accordingly different rotation profiles. in the cases with a spatiallyconstant temperature, because the rotation frequency is vertically constant inthe equilibrium condition, general properties of the turbulence arequantitatively similar to those obtained in local shearing box simulations. onthe other hand, in the cases with a radially variable temperature profile, thevertical differential rotation, which is inevitable in the equilibriumcondition, winds up the magnetic field lines, in addition to the usual radialdifferential rotation. as a result, the coherent wound magnetic fieldscontribute to the maxwell stress in the surface regions. we obtainnondimensional density and velocity fluctuations ~0.1-0.2 at the midplane. theazimuthal power spectra of the magnetic fields show shallow slopes, ~m^0-m^{-1}, than those of velocity and density. we observe intermittent andstructured disk winds driven by the poynting flux associated with the mhdturbulence. the poynting flux originating from magnetic tension is injectedfrom the regions above a scale height towards both the midplane and thesurfaces. related to this, sound waves are directed to the midplane from thesurface regions. the mass accretion mainly occurs near the surfaces and the gasnear the midplane slowly moves outward, which causes large-scale meridionalcirculations. the vertical magnetic fields are also dragged inward in thesurface regions, while they stochastically move outward and inward around themidplane. we also discuss an observational implication of induced spiralstructure in the simulated turbulent disks to protoplanetary disks.

1309.7139	self-sustained turbulence without dynamical forcing: a two-dimensional  study of a bistable interstellar medium	in this paper, the nonlinear evolution of a bistable interstellar medium isinvestigated using two-dimensional simulations with a realistic cooling rate,thermal conduction, and physical viscosity. the calculations are performedusing periodic boundary conditions without any external dynamical forcing. asthe initial condition, a spatially uniform unstable gas under thermalequilibrium is considered. at the initial stage, the unstable gas quicklysegregates into two phases, or cold neutral medium (cnm) and warm neutralmedium (wnm). then, self-sustained turbulence with velocity dispersion of$0.1-0.2\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$ is observed in which the cnm moves around in thewnm. we find that the interfacial medium (ifm) between the cnm and wnm plays animportant role in sustaining the turbulence. the self-sustaining mechanism canbe divided into two steps. first, thermal conduction drives fast flowsstreaming into concave cnm surfaces towards the wnm. the kinetic energy of thefast flows in the ifm is incorporated into that of the cnm through the phasetransition. second, turbulence inside the cnm deforms interfaces and formsother concave cnm surfaces, leading to fast flows in the ifm. this drives thefirst step again and a cycle is established by which turbulent motions areself-sustained.

0801.4210	the formation and evolution of prestellar cores	improving our understanding of the initial conditions and earliest stages ofstar formation is crucial to gain insight into the origin of stellar masses,multiple systems, and protoplanetary disks. we review the properties oflow-mass dense cores as derived from recent millimeter/submillimeterobservations of nearby molecular clouds and discuss them in the context ofvarious contemporary scenarios for cloud core formation and evolution. none ofthe extreme scenarios can explain all observations. pure laminar ambipolardiffusion has relatively long growth times for typical ionization levels andhas difficulty satisfying core lifetime constraints. purely hydrodynamicpictures have trouble accounting for the inefficiency of core formation and thedetailed velocity structure of individual cores. a possible favorable scenariois a mixed model involving gravitational fragmentation of turbulent molecularclouds close to magnetic criticality. the evolution of the magnetic field andangular momentum in individual cloud cores after the onset of gravitationalcollapse is also discussed. in particular, we stress the importance ofradiation-magnetohydrodynamical processes and resistive mhd effects during theprotostellar phase. we also emphasize the role of the formation of theshort-lived first (protostellar) core in providing a chance forsub-fragmentation into binary systems and triggering mhd outflows. futuresubmillimeter facilities such as herschel and alma will soon provide major newobservational constraints in this field. on the theoretical side, an importantchallenge for the future will be to link the formation of molecular clouds andprestellar cores in a coherent picture.

1310.2087	crowding out of giants by dwarfs: an origin for the lack of companion  planets in hot jupiter systems	we investigate formation of close-in terrestrial planets from planetaryembryos under the influence of a hot jupiter (hj) using gravitational n-bodysimulations that include gravitational interactions between the gas disk andthe terrestrial planet (e.g., type i migration). our simulations show thatseveral terrestrial planets efficiently form outside the orbit of the hj,making a chain of planets, and all of them gravitationally interact directly orindirectly with the hj through resonance, which leads to inward migration ofthe hj. we call this mechanism of induced migration of the hj as "crowdingout." the hj is eventually lost by collision with the central star, and onlyseveral terrestrial planets remain. we also find that the efficiency of thecrowding-out effect depends on model parameters; for example, the heavier thedisk is, the more efficient the crowding out is. when planet formation occursin a massive disk, the hj can be lost to the central star and is neverobserved. on the other hand, for a less massive disk, the hj and terrestrialplanets can coexist; however, the companion planets can be below the detectionlimit of current observations. in both cases, systems with the hj andterrestrial planets have little chance for detection. therefore, our modelnaturally explains the lack of companion planets in hj systems regardless ofthe disk mass. in effect, our model provide a theoretical prediction for futureobservations; additional planets can be discovered just outside the hj, andtheir masses should generally be small.

1311.0972	atmospheric escape by magnetically driven wind from gaseous planets	we calculate the mass loss driven by mhd waves from hot jupiters by using mhdsimulations in one-dimensional flux tubes. if a gaseous planet has magneticfield, mhd waves are excited by turbulence at the surface, dissipate at theupper atmosphere, and drive gas outflows. our calculation shows that mass lossrates are comparable to the observed mass loss rates of hot jupiters, thereforeit is suggested that gas flow driven by mhd waves can plays an important rolein the mass loss from gaseous planets. the mass loss rate varies dramaticallywith radius and mass of a planet: a gaseous planet with a small mass but withinflated radius produces very large mass loss rate. we also derive ananalytical expression for the dependence of mass loss rate on planet radius andmass that is in good agreement with the numerical calculation. the mass lossrate also depends on the amplitude of velocity dispersion at the surface of aplanet. thus we expect to infer the condition of the surface and the internalstructure of a gaseous planet from future observations of mass loss rate fromvarious exoplanets.

1312.6232	from filamentary networks to dense cores in molecular clouds: toward a  new paradigm for star formation	recent studies of the nearest star-forming clouds of the galaxy atsubmillimeter wavelengths with the herschel space observatory have provided uswith unprecedented images of the initial and boundary conditions of the starformation process. the herschel results emphasize the role of interstellarfilaments in the star formation process and connect remarkably well with nearlya decade's worth of numerical simulations and theory that have consistentlyshown that the ism should be highly filamentary on all scales and starformation is intimately related to self-gravitating filaments. in this review,we trace how the apparent complexity of cloud structure and star formation isgoverned by relatively simple universal processes - from filamentary clumps togalactic scales. we emphasize two crucial and complementary aspects: (i) thekey observational results obtained with herschel over the past three years,along with relevant new results obtained from the ground on the kinematics ofinterstellar structures, and (ii) the key existing theoretical models and themany numerical simulations of interstellar cloud structure and star formation.we then synthesize a comprehensive physical picture that arises from theconfrontation of these observations and simulations.

1312.6870	two-component secular gravitational instability in a protoplanetary  disk: a possible mechanism for creating ring-like structures	the instability in protoplanetary disks due to gas-dust friction andself-gravity of gas and dust is investigated by linear analysis. in the casewhere the dust to gas ratio is enhanced and turbulence is week, the instabilitygrows, even in gravitationally stable disks, on a timescale of order $10^{4-5}$yr at a radius of order 100au. if we ignore the dynamical feedback from dustgrains in the gas equation of motion, the instability reduces to the so-called"secular gravitational instability", which was investigated previously as aninstability of dust in a fixed background gas flow. in this work, we solve theequations of motion for both gas and dust consistently and find thatlong-wavelength perturbations are stable, in contrast to the seculargravitational instability in the simplified treatment. this may indicate thatwe should not neglect small terms in equation of motion if the growth rate issmall. the instability is expected to form ring structures in protoplanetarydisks. the width of the ring formed at a radius of 100 au is a few tens of au.therefore, the instability is a candidate for the formation mechanism ofobserved ring-like structures in disks. another aspect of the instability isthe accumulation of dust grains, and hence the instability may play animportant role in the formation of planetesimals, rocky protoplanets, and coresof gas giants located at radii $\sim$100 au. if these objects survive thedispersal of the gaseous component of the disk, they may be the origin ofdebris disks.

1402.6091	on the viability of the magnetorotational instability in circumplanetary  disks	we examine whether the magnetorotational instability (mri) can serve as amechanism of angular momentum transport in circumplanetary disks. for the mrito operate the ionization degree must be sufficiently high and the magneticpressure must be sufficiently lower than the gas pressure. we calculate thespatial distribution of the ionization degree and search for the mri-activeregion where the two criteria are met. we find that there can be thin activelayers at the disk surface depending on the model parameters, however, we findhardly any region which can sustain well-developed mri turbulence; when themagnetic field is enhanced by mri turbulence at the disk surface layer, amagnetically dominated atmosphere encroaches on a lower altitude and a regionof well-developed mri turbulence becomes smaller. we conclude that if there areno angular momentum transfer mechanisms other than mri in gravitationallystable circumplanetary disks, gas is likely to pile up until disks becomegravitationally unstable, and massive disks may survive for a long time.

1404.4990	n-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation under the influence  of a hot jupiter	we investigate the formation of multiple-planet systems in the presence of ahot jupiter using extended n-body simulations that are performed simultaneouslywith semi-analytic calculations. our primary aims are to describe the planetformation process starting from planetesimals using high-resolutionsimulations, and to examine the dependences of the architecture of planetarysystems on input parameters (e.g., disk mass, disk viscosity). we observe thatprotoplanets that arise from oligarchic growth and undergo type i migrationstop migrating when they join a chain of resonant planets outside the orbit ofa hot jupiter. the formation of a resonant chain is almost independent of ourmodel parameters, and is thus a robust process. at the end of our simulations,several terrestrial planets remain at around 0.1 au. the formed planets are notequal-mass; the largest planet constitutes more than 50 percent of the totalmass in the close-in region, which is also less dependent on parameters. in theprevious work of this paper (ogihara et al. 2013), we have found a new physicalmechanism of induced migration of the hot jupiter, which is called acrowding-out. if the hot jupiter opens up a wide gap in the disk (e.g., owingto low disk viscosity), crowding-out becomes less efficient and the hot jupiterremains. we also discuss angular momentum transfer between the planets anddisk.

1404.7271	effects of radiation transfer on the structure of self-gravitating  disks, their fragmentation and evolution of the fragments	we investigate structure of self-gravitating disks, their fragmentation andevolution of the fragments (the clumps) using both analytic approach andthree-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations starting from molecularcores. the simulations show that non-local radiative transfer determines disktemperature. we find the disk structure is well described by an analyticalmodel of quasi-steady self-gravitating disk with radial radiative transfer.because the radiative process is not local and radiation from the interstellarmedium cannot be ignored, the local radiative cooling would not be balancedwith the viscous heating in a massive disk around a low mass star. in oursimulations, there are cases in which the disk does not fragment even though itsatisfies the fragmentation criterion based on disk cooling time ($q \sim 1$and $\omega t_{\rm cool}\sim 1$). this indicates that at least the criterion isnot sufficient condition for fragmentation. we determine the parameter rangefor the host cloud core in which disk fragmentation occurs. in addition, weshow that the temperature evolution of the center of the clump is close to thatof typical first cores and the minimum initial mass of clumps to be about a fewjupiter mass.

1407.8110	the nonlinear ohm's law: plasma heating by strong electric fields and  its effects on the ionization balance in protoplanetary disks	the ionization state of the gas plays a key role in the mhd of protoplanetarydisks. however, the ionization state can depend on the gas dynamics, becauseelectric fields induced by mhd turbulence can heat up plasmas and therebyaffect the ionization balance. to study this nonlinear feedback, we constructan ionization model that includes plasma heating by electric fields and impactionization by heated electrons, as well as charging of dust grains. we showthat when plasma sticking onto grains is the dominant recombination process,the electron abundance in the gas decreases with increasing electric fieldstrength. this is a natural consequence of electron-grain collisions whosefrequency increases with electron's random velocity. the decreasing electronabundance may lead to a self-regulation of mhd turbulence. in some cases, notonly the electron abundance but also the electric current decreases withincreasing field strength in a certain field range. the resulting n-shapedcurrent--field relation violates the fundamental assumption of thenon-relativistic mhd that the electric field is uniquely determined by thecurrent density. at even higher field strengths, impact ionization causes anabrupt increase of the electric current as expected by previous studies. wefind that this discharge current is multi-valued (i.e., the current--fieldrelation is s-shaped) under some circumstances, and that the intermediatebranch is unstable. the n/s-shaped current--field relations may yieldhysteresis in the evolution of mhd turbulence in some parts of protoplanetarydisks.

0705.2073	driving mechanism of jets and outflows in star formation process	the driving mechanism of jets and outflows in star formation process isstudied using resistive mhd nested grid simulations. we calculated cloudevolution from the molecular cloud core to the stellar core. in the collapsingcloud core, we found two distinct flows: low-velocity flows (sim 5 km/s) with awide opening angle, driven from the adiabatic core, and high-velocity flows(sim 30 km/s) with good collimation, driven from the protostar. high-velocityflows are enclosed by low-velocity flows after protostar formation. thedifference in the degree of collimation between the two flows is caused by thestrength of the magnetic field and configuration of the magnetic field lines.the magnetic field around an adiabatic core is strong and has an hourglassconfiguration; therefore, flows from the adiabatic core are driven mainly bythe magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guided by the hourglass-like field lines.in contrast, the magnetic field around the protostar is weak and has a straightconfiguration owing to ohmic dissipation in the high-density gas region.therefore, flows from the protostar are driven mainly by the magnetic pressuregradient force and guided by straight field lines. differing depth of thegravitational potential between the adiabatic core and the protostar cause thedifference of the flow speed. low-velocity flows correspond to the observedmolecular outflows, while high-velocity flows correspond to the observedoptical jets. we suggest that the outflow and the jet are driven by differentcores, rather than that the outflow being entrained by the jet.

1507.04677	atmospheric escape by magnetically driven wind from gaseous planets ii  --effects of magnetic diffusion--	we investigate roles of alfvenic waves in the weakly-ionized atmosphere ofhot jupiters by carrying out non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulationswith ohmic diffusion in one-dimensional magnetic flux tubes. turbulence at thesurface excites alfven waves and they propagate upward to drive hot (~ 10^4 k)outflows. the magnetic diffusion plays an important role in the dissipation ofthe alfvenic waves in the weakly ionized atmosphere of hot jupiters. themass-loss rate of the spontaneously driven planetary wind is considerablyreduced, in comparison with that obtained from ideal mhd simulations becausethe alfvenic waves are severely damped at low altitudes in the atmosphere,whereas the wave heating is still important in the heating of the upperatmosphere. dependence on the surface temperature, planetary radius, andvelocity dispersion at the surface is also investigated. we find an inversionphenomenon of the transmitted wave energy flux; the energy flux carried byalfven waves in the upper atmosphere has a nonmonotonic correlation with theinput energy flux from the surface in a certain range of the surfacetemperature because the resistivity is determined by the global physicalproperties of the atmosphere in a complicated manner. we also point out thatthe heating and mass loss are expected only in limited zones if the openmagnetic field is confined in the limited regions.

1509.03736	significant gas-to-dust ratio asymmetry and variation in the disk of hd  142527 and the indication of gas depletion	we investigate the dust and gas distribution in the disk around hd 142527based on alma observations of dust continuum, 13co(3-2), and c18o(3-2)emission. the disk shows strong azimuthal asymmetry in the dust continuumemission, while gas emission is more symmetric. in this paper, we investigatehow gas and dust are distributed in the dust-bright northern part of the diskand in the dust-faint southern part. we construct two axisymmetric disk models.one reproduces the radial profiles of the continuum and the velocity moments 0and 1 of co lines in the north and the other reproduces those in the south. wehave found that the dust is concentrated in a narrow ring having ~50au width(in fwhm; w_d=30au in our parameter definition) located at ~170-200au from thecentral star. the dust particles are strongly concentrated in the north. wehave found that the dust surface density contrast between the north and southamounts to ~70. compared to the dust, the gas distribution is more extended inthe radial direction. we find that the gas component extends at least from~100au to ~250au from the central star, and there should also be tenuous gasremaining inside and outside of these radii. the azimuthal asymmetry of gasdistribution is much smaller than dust. the gas surface density differs only bya factor of ~3-10 between the north and south. hence, gas-to-dust ratiostrongly depends on the location of the disk: ~30 at the location of the peakof dust distribution in the south and ~3 at the location of the peak of dustdistribution in the north. despite large uncertainties, the overall gas-to-dustratio is inferred to be ~10-30, indicating that the gas depletion may havealready been under way.

1511.03063	on the radius anomaly of hot jupiters: reexamination of the possibility  and impact of layered convection	observations have revealed that a significant number of hot jupiters haveanomalously large radii. layered convection induced by compositionalinhomogeneity has been proposed to account for the radius anomaly of hotjupiters. to reexamine the impact of the compositional inhomogeneity, weperform an evolutionary calculation by determining convection regime at eachevolutionary time step according to the criteria from linear analyses. it isshown that the impact is limited in the case of the monotonic gradient of heavyelement abundance. the layered convection is absent for the first 1 gyr fromthe formation of hot jupiters and instead overturning convection develops. thesuper-adiabaticity of the temperature gradient is limited by the neutrallystable state for the ledoux stability criterion. the effect of the increasedmass of heavy elements essentially compensates the effect of the delayedcontraction on the planetary radius caused by compositional inhomogeneity. inaddition, even in the case where the layered convection is artificiallyimposed, this mechanism requires extremely thin layers (~ 10^1-10^3 cm) toaccount for the observed radius anomaly. the long-term stability of such thinlayers remains to be studied. therefore, if the criteria adopted in this paperare adequate, it might be difficult to explain the inflated radii of hotjupiters by monotonic gradient of heavy element abundance alone.

astro-ph;0110125	saturation and thermalization of the magnetorotational instability:  recurrent channel flows and reconnections	the nonlinear evolution and the saturation mechanism of the magnetorotationalinstability (mri) are investigated using three-dimensional resistive mhdsimulations. a local shearing box is used for our numerical analysis and thesimulations begin with a purely vertical magnetic field. we find that themagnetic stress in the nonlinear stage of the mri is strongly fluctuating. thetime evolution shows the quasi-periodic recurrence of spike-shape variationstypically for a few orbits which correspond to the rapid amplification of themagnetic field by the nonlinear growth of a two-channel solution followed bythe decay through magnetic reconnections. the increase rate of the total energyin the shearing box system is analytically related to the volume-averagedtorque in the system. we find that at the saturated state this energy gain ofthe system is balanced with the increase of the thermal energy mostly due tothe joule heating. the spike-shape time evolution is a general feature of thenonlinear evolution of the mri in the disks threaded by vertical fields and canbe seen if the effective magnetic reynolds number is larger than about unity.

astro-ph;0302126	the field condition: a new constraint of spatial resolution in  simulations of the nonlinear development of thermal instability	we present the dynamics of a thermally bistable medium using one-dimensionalnumerical calculations, including cooling, heating, thermal conduction, andphysical viscosity.we set up a two-phase medium from a thermally unstableone-phase medium and follow its long-term evolution. to clarify the role ofthermal conduction, we compare the results of the two models, with and withoutthermal conduction. the calculations show that the thermal conduction helps togenerate the kinetic energy of translational motions of the clouds. next, wefocus on spatial resolution because we have to resolve the field length$\lambda_{\rm f}$, which is the characteristic length scale of the thermalconduction. the results show convergence only when thermal conduction isincluded and a large enough cell number is used. we find it necessary tomaintain a cell size of less than $\lambda_{\rm f}/3$ to achieve a convergedmotion in the two-phase medium. we refer to the constraint that $\lambda_{\rmf}/3$ be resolved as the ``field condition''. the inclusion of thermalconduction to satisfy the field condition is crucial to numerical studies ofthermal instability (ti) and may be important for studies of the turbulentinterstellar two-phase medium: the calculations of ti without thermalconduction may be susceptible to contamination by artificial phenomena that donot converge with increasing resolutions.

astro-ph;0312480	angular momentum transport by mhd turbulence in accretion disks: gas  pressure dependence of the saturation level of the magnetorotational  instability	the saturation level of the magnetorotational instability (mri) isinvestigated using three-dimensional mhd simulations. the shearing boxapproximation is adopted and the vertical component of gravity is ignored, sothat the evolution of the mri is followed in a small local part of the disk. wefocus on the dependence of the saturation level of the stress on the gaspressure, which is a key assumption in the standard alpha disk model. from ournumerical experiments it is found that there is a weak power-law relationbetween the saturation level of the maxwell stress and the gas pressure in thenonlinear regime; the higher the gas pressure, the larger the stress. althoughthe power-law index depends slightly on the initial field geometry, therelationship between stress and gas pressure is independent of the initialfield strength, and is unaffected by ohmic dissipation if the magnetic reynoldsnumber is at least 10. the relationship is the same in adiabatic calculations,where pressure increases over time, and nearly-isothermal calculations, wherepressure varies little with time. our numerical results are qualitativelyconsistent with an idea that the saturation level of the mri is determined by abalance between the growth of the mri and the dissipation of the field throughreconnection. the quantitative interpretation of the pressure-stress relation,however, may require advances in the theoretical understanding of non-steadymagnetic reconnection.

astro-ph;0506639	making the corona and the fast solar wind: a self-consistent simulation  for the low-frequency alfven waves from photosphere to 0.3au	we show that the coronal heating and the fast solar wind acceleration in thecoronal holes are natural consequence of the footpoint fluctuations of themagnetic fields at the photosphere, by performing one-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynamical simulation with radiative cooling and thermal conduction.we initially set up a static open flux tube with temperature 10^4k rooted atthe photosphere. we impose transverse photospheric motions corresponding to thegranulations with velocity &lt;dv&gt; = 0.7km/s and period between 20 seconds and 30minutes, which generate outgoing alfven waves. we self-consistently treat thesewaves and the plasma heating. after attenuation in the chromosphere by ~85% ofthe initial energy flux, the outgoing alfven waves enter the corona andcontribute to the heating and acceleration of the plasma mainly by thenonlinear generation of the compressive waves and shocks. our result clearlyshows that the initial cool and static atmosphere is naturally heated up to10^6k and accelerated to 800km/s.

astro-ph;0511006	solar winds driven by nonlinear low-frequency alfven waves from the  photosphere : parametric study for fast/slow winds and disappearance of solar  winds	(abridged) we investigate how the properties of the corona and solar wind inthe open coronal holes depend on the properties of the magnetic fields andtheir footpoint motions at the surface, by perfoming 1d mhd simulations fromthe photosphere to 0.3 or 0.1au. we impose low-frequency (&lt;0.05hz) transversefluctuations of the field lines at the photosphere with various amplitude,spectrum, and polarization in the open flux tubes with different photosphericfield strength, b, and super-radial expansion of the cross section, f_max. wefind that a transonic solar wind is the universal consequence. the atmosphereis also stably heated up to &gt;10^6k by the dissipation of the alfven wavesthrough compressive-wave generation and wave reflection in the case of thesufficient wave input with photospheric amplitude, &lt;dv&gt; &gt; 0.7km/s. the density,and accordingly the mass flux, of solar winds show a quite sensitive dependenceon &lt;dv&gt; because of an unstable aspect of the heating by the nonlinear alfvenwaves. a case with &lt;dv&gt;=0.4km/s gives ~50 times smaller mass flux than thefiducial case for the fast wind with &lt;dv&gt;=0.7km/s; solar wind almost disappearsonly if &lt;dv&gt; becomes half. we also find that the solar wind speed has apositive correlation with b/f_max, which is consistent with recentobservations. we finally show that both fast and slow solar winds can beexplained by the single process, the dissipation of the low-frequency alfvenwaves, with different sets of &lt;dv&gt; and b/f_max. our simulations naturallyexplain the observed (i) anticorrelation of the solar wind speed and thecoronal temperature and (ii) larger amplitude of the alfvenic fluctuations inthe fast winds. in appendix, we also explain our implementation of the outgoingboundary condition of the mhd waves with some numerical tests.

astro-ph;0603711	current advances in the methodology and computational simulation of the  formation of low-mass stars	developing a theory of low-mass star formation ($\sim 0.1$ to 3~m$_{\odot}$)remains one of the most elusive and important goals of theoreticalastrophysics. the star-formation process is the outcome of the complex dynamicsof interstellar gas involving non-linear interactions of turbulence, gravity,magnetic field and radiation. the evolution of protostellar condensations, fromthe moment they are assembled by turbulent flows to the time they reach stellardensities, spans an enormous range of scales, resulting in a majorcomputational challenge for simulations. since the previous protostars andplanets conference, dramatic advances in the development of new numericalalgorithmic techniques have been successfully implemented on large scaleparallel supercomputers. among such techniques, adaptive mesh refinement andsmooth particle hydrodynamics have provided frameworks to simulate the processof low-mass star formation with a very large dynamic range. it is now feasibleto explore the turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds and thegravitational collapse of cores into stars self-consistently within the samecalculation. the increased sophistication of these powerful methods comes withsubstantial caveats associated with the use of the techniques and theinterpretation of the numerical results. in this review, we examine what hasbeen accomplished in the field and present a critique of both numerical methodsand scientific results. we stress that computational simulations should obeythe available observational constraints and demonstrate numerical convergence.failing this, results of numerical simulations do not advance our understandingof low-mass star formation.

astro-ph;0604564	structure and stability of phase transition layers in the interstellar  medium	we analyze the structure and stability of the transition layer (or front)that connects the cold neutral medium and warm neutral medium in theplane-parallel geometry. such fronts appear in recent numerical simulations ofa thermally bistable interstellar medium. the front becomes an evaporation orcondensation front depending on the surrounding pressure. the stabilityanalysis is performed in both long- and short-wavelength approximations. wefind that the plane-parallel evaporation front is unstable under corrugationaldeformations, whereas the condensation front seems to be stable. theinstability is analogous to the darrieus-landau instability in combustionfront. the growth rate of the instability is proportional to the speed of theevaporation flow and the corrugation wavenumber for modes with wavelength muchlonger than the thickness of the front, and it is suppressed at scalesapproximately equal to the thickness of the front. the timescale of theinstability is smaller than the cooling timescale of the warm neutral medium($\sim 1$ myr), and can be as small as the cooling timescale of the coldneutral medium ($\sim 0.01-0.1$ myr). thus, this instability should be one ofthe processes for driving the interstellar turbulence.

astro-ph;0605146	the first jet in the universe: protostellar jets from the first stars	the protostellar jets driven by the formation of the first stars are studiedby using mhd nested grid simulations. starting from a slowly rotating sphericalcloud of 5.1 times 10^4 msun permeated by a uniform magnetic field, we followthe evolution from the central number density n = 10^3 cm^-3 to n simeq 10^23cm^-3. we calculate four models that differ in initial magnetic field strengthsand angular velocities. in all models, protostars of simeq 10^-3 msun areformed at n simeq 10^22 cm^-3 in accordance with one-dimensional calculations.by this epoch, the magnetic flux density is amplified by 10 orders of magnitudefrom the initial value. consequently, the formed protostar possesses themagnetic field of \sim 10^6 g that is much larger than the flux density of thepresent counterparts, reflecting the fact that the dissipation of a magneticfield is ineffective in primordial gas clouds. if the initial magnetic field b&gt; 10^-9 (n/10^3 cm^-3)^2/3 g, the protostellar jet is launched and itsvelocities reaches \sim 70 km s^-1 by the time the protostellar mass becomes(4-6) times 10^-3 msun, and a fraction (3-10%) of the accreting matter is blownoff from the central region. owing to the interaction of these ejecta withsurrounding matter, expanding bow shocks are created at both heads of the jet.if this jet continues to sweep out the surrounding gas that otherwise accretesonto the central star or circumstellar disk, the final mass of the first starcan be substantially reduced. in addition, dense post-shock regions behind thebow shocks are expected to promote the chemical reactions (formation of h_2 andhd), and this provides possible environments for subsequent low-mass starformation in the early universe.

astro-ph;0605528	nonlinear development of thermal instability without external forcing	supersonic turbulent motions are the remarkable properties of interstellarmedium. previous numerical simulations have demonstrated that the thermalinstability in a shock-compressed layer produces the supersonic turbulentmotion that does not decay. in this paper we focus on two- andthree-dimensional numerical simulations of the non-linear development of simplethermal instability incorporating physical viscosity but without any externalforcing, in order to isolate the effects of various processes responsible forthe long-lasting turbulent motion. as the initial condition for oursimulations, we set up spatially uniform gas with thermally unstabletemperature in a box with periodic boundaries. after the linear growth stage ofthe thermal instability, two-phase medium forms where cold clumps are embeddedin warm medium, and turbulent fluid flow clearly visible as translationalmotions of the cold clumps does not decay in a viscous dissipation timescale.the amplitude of the turbulent velocity increases when we reduce the prandtlnumber that is the non-dimensional ratio of kinetic viscosity to thermalconduction: the saturation amplitude does not change when we increase theviscosity and thermal conduction coefficients simultaneously in order to keepthe prandtl number. this shows that the thermal conduction plays an importantrole in maintaining turbulent motions against viscous dissipation. theamplitude also increases when we increase the ratio of the computational domainlength $l$ to the cooling length $\lambda_{\rm c}$ that is defined by theproduct of the cooling time and the sound speed, as long as $l \la 100\lambda_{\rm c}$.

0811.4528	direct simulations of particle acceleration in fluctuating  electromagnetic field across a shock	we simulate the acceleration processes of collisionless particles in a shockstructure with magnetohydrodynamical (mhd) fluctuations. the electromagneticfield is represented as a sum of mhd shock solution ($\mag_0, \ele_0$) andtorsional alfven modes spectra ($\delta \mag, \delta \ele $). we representfluctuation modes in logarithmic wavenumber space. since the electromagneticfields are represented analytically, our simulations can easily cover as largeas eight orders of magnitude in resonant frequency, and do not suffer fromspatial limitations of box size or grid spacing. we deterministically calculatethe particle trajectories under the lorenz force for time interval of up to tenyears, with a time step of $\sim 0.5 \sec$. this is sufficient to resolvelarmor frequencies without a stochastic treatment. simulations show that theefficiency of the first order fermi acceleration can be parametrized by thefluctuation amplitude $\eta \equiv &lt; \delta b^2 &gt; ^{\frac 1 2} {b_0}^{-1}$ .convergence of the numerical results is shown by increasing the number of wavemodes in fourier space while fixing $\eta$. efficiency of the first order fermiacceleration has a maximum at $ \eta \simeq 10^1$. the acceleration ratedepends on the angle between the shock normal and $\mag_0$, and is highest whenthe angle is zero. our method will provide a convenient tool for comparingcollisionless turbulence theories with, for example, observations of bipolarstructure of super nova remnants (snrs) and shell-like synchrotron-radiatingstructure.
