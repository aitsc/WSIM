0902.0363	aegis: the clustering of x-ray agn relative to galaxies at z~1	we measure the clustering of non-quasar x-ray agn at z=0.7-1.4 in the aegisfield. using the cross-correlation of 113 chandra-selected agn, with a medianlog l_x=42.8 erg s^-1, with ~5,000 deep2 galaxies, we find that the x-ray agnare fit by a power law with a clustering scale length of r_0=5.95 +/-0.90 h^-1mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. x-ray agn have a similar clustering amplitudeas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantlymore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. the x-ray agn clusteringstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; agn in red hostgalaxies are significantly more clustered than agn in blue host galaxies, witha relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue deep2 galaxies. wedetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, x-ray luminosity, orhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. we find evidence for galaxieshosting x-ray agn to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matchingjoint optical color and magnitude distributions. this implies that galaxieshosting x-ray agn are more likely to reside in groups and more massive darkmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an x-rayagn. in comparison to optically-selected quasars in the deep2 fields, we findthat x-ray agn at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (witha 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive darkmatter halos. our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasarphase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with alower-luminosity x-ray agn, if they are similar objects at differentevolutionary stages.

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0907.0231	galaxies probing galaxies: cool halo gas from a z = 0.47 post-starburst  galaxy	we study the cool gas around a galaxy at z = 0.4729 using keck/lrisspectroscopy of a bright (b = 21.7) background galaxy at z = 0.6942 at atransverse distance of 16.5/h_70 kpc. the background galaxy spectrum revealsstrong feii, mgii, mgi, and caii absorption at the redshift of the foregroundgalaxy, with a mgii 2796 rest equivalent width of 3.93 +/- 0.08 angstroms,indicative of a velocity width exceeding 400 km/s. because the backgroundgalaxy is large (&gt; 4/h_70 kpc), the high covering fraction of the absorbing gassuggests that it arises in a spatially extended complex of cool clouds withlarge velocity dispersion. spectroscopy of the massive (log m_*/m_sun = 11.15+/- 0.08) host galaxy reveals that it experienced a burst of star formationabout 1 gyr ago and that it harbors a weak agn. we discuss the possible originsof the cool gas in its halo, including multiphase cooling of hot halo gas, coldinflow, tidal interactions, and galactic winds. we conclude the absorbing gaswas most likely ejected or tidally stripped from the interstellar medium of thehost galaxy or its progenitors during the past starburst event. adopting thelatter interpretation, these results place one of only a few constraints on theradial extent of cool gas driven or stripped from a galaxy in the distantuniverse. future studies with integral field unit spectroscopy of spatiallyextended background galaxies will provide multiple sightlines throughforeground absorbers and permit analysis of the morphology and kinematics ofthe gas surrounding galaxies with a diverse set of properties and environments.

0907.4380	dynamics of lyman break galaxies and their host halos	we present deep two-dimensional spectra of 22 candidate and confirmed lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;4 in the hubble deep field (hdf)obtained at the keck ii telescope. the targets were preferentially selectedwith spatial extent and/or multiple knot morphologies, and we used slitmasksand individual slits tilted to optimize measurement of any spatially resolvedkinematics. the median target magnitude was i_814=25.3, and total exposuretimes ranged from 10 to 50 ks. we measure redshifts, some new, ranging fromz=0.2072 to z=4.056, including two interlopers at z&lt;1, and resulting in asample of 14 lbgs with a median redshift z=2.424. the morphologies andkinematics of the close pairs and multiple knot sources in our sample aregenerally inconsistent with galaxy formation scenarios postulating that lbgsoccur only at the bottom of the potential wells of massive host halos; rather,they support ``collisional starburst'' models with significant major mergerrates and a broad halo occupation distribution. for 13 lbgs with possiblekinematic signatures, we estimate simple dynamical masses ranging from 4e9 h^-1m_sun to 1.1e11 h^-1 m_sun for individual galaxies and from &lt;10e10 h^-1 to~10^14 h^-1 m_sun with a median value 1e13 h^-1 m_sun for host dark matterhalos. comparison with a recent numerical galaxy formation model implies thatthe pairwise velocities might not reflect true dynamical masses. we compare ourdynamical mass estimates directly to stellar masses and find no evidence for astrong correlation. the diversity of morphologies and dynamics implies thatlbgs represent a broad range of galaxy or proto-galaxy types in a variety ofevolutionary or merger stages rather than a uniform class with a narrow rangeof mass.

0912.2343	the persistence of cool galactic winds in high stellar mass galaxies  between z~1.4 and ~1	we present an analysis of the mgii 2796, 2803 and feii 2586, 2600 absorptionline profiles in coadded spectra of 468 galaxies at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. the galaxysample, drawn from the team keck treasury redshift survey of the goods-n field,has a range in stellar mass (m_*) comparable to that of the sample at z~1.4analyzed in a similar manner by weiner et al. (2009; w09), but extends to lowerredshifts and has specific star formation rates which are lower by ~0.6 dex. weidentify outflows of cool gas from the doppler shift of the mgii absorptionlines and find that the equivalent width (ew) of absorption due to outflowinggas increases on average with m_* and star formation rate (sfr). we attributethe large ews measured in spectra of the more massive, higher-sfr galaxies tooptically thick absorbing clouds having large velocity widths. the outflowshave hydrogen column densities n(h) &gt; 10^19.3 cm^-2, and extend to velocitiesof ~500 km/s. while galaxies with sfr &gt; 10 msun/yr host strong outflows in boththis and the w09 sample, we do not detect outflows in lower-sfr (i.e., logm_*/msun &lt; 10.5) galaxies at lower redshifts. using a simple galaxy evolutionmodel which assumes exponentially declining sfrs, we infer that strong outflowspersist in galaxies with log m_*/msun &gt; 10.5 as they age between z=1.4 and z~1,presumably because of their high absolute sfrs. finally, using high resolutionhst/acs imaging in tandem with our spectral analysis, we find evidence for aweak trend (at 1 sigma significance) of increasing outflow absorption strengthwith increasing galaxy sfr surface density.

1001.4560	where do wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers occur? a study of the  environments of close galaxy pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey	we study the environment of wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers at 0.75 &lt; z &lt;1.2 using close pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that thetypical environment of mixed and dry merger candidates is denser than that ofwet mergers, mostly due to the color-density relation. while the galaxycompanion rate (nc) is observed to increase with overdensity, using n-bodysimulations we find that the fraction of pairs that will eventually mergedecreases with the local density, predominantly because interlopers are morecommon in dense environments. after taking into account the merger probabilityof pairs as a function of local density, we find only marginal environmentdependence of the fractional merger rate for wet mergers over the redshiftrange we have probed. on the other hand, the fractional dry merger rateincreases rapidly with local density due to the increased population of redgalaxies in dense environments. we also find that the environment distributionof k+a galaxies is similar to that of wet mergers alone and of wet+mixedmergers, suggesting a possible connection between k+a galaxies and wet and/orwet+mixed mergers. we conclude that, as early as z ~ 1, high-density regionsare the preferred environment in which dry mergers occur, and that present-dayred-sequence galaxies in overdense environments have, on average, undergone1.2+-0.3 dry mergers since this time, accounting for (38+-10)% of their massaccretion in the last 8 billion years. our findings suggest that dry mergersare crucial in the mass-assembly of massive red galaxies in dense environments,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in galaxy groups and clusters.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1008.3397	low-ionization line emission from starburst galaxies: a new probe of  galactic-scale outflows	we study the kinematically narrow, low-ionization line emission from abright, starburst galaxy at z = 0.69 using slit spectroscopy obtained withkeck/lris. the spectrum reveals strong absorption in mgii and feii resonancetransitions with doppler shifts of -200 to -300 km/s, indicating a cool gasoutflow. emission in mgii near and redward of systemic velocity, in concertwith the observed absorption, yields a p cygni-like line profile similar tothose observed in the ly alpha transition in lyman break galaxies. further, themgii emission is spatially resolved, and extends significantly beyond theemission from stars and hii regions within the galaxy. assuming the emissionhas a simple, symmetric surface brightness profile, we find that the gasextends to distances &gt; ~7 kpc. we also detect several narrow feii*fine-structure lines in emission near the systemic velocity, arising fromenergy levels which are radiatively excited directly from the ground state. wesuggest that the mgii and feii* emission is generated by photon scattering inthe observed outflow, and emphasize that this emission is a generic predictionof outflows. these observations provide the first direct constraints on theminimum spatial extent and morphology of the wind from a distant galaxy.estimates of these parameters are crucial for understanding the impact ofoutflows in driving galaxy evolution.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1110.4057	goods-herschel and candels: the morphologies of ultraluminous infrared  galaxies at z~2	using deep 100-160 micron observations in goods-s from the goods-h survey,combined with hst/wfc3 nir imaging from candels, we present the firstmorphological analysis of a complete, fir selected sample of 52 ulirgs at z~2.we also make use of a comparison sample of galaxies without herschel detectionsbut with the same z and magnitude distribution. our visual classifications ofthese two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroidmorphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ulirgs. the combination of diskand irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactionsand minor mergers could play an important role in ulirgs at z~2. we comparethese fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range andfind that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with l_ir while thefraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.at comparable luminosities, the fraction of ulirgs with various morphologicalclassifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. we investigate the position of theulirgs, along with 70 lirgs, on the specific star formation rate versusredshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (lie more than a factor of3 above the main sequence relation). the morphologies of starbursts aredominated by interacting and merging systems (50%). if irregular disks areincluded as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starburstsare involved in a merger or interaction at some level. although the finalcoalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities ofulirgs at z~2 as is the case locally, the large fraction of interactions at allstages and potential minor mergers suggest that the high star formation ratesof ulirgs are still largely externally triggered at z~2.

1111.2135	clustering properties of bzk-selected galaxies in goods-n: environmental  quenching and triggering of star formation at z ~ 2	using a sample of bzk-selected galaxies at z~2 identified from thecfht/wircam near-infrared survey of goods-north, we discuss the relationbetween star formation rate (sfr), specific star formation rate (ssfr), andstellar mass (m_{*}), and the clustering of galaxies as a function of theseparameters. for star-forming galaxies (sbzks), the uv-based sfr, corrected forextinction, scales with the stellar mass as sfr ~ m_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =0.74+/-0.20 down to m_{*} ~ 10^{9} m_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence onthe stellar mass of the ssfr. we also measure the angular correlation functionand hence infer the correlation length for sbzk galaxies as a function ofm_{*}, sfr, and ssfr, as well as k-band apparent magnitude. we show thatpassive galaxies (pbzks) are more strongly clustered than sbzk galaxies at agiven stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lowerredshifts. we also find that the correlation length of sbzk galaxies rangesfrom 4 to 20 h^{-1}mpc, being a strong function of m_{k}, m_{*}, and sfr. onthe other hand, the clustering dependence on ssfr changes abruptly at 2x10^{-9}yr^{-1}, which is the typical value for "main sequence" star-forming galaxiesat z~2. we show that the correlation length reaches a minimum at thischaracteristic value, and is larger for galaxies with both smaller and largerssfrs; a dichotomy that is only marginally implied from the predictions of thesemi-analytical models. our results suggest that there are two types ofenvironmental effects at work at z~2. stronger clustering for relativelyquiescent galaxies implies that the environment has started to play a role inquenching star formation. at the same time, stronger clustering for galaxieswith elevated ssfrs ("starbursts") might be attributed to an increasedefficiency for galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments.

1201.1677	the swells survey. iii. disfavouring "heavy" initial mass functions for  spiral lens galaxies	we present gravitational lens models for 20 strong gravitational lens systemsobserved as part of the sloan wfc edge-on late-type lens survey (swells)project. fifteen of the lenses are taken from paper i while five are newlydiscovered systems. the systems are galaxy-galaxy lenses where the foregrounddeflector has an inclined disc, with a wide range of morphological types, fromlate-type spiral to lenticular. for each system, we compare the total massinside the critical curve inferred from gravitational lens modelling to thestellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis (sps) models, computingthe stellar mass fraction f* = m(sps)/m(lens). we find that, for the lower massswells systems, adoption of a salpeter stellar initial mass function (imf)leads to estimates of f* that exceed 1. this is unphysical, and provides strongevidence against the salpeter imf being valid for these systems. taking thelower mass end of the swells sample sigma(sie) &lt; 230 km/s, we find that the imfis lighter (in terms of stellar mass-to-light ratio) than salpeter with 98%probability, and consistent with the chabrier imf and imfs between the two.this result is consistent with previous studies of spiral galaxies based onindependent techniques. in combination with recent studies of massiveearly-type galaxies that have favoured a heavier salpeter-like imf, this resultstrengthens the evidence against a universal stellar imf.

1201.1692	the swells survey. iv. precision measurements of the stellar and dark  matter distributions in a spiral lens galaxy	we construct a fully self-consistent mass model for the lens galaxy j2141 atz=0.14, and use it to improve on previous studies by modelling itsgravitational lensing effect, gas rotation curve and stellar kinematicssimultaneously. we adopt a very flexible axisymmetric mass model constituted bya generalized nfw dark matter halo and a stellar mass distribution obtained bydeprojecting the mge fit to the high-resolution k'-band lgsao imaging data ofthe galaxy, with the (spatially constant) m/l ratio as a free parameter. wemodel the stellar kinematics by solving the anisotropic jeans equations. wefind that the inner logarithmic slope of the dark halo is weakly constrained(gamma = 0.82^{+0.65}_{-0.54}), and consistent with an unmodified nfw profile.we infer the galaxy to have (i) a dark matter fraction within 2.2 disk radii of0.28^{+0.15}_{-0.10}, independent of the galaxy stellar population, implying amaximal disk for j2141; (ii) an apparently uncontracted dark matter halo, withconcentration c_{-2} = 7.7_{-2.5}^{+4.2} and virial velocity v_{vir} =242_{-39}^{+44} km/s, consistent with lcdm predictions; (iii) a slightly oblatehalo (q_h = 0.75^{+0.27}_{-0.16}), consistent with predictions frombaryon-affected models. comparing the stellar mass inferred from the combinedanalysis (log_{10} mstar/msun = 11.12_{-0.09}^{+0.05}) with that inferred fromsps modelling of the galaxies colours, and accounting for a cold gas fractionof 20+/-10%, we determine a preference for a chabrier imf over salpeter imf bya bayes factor of 5.7 (substantial evidence). we infer a value beta_{z} = 1 -sigma^2_{z}/sigma^2_{r} = 0.43_{-0.11}^{+0.08} for the orbital anisotropyparameter in the meridional plane, in agreement with most studies of local diskgalaxies, and ruling out at 99% cl that the dynamics of this system can bedescribed by a two-integral distribution function.

1203.1625	dependence of galaxy quenching on halo mass and distance from its centre	we study the dependence of star-formation quenching on galaxy mass andenvironment, in the sdss (z~0.1) and the aegis (z~1). it is crucial that wedefine quenching by low star-formation rate rather than by red colour, giventhat one third of the red galaxies are star forming. we address stellar massm*, halo mass mh, density over the nearest n neighbours deltan, and distance tothe halo centre d. the fraction of quenched galaxies appears more stronglycorrelated with mh at fixed m* than with m* at fixed mh, while for satellitesquenching also depends on d. we present the m*-mh relation for centrals at z~1.at z~1, the dependence of quenching on m* at fixed mh is somewhat morepronounced than at z~0, but the quenched fraction is low (10%) and the haloesare less massive. for satellites, m*-dependent quenching is noticeable at highd, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently capturedsatellites. at small d, where satellites likely fell in more than a few gyrago, quenching strongly depends on mh, and not on m*. the mh-dependence ofquenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating inmassive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping,causing quenching. the interpretation of deltan is complicated by the fact thatit depends on the number of observed group members compared to n, motivatingthe use of d as a better measure of local environment.

1203.3192	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: design, observations, data reduction,  and redshifts	we describe the design and data sample from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey,the densest and largest precision-redshift survey of galaxies at z ~ 1completed to date. the survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massivegalaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down toabsolute magnitude m_b = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on thedeimos spectrograph at keck observatory. deep2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude ofr_ab=24.1. objects with z &lt; 0.7 are rejected based on bri photometry in threeof the four deep2 fields, allowing galaxies with z &gt; 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. approximatelysixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. most of thetargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z~ 1.45. the deimos 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers highspectral resolution (r~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and uniqueinternal kinematic information. extensive ancillary data are available in thedeep2 fields, particularly in the extended groth strip, which has evolved intoone of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. deep2 surpasses otherdeep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshiftaccuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. we alsoprovide an overview of the scientific highlights of the deep2 survey thus far.this paper is intended as a handbook for users of the deep2 data release 4,which includes all deep2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for thepublicly-available deep2 deimos data reduction pipelines.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1210.4173	the dependence of quenching upon the inner structure of galaxies at  0.5&lt;z&lt; 0.8 in the deep2/aegis survey	the shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'.although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exactmechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.this paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenchingprocesses through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surfacestellar mass density and sersic index (n). we analyze the rest-frame u-b colorcorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies inthe redshift range 0.5&lt; z&lt;0.8 from the deep2/aegis survey. we find that sersicindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters andresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. there exists,however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. we hypothesize that their sersicvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, agns, and/or poor fits,leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternativeto sersic index. not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tightrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies ismost physically linked with quenching. furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority ofthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since theirgim2d bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses ofsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass mustabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. we discuss atwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates arecontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and asecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellarmass build-up.

1212.0544	a census of broad-line active galactic nuclei in nearby galaxies: coeval  star formation and rapid black hole growth	we present the first quantified, statistical map of broad-line activegalactic nucleus (agn) frequency with host galaxy color and stellar mass innearby (0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.11) galaxies. aperture photometry and z-band concentrationmeasurements from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) are used to dis- entangleagn and galaxy emission, resulting in estimates of uncontaminated galaxyrest-frame color, luminosity, and stellar mass. broad-line agns are distributedthroughout the blue cloud and green valley at a given stellar mass, and aremuch rarer in quiescent (red sequence) galaxies. this is in contrast to thepublished host galaxy properties of weaker narrow-line agns, indicating thatbroad-line agns occur during a different phase in galaxy evolution. moreluminous broad-line agns have bluer host galaxies, even at fixed mass,suggesting that the same processes that fuel nuclear activity also efficientlyform stars. the data favor processes that simultaneously fuel both starformation activity and rapid supermassive black hole accretion. if agns causefeedback on their host galaxies in the nearby universe, the evidence ofgalaxy-wide quenching must be delayed until after the broad-line agn phase.

1212.2218	testing diagnostics of nuclear activity and star formation in galaxies  at z&gt;1	we present some of the first science data with the new keck/mosfireinstrument to test the effectiveness of different agn/sf diagnostics at z~1.5.mosfire spectra were obtained in three h-band multi-slit masks in the goods-sfield, resulting in two hour exposures of 36 emission-line galaxies. we comparex-ray data with the traditional emission-line ratio diagnostics and thealternative mass-excitation and color-excitation diagrams, combining newmosfire infrared data with previous hst/wfc3 infrared spectra (from the 3d-hstsurvey) and multiwavelength photometry. we demonstrate that a high [oiii]/hbratio is insufficient as an agn indicator at z&gt;1. for the four x-ray detectedgalaxies, the classic diagnostics ([oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha and [sii]/ha) remainconsistent with x-ray agn/sf classification. the x-ray data also suggest that"composite" galaxies (with intermediate agn/sf classification) host bona-fideagns. nearly 2/3 of the z~1.5 emission-line galaxies have nuclear activitydetected by either x-rays or the classic diagnostics. compared to the x-ray andline ratio classifications, the mass-excitation method remains effective atz&gt;1, but we show that the color-excitation method requires a new calibration tosuccessfully identify agns at these redshifts.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

1305.0607	candels observations of the environmental dependence of the  color-mass-morphology relation at z = 1.6	we study the environmental dependence of color, stellar mass, and morphologyby comparing galaxies in a forming cluster to those in the field at z = 1:6with hubble space telescope near-infrared imaging in the candels/uds field. wequantify the morphology of the galaxies using the effective radius, reff, ands\'ersic index, n. in both the cluster and field, approximately half of thebulge-dominated galaxies (n &gt; 2) reside on the red sequence of thecolor-magnitude diagram, and most disk-dominated galaxies (n &lt; 2) have colorsexpected for star-forming galaxies. there is weak evidence that clustergalaxies have redder rest-frame u - b colors and higher stellar masses comparedto the field. star-forming galaxies in both the cluster and field show nosignificant differences in their morphologies. in contrast, there is evidencethat quiescent galaxies in the cluster have larger median effective radii andsmaller s\'ersic indices compared to the field with a significance of 2?. thesedifferences are most pronounced for galaxies at clustercentric distances 1 mpc&lt; rproj &lt; 1.5 mpc, which have low s\'ersic indices and possibly largereffective radii, more consistent with star-forming galaxies at this epoch andin contrast to other quiescent galaxies. we argue that star-forming galaxiesare processed under the influence of the cluster environment at distancesgreater than the cluster-halo virial radius. our results are consistent withmodels where gas accretion onto these galaxies is suppressed from processesassociated with the cluster environment.

1308.4405	candels multi-wavelength catalogs: source detection and photometry in  the goods-south field	we present a uv-to-mid infrared multi-wavelength catalog in thecandels/goods-s field, combining the newly obtained candels hst/wfc3 f105w,f125w, and f160w data with existing public data. the catalog is based on sourcedetection in the wfc3 f160w band. the f160w mosaic includes the data fromcandels deep and wide observations as well as previous ers and hudf09 programs.the mosaic reaches a 5$\sigma$ limiting depth (within an aperture of radius0.17 arcsec) of 27.4, 28.2, and 29.7 ab for candels wide, deep, and hudfregions, respectively. the catalog contains 34930 sources with therepresentative 50% completeness reaching 25.9, 26.6, and 28.1 ab in the f160wband for the three regions. in addition to wfc3 bands, the catalog alsoincludes data from uv (u-band from both ctio/mosaic and vlt/vimos), optical(hst/acs f435w, f606w, f775w, f814w, and f850lp), and infrared (hst/wfc3 f098m,vlt/isaac ks, vlt/hawk-i ks, and spitzer/irac 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 $\mu$m)observations. the catalog is validated via stellar colors, comparison withother published catalogs, zeropoint offsets determined from the best-fittemplates of the spectral energy distribution of spectroscopically observedobjects, and the accuracy of photometric redshifts. the catalog is able todetect unreddened star-forming (passive) galaxies with stellar mass of10^{10}m_\odot at a 50% completeness level to z$\sim$3.4 (2.8), 4.6 (3.2), and7.0 (4.2) in the three regions. as an example of application, the catalog isused to select both star-forming and passive galaxies at z$\sim$2--4 via thebalmer break. it is also used to study the color--magnitude diagram of galaxiesat 0&lt;z&lt;4.

1308.5224	a link between star formation quenching and inner stellar mass density  in sdss central galaxies	we study the correlation between galaxy structure and the quenching of starformation using a sample of sdss central galaxies with stellar masses 9.75&lt; logm_*/m_sun&lt;11.25 and redshifts z&lt;0.075. galex uv data are used to cleanly dividethe sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies, and to identify galaxies intransition (the green valley). despite a stark difference in visual appearancebetween blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass densityprofiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixedmass. the inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc,\sigma_1, is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. whengalaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in thecolor-\sigma_1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks.\sigma_1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once itcrosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed \sigma_1. the\sigma_1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, \sigma_1 ~m_*^{0.64}. however, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above thethreshold \sigma_1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficientto quench a galaxy fully. this would be consistent with a two-step quenchingprocess in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against starformation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, agn feedback, ormorphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed byseparate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). quenching thusdepends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and itssurrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the twocould produce the observed scatter in color vs. \sigma_1.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

0705.0660	hudf-jd2: mid-infrared evidence for a z~2 luminous infrared galaxy	the hubble ultra deep field source jd2 presented in mobasher et al. (2005) isan unusual galaxy that is very faint at all wavelengths shortward of 1.1micron. photometric redshift fits to data at 0.4 to 8 microns yield asignificant probability that it is an extremely massive galaxy at z~6.5. inthis paper we present new photometry at 16 microns and 22 micron from spitzerinfrared spectrograph (irs) peak-up imaging of the great observatories originsdeep survey (goods) fields. we find that the spectral energy distribution showsa factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micronbandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands. theflux ratio between these bandpasses can be best fit by a z~1.7 luminousinfrared galaxy with a bolometric luminosity of (2-6)\times10^{11} l_suncorresponding to a star-formation rate of 80 m_sun/yr. the predicted fluxdensity values at other longer wavelengths are below the detection limits ofcurrent instrumentation but such sources could potentially be detected inlensed submillimeter surveys. re-evaluation of the optical/near-infraredphotometry continues to favor z&gt;6 photometric redshift solutions, but we arguethat the consistency of the multiwavelength parameters of this galaxy withother dusty starbursts favor the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift. thedata presented here provide evidence that optically undetected near-infraredsources which are detected at 24 microns are most likely dusty, starburstgalaxies at a redshift of z~2 with stellar masses &gt;10^{10} m_sun.

1310.2941	galaxy zoo: observing secular evolution through bars	in this paper, we use the galaxy zoo 2 dataset to study the behavior of barsin disk galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate (ssfr), andbulge prominence. our sample consists of 13,295 disk galaxies, with an overall(strong) bar fraction of $23.6\pm 0.4\%$, of which 1,154 barred galaxies alsohave bar length measurements. these samples are the largest ever used to studythe role of bars in galaxy evolution. we find that the likelihood of a galaxyhosting a bar is anti-correlated with ssfr, regardless of stellar mass or bulgeprominence. we find that the trends of bar likelihood and bar length with bulgeprominence are bimodal with ssfr. we interpret these observations usingstate-of-the-art simulations of bar evolution which include live halos and theeffects of gas and star formation. we suggest our observed trends of barlikelihood with ssfr are driven by the gas fraction of the disks; a factordemonstrated to significantly retard both bar formation and evolution inmodels. we interpret the bimodal relationship between bulge prominence and barproperties as due to the complicated effects of classical bulges and centralmass concentrations on bar evolution, and also to the growth of diskypseudobulges by bar evolution. these results represent empirical evidence forsecular evolution driven by bars in disk galaxies. this work suggests that barsare not stagnant structures within disk galaxies, but are a criticalevolutionary driver of their host galaxies in the local universe ($z&lt;1$).

1310.3819	the progenitors of the compact early-type galaxies at high-redshift	we use goods and candels images to identify progenitors of massive (log m &gt;10 msun) compact "early-type" galaxies (etgs) at z~1.6. since merging andaccretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if theprogenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compactthemselves. we select candidate progenitors among compact lyman-break galaxiesat z~3 based on their mass, sfr and central stellar density and find that theseaccount for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact etgs at z~1.6. wefind that the average far-uv sed of the candidates is redder than that of thenon-candidates, but the optical and mid-ir sed are the same, implying that theredder uv of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration, andconsistent with more evolved (aging) star-formation. this is in line with otherevidence that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity amonghigh-redshift massive galaxies. we also find that the light distribution ofboth the compact etgs and their candidate progenitors does not show anyextended "halos" surrounding the compact "core", both in individual images andin stacks. we argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology ofmerger remnants, even if gas-rich, as predicted by n-body simulations. thissuggests that the compact etgs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseousaccretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected inthe hst images, with their stellar mass assembling in-situ, and that they havenot experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z~1.6.

1312.3233	a comparison between semi-analytic model predictions for the candels  survey	we compare the predictions of three independently developed semi-analyticgalaxy formation models that are being used to aid in the interpretation ofresults from the candels survey. these models are each applied to the same setof halo merger trees extracted from the "bolshoi" simulation and are carefullytuned to match the local galaxy stellar mass function using the powerful methodof bayesian inference coupled with mcmc or by hand. the comparisons reveal thatin spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formationand feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similarpredictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and starformation over cosmic time. we show that the sams generally require strongoutflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present daystellar mass function. however, all of the models considered producepredictions for the star formation rates and metallicities of low-mass galaxiesthat are inconsistent with existing data and diverge between the models. wesuggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and smalldifferences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem fromdifferent assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor. importantly, whilemore accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, sfr and metallicityof galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;5 will discriminate between models, the discrepanciesbetween the models and existing data of these observables have already revealedchallenging problems in understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxyformation. the three sets of models are being used to construct catalogs ofmock galaxies on light cones that have the same geometry as the candels survey,which should be particularly useful for quantifying the biases anduncertainties on measurements and inferences from the real observations.-abridged

1405.5266	star formation and clumps in cosmological galaxy simulations with  radiation pressure feedback	cosmological simulations of galaxies have typically produced too many starsat early times. we study the global and morphological effects of radiationpressure (rp) in eight pairs of high-resolution cosmological galaxy formationsimulations. we find that the additional feedback suppresses star formationglobally by a factor of ~2. despite this reduction, the simulations stilloverproduce stars by a factor of ~2 with respect to the predictions provided byabundance matching methods for halos more massive than 5e11 msun/h (behroozi,wechsler &amp; conroy 2013).  we also study the morphological impact of radiation pressure on oursimulations. in simulations with rp the average number of low mass clumps fallsdramatically. only clumps with stellar masses mclump/mdisk &lt;= 5% are impactedby the inclusion of rp, and rp and no-rp clump counts above this range arecomparable. the inclusion of rp depresses the contrast ratios of clumps byfactors of a few for clump masses less than 5% of the disk masses. for moremassive clumps, the differences between and rp and no-rp simulations diminish.we note however, that the simulations analyzed have disk stellar masses belowabout 2e10 msun/h.  by creating mock hubble space telescope observations we find that the numberof clumps is slightly reduced in simulations with rp. however, since massiveclumps survive the inclusion of rp and are found in our mock observations, wedo not find a disagreement between simulations of our clumpy galaxies andobservations of clumpy galaxies. we demonstrate that clumps found in any singlegas, stellar, or mock observation image are not necessarily clumps found inanother map, and that there are few clumps common to multiple maps.

1406.3351	the nature of extreme emission line galaxies at z=1-2: kinematics and  metallicities from near-infrared spectroscopy	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 22 extreme emission linegalaxies at redshifts 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.3, confirming that these are low-mass (m* =10^8 - 10^9 m_sun) galaxies undergoing intense starburst episodes (m*/sfr ~10-100 myr). the sample is selected by [o iii] or h{\alpha} emission line fluxand equivalent width using near-infrared grism spectroscopy from the 3d-hstsurvey. high-resolution nir spectroscopy is obtained with lbt/luci andvlt/x-shooter. the [o iii]/h{\beta} line ratio is high (&gt; 5) and [nii]/h{\alpha} is always significantly below unity, which suggests a lowgas-phase metallicity. we are able to determine gas-phase metallicities for 7of our objects using various strong-line methods, with values in the range0.05-0.30 z_sun and with a median of 0.15 z_sun; for 3 of these objects wedetect [o iii]{\lambda}4363 which allows for a direct constraint on themetallicity. the velocity dispersion, as measured from the nebular emissionlines, is typically ~50 km/s. combined with the observed star-forming activity,the jeans and toomre stability criteria imply that the gas fraction must belarge (&gt; 2/3), consistent with the difference between our dynamical and stellarmass estimates. the implied gas depletion time scale (several hundred myr) issubstantially longer than the inferred mass-weighted ages (~50 myr), whichfurther supports the emerging picture that most stars in low-mass galaxies formin short, intense bursts of star formation.

1406.5372	two conditions for galaxy quenching: compact centres and massive haloes	we investigate the roles of two classes of quenching mechanisms for centraland satellite galaxies in the sdss ($z&lt;0.075$): those involving the halo andthose involving the formation of a compact centre. for central galaxies withinner compactness $\sigma_{\rm 1kpc} \sim 10^{9-9.4}m_{\odot} {\rm kpc}^{-2}$,the quenched fraction $f_{q}$ is strongly correlated with $\sigma_{\rm 1kpc}$with only weak halo mass $m_{\rm h}$ dependence. however, at higher and lower$\sigma_{\rm 1kpc}$, ssfr is a strong function of $m_{\rm h}$ and mostlyindependent of $\sigma_{\rm 1kpc}$. in other words, $\sigma_{\rm 1kpc} \sim10^{9-9.4} m_{\odot} {\rm kpc}^{-2}$ divides galaxies into those with high ssfrbelow and low ssfr above this range. in both the upper and lower regimes,increasing $m_{\rm h}$ shifts the entire ssfr distribtuion to lower ssfrwithout a qualitative change in shape. this is true even at fixed $m_{*}$, butvarying $m_{*}$ at fixed $m_{\rm h}$ adds no quenching information. most of thequenched centrals with $m_{\rm h} &gt; 10^{11.8}m_{\odot}$ are dense ($\sigma_{\rm1kpc} &gt; 10^{9}~ m_{\odot} {\rm kpc}^{-2}$), suggesting compaction-relatedquenching maintained by halo-related quenching. however, 21% are diffuse,indicating only halo quenching. for satellite galaxies in the outskirts ofhalos, quenching is a strong function of compactness and a weak function ofhost $m_{\rm h}$. in the inner halo, $m_{\rm h}$ dominates quenching, with$\sim 90\%$ of the satellites being quenched once $m_{\rm h} &gt;10^{13}m_{\odot}$. this regional effect is greatest for the least massivesatellites. as demonstrated via semi-analytic modelling with simpleprescriptions for quenching, the observed correlations can be explained ifquenching due to central compactness is rapid while quenching due to halo massis slow.

1406.6056	the distribution of satellites around massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  zfourge/candels: dependence on star formation activity	we study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming andquiescent central galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 using imaging from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey (zfourge) and the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the deep near-ir data select satellites down to$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;9$ at z&lt;3. the radial satellite distribution around centralsis consistent with a projected nfw profile. massive quiescent centrals,$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.78$, have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites comparedto star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even afteraccounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. we findno statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-massquiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48&lt;\log(m/m_\odot)&lt;10.78$. comparingto the guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicatesthat quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-formingcentrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. we use a simpletoy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces theobserved quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass betweenstar-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenchingprobability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for$\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$13.5. a singlehalo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction andsatellite distribution of centrals. therefore, while halo quenching may be animportant mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. itremains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even inrelatively massive halos.

1407.1834	the interstellar medium and feedback in the progenitors of the compact  passive galaxies at z~2	quenched galaxies at z&gt;2 are nearly all very compact relative to z~0,suggesting a physical connection between high stellar density and efficient,rapid cessation of star-formation. we present restframe uv spectra oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors ofquenched galaxies at z~2 based on their compact restframe optical sizes andhigh surface density of star-formation. we compare their uv properties to thoseof more extended lbgs of similar mass and star formation rate (non-candidates).we find that candidate progenitors have faster ism gas velocities and higherequivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocityspread among absorbing clouds. candidates deviate from the relationship betweenequivalent widths of lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption lines in thattheir lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,possibly indicating that the neutral hi fraction is patchy such thatlyman-alpha photons can escape. we detect stronger civ p-cygni features(emission and absorption) and heii emission in candidates, indicative of largerpopulations of metal rich wolf-rayet stars compared to non-candidates. thefaster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and lyman-alpha propertiesof candidates are consistent with their ism being subject to more energeticfeedback than non-candidates. together with their larger metallicity (implyingmore evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, ifspeculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates,supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them asprogenitors of z~2 passive galaxies. we propose that massive, compact galaxiesundergo more rapid growth of stellar mass content, perhaps because the gasaccretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized lbgsat these early epochs.

1407.3834	from starburst to quiescence: testing agn feedback in rapidly quenching  post-starburst galaxies	post-starbursts are galaxies in transition from the blue cloud to the redsequence. although they are rare today, integrated over time they may be animportant pathway to the red sequence. this work uses sdss, galex, and wiseobservations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fullyquenched post-starbursts in the narrow mass range $\log m(m_\odot) =10.3-10.7$, and identifies "transiting" post-starbursts which are intermediatebetween these two populations. in this mass range, $\sim 0.3\%$ of galaxies arestarbursts, $\sim 0.1\%$ are quenched post-starbursts, and $\sim 0.5\%$ are thetransiting types in between. the transiting post-starbursts have stellarproperties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphologicalcharacteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. the agnfraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts isabout 3 times higher ($\gtrsim 36 \pm 8 \%$) than that of normal star-forminggalaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between thestarburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical agn activity (median agedifference of $\gtrsim 200 \pm 100$ myr), in agreement with previous studies.the time delay is inferred by comparing the broad-band near nuv-to-opticalphotometry with stellar population synthesis models. we also find thatstarbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust-obscured than normalstar-forming galaxies in the same mass range. about $20\%$ of the starburstsand $15\%$ of the transiting post-starbursts can be classified as the"dust-obscured galaxies" (dogs), while only $0.8\%$ of normal galaxies aredogs.the time delay between the starburst phase and agn activity suggests thatagn do not play a primary role in the original quenching of starbursts but maybe responsible for quenching later low-level star formation during thepost-starburst phase.

1407.7525	no more active galactic nuclei in clumpy disks than in smooth galaxies  at z~2 in candels / 3d-hst	we use candels imaging, 3d-hst spectroscopy, and chandra x-ray data toinvestigate if active galactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially fueled byviolent disk instabilities funneling gas into galaxy centers at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4. weselect galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number ofclumps and degree of patchiness as proxies. the candels visual classificationsystem is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matchedcomparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. we notethat, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates,the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulgescompared to the clumpy galaxies. the lack of smooth extended disks is probablya general feature of the z~2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directlycompare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift.we find that z~2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced agn fractions selectedby integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatiallyresolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena ratherthan nuclear agns. meanwhile the x-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, andintermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable agn fractions derived fromboth individual detections and stacked non-detections. the data demonstratethat agn fueling modes at z~1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities orsecular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpygalaxies.

1409.4791	kpc-scale properties of emission-line galaxies	we perform a detailed study of the resolved properties of emission-linegalaxies at kpc-scale to investigate how small-scale and global properties ofgalaxies are related. 119 galaxies with high-resolution keck/deimos spectra areselected to cover a wide range in morphologies over the redshift range0.2&lt;z&lt;1.3. using the hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging data taken as a part of thecandels project, for each galaxy we perform sed fitting per resolution element,producing resolved rest-frame u-v color, stellar mass, star formation rate, ageand extinction maps. we develop a technique to identify blue and red "regions"within individual galaxies, using their rest-frame color maps. as expected, forany given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surfacedensities and older ages compared to the blue regions. furthermore, we quantifythe spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshiftand stellar mass, finding that the stronger concentration of red regions towardthe centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift orstellar mass. we find that the "main sequence" of star forming galaxies existsamong both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blueregions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.6 dex. the blue regions show higher specific star formation rates (ssfr)than their red counterparts with the ssfr decreasing since z~1, driverprimarily by the stellar mass surface densities rather than the sfrs at a giverresolution element.

1409.5434	galaxy zoo: are bars responsible for the feeding of active galactic  nuclei at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0?	we present a new study investigating whether active galactic nuclei (agn)beyond the local universe are preferentially fed via large-scale bars. ourinvestigation combines data from chandra and galaxy zoo: hubble (gzh) in theaegis, cosmos, and goods-s surveys to create samples of face-on, disc galaxiesat 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. we use a novel method to robustly compare a sample of 120 agnhost galaxies, defined to have 10^42 erg/s &lt; l_x &lt; 10^44 erg/s, with inactivecontrol galaxies matched in stellar mass, rest-frame colour, size, sersicindex, and redshift. using the gzh bar classifications of each sample, wedemonstrate that agn hosts show no statistically significant enhancement in barfraction or average bar likelihood compared to closely-matched inactivegalaxies. in detail, we find that the agn bar fraction cannot be enhanced abovethe control bar fraction by more than a factor of two, at 99.7% confidence. wesimilarly find no significant difference in the agn fraction among barred andnon-barred galaxies. thus we find no compelling evidence that large-scale barsdirectly fuel agn at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0. this result, coupled with previous results atz=0, implies that moderate-luminosity agn have not been preferentially fed bylarge-scale bars since z=1. furthermore, given the low bar fractions at z&gt;1,our findings suggest that large-scale bars have likely never directly been adominant fueling mechanism for supermassive black hole growth.

1410.7398	clumpy galaxies in candels. i. the definition of uv clumps and the  fraction of clumpy galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3	although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution,the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because thedefinition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. in this paper, we studythe basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3,using our proposed physical definition that uv-bright clumps are discretestar-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of therest-frame uv light of their galaxies. clumps defined this way aresignificantly brighter than the hii regions of nearby large spiral galaxies,either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution andcosmological dimming are considered. under this definition, we measure thefraction of sfgs that contain at least one off-center clump (fclumpy) and thecontributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv light and star formation rate ofsfgs in the candels/goods-s and uds fields, where our mass-complete sampleconsists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q&gt;0.5. the redshift evolution offclumpy changes with the stellar mass (m*) of the galaxies. low-mass(log(m*/msun)&lt;9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant fclumpy of about 60% fromz~3.0 to z~0.5. intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their fclumpy from55% at z~3.0 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z~0.5. we find that (1) the trendof disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the fclumpytrend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of thefclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z&lt;1.5, given a realisticobservability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for thefclumpy trend in all masses at z&lt;1.5. the clump contribution to the rest-frameuv light of sfgs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(m*/msun)~10.5 atall redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.(abridged)

1502.02659	a wfc3 grism emission line redshift catalog in the goods-south field	we combine hst/wfc3 imaging and g141 grism observations from the candels and3d-hst surveys to produce a catalog of grism spectroscopic redshifts forgalaxies in the candels/goods-south field. the wfc3/g141 grism spectra cover awavelength range of 1.1&lt;lambda&lt;1.7 microns with a resolving power of r~130 forpoint sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out toz~3.5. the catalog is selected in the h-band (f160w) and includes both galaxieswith and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. grism spectraare extracted for all h-band detected galaxies with h&lt;24 and a candelsphotometric redshift z_phot &gt; 0.6. the resulting spectra are visually inspectedto identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlationwith empirical spectral templates. to establish the accuracy of our redshifts,we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from theliterature. using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields aprecision of sigma_nmad=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which isconsistent with the accuracy reported by the 3d-hst team. our final catalogcovers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies ingoods-s. roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with nopreviously published spectroscopic redshift. these new redshifts span a rangeof 0.677 &lt; z &lt; 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. the catalogcontains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z&gt;1.5. in addition, wepresent 20 galaxy pair candidates identified for the first time using the grismredshifts in our catalog, including four new galaxy pairs at z~2, nearlydoubling the number of such pairs previously identified.

0804.4312	aegis: the nature of the host galaxies of low-ionization outflows at z &lt;  0.6	we report on a s/n-limited search for low-ionization gas outflows in thespectra of the 0.11 &lt; z &lt; 0.54 objects in the egs portion of the deep2 survey.doppler shifts from the host galaxy redshifts are systematically searched forin the na i 5890,96 doublet (na d). although the spectral resolution and s/nlimit us to study the interstellar gas kinematics from fitting a single doubletcomponent to each observed na d profile, the typical outflow often seen inlocal luminous-infrared galaxies (lirgs) should be detected at &gt;~ 6 sigma inabsorption equivalent width down to the survey limiting s/n (~ 5 per pixel) inthe continuum around na d. the detection rate of lirg-like outflow clearlyshows an increasing trend with star-forming activity and infrared luminosity.however, by virtue of not selecting our sample on star formation, we also finda majority of outflows in galaxies on the red sequence in the rest-frame (u-b,m_b) color-magnitude diagram. most of these red-sequence outflows are ofearly-type morphology and show the sign of recent star formation in theiruv-optical colors; some show enhanced balmer h-beta absorption lines indicativeof poststarburst as well as high dust extinction. these findings demonstratethat outflows outlive starbursts and suggest that galactic-scale outflows playa role in quenching star formation in the host galaxies on their way to the redsequence. the fate of relic winds, as well as the observational constraints ongaseous feedback models, may be studied in galaxies during their poststarburstphase. we also note the presence of inflow candidates in red, early-typegalaxies, some with signs of agns/liners but little evidence for starformation.

0804.4686	ubiquitous outflows in deep2 spectra of star-forming galaxies at z=1.4	galactic winds are a prime suspect for the metal enrichment of theintergalactic medium and may have a strong influence on the chemical evolutionof galaxies and the nature of qso absorption line systems. we use a sample of1406 galaxy spectra at z~1.4 from the deep2 redshift survey to show thatblueshifted mg ii 2796, 2803 a absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxiesat this epoch. this is the first detection of frequent outflowing galacticwinds at z~1. the presence and depth of absorption are independent of agnspectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisitefor driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. outflows are found incoadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x instar formation rate (sfr), calibrated from k-band and from mips ir fluxes. theoutflows have column densities of order n_h ~ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristicvelocities of ~ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in themost massive, highest sfr galaxies. the velocities suggest that the outflowinggas can escape into the igm and that massive galaxies can producecosmologically and chemically significant outflows. both the mg ii equivalentwidth and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar massand sfr, with v_wind ~ sfr^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshiftir-luminous galaxies. the high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxypopulation at z~1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors ofmassive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. the increase of outflowvelocity with mass and sfr constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolutionthat include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven modelsfor the wind physics.

0805.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: environments of poststarburst galaxies  at z~0.1 and z~0.8	postststarburst (k+a) galaxies are candidates for galaxies in transition froma star-forming phase to a passively-evolving phase. we have spectroscopicallyidentified large samples of k+a galaxies both in the sdss at z~0.1 and in thedeep2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in hbetaemission rather than the more problematic [oii] 3727. based on measurements ofthe overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that k+a galaxiesbrighter than 0.4l*_b at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishableenvironment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments,but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. however, at higher-z, theenvironment distribution of k+a galaxies is more similar to red galaxies thanto blue galaxies. we conclude that the quenching of star formation and thebuild-up of the red sequence through the k+a phase is happening in relativelyoverdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing withtime, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same alongwith the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of allgalaxies has to grow with time. in addition, we do not find any significantdependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of k+as. the existenceof a large k+a population in the field at both redshifts indicates thatcluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which thesegalaxies are formed. we also demonstrates that studying k+a-environmentrelations by measuring the k+a fraction in different environments is highlynon-robust. statistical comparisons of the overall environment distributions ofdifferent populations are much better behaved.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1509.03629	are compton-thick agn the missing link between mergers and black hole  growth?	we examine the host morphologies of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei(agn) at $z\sim1$ to test whether obscured supermassive black hole growth atthis epoch is preferentially linked to galaxy mergers. our sample consists of154 obscured agn with $n_{\rm h}&gt;10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $z&lt;1.5$. using visualclassifications, we compare the morphologies of these agn to control samples ofmoderately obscured ($10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $&lt;n_{\rm h}&lt; 10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) andunobscured ($n_{\rm h}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) agn. these control agn are matchedin redshift and intrinsic x-ray luminosity to our heavily obscured agn. we findthat heavily obscured agn at z~1 are twice as likely to be hosted by late-typegalaxies relative to unobscured agn ($65.3^{+4.1}_{-4.6}\%$ vs$34.5^{+2.9}_{-2.7}\%$) and three times as likely to exhibit merger orinteraction signatures ($21.5^{+4.2}_{-3.3}\%$ vs $7.8^{+1.9}_{-1.3}\%$). theincreased merger fraction is significant at the 3.8$\sigma$ level. we also findthat the incidence of point-like morphologies is inversely proportional toobscuration. if we exclude all point sources and consider only extended hosts,we find the correlation between merger fraction and obscuration is stillevident, however at a reduced statistical significance ($2.5\sigma$). the factthat we observe a different disk/spheroid fraction versus obscuration indicatesthat viewing angle cannot be the only thing differentiating our three agnsamples, as a simple unification model would suggest. the increased fraction ofdisturbed morphologies with obscuration supports an evolutionary scenario, inwhich compton-thick agn are a distinct phase of obscured smbh growth followinga merger/interaction event. our findings also suggest that some of themerger-triggered smbh growth predicted by recent agn fueling models may behidden among the heavily obscured, compton-thick population.

astro-ph;0105389	are there blue, massive e/s0s at z &lt; 1 ?: kinematics of blue spheroidal  galaxy candidates	several recent studies find that 10 - 50% of morphologically selected fieldearly-type galaxies at redshifts z &lt;= 1 have blue colors indicative of recentstar formation. such ``blue spheroids''might be massive early-type galaxieswith active star formation, perhaps induced by recent merger events.  alternatively, they could be starbursting, low-mass spheroids. to distinguishbetween these two choices, we have selected 10 ``blue spheroid candidates''  (hereafter, bscs) from a quantitatively selected e/s0 sample and studiedtheir properties, including kinematics from keck spectra obtained as part ofthe deep groth strip survey (gss). most bscs (70%) turn out to belong to twobroad categories, while the remaining objects are likely to be misclassifiedobjects. type-1 bscs have underlying red stellar components with bluer innercomponents. type-2 bscs do not show an obvious sign of the underlying redstellar component, and their overall colors are quite blue ((u-b)_rest &lt; 0).  both type-1 and type-2 bscs have internal velocity dispersions measured fromemission lines sigma &lt; 80$ km/sec and estimated dynamical masses of only a fewtimes 10^10 m_sun or less. for type-1 bscs, we estimate sigma of the redcomponent using the fundamental plane relation of distant field absorption-linegalaxies and find that these sigma estimates are similar to the sigma measuredfrom emission lines. overall, we conclude that our type-1 and type-2 bscs aremore likely to be star-forming low mass spheroids than star-forming, massive,early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0307242	the deep groth strip survey ix: evolution of the fundamental plane of  field galaxies	fundamental plane studies provide an excellent means of understanding theevolutionary history of early-type galaxies. using the low resolution imagingspectrograph on the keck telescope, we obtained internal stellar kinematicinformation for 36 field galaxies in the groth strip--21 early-type and 15 diskgalaxies. their redshifts range from 0.3--1.0, with a median redshift 0.8. theslope of the relation shows no difference compared with the local slope.however, there is significant evolution in the zero-point offset; an offset dueto evolution in magnitude requires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening atz=1. we see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction, which is agood surrogate for galaxy type. correcting for the luminosity evolution reducesthe orthogonal scatter in the fundamental plane to 8%, consistent with thelocal scatter. this scatter is measured for our sample, and does not includeresults from other studies which may have different selection effects. thedifference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and publishedcluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch--around z=1.5 for fieldgalaxies compared to z&gt;2.0 for cluster galaxies. the magnitude differenceimplies that the field early-type galaxies are about 2 gyr younger than thecluster ellipticals using standard single-burst models. however, the samemodels imply a significant change in the rest-frame u-b color from then topresent, which is not seen in our sample. continuous low-level star formation,however, would serve to explain the constant colors over this large magnitudechange. a consistent model has 7% of the stellar mass created after the initialburst, using an exponentially decaying star formation rate with an e-foldingtime of 5 gyr.

astro-ph;0409305	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: probing the evolution of dark matter  halos around isolated galaxies at z ~ 1	using the first 25% of deep2 redshift survey data, we probe the line-of-sightvelocity dispersion profile for isolated galaxies with absolute b-bandmagnitude -22&lt;m_b-5log(h)&lt;-21 at z=0.7-1.0, using satellite galaxies asluminous tracers of the underlying velocity distribution. measuring thevelocity dispersion beyond a galactocentric radius of ~200 kpc/h (physical)permits us to determine the total mass, including dark matter, around thesebright galaxies. we find a line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los) of162^{+44}_{-30} km/s at ~110 kpc/h, 136^{+26}_{-20} km/s at ~230 kpc/h, and150^{+55}_{-38} km/s at ~320 kpc/h. assuming an nfw model for the dark matterdensity profile, this corresponds to a mass within r_{200} ofm_200=5.5^{+2.5}_{-2.0} x 10^12 m_sun/h for our sample of satellite hosts withmean luminosity ~2.5l*. roughly $~60% of these host galaxies have early-typespectra and are red in restframe (u-b) color, consistent with the overall deep2sample in the same luminosity and redshift range. the halo mass determined fordeep2 host galaxies is consistent with that measured in the sloan digital skysurvey for host galaxies within a similar luminosity range relative to m*_b.this comparison is insensitive to the assumed halo mass profile, and implies anincrease in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (m_200/l_b) of isolated galaxieswhich host satellites by a factor of ~2.5 from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. our results areconsistent with scenarios in which galaxies populate dark matter halossimilarly from z ~ 0 to z ~ 1, except for ~1 magnitude of evolution in theluminosity of all galaxies.

astro-ph;0510843	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: discovery of luminous, metal-poor, sta  r-forming galaxies at redshifts z~0.7	we have discovered a sample of 17 metal-poor, yet luminous, star-forminggalaxies at redshifts z~0.7. they were selected from the initial phase of thedeep2 survey of 3900 galaxies and the team keck redshift survey (tkrs) of 1536galaxies as those showing the temperature-sensitive [oiii]l4363 auroral line.these rare galaxies have blue luminosities close to l*, high star formationrates of 5 to 12 solar masses per year, and oxygen abundances of 1/3 to 1/10solar. they thus lie significantly off the luminosity-metallicity relationfound previously for field galaxies with strong emission lines at redshiftsz~0.7. the prior surveys relied on indirect, empirical calibrations of the r23diagnostic and the assumption that luminous galaxies are not metal-poor. ourdiscovery suggests that this assumption is sometimes invalid. as a class, thesenewly-discovered galaxies are: (1) more metal-poor than common classes ofbright emission-line galaxies at z~0.7 or at the present epoch; (2) comparablein metallicity to z~3 lyman break galaxies but less luminous; and (3)comparable in metallicity to local metal-poor extreme blue compact galaxies(xbcgs), but more luminous. together, the three samples suggest that themost-luminous, metal-poor, compact galaxies become fainter over time.

astro-ph;9604096	optical rotation curves of distant field galaxies i : keck results at  redshifts to z ~ 1	spatially resolved velocity profiles are presented for nine faint fieldgalaxies in the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1, based on moderate-resolutionspectroscopy obtained with the keck 10 m telescope. these data were augmentedwith high-resolution hst images from wfpc2, which provided v and i photometry,galaxy type, orientation, and inclination. the effects of seeing, slit width,and slit misalignment with respect to galaxy major axis were modeled along withinclination for each source, in order to derive a maximum circular velocityfrom the observed rotation curve. the lowest redshift galaxy, though highlyelongated, shows a distorted low-amplitude rotation curve that suggests amerger in progress seen perpendicular to the collision path. the remainingrotation curves appear similar to those of local galaxies in both form andamplitude, implying that some massive disks were in place at z ~ 1. the keyresult is that the kinematics of these distant galaxies show evidence for onlya modest increase in luminosity of delta m_b &lt; 0.6 compared tovelocity-luminosity (tully-fisher) relations for local galaxies.

astro-ph;9604113	redshift z ~ 1 field galaxies observed with the keck telescope and the  hst	we report results based on 35 new spectroscopic redshifts obtained with thekeck telescope for field galaxies that also have photometry and morphology fromsurvey images taken by the refurbished hst. a sample of 24 redshifts forgalaxies fainter than i = 22 has a median redshift of z ~ 0.81. this result isinconsistent with the lower median redshift of z ~ 0.6 predicted by the``maximal merger models'' of carlberg (1996), which otherwise fit existingdata. the data match an extrapolation of the cfrs, as well as predictions ofcertain mild luminosity-evolution models. nearly half of the redshifts lie intwo structures at z ~ 0.81 and z ~ 1.0, showing the presence of high densityconcentrations spanning scales of ~ 1/h mpc, i.e., the size of groups. we findemission lines or the presence of possible neighbors in 7 of 9 otherwiseluminous galaxies with red central regions at redshifts beyond z ~ 0.7. we alsonote a diversity of morphological types among blue galaxies at z ~ 1, includingsmall compact galaxies, ``chains,'' and ``blue nucleated galaxies.'' thesemorphologies are found among local, but generally less luminous, galaxies.distant blue galaxies also include apparently normal late-type spirals. thesefindings could imply modest bursts of star formation caused by mergers orinteractions of small, gas-rich galaxies with each other or with larger,well-formed galaxies. this first glimpse of very faint z ~ 1 field galaxies ofdiverse colors and morphologies suggests that a mixture of physical processesis at work in the formation and evolution of faint field galaxies.

astro-ph;9612239	keck spectroscopy of redshift z~3 galaxies in the hubble deep field	we have obtained spectra with the 10-m keck telescope of a sample of 24galaxies having colors consistent with star-forming galaxies at redshifts2&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the hubble deep field (hdf). eleven of these galaxies are confirmedto be at high redshift (median z=3.0), one is at z=0.5, and the other 12 haveuncertain redshifts but have spectra consistent with their being at z&gt;2.combined with 5 previously confirmed high-redshift galaxies in the hdf, the 16confirmed sources yield a comoving volume density of n&gt;2.5^-4 h50^3 mpc^-3 forq0=0.05, or n&gt;1.2^-3 h50^3 mpc^-3 for q0=0.5. these densities are comparable toestimates of the local volume density of galaxies brighter than l*, and couldbe almost three times higher still if all 29 of the unconfirmed candidates inour original sample are indeed also at high redshift. the galaxies are smallbut luminous, with half-light radii 1.8 &lt; r(1/2) &lt; 6.5 h50^-1 kpc and absolutemagnitudes -21.5 &gt; m_b &gt; -23. the hst images show a wide range of morphologies,including several with very close, small knots of emission embedded in wispyextended structures. using rest-frame uv continuum fluxes with no dustcorrection, we calculate star formation rates in the range 7 - 24 or 3 - 9h50^-2 msun/yr for q0=0.05 and q0=0.5, respectively. the variety ofmorphologies and the high number density of z=3 galaxies in the hdf suggestthat they represent a range of physical processes and stages of galaxyformation and evolution, rather than any one class of object, such as massiveellipticals. a key issue remains the measurement of masses. these high-redshiftobjects are likely to be the low-mass, starbursting building blocks of moremassive galaxies seen today.

astro-ph;9701244	optical rotation curves of distant field galaxies: sub-l* systems	moderate-resolution spectroscopic observations from the keck 10m telescopeare used to derive internal kinematics for eight faint disk galaxies in thefields flanking the hubble deep field. the spectroscopic data are combined withhigh-resolution f814w wfpc2 images from the hubble space telescope whichprovide morphologies and scale-lengths, inclinations and orientations. theeight galaxies have redshifts 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.75, magnitudes 18.6 &lt; i_814 &lt; 22.1and luminosities -21.8 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.0 (h_0 = 75 and q_0 = 0.05). terminal diskvelocities are derived from the spatially-resolved velocity profiles bymodeling the effects of seeing, slit width, slit misalignment with galaxy majoraxis, and inclination for each source. these data are combined with the sampleof vogt et al. (1996) to provide a high-redshift tully-fisher relation thatspans three magnitudes. this sample was selected primarily by morphology andmagnitude, rather than color or spectral features. we find no obvious change inthe shape or slope of the relation with respect to the local tully-fisherrelation. the small offset of &lt; 0.4 b mag with respect to the local relation ispresumably caused by luminosity evolution in the field galaxy population, anddoes not correlate with galaxy mass. a comparison of disk surface brightnessbetween local and high-redshift samples yields a similar offset, ~0.6 mag.these results provide further evidence for only a modest increase in luminositywith lookback time.

astro-ph;9709216	the luminosity function for l&gt;l* galaxies at z &gt; 3	through use of multiband (u, b, r, i) photometry we have isolated highredshift (3.0&lt;z&lt;3.5) galaxy candidates in a survey of 1.27 deg^2 to r = 21.25and a survey of 0.02 deg^2 to r = 23.5. our pool of candidates constrains thenature of the 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 luminosity function over the range l* &lt; l &lt; 100 l*,if we grant a similar level of completeness to these data as for very faintsamples (to r = 25.5) selected in a similar fashion. our constraints agree withthe high redshift sky density at r = 20.5 estimated from yee et al.'s (1996)serendipitous discovery of a bright, z = 2.7 galaxy, as well as the density atr ~ 23 by steidel et al. (1996b). we strongly rule out -- by more than twoorders of magnitude at m(r) = -25 -- the l &gt; l* luminosity function for z = 3-5galaxies obtained by a photometric redshift analysis of the hubble deep field(hdf) by gwyn &amp; hartwick (1996). our results at r ~ 23 are more consistent withthe photometric redshift analysis of the faint hdf galaxies by sawicki &amp; yee(1996), but our present upper limits at the brightest magnitudes (r &lt; 21.5,m(r) &lt; -24) allow more generous volume densities of these super-l* galaxies.

astro-ph;9804093	near-infrared galaxy counts to j and k ~ 24 as a function of image size	we have used the keck 10m telescope to count objects as a function of imagesize in 2 high galactic latitude fields covering 1.5 arcmin^2 and reaching 50%completeness at k=24 and j=24.5 for stellar sources. counts extend ~1 magdeeper in k than surveys with other telescopes; complement keck surveysproviding counts at comparable or shallower depths but not utilizing imagestructure; and extend by several magnitudes the j band counts from othersurveys. we find the surface-density of objects at k=23 to be higher thanpreviously found (~500,000/mag/deg^2), but at k&lt;22 to be consistent with mostother surveys in amplitude and slope (~0.36). j band counts have similar slope.j and k counts are in excess of our empirical no-evolution models for an openuniverse, and a factor of 2 higher than mild-evolution models at j and k ~ 23.the slope of the model counts is insensitive to geometry even in thenear-infrared because the counts are dominated by low-luminosity (&lt;0.1l*)objects at modest redshift (z&lt;1) with small apparent sizes (r05&lt;0.4", i.e. &lt;4kpc). the observed counts rise most steeply for these smaller objects, whichdominate fainter than k=22.3 and j=23.3. however, the greatest excess relativeto no-evolution models occurs for the apparently larger objects (medianj-k~1.5). the size and colors of such objects correspond equally well toluminous (&gt;0.1l*), galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;4, or progressively more diffuse,low-luminosity (0.001-0.1l*) galaxies at z&lt;1. we rule out the excess is fromvery low luminosity (&lt;0.0001l*) red galaxies at z&lt;0.25. there is a deficit ofgalaxies with red j-k colors corresponding to luminous, early-type galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;3. assuming the deficit is due to their appearance as blue galaxies, theyaccount only for 10-30% of the excess of large, blue galaxies.

astro-ph;9906243	dynamics of distant normal galaxies	masses of galaxies are beginning to be measured systematically at redshifts z&gt; 0.3. such data provide powerful and unique links and clues to theories,simulations, and our understanding of early galaxy formation and evolution.discriminating masses of different kinds (e.g., dark matter, old stars, hi gas)remains difficult, but a wide variety of techniques for measuring totaldynamical masses are being explored and found practical. i highlight threerecent optical studies of dynamical masses: 1) the emission line velocitywidths of blue galaxies and rotation curves of spirals that trace evolution inthe tully-fisher relation to z ~ 1; 2) the absorption line velocity dispersionsof early type galaxies in the field and clusters to track evolution in thefundamental plane to z ~ 0.85; and 3) the kinematics of high redshift (z ~ 3)lyman-drop galaxies to constrain their nature, descendents, and progenitors.the next decade shows promise of an explosive growth in this infant field ofmeasuring masses, especially in having much larger sample sizes, higherprecision and s/n, improved techniques and tools, and probes of more diversekinds of mass.

0810.3235	inspiralling supermassive black holes: a new signpost for galaxy mergers	we present a new technique for observationally identifying galaxy mergersspectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. our techniqueexploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (smbhs) powering activegalactic nuclei (agns) in merger-remnant galaxies. because structure in theuniverse is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host acentral smbh, some galaxies should possess two smbhs near their centers as theresult of a recent merger. these smbhs spiral to the center of the resultantmerger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the smbhs may power agns. using thedeep2 galaxy redshift survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91exhibit [o iii] and hbeta emission lines indicative of seyfert 2 activity. ofthese, 32 agns have [o iii] emission-line redshifts significantly differentfrom the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocityoffsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. two of these agns exhibit double-peaked [oiii] emission lines, while the remaining 30 agns each exhibit a single set ofvelocity-offset [o iii] emission lines. after exploring a variety of physicalmodels for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation isinspiralling smbhs in merger-remnant galaxies. based on this interpretation, wefind that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting agns are also mergerremnants, which implies that mergers may trigger agn activity in red galaxies.the agn velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a mergerrate of ~3 mergers/gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 &lt; z &lt; 0.82.

0810.3945	spatially resolved stellar populations of eight goods-south agn at z~1	we present a pilot study of the stellar populations of 8 agn hosts at z~1 andcompare to (1) lower redshift samples and (2) a sample of nonactive galaxies ofsimilar redshift. we utilize k' images in the goods south field obtained withthe laser guide star adaptive optics (lgsao) system at keck observatory. wecombine this k' data with b, v, i, and z imaging from the acs on hst to givemulti-color photometry at a matched spatial resolution better than 100 mas inall bands. the hosts harbor agn as inferred from their high x-ray luminosities(l_x &gt; 10^42 ergs/s) or mid-ir colors. we find a correlation between thepresence of younger stellar populations and the strength of the agn, asmeasured with [oiii] line luminosity or x-ray (2-10 kev) luminosity. thisfinding is consistent with similar studies at lower redshift. of the three typeii galaxies, two are disk galaxies and one is of irregular type, while in thetype i sample there only one disk-like source and four sources with smooth,elliptical/spheroidal morphologies. in addition, the mid-ir seds of the strongtype ii agn indicate that they are excited to lirg (luminous infrared galaxy)status via galactic starbursting, while the strong type i agn are excited tolirg status via hot dust surrounding the central agn. this supports the notionthat the obscured nature of type ii agn at z~1 is connected with globalstarbursting and that they may be extincted by kpc-scale dusty features thatare byproducts of this starbursting.
