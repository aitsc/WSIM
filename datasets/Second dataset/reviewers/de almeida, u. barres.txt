1004.2089	multi-wavelength observations of h 2356-309	aims: the properties of the broad-band emission from the high-frequencypeaked bl lac h 2356-309 (z=0.165) are investigated. methods: very high energy(vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) observations of h 2356-309 were performed with the highenergy stereoscopic system (hess) from 2004 through 2007. simultaneousoptical/uv and x-ray observations were made with the xmm-newton satellite onjune 12/13 and june 14/15, 2005. nrt radio observations were alsocontemporaneously performed in 2005. atom optical monitoring observations werealso made in 2007. results: a strong vhe signal, ~13 sigma total, was detectedby hess after the four years hess observations (116.8 hrs live time). theintegral flux above 240 gev is i(&gt;240 gev) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observedfrom the crab nebula. a time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 gevto 2 tev and is characterized by a power law (photon index of gamma = 3.06 +-0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). significant small-amplitude variations in the vheflux from h 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not onshorter time scales. no evidence for any variations in the vhe spectral slopeare found within these data. the xmm-newton x-ray measurements show ahistorically low x-ray state, characterized by a hard, broken-power-lawspectrum on both nights. conclusions: the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) of the blazar can be adequately fit using a simple one-zonesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) model. in the ssc scenario, higher vhe fluxescould be expected in the future since the observed x-ray flux is at ahistorically low level.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1006.4830	particle acceleration and magnetic field structure in pks 2155-304:  optical polarimetric observations	in this paper we present multiband optical polarimetric observations of thevhe blazar pks 2155-304 made simultaneously with a h.e.s.s./fermi high-energycampaign in 2008, when the source was found to be in a low state. the intensedaily coverage of the dataset allowed us to study in detail the temporalevolution of the emission and we found that the particle accelerationtimescales are decoupled from the changes in the polarimetric properties of thesource. we present a model in which the optical polarimetric emissionoriginates at the polarised mm-wave core and propose an explanation for thelack of correlation between the photometric and polarimetric fluxes. theoptical emission is consistent with an inhomogeneous synchrotron source inwhich the large scale field is locally organised by a shock in which particleacceleration takes place. finally, we use these optical polarimetricobservations of pks 2155-304 at a low state to propose an origin for thequiescent gamma-ray flux of the object, in an attempt to provide clues for thesource of its recently established persistent tev emission.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1112.3917	detection of very-high energy \gamma-ray emission from ngc 1275 by the  magic telescopes	we report on the detection of very-high energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rayemission from ngc 1275, the central radio galaxy of the perseus cluster ofgalaxies. the source has been detected by the magic telescopes with astatistical significance of 6.6 sigma above 100 gev in 46 hr of stereoobservations carried out between august 2010 and february 2011. the measureddifferential energy spectrum between 70 gev and 500 gev can be described by apower law with a steep spectral index of \gamma=-4.1+/-0.7stat+/-0.3syst, andthe average flux above 100 gev is f_{gamma}=(1.3+/-0.2stat+/-0.3syst) x 10^-11cm^-2 s^-1. these results, combined with the power-law spectrum measured in thefirst two years of observations by the fermi-lat above 100 mev, with a spectralindex of gamma ~ -2.1, strongly suggest the presence of a break or cut-offaround tens of gev in the ngc 1275 spectrum. the light curve of the sourceabove 100 gev does not show hints of variability on a month time scale.finally, we report on the nondetection in the present data of the radio galaxyic 310, previously discovered by the fermi-lat and magic. the derived fluxupper limit f^{u.l.}_{gamma} (&gt;300 gev)=1.2 x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1 is a factor ~ 3lower than the mean flux measured by magic between october 2009 and february2010, thus confirming the year time-scale variability of the source at vhe.

1201.4074	morphological and spectral properties of the w51 region measured with  the magic telescopes	the w51 complex hosts the supernova remnant w51c which is known to interactwith the molecular clouds in the star forming region w51b. in addition, apossible pulsar wind nebula cxo j192318.5+140305 was found likely associatedwith the supernova remnant. gamma-ray emission from this region was discoveredby fermi/lat (between 0.2 and 50 gev) and h.e.s.s. (&gt;1 tev). the spatialdistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of theemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or themolecular cloud. however, the modeling of the spectral energy distributionpresented by the fermi/lat collaboration suggests a hadronic emissionmechanism. we performed observations of the w51 complex with the magictelescopes for more than 50 hours. the good angular resolution in the medium(few hundred gev) to high (above 1 tev) energies allow us to performmorphological studies. we detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gammarays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. we extend the spectrumfrom the highest fermi/lat energies to \sim 5 tev and find that it follows asingle power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . the mainpart of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find afeature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. the possible contribution ofthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence onenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. the broad band spectralenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies protonacceleration above 100 tev. this result, together with the morphology of thesource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions inthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. these results shedlight on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

1311.3637	magic upper limits on the grb 090102 afterglow	indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since theegret observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the dataof the fermi satellite. these results have, however, shown that ourunderstanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory. the new generation ofcherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope, allow for thefirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tensup to hundreds of gev energy range. both leptonic and hadronic processes havebeen suggested to explain the possible gev/tev counterpart of grbs.observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (e&gt;30gev) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating amongthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable atlower energies. magic telescope observations of the grb 090102 (z=1.547) fieldand fermi large area telescope (lat) data in the same time interval areanalysed to derive upper limits of the gev/tev emission. we compare theseresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in theframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. simultaneousupper limits with fermi and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for thisgrb observation. the results we obtained are compatible with the expectedemission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission forthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.nonetheless, magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-basedinstruments (above about 40 gev) is about one order of magnitude better withrespect to fermi. this makes evident the constraining power of ground-basedobservations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the requiredperformance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very highenergy range.

1401.0464	magic long-term study of the distant tev blazar pks 1424+240 in a  multiwavelength context	we present a study of the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-rayemission of the blazar pks 1424+240 observed with the magic telescopes. theprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization andmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recentdiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z &gt; 0.6 and makes it a promisingcandidate to be the most distant vhe source. the source has been observed withthe magic telescopes in vhe gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 hfrom 2009 to 2011. the source was marginally detected in vhe gamma rays during2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an opticaloutburst in 2011. the combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2sigma. the differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can bedescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0+/- 1.7. the magic spectra corrected for the absorption due to theextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, withthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the fermi-lat. theabsorption-corrected magic spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to400 gev. the multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio andoptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of thejet. the large separation between the two peaks of the constructednon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely highdoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-compton model is applied. wefind that a two-component synchrotron self-compton model describes the spectralenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.
