0901.1896	extreme uv qsos	we present a sample of spectroscopically confirmed qsos with fuv-nuv color(as measured by galex photometry) bluer than canonical qso templates and thanthe majority of known qsos. we analyze their fuv to nir colors, luminositiesand optical spectra. the sample includes a group of 150 objects at low redshift(z $&lt;$ 0.5), and a group of 21 objects with redshift 1.7$&lt;$z$&lt;$2.6. for the lowredshift objects, the "blue" fuv-nuv color may be caused by enhanced ly$\alpha$emission, since ly$\alpha$ transits the galex fuv band from z=0.1 to z=0.47.synthetic qso templates constructed with ly$\alpha$ up to 3 times stronger thanin standard templates match the observed uv colors of our low redshift sample.the h$\alpha$ emission increases, and the optical spectra become bluer, withincreasing absolute uv luminosity. the uv-blue qsos at redshift about 2, wherethe galex bands sample restframe about 450-590a (fuv) and about 590-940a(nuv),are fainter than the average of uv-normal qsos at similar redshift in nuv,while they have comparable luminosities in other bands. therefore we speculatethat their observed fuv-nuv color may be explained by a combination of steepflux rise towards short wavelengths and dust absorption below the lyman limit,such as from small grains or crystalline carbon. the ratio of ly$\alpha$ to civcould be measured in 10 objects; it is higher (30% on average) than foruv-normal qsos, and close to the value expected for shock or collisionalionization. full version available from author's web site:http://dolomiti.pha.jhu.edu/papers/2009_aj_extreme_uv_qsos.pdf

0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0706.3424	keck/deimos spectroscopy of a galex uv selecte sample from the medium  imaging survey	we report results from a pilot program to obtain spectroscopy for objectsdetected in the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium imaging survey (mis).our study examines the properties of galaxies detected by galex fainter thanthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic survey. this is the firststudy to extend the techinques of salim et al. 2005 to estimate stellar masses,star formation rates (sfr) and the b (star formation history) parameter forstar-forming galaxies out to z~0.7. we obtain redshifts for 50 galex missources reaching nuv=23.9 (ab mag), having counterparts in the sdss datarelease 4 (dr4). of our sample, 43 are starforming galaxies with z&lt;0.7, 3 haveemission line ratios indicative of agn with z&lt;0.7, and 4 objects with z~1 areqsos, 3 of which are not previously cataloged. we compare our sample to a muchlarger sample of ~50,000 matched galex/sdss galaxies with sdss spectroscopy;while our survey is shallow, the optical counterparts to our sources reach ~3magnitudes fainter in sdss r magnitude than the sdss spectroscopic sample. weuse emission line diagnostics for the galaxies to determine that the samplecontains mostly star-forming galaxies. the galaxies in the sample populate theblue sequence in the nuv-r vs m_r color-magnitude diagram. our sample has sfrs,luminosities, and velocity dispersions that are similar to the samples of faintcompact blue galaxies studied previously in the same redshift range by koo et.al 1995, guzman et. al 1996 &amp; phillips et. al 1997. however, our sample is ~2mag fainter in surface brightness than the compact blue galaxies. we find thatthe star-formation histories for a majority of the galaxies are consistent witha recent starburst within the last 100 myr.

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0906.1010	studying large and small scale environments of ultraviolet luminous  galaxies	studying the environments of 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2 uv-selected galaxies, as examples ofextreme star-forming galaxies (with star formation rates in the range of 3-30m_sol/yr), we explore the relationship between high rates of star-formation,host halo mass and pair fractions. we study the large-scale and small-scaleenvironments of local ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) by measuringangular correlation functions. we cross-correlate these systems with othergalaxy samples: a volume-limited sample (all), a blue luminous galaxy sample(blg) and a luminous red galaxy sample (lrg). we determine the uvlg comovingcorrelation length to be r_0=4.8(+11.6/-2.4) h^-1 mpc at &lt;z&gt; =1.0, which isunable to constrain the halo mass for this sample. however, we find that uvlgsform close (separation &lt; 30 kpc) pairs with the all sample, but do notfrequently form pairs with lrgs. a rare subset of uvlgs, those with the highestfuv surface brightnesses, are believed to be local analogs of high redshiftlyman break galaxies (lbgs) and are called lyman break analogs (lbas). lbgs andlbas share similar characteristics (i.e., color, size, surface brightness,specific star formation rates, metallicities, and dust content). recent hstimages of z~0.2 lbas show disturbed morphologies, signs of mergers andinteractions. uvlgs may be influenced by interactions with other galaxies andwe discuss this result in terms of other high star-forming, merging systems.

0906.4839	an ultraviolet study of star-forming regions in m31	we present a comprehensive study of star-forming (sf) regions in the nearestlarge spiral galaxy m31. we use galex far-uv (1344-1786 \aa, fuv) and near-uv(1771-2831 \aa, nuv) imaging to detect young massive stars and trace the recentstar formation across the galaxy. the fuv and nuv flux measurements of the sfregions, combined with ground-based data for estimating the reddening byinterstellar dust from the massive stars they contain, are used to derive theirages and masses. the galex imaging, combining deep sensitivity and coverage ofthe entire galaxy, provides a complete picture of the recent star formation inm31 and its variation with environment throughout the galaxy. the fuv and nuvmeasurements are sensitive to detect stellar populations younger than a fewhundred myrs. we detected 894 sf regions, with size &gt; 1600 pc^{2} above anaverage fuv flux limit of ~ 26 abmag arcsecond^{-2}, over the whole 26 kpcgalaxy disk. we derive the star-formation history of m31 within this time span.the star formation rate (sfr) from the youngest uv sources (age &lt; 10 myr) iscomparable to that derived from h_{alpha}, as expected. we show the dependenceof the results on the assumed metallicity. when star formation detected from irmeasurements of the heated dust is added to the uv-measured star formation(from the unobscured populations) in the recent few myrs, we find the sfr hasslightly decreased in recent epochs, with a possible peak between 10 and 100myrs, and an average value of sfr ~ 0.6 or 0.7 m_{sun} yr^{-1} (for metallicityz=0.02 or 0.05 respectively) over the last 400 myrs.

0707.1878	the young and the dustless: interpreting radio observations of  ultraviolet luminous galaxies	ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) have been identified as intenselystar-forming, nearby galaxies. a subset of these, the supercompact uvlgs, arebelieved to be local analogs of high redshift lyman break galaxies. here weinvestigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for thefirst time. we have observed 42 supercompact uvlgs with the vla, all of whichhave extensive coverage in the uv/optical by galex and sdss. our analysisincludes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the spitzer first looksurvey and from the sdss-galex matched catalogs. in addition we have spitzermips data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-fircorrelation of normal star-forming galaxies. we find that our galaxies havelower radio-to-uv ratios and lower balmer decrements than other local galaxieswith similar (high) star formation rates. optical spectra show they have lowerdn(4000) and hdeltaa indices, higher hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,and higher [oiii]5007/hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forminggalaxies. comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models weconclude that supercompact uvlgs are distinguished from normal star forminggalaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. moreover,compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, theyhave significantly less dust attenuation. in both regards they are similar tolyman break galaxies. this suggests that the process that causes star formationin the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies, butmay be similar to lyman break galaxies.

0911.0690	the local hosts of type ia supernovae	we use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from galex,sdss and the rc3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxieshosting 168 well-observed type ia supernovae (sne ia). our data corroboratewell-known features that have been seen in other sn ia samples. specifically,hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower sne ia on average,and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 gyr produce on averagemore faint, fast and fewer bright, slow sne ia than younger hosts. new resultsinclude that in our sample, the faintest and fastest sne ia occur only ingalaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 m_sun, indicating thattheir progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metalrich than the general sn ia population. a low host extinction sub-sample hintsat a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting forlight-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produceless-extincted sne ia on average. this has implications for cosmologicalfitting of sne ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter inthe fitting. converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56ni mass fromthe supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with amodel that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56nimass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.we measure a correlation between 56ni mass and host age in the local universethat is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. thedetails of the age -- 56ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply aluminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 gyr for sn ia hosts, above which theyare less likely to produce sne ia with 56ni masses above ~0.5 m_sun.

1003.4985	ngc 404, a rejuvenated lenticular galaxy on a merger-induced, blueward  excursion into the green valley	we have discovered recent star formation in the outermost portion (1-4x r_25)of the nearby lenticular (s0) galaxy ngc 404 using galex uv imaging. fuv-brightsources are strongly concentrated within the galaxy's hi ring (formed by amerger event according to del rio et al.), even though the average gas densityis dynamically subcritical. archival hst imaging reveals resolved upper mainsequence stars and conclusively demonstrates that the uv light originates fromrecent star formation activity. we present fuv, nuv radial surface brightnessprofiles and integrated magnitudes for ngc 404. within the ring, the averagestar formation rate surface density (sigma_{sfr}) is 2.2x10^-5 msun/yr/kpc^2.of the total fuv flux, 70% comes from the hi ring which is forming stars at arate of 2.5x10^-3 msun/yr. the gas consumption timescale, assuming a constantsfr and no gas recycling, is several times the age of the universe. in thecontext of the uv-optical galaxy cmd, the presence of the sf hi ring places ngc404 in the green valley separating the red and blue sequences. the rejuvenatedlenticular galaxy has experienced a merger-induced, disk-building excursionaway from the red sequence toward bluer colors, where it may evolve quiescentlyor (if appropriately triggered) experience a burst capable of placing it on theblue/star-forming sequence for up to ~1 gyr. the green valley galaxy populationis heterogeneous, with most systems transitioning from blue to red but othersevolving in the opposite sense due to acquisition of fresh gas through variouschannels.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

1009.3348	observations of diffuse ultraviolet emission from draco	we have studied small scale (2 arcmin) spatial variation of the diffuse uvradiation using a set of 11 galex deep observations in the constellation ofdraco. we find a good correlation between the observed uv background and the ir100 micron flux, indicating that the dominant contributor of the diffusebackground in the field is the scattered starlight from the interstellar dustgrains. we also find strong evidence of additional emission in the fuv bandwhich is absent in the nuv band. this is most likely due to lyman band emissionfrom molecular hydrogen in a ridge of dust running through the field and toline emissions from species such as c iv (1550 a) and si ii (1533 a) in therest of the field. a strong correlation exists between the fuv/nuv ratio andthe fuv intensity in the excess emission regions in the fuv band irrespectiveof the optical depth of the region. the optical depth increases more rapidly inthe uv than the ir and we find that the uv/ir ratio drops off exponentiallywith increasing ir due to saturation effects in the uv. using the positionaldetails of spitzer extragalactic objects, we find that the contribution ofextragalactic light in the diffuse nuv background is 49 +/- 13 photon units andis 30 +/- 10 photon units in the fuv band.

1011.1733	catalogs of hot white dwarfs in the milky way from galex's ultraviolet  sky surveys. constraining stellar evolution	we present comprehensive catalogs of hot star candidates in the milky way,selected from galex far-uv (fuv, 1344-1786 aa) and near-uv (nuv, 1771-2831 aa)imaging. the fuv and nuv photometry allows us to extract the hottest stellarobjects, in particular hot white dwarfs (wd), which are elusive at otherwavelengths because of their high temperatures and faint optical luminosities.we generated catalogs of uv sources from two galex's surveys: ais (all-skyimaging survey, depth abmag~19.9/20.8 in fuv/nuv) and mis (medium-depth imagingsurvey, depth ~22.6/22.7mag). the two catalogs (from galex fifth data release)contain 65.3/12.6 million (ais/mis) unique uv sources with error(nuv)&lt;0.5mag,over 21,435/1,579 square degrees. we also constructed subcatalogs of the uvsources with matched optical photometry from sdss (7th data release): thesecontain 0.6/0.9million (ais/mis) sources with errors &lt;0.3mag in both fuv andnuv, excluding sources with multiple optical counterparts, over an area of7,325/1,103 square degrees. all catalogs are available online. we then selected28,319(ais)/9,028(mis) matched sources with fuv-nuv&lt;-0.13; this color cutcorresponds to stellar teff hotter than ~18,000 k. an additional color cut ofnuv-r&gt;0.1 isolates binaries with largely differing teff's, and some intrudingqsos. available spectroscopy for a subsample indicates that hot-star candidateswith nuv-r&lt;0.1 have negligible contamination by non-stellar objects. we discussthe distribution of sources in the catalogs, and the effects of error and colorcuts on the samples. the density of hot-star candidates increases from high tolow galactic latitudes, but drops on the mw plane due to dust extinction. ourhot-star counts at all latitudes are better matched by milky way modelscomputed with an initial-final mass relation that favours lower final masses.(abridged)

1011.3512	the extreme hosts of extreme supernovae	we use galex ultraviolet (uv) and optical integrated photometry of the hostsof seventeen luminous supernovae (lsne, having peak m_v &lt; -21) and compare themto a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the sdss dr4 spectralcatalog and galex interim release 1.1. we place the lsne hosts on the galaxynuv-r versus m_r color magnitude diagram (cmd) with the larger sample toillustrate how extreme they are. the lsn hosts appear to favor low-densityregions of the galaxy cmd falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward thelow luminosity end. from the uv-optical photometry, we estimate the starformation history of the lsn hosts. the hosts have moderately low starformation rates (sfrs) and low stellar masses (m_*) resulting in high specificstar formation rates (ssfr). compared with the larger sample, the lsn hostsoccupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting ssfr versus m_* in the areahaving higher ssfr and lower m_*. this preference for low m_*, high ssfr hostsimplies the lsne are produced by an effect having to do with their localenvironment. the correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhapswind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents lsne from arising inhigher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. the massive progenitors of the lsne(&gt;100 m_sun), by appearing in low-sfr hosts, are potential tests for theoriesof the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on thesfr.

0709.0730	the star formation and extinction co-evolution of uv-selected galaxies  over 0.05&lt;z&lt;1.2	we use a new stacking technique to obtain mean mid ir and far ir to far uvflux ratios over the rest near-uv/near-ir color-magnitude diagram. we employcombo-17 redshifts and combo-17 optical, galex far and near uv, spitzer iracand mips mid ir photometry. this technique permits us to probe infrared excess(irx), the ratio of far ir to far uv luminosity, and specific star formationrate (ssfr) and their co-evolution over two orders of magnitude of stellar massand redshift 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2. we find that the ssfr and the characteristic mass (m_0)above which the ssfr drops increase with redshift (downsizing). at any givenepoch, irx is an increasing function of mass up to m_0. above this mass irxfalls, suggesting gas exhaustion. in a given mass bin below m_0 irx increaseswith time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. we interpret these trendsusing a simple model with a schmidt-kennicutt law and extinction that tracksgas density and enrichment. we find that the average irx and ssfr follows agalaxy age parameter which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and timesince formation. we conclude that blue sequence galaxies have properties whichshow simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady build-upof heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and theexhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. the irxrepresents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution.

1101.6051	the recent star formation in ngc 6822: an ultraviolet study	we characterize the star formation in the low-metallicity galaxy ngc 6822over the past few hundred million years, using galex far-uv (fuv, 1344-1786 a)and near-uv (nuv, 1771-2831 a) imaging, and ground-based ha imaging. from galexfuv image, we define 77 star-forming (sf) regions with area &gt;860 pc^2, andsurface brightness &lt;=26.8 mag(ab)arcsec^-2, within 0.2deg (1.7kpc) of thecenter of the galaxy. we estimate the extinction by interstellar dust in eachsf region from resolved photometry of the hot stars it contains: e(b-v) rangesfrom the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. theintegrated fuv and nuv photometry, compared with stellar population models,yields ages of the sf complexes up to a few hundred myr, and masses from 2x10^2msun to 1.5x10^6 msun. the derived ages and masses strongly depend on theassumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary acrossthe galaxy. the total mass of the fuv-defined sf regions translates into anaverage star formation rate (sfr) of 1.4x10^-2 msun/yr over the past 100 myr,and sfr=1.0x10^-2 msun/yr in the most recent 10 myr. the latter is in agreementwith the value that we derive from the ha luminosity, sfr=0.008 msun/yr. thesfr in the most recent epoch becomes higher if we add the sfr=0.02 msun/yrinferred from far-ir measurements, which trace star formation still embedded indust (age &lt;= a few myr).

1112.2944	a comprehensive galex ultraviolet catalog of star clusters in m31 and a  study of the young clusters	we present a comprehensive catalog of 700 confirmed star clusters in thefield of m31 compiled from three major existing catalogs. we detect 418 and 257star clusters in galaxy evolution explorer (galex) near-ultraviolet (nuv) andfar-ultraviolet (fuv) imaging, respectively. our final catalog includesphotometry of star clusters in up to 16 passbands ranging from fuv to nir aswell as ancillary information such as reddening, metallicity, and radialvelocities. in particular, this is the most extensive and updated catalog of uvintegrated photometry for m31 star clusters. ages and masses of star clustersare derived by fitting the multi-band photometry with model spectral energydistribution (sed); uv photometry enables more accurate age estimation of youngclusters. our catalog includes 182 young clusters with ages less than 1 gyr.our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement withpreviously determined values in the literature. the mean age and mass of youngclusters are about 300 myr and 10^4 m_sun, respectively. we found that thecompiled [fe/h] values of young clusters included in our catalog aresystematically lower (by more than 1 dex) than those from recent high-qualityspectroscopic data and our sed fitting result. we confirm that most of theyoung clusters kinematics show systematic rotation around the minor axis andassociation with the thin disk of m31. the young clusters distribution exhibitsa distinct peak in the m31 disk around 10 - 12 kpc from the center and follow aspatial distributions similar to other tracers of disk structure such as obstars, uv star-forming regions, and dust. some young clusters also showconcentration around the ring splitting regions found in the southern part ofthe m31 disk and most of them have systematically younger (&lt; 100 myr) ages.

1206.4045	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury i: bright uv stars in the  bulge of m31	as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) multi-cycleprogram, we observed a 12' \times 6.5' area of the bulge of m31 with thewfc3/uvis filters f275w and f336w. from these data we have assembled a sampleof \sim4000 uv-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. weuse updated padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars intothree classes: post-agb stars (p-agb), post-early agb (pe-agb) stars andagb-manqu\'e stars. p-agb stars are the end result of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,whereas pe-agb and agb-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hotpost-horizontal branch; hp-hb) stars are the result of insufficient envelopemasses to allow a full agb phase, and are expected to be particularly prominentat high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the rgb is high.our data support previous claims that most uv-bright sources in the bulge arelikely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (ehb) and their progeny. weconstruct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show thatthey are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated uv oroptical light. however, we find that this uv-bright population does notdominate the total uv luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only theprogeny of the ehb stars that are the likely source of the uvx. we calculatethat only a few percent of ms stars in the central bulge can have gone throughthe hp-hb phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance fromthe center. we also find that the surface density of hot uv-bright stars hasthe same radial variation as that of low-mass x-ray binaries. we discuss age,metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observedradial variation in the uv-bright population.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

1209.3320	project lyman: quantifying 11 gyrs of metagalactic ionizing background  evolution	the timing and duration of the reionization epoch is crucial to the emergenceand evolution of structure in the universe. the relative roles thatstar-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei and quasars play in contributingto the metagalactic ionizing background across cosmic time remains uncertain.deep quasar counts provide insights into their role, but the potentiallycrucial contribution from star-formation is highly uncertain due to our poorunderstanding of the processes that allow ionizing radiation to escape into theintergalactic medium (igm). the fraction of ionizing photons that escape fromstar-forming galaxies is a fundamental free parameter used in models to"fine-tune" the timing and duration of the reionization epoch that occurredsomewhere between 13.4 and 12.7 gyrs ago (redshifts between 12 &gt; z &gt; 6).however, direct observation of lyman continuum (lyc) photons emitted below therest frame \ion{h}{1} ionization edge at 912 \aa\ is increasingly improbable atredshifts z &gt; 3, due to the steady increase of intervening lyman limit systemstowards high z. thus uv and u-band optical bandpasses provide the only hope fordirect, up close and in depth, observations of the types of environment thatfavor lyc escape. by quantifying the evolution over the past 11 billion years(z &lt; 3) of the relationships between lyc escape and local and global parameters..., we can provide definitive information on the lyc escape fraction that isso crucial to answering the question of, how did the universe come to beionized? here we provide estimates of the ionizing continuum flux emitted by"characteristic" (l_{uv}^*) star-forming galaxies as a function of look backtime and escape fraction, finding that at z = 1 (7.6 gyrs ago) l_{uv}^*galaxies with an escape fraction of 1% have a flux of 10^{-19} ergs cm^{-2}s^{-1} \aa^{-1}.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1312.3281	the ultraviolet sky: an overview from the galex surveys	the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) has performed the first surveys of thesky in the ultraviolet (uv). its legacy is an unprecedented database with morethan 200 million source measurements in far-uv (fuv) and near-uv (nuv), as wellas wide-field imaging of extended objects, filling an important gap in our viewof the sky across the electromagnetic spectrum. the uv surveys offer uniquesensitivity for identifying and studying selected classes of astrophysicalobjects, both stellar and extra-galactic. we examine the overall content anddistribution of uv sources over the sky, and with magnitude and color. for thispurpose, we have constructed final catalogs of uv sources with homogeneousquality, eliminating duplicate measurements of the same source. such catalogscan facilitate a variety of investigations on uv-selected samples, as well asplanning of observations with future missions.  we describe the criteria used to build the catalogs, their coverage andcompleteness. we included observations in which both the far-uv and near-uvdetectors were exposed; 28,707 fields from the all-sky imaging survey (ais)cover a unique area of 22,080 square degrees (after we restrict the catalogs tothe central 1-degree diameter of the field), with a typical depth of about20/21 mag (fuv/nuv, in the ab mag system), and 3,008 fields from themedium-depth imaging survey (mis) cover a total of 2,251 square degrees at adepth of about 22.7mag. the catalogs contain about 71 and 16.6 million sourcesrespectively. the density of hot stars reflects the galactic structure, and thenumber counts of both galactic and extra-galactic sources are modulated by themilky way dust extinction, to which the uv data are very sensitive.

1403.5325	interesting features in the combined galex and sloan color diagrams of  solar-like galactic populations	we report on intriguing photometric properties of galactic stars observed inthe galex satellite's far-uv and near-uv bandbasses as well as from the sdsssurvey and the kepler input catalog. first, the fuv-nuv color distribution ofstars in the kepler field consists of 2 distinct peaks. second, curiously, forstars with spectral types g or later the mean fuv-nuv color becomes much bluer,contrary to expectation. we have found in two samples of mid-f through k typestars that ~14-18% of them exhibit fuv-excesses relative to their nuv fluxesand spectral types. nearly the same fractions are also discovered among membersof the kepler eclipsing binary catalog and in the published list of keplerobjects of interest. these uv-excess ("uve") colors are confirmed by the uvcontinuum slopes in galex spectra. the sdss spectra of some uve stars exhibitmetallic line weakening especially in the blue. this suggests an enhancedcontribution of uv flux relative to photospheric flux of a solar-type singlestar. we consider the possibility that the uv excesses originate from varioustypes of hot stars, including binaries, and strong chromosphere stars that. ourmodel atmosphere-derived simulations of colors for binaries with main sequencepairs with a hot secondary demonstrate that the color loci conflict with theobserved sequence. we are left with the active chromospheres explanation,whether in active binaries or young stars, as a still tentative explanation forthe uve stars. we also address the presence of an island of "uv red" stars inthe nuv-g, g-i color diagram. the subpopulation comprising this island aremainly horizontal branch stars. these objects do not exhibit uv excesses andtherefore have uv colors typical for their spectral types. this subpopulationappears "red" in the uv because their colors are not pulled to the blue by theuve stars.

1409.0899	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury x. ultraviolet to infrared  photometry of 117 million equidistant stars	we have measured stellar photometry with the hubble space telescope (hst)wide field camera 3 (wfc3) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) in nearultraviolet (f275w, f336w), optical (f475w, f814w), and near infrared (f110w,f160w) bands for 117 million resolved stars in m31. as part of the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey, we measured photometry withsimultaneous point spread function fitting across all bands and at all sourcepositions after precise astrometric image alignment (&lt;5-10 milliarcsecondaccuracy). in the outer disk, the photometry reaches a completeness-limiteddepth of f475w~28, while in the crowded, high surface brightness bulge, thephotometry reaches f475w~25. we find that simultaneous photometry and optimizedmeasurement parameters significantly increase the detection limit of the lowestresolution filters (wfc3/ir) providing color-magnitude diagrams that are up to2.5 magnitudes deeper when compared with color-magnitude diagrams from wfc3/irphotometry alone. we present extensive analysis of the data quality includingcomparisons of luminosity functions and repeat measurements, and we useartificial star tests to quantify photometric completeness, uncertainties andbiases. we find that largest sources of systematic error in the photometry aredue to spatial variations in the point spread function models and chargetransfer efficiency corrections. this stellar catalog is the largest everproduced for equidistant sources, and is publicly available for download by thecommunity.

1410.1745	new parsec evolutionary tracks of massive stars at low metallicity:  testing canonical stellar evolution in nearby star forming dwarf galaxies	we extend the {\sl\,parsec} library of stellar evolutionary tracks bycomputing new models of massive stars, from 14\msun to 350\msun. the inputphysics is the same used in the {\sl\,parsec}~v1.1 version, but for themass-loss rate which is included by considering the most recent updates inliterature. we focus on low metallicity, $z$=0.001 and $z$=0.004, for which themetal poor dwarf irregular star forming galaxies, sextans a, wlm and ncg6822,provide simple but powerful workbenches. the models reproduce fairly well theobserved cmds but the stellar colour distributions indicate that the predictedblue loop is not hot enough in models with canonical extent of overshooting. inthe framework of a mild extended mixing during central hydrogen burning, theonly way to reconcile the discrepancy is to enhance the overshooting at thebase of the convective envelope (eo) during the first dredge-up. the mixingscales required to reproduce the observed loops, eo=2\hp or eo=4\hp, aredefinitely larger than those derived from, e.g., the observed location of thergb bump in low mass stars. this effect, if confirmed, would imply a strongdependence of the mixing scale below the formal schwarzschild border, on thestellar mass or luminosity. reproducing the features of the observed cmds withstandard values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicitysignificantly lower than the values measured in these galaxies. otherquantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass function, areonly slightly sensitive to this effect. future investigations will considerother metallicities and different mixing schemes.

1511.00017	envelope overshooting in low metallicity intermediate- and high-mass  stars: a test with the sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy	we check the performance of the {\sl\,parsec} tracks in reproducing the blueloops of intermediate age and young stellar populations at very lowmetallicity. we compute new evolutionary {\sl\,parsec} tracks of intermediate-and high-mass stars from 2\msun to 350\msun with enhanced envelope overshooting(eo), eo=2\hp and 4\hp, for very low metallicity, z=0.0005. the input physics,including the mass-loss rate, has been described in {\sl\,parsec}~v1.2 version.by comparing the synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) obtained from thedifferent sets of models with envelope overshooting eo=0.7\hp (the standard{\sl\,parsec} tracks), 2\hp and 4\hp, with deep observations of the sagittariusdwarf irregular galaxy (sagdig), we find an overshooting scale eo=2\hp to bestreproduce the observed loops. this result is consistent with that obtained by\citet{tang_etal14} for z in the range 0.001-0.004. we also discuss thedependence of the blue loop extension on the adopted instability criterion andfind that, contrary to what stated in literature, the schwarzschild criterion,instead of the ledoux criterion, favours the development of blue loops. otherfactors that could affect the cmd comparisons such as differential internalextinction or the presence of binary systems are found to have negligibleeffects on the results. we thus confirm that, in presence of core overshootingduring the h-burning phase, a large envelope overshooting is needed toreproduce the main features of the central he-burning phase of intermediate-and high-mass stars.

astro-ph;0306099	winds in r coronae borealis stars	we present new spectroscopic observations of the he i $\lambda$10830 line inr coronae borealis (rcb) stars which provide the first strong evidence thatmost, if not all, rcb stars have winds. it has long been suggested that whendust forms around an rcb star, radiation pressure accelerates the dust awayfrom the star, dragging the gas along with it. the new spectra show that nineof the ten stars observed have p-cygni or asymmetric blue-shifted profiles inthe he i $\lambda$10830 line. in all cases, the he i line indicates a massoutflow - with a range of intensity and velocity. around the rcb stars, it islikely that this state is populated by collisional excitation rather thanphotoionization/recombination. the line profiles have been modeled with an seicode to derive the optical depth and the velocity field of the helium gas. theresults show that the typical rcb wind has a steep acceleration with a terminalvelocity of \vinf = 200-350 \kms and a column density of n $\sim10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ in the he i $\lambda$10830 line. there is a possible relationshipbetween the lightcurve of an rcb star and its he i $\lambda$10830 profile.stars which have gone hundreds of days with no dust-formation episodes tend tohave weaker he i features. the unusual rcb star, v854 cen, does not follow thistrend, showing little or no he i absorption despite high mass-loss activity.the he i $\lambda$10830 line in r crb itself, which has been observed at fourepochs between 1978 and 2001, seems to show a p-cygni or asymmetricblue-shifted profile at all times whether it is in decline or at maximum light.

astro-ph;0310187	the ofpe/wn9 stars in m33	we present hst/stis ultraviolet spectra of the six known ofpe/wn9 stars(``slash stars'') in m33. these stars were selected for showing thecharacteristics of the ofpe/wn9 class from previous optical ground-basedspectroscopy. the uv spectra are rich in wind lines, whose strength andterminal velocity vary greatly among our target sample. we analyse the stisspectra with non-lte, line blanketed, spherical models with hydrodynamics,computed with the wm-basic code. we find c to be underabundant and noverabundant, respect to the solar values, with a ratio (by mass) of c/nbetween 0.02 to 0.9 across the sample. some stars show very conspicuous windlines (p cygni profiles), while two stars have extremely weak winds. themass-loss rates thus vary greatly across the sample.  the mass-loss rates of the hottest stars are lower than typical values of wnlstars, but higher than expected for normal population i massive stars. there isindication that the mass-loss rates may be variable in time. the c/n ratio, andthe other physical parameters derived by the spectral modeling (teff, lbol,mass), are consistent with evolutionary calculations for objects withmoderately high initial masses (approx 30-50 solar masses), evolving towardsthe wnl stage through an enhanced mass-loss phase.

astro-ph;0407464	fortis: pathfinder to the lyman continuum	shull et al. (1999) have asserted that the contribution of stars, relative toquasars, to the metagalactic background radiation that ionizes most of thebaryons in the universe remains almost completely unknown at all epochs. thepotential to directly quantify this contribution at low redshift has recentlybecome possible with the identification by galex of large numbers of sparselydistributed faint ultraviolet galaxies. neither stis nor fuse nor galex havethe ability to efficiently survey these sparse fields and directly measure thelyman continuum radiation that may leak into the low redshift (z &lt; 0.4)intergalactic medium. we present here a design for a new type of farultraviolet spectrograph, one that is more sensitive, covers wider fields, andcan provide spectra and images of a large number of objects simultaneously,called the far-ultraviolet off rowland-circle telescope for imaging andspectroscopy (fortis). we intend to use a sounding rocket flight to validatethe new instrument with a simple long-slit observation of the starburstpopulations in the galaxy m83. if however, the long-slit were replaced withmicroshutter array, this design could isolate the chains of blue galaxies foundby galex over an ~30' diameter field-of-view and directly address the lymancontinuum problem in a long duration orbital mission. thus, our development ofthe sounding rocket instrument is a pathfinder to a new wide fieldspectroscopic technology for enabling the potential discovery of the longhypothesized but elusive lyman continuum radiation that is thought to leak fromlow redshift galaxies and contribute to the ionization of the universe.

astro-ph;0411302	the galaxy evolution explorer: a space ultraviolet survey mission	we give an overview of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex), a nasa explorermission launched on april 28, 2003. galex is performing the first space uvsky-survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750angstroms and 1750-2750 angstroms). the surveys include an all-sky imagingsurvey (m[ab] ~ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 square degrees (m[ab] ~23), a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees (m[ab] ~ 25), and a nearbygalaxy survey. spectroscopic grism surveys (r=100-200) are underway withvarious depths and sky coverage. many targets overlap existing or plannedsurveys. we will use the measured uv properties of local galaxies, along withcorollary observations, to calibrate the uv-global star formation raterelationship in local galaxies. we will apply this calibration to distantgalaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map thehistory of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5,and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. the galex missionincludes a guest investigator program supporting the wide variety of programsmade possible by the first uv sky survey.

astro-ph;0411319	uv emission and star formation in stephan's quintet	we present the first galex uv images of the well known interacting group ofgalaxies, stephan's quintet (sq). we detect widespread uv emission throughoutthe group. however, there is no consistent coincidence between uv structure andemission in the optical, h\alpha, or hi. excluding the foreground galaxyngc7320 (sd), most of the uv emission is found in regions associated with thetwo spiral members of the group, ngc7319 and ngc7318b, and the intragroupmedium starburst sq-a. the extinction corrected uv data are analyzed toinvestigate the overall star formation activity in sq. it is found that thetotal star formation rate (sfr) of sq is 6.69+-0.65 m_\sun/yr. among this,1.34+-0.16 m_sun/yr is due to sq-a. this is in excellent agreement with thatderived from extinction corrected h\alpha luminosity of sq-a. the sfr inregions related to ngc 7319 is 1.98+-0.58 m_\sun/yr, most of which(68%) iscontributed by the disk. the contribution from the 'young tail' is only 15%. inthe uv, the 'young tail' is more extended (~100 kpc) and shows a loop-likestructure, including the optical tail, the extragalactic hii regions recentlydiscovered in h\alpha, and other uv emission regions discovered for the firsttime. the uv and optical colors of the 'old tail' are consistent with a singlestellar population of age t ~10^{8.5+-0.4} yrs. the uv emission associated withngc 7318b is found in a very large (~80 kpc) disk, with a net sfr of 3.37+-0.25m_sun/yr. several large uv emission regions are 30 -- 40 kpc away from thenucleus of ngc7318b. although both ngc7319 and ngc7318b show peculiar uvmorphology, their sfr is consistent with that of normal sbc galaxies,indicating that the strength of star formation activity is not enhenced byinteractions.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0605605	ultraviolet through far-infrared spatially resolved analysis of the  recent star formation in m81 (ngc3031)	the recent star formation (sf) in the early-type spiral galaxy m81 ischaracterized using imaging observations from the far-ultraviolet (uv) to thefar-infrared (ir). we compare these data with models of the stellar, gas, anddust emission for sub-galactic regions. our results suggest the existence of adiffuse dust emission not directly linked to the recent sf. we find a radialdecrease of the dust temperature and dust mass density, and in the attenuationof the stellar light. the ir emission in m81 can be modeled with threecomponents: 1) cold dust with a temperature &lt;t_c&gt;=18+-2 k, concentrated nearthe hii regions but also presenting a diffuse distribution; 2) warm dust witht_w=53+-7 k, directly linked with the hii regions; and 3) aromatic molecules,with diffuse morphology peaking around the hii regions. we derive severalrelationships to obtain total ir luminosities from ir monochromatic fluxes, andwe compare five different star formation rate (sfr) estimators for hii regionsin m81 and m51: the uv, halpha, and three estimators based on spitzer data. wefind that the halpha luminosity absorbed by dust correlates tightly with the 24microns emission. the correlation with the total ir luminosity is not as good.important variations from galaxy to galaxy are found when estimating the totalsfr with the 24 microns or the total ir emission alone. the most reliableestimations of the total sfrs are obtained by combining the halpha emission (orthe uv) and an ir luminosity (especially the 24 microns emission), which probethe unobscured and obscured sf, respectively. for the entire m81 galaxy, about50% of the total sf is obscured by dust. the percentage of obscured sf rangesfrom 60% in the inner regions of the galaxy to 30% in the outer zones.

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0612203	galex ultraviolet photometry of globular clusters in m31: three year  results and a catalog	we present ultraviolet (uv) photometry of m31 globular clusters (gcs) foundin 23 galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images covering the entirety of m31. wedetect 485 and 273 gcs (and gc candidates) in the near-ultraviolet (nuv; 2267a) and far-ultraviolet (fuv; 1516 a), respectively. comparing m31 data withthose of galactic gcs in the uv with the aid of population models, we find thatthe age ranges of old gcs in m31 and the galactic halo are similar. threemetal-rich ([fe/h]&gt;-1) gcs in m31 produce significant fuv flux making theirfuv-v colors unusually blue for their metallicities. these are thought to beanalogs of the two peculiar galactic gcs ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 with extendedblue hb stars. based on the models incorporating helium enriched subpopulationsin addition to the majority of the population that have a normal heliumabundance, we suggest that even small fraction of super-helium-richsubpopulations in gcs can reproduce the observed uv bright metal-rich gcs.young clusters in m31 show distinct uv and optical properties from gcs in milkyway. population models indicate that their typical age is less than ~ 2 gyrs. alarge fraction of young gcs have the kinematics of the thin, rapidly rotatingdisk component. however, a subset of the old gcs also shares the thin-diskkinematics of the younger clusters. the existence of young gcs on the outskirtsof m31 disk suggests the occurrence of a significant recent star formation inthe thin-disk of m31. old thin-disk gcs may set constraints on the epoch ofearly formation of the m31 thin-disk. we detect 12 (10) intermediate-age gccandidates in nuv (fuv). we suggest that some of spectroscopically identifiedintermediate-age gcs may not be truly intermediate in age, but rather older gcsthat possess developed hb.

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

astro-ph;0703503	the look-back time evolution of far-ultraviolet flux from the brightest  cluster elliptical galaxies at z &lt; 0.2	we present the galex uv photometry of the elliptical galaxies in abellclusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) for the study of the look-back timeevolution of the uv upturn phenomenon. the brightest elliptical galaxies (m_r &lt;-22) in 12 remote clusters are compared with the nearby giant ellipticalgalaxies of comparable optical luminosity in the fornax and virgo clusters. thesample galaxies presented here appear to be quiescent without signs of massivestar formation or strong nuclear activity, and show smooth, extended profilesin their uv images indicating that the far-uv (fuv) light is mostly produced byhot stars in the underlying old stellar population. compared to theircounterparts in nearby clusters, the fuv flux of cluster giant ellipticalgalaxies at moderate redshifts fades rapidly with ~ 2 gyrs of look-back time,and the observed pace in fuv - v color evolution agrees reasonably well withthe prediction from the population synthesis models where the dominant fuvsource is hot horizontal-branch stars and their progeny. a similar amount ofcolor spread (~ 1 mag) in fuv - v exists among the brightest cluster ellipticalgalaxies at z ~ 0.1, as observed among the nearby giant elliptical galaxies ofcomparable optical luminosity.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
