0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1005.0367	veritas 2008 - 2009 monitoring of the variable gamma-ray source m87	m87 is a nearby radio galaxy that is detected at energies ranging from radioto vhe gamma-rays. its proximity and its jet, misaligned from ourline-of-sight, enable detailed morphological studies and extensive modeling atradio, optical, and x-ray energies. flaring activity was observed at allenergies, and multi-wavelength correlations would help clarify the origin ofthe vhe emission. in this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectralanalysis of the veritas vhe gamma-ray observations of m87 in 2008 and 2009. inthe 2008 observing season, veritas detected an excess with a statisticalsignificance of 7.2 sigma from m87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoringcampaign conducted by three major vhe experiments along with the chandra x-rayobservatory. in february 2008, veritas observed a vhe flare from m87 occurringover a 4-day timespan. the peak nightly flux above 250gev was 7.7% of the crabnebula flux. m87 was marginally detected before this 4-day flare period, andwas not detected afterwards. spectral analysis of the veritas observationsshowed no significant change in the photon index between the flare andpre-flare states. shortly after the vhe flare seen by veritas, the chandrax-ray observatory detected the flux from the core of m87 at a historicalmaximum, while the flux from the nearby knot hst-1 remained quiescent. acciariet al.

1006.5955	veritas search for vhe gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies	indirect dark matter searches with ground-based gamma-ray observatoriesprovide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter thatis complementary to that of direct search or accelerator productionexperiments. we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies draco, ursa minor, bootes 1, and willman 1 conducted by veritas. thesegalaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distanceof several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of thedark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. since theconventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from theseobjects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for thesecondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matterparticles. no significant gamma-ray flux above 200 gev was detected from thesefour dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. the 95% confidenceupper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12photons cm^-2s^-1. we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints onthe thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section andthe relative velocity of the wimps. the limits are obtained under conservativeassumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and areapproximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoreticalprediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as wellas the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions couldfurther lower the limits.

1110.0409	observation and spectral measurements of the crab nebula with milagro	the crab nebula was detected with the milagro experiment at a statisticalsignificance of 17 standard deviations over the lifetime of the experiment. theexperiment was sensitive to approximately 100 gev - 100 tev gamma ray airshowers by observing the particle footprint reaching the ground. the fractionof detectors recording signals from photons at the ground is a suitable proxyfor the energy of the primary particle and has been used to measure the photonenergy spectrum of the crab nebula between ~1 and ~100 tev. the tev emission isbelieved to be caused by inverse-compton up-scattering scattering of ambientphotons by an energetic electron population. the location of a tev steepeningor cutoff in the energy spectrum reveals important details about the underlyingelectron population. we describe the experiment and the technique fordistinguishing gamma-ray events from the much more-abundant hadronic events. wedescribe the calculation of the significance of the excess from the crab andhow the energy spectrum is fit. the fit is consistent with values measured byiacts between 1 and 20 tev. fixing the spectral index to values that have beenmeasured below 1 tev by iact experiments (2.4 to 2.6), the fit to the milagrodata suggests that crab exhibits a spectral steepening or cutoff between about20 to 40 tev.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1401.2828	observations of the unidentified gamma-ray source tev j2032+4130 by  veritas	tev j2032+4130 was the first unidentified source discovered at very highenergies (vhe; e $&gt;$ 100 gev), with no obvious counterpart in any otherwavelength. it is also the first extended source to be observed in vhe gammarays. following its discovery, intensive observational campaigns have beencarried out in all wavelengths in order to understand the nature of the object,which have met with limited success. we report here on a deep observation oftev j2032+4130, based on 48.2 hours of data taken from 2009 to 2012 by theveritas (very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system) experiment.the source is detected at 8.7 standard deviations ($\sigma$) and is found to beextended and asymmetric with a width of 9.5$^{\prime}$$\pm$1.2$^{\prime}$ alongthe major axis and 4.0$^{\prime}$$\pm$0.5$^{\prime}$ along the minor axis. thespectrum is well described by a differential power law with an index of 2.10$\pm$ 0.14$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 0.21$_{sys}$ and a normalization of (9.5 $\pm$1.6$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 2.2$_{sys}$) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev. we interpret these results in the context of multiwavelengthscenarios which particularly favor the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) interpretation.

1403.4308	deep broadband observations of the distant gamma-ray blazar pks 1424+240	we present deep veritas observations of the blazar pks 1424+240, along withcontemporaneous fermi large area telescope, swift x-ray telescope and swift uvoptical telescope data between 2009 february 19 and 2013 june 8. this blazarresides at a redshift of $z\ge0.6035$, displaying a significantly attenuatedgamma-ray flux above 100 gev due to photon absorption via pair-production withthe extragalactic background light. we present more than 100 hours of veritasobservations from three years, a multiwavelength light curve and thecontemporaneous spectral energy distributions. the source shows a higher fluxof (2.1$\pm0.3$)$\times10^{-7}$ ph m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 120 gev in 2009 and2011 as compared to the flux measured in 2013, corresponding to(1.02$\pm0.08$)$\times10^{-7}$ ph m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 120 gev. the measureddifferential very high energy (vhe; $e\ge100$ gev) spectral indices are$\gamma=$3.8$\pm$0.3, 4.3$\pm$0.6 and 4.5$\pm$0.2 in 2009, 2011 and 2013,respectively. no significant spectral change across the observation epochs isdetected. we find no evidence for variability at gamma-ray opacities of greaterthan $\tau=2$, where it is postulated that any variability would be small andoccur on longer than year timescales if hadronic cosmic-ray interactions withextragalactic photon fields provide a secondary vhe photon flux. the datacannot rule out such variability due to low statistics.

1410.5367	constraints on very high energy emission from grb 130427a	prompt emission from the very fluent and nearby (z=0.34) gamma-ray burst grb130427a was detected by several orbiting telescopes and by ground-based,wide-field-of-view optical transient monitors. apart from the intensity andproximity of this grb, it is exceptional due to the extremely long-livedhigh-energy (100 mev to 100 gev) gamma-ray emission, which was detected by thelarge area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope for ~70 ks afterthe initial burst. the persistent, hard-spectrum, high-energy emission suggeststhat the highest-energy gamma rays may have been produced via synchrotronself-compton processes though there is also evidence that the high-energyemission may instead be an extension of the synchrotron spectrum. veritas, aground-based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope array, began follow-upobservations of grb 130427a ~71 ks (~20 hr) after the onset of the burst. thegrb was not detected with veritas; however, the high elevation of theobservations, coupled with the low redshift of the grb, make veritas a verysensitive probe of the emission from grb 130427a for e &gt; 100 gev. thenon-detection and consequent upper limit derived place constraints on thesynchrotron self-compton model of high-energy gamma-ray emission from thisburst.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7144	the most powerful flaring activity from the nlsy1 pmn j0948+0022	we report on multifrequency observations performed during 2012 december-2013august of the first narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy detected in gamma rays, pmnj0948+0022 ($z$ = 0.5846). a gamma-ray flare was observed by the large areatelescope on board fermi during 2012 december-2013 january, reaching a dailypeak flux in the 0.1-100 gev energy range of (155 $\pm$ 31) $\times$10$^{-8}$ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on 2013 january 1, corresponding to an apparent isotropicluminosity of about 1.5$\times$10$^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the gamma-ray flaringperiod triggered swift and veritas observations in addition to radio andoptical monitoring by ovro, mojave, and crts. a strong flare was observed inoptical, uv, and x-rays on 2012 december 30, quasi-simultaneously to thegamma-ray flare, reaching a record flux for this source from optical to gammarays. veritas observations at very high energy (e &gt; 100 gev) during 2013january 6-17 resulted in an upper limit of f (&gt; 0.2 tev) &lt;4.0$\times$10$^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. we compared the spectral energydistribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2013 january with that of anintermediate state observed in 2011. the two seds, modelled as synchrotronemission and an external compton scattering of seed photons from a dust torus,can be modelled by changing both the electron distribution parameters and themagnetic field.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1506.06246	veritas detection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac  object 1es 1727+502 during bright moonlight observations	during moonlit nights, observations with ground-based cherenkov telescopes atvery high energies (vhe, $e&gt;100$ gev) are constrained since the photomultipliertubes (pmts) in the telescope camera are extremely sensitive to the backgroundmoonlight. observations with the veritas telescopes in the standardconfiguration are performed only with a moon illumination less than 35$\%$ offull moon. since 2012, the veritas collaboration has implemented a newobserving mode under bright moonlight, by either reducing the voltage appliedto the pmts (reduced-high-voltage configuration, rhv), or by utilizinguv-transparent filters. while these operating modes result in lower sensitivityand increased energy thresholds, the extension of the available observing timeis useful for monitoring variable sources such as blazars and sources requiringspectral measurements at the highest energies. in this paper we report thedetection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac object 1es 1727+502during rhv observations. this detection represents the first evidence of vhevariability from this blazar. the integral flux is$(1.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 250 gev, which is aboutfive times higher than the low-flux state. the detection triggered additional\veritas\ observations during standard dark-time. multiwavelength observationswith the flwo 48" telescope, and the swift and fermi satellites are presentedand used to produce the first spectral energy distribution (sed) of this objectduring $\gamma$-ray flaring activity. the sed is then fitted with a standardsynchrotron-self-compton model, placing constraints on the properties of theemitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of therelativistic particle population in the jet.
