0901.2587	the wigglez dark energy survey: small-scale clustering of lyman break  galaxies at z &lt; 1	the wigglez dark energy survey is a large-scale structure survey ofintermediate-redshift uv-selected emission-line galaxies scheduled to cover1000 sq deg, spanning a broad redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. the main scientificgoal of the survey is the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) inthe galaxy clustering pattern at a significantly higher redshift than previousstudies. the bao may be applied as a standard cosmological ruler to constraindark energy models. based on the first 20% of the dataset, we present initialresults concerning the small-scale clustering of the wigglez targets, togetherwith survey forecasts. the wigglez galaxy population possesses a clusteringlength r_0 = 4.40 +/- 0.12 mpc/h, which is significantly larger than z=0uv-selected samples, with a slope gamma = 1.92 +/- 0.08. this clustering lengthis comparable to z=3 lyman break galaxies with similar uv luminosities. thefull survey, scheduled for completion in 2010, will map an effective volumev_eff ~ 1 gpc^3 (evaluated at a scale k = 0.15 h/mpc) and will measure theangular-diameter distance and hubble expansion rates in three redshift binswith accuracies ~ 5%. we will determine the value of a constant dark energyequation-of-state parameter, w, with a higher precision than existingsupernovae observations using an entirely independent technique. the wigglezand supernovae measurements lie in highly complementary directions in the planeof w and the matter density omega_m. the forecast using the full combination ofwigglez, supernovae and cmb datasets is a marginalized error sigma(w) = 0.07,providing a robust and precise measurement of the properties of dark energyincluding cross-checking of systematic errors.

0903.1092	the anatomy of the ngc 5044 group -- ii. stellar populations and  star-formation histories	the distribution of galaxy properties in groups and clusters holds importantinformation on galaxy evolution and growth of structure in the universe. whileclusters have received appreciable attention in this regard, the role of groupsas fundamental to formation of the present day galaxy population has remainedrelatively unaddressed. here we present stellar ages, metallicities andalpha-element abundances derived using lick indices for 67 spectroscopicallyconfirmed members of the ngc 5044 galaxy group with the aim of shedding lighton galaxy evolution in the context of the group environment.  we find that galaxies in the ngc 5044 group show evidence for a strongrelationship between stellar mass and metallicity, consistent with theircounterparts in both higher and lower mass groups and clusters. galaxies showno clear trend of age or alpha-element abundance with mass, but these data forma tight sequence when fit simultaneously in age, metallicity and stellar mass.in the context of the group environment, our data support the tidal disruptionof low-mass galaxies at small group-centric radii, as evident from an apparentlack of galaxies below ~10^9 m_sun within ~100 kpc of the brightest groupgalaxy. using a joint analysis of absorption- and emission-line metallicities,we are able to show that the star-forming galaxy population in the ngc 5044group appears to require gas removal to explain the ~1.5 dex offset betweenabsorption- and emission-line metallicities observed in some cases. acomparison with other stellar population properties suggests that this gasremoval is dominated by galaxy interactions with the hot intragroup medium.

0909.0568	southern gems groups ii: hi distribution, mass functions and hi  deficient galaxies	we investigate the neutral hydrogen (hi) content of sixteen groups for whichwe have multi-wavelength data including x-ray observations. wide-field imagingof the groups was obtained with the 20-cm multibeam system on the 64-m parkestelescope. we have detected ten previously uncatalogued hi sources, one ofwhich has no visible optical counterpart. we examine the hi properties of thegroups, compared to their x-ray characteristics, finding that those groups witha higher x-ray temperature and luminosity contain less hi per galaxy. the hicontent of a group depends on its morphological make-up, with those groupsdominated by early-type galaxies containing the least total hi. we determinedthe expected hi for the spiral galaxies in the groups, and found that a numberof the galaxies were hi deficient. the hi deficient spirals were found both ingroups with and without a hot intra-group medium. the hi deficient galaxieswere not necessarily found at the centre of the groups, however, we did findthat two thirds of hi deficient galaxies were found within about 1 mpc from thegroup centre, indicating that the group environment is affecting the gas-lossfrom these galaxies. we determined the hi mass function for a composite sampleof 15 groups, and found that it is significantly flatter than the field hi massfunction. we also find a lack of high hi-mass galaxies in groups. one possiblecause of this effect is the tidal stripping of hi gas from spiral galaxies asthey are pre-processed in groups.

0911.5347	the wigglez dark energy survey: direct constraints on blue galaxy  intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts	correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxy pairs, and between theintrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale density field, may be inducedby tidal fields. these correlations, which have been detected at low redshifts(z&lt;0.35) for bright red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), andfor which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z~0.1, provide a window intogalaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant forcurrent and future weak lensing surveys. measurements of these alignments atintermediate redshifts (z~0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shearobservations are very important for understanding the origin and redshiftevolution of these alignments, and for minimising their impact on weak lensingmeasurements. we present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement forblue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from sdss and spectroscopicredshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. our null detection allows us toplace upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by bluegalaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not requiresignificant model-dependent extrapolation from the z~0.1 sdss observations.also, combining the sdss and wigglez constraints gives us a long redshiftbaseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contaminationof the cosmic shear power spectrum. assuming that the alignments can beexplained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we findthat a measurement of \sigma_8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, cfhtls-like surveywould be contaminated by at most +/-0.02 (95% confidence level, sdss andwigglez) or +/-0.03 (wigglez alone) due to intrinsic alignments.

1104.0223	separating the conjoined red clump in the galactic bulge: kinematics and  abundances	we have used the aaomega spectrograph to obtain r $\sim 1500$ spectra of 714stars that are members of two red clumps in the plaut window galactic bulgefield $(l,b)=0^{\circ},-8^{\circ}$. we discern no difference between the clumppopulations based on radial velocities or abundances measured from the mg$b$index. the velocity dispersion has a strong trend with mg$b$-index metallicity,in the sense of a declining velocity dispersion at higher metallicity. we alsofind a strong trend in mean radial velocity with abundance. our red clumpsample shows distinctly different kinematics for stars with [fe/h] $&lt;-1$, whichmay plausibly be attributable to a minority classical bulge or inner halopopulation. the transition between the two groups is smooth. thechemo-dynamical properties of our sample are reminiscent of those of the milkyway globular cluster system. if correct, this argues for no bulge/halodichotomy and a relatively rapid star formation history. large surveys of thecomposition and kinematics of the bulge clump and red giant branch are neededto define further these trends.

1104.2948	the wigglez dark energy survey: the growth rate of cosmic structure  since redshift z=0.9	we present precise measurements of the growth rate of cosmic structure forthe redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, using redshift-space distortions in thegalaxy power spectrum of the wigglez dark energy survey. our results, whichhave a precision of around 10% in four independent redshift bins, are well-fitby a flat lcdm cosmological model with matter density parameter omega_m = 0.27.our analysis hence indicates that this model provides a self-consistentdescription of the growth of cosmic structure through large-scale perturbationsand the homogeneous cosmic expansion mapped by supernovae and baryon acousticoscillations. we achieve robust results by systematically comparing our datawith several different models of the quasi-linear growth of structure includingempirical models, fitting formulae calibrated to n-body simulations, andperturbation theory techniques. we extract the first measurements of the powerspectrum of the velocity divergence field, p_vv(k), as a function of redshift(under the assumption that p_gv(k) = -sqrt[p_gg(k) p_vv(k)] where g is thegalaxy overdensity field), and demonstrate that the wigglez galaxy-masscross-correlation is consistent with a deterministic (rather than stochastic)scale-independent bias model for wigglez galaxies for scales k &lt; 0.3 h/mpc.measurements of the cosmic growth rate from the wigglez survey and othercurrent and future observations offer a powerful test of the physical nature ofdark energy that is complementary to distance-redshift measures such assupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.

1105.2862	the wigglez dark energy survey: testing the cosmological model with  baryon acoustic oscillations at z=0.6	we measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) in the galaxyclustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date, z=0.6, using thedistribution of n=132,509 emission-line galaxies in the wigglez dark energysurvey. we quantify baos using three statistics: the galaxy correlationfunction, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by xu etal. (2010). the results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0%measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=0.6 (in terms of theacoustic parameter "a(z)" introduced by eisenstein et al. (2005) we finda(z=0.6) = 0.452 +/- 0.018). both baos and power spectrum shape informationcontribute toward these constraints. the statistical significance of thedetection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to awiggle-free model, is 3.2-sigma. the ratios of our distance measurements tothose obtained using baos in the distribution of luminous red galaxies atredshifts z=0.2 and z=0.35 are consistent with a flat lambda cold dark mattermodel that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation. the addition of the currentwigglez data results in a ~ 30% improvement in the measurement accuracy of aconstant equation-of-state, w, using bao data alone. based solely on geometricbao distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w &lt; -1/3) is required with aprobability of 99.8%, providing a consistency check of conclusions based onsupernovae observations. further improvements in cosmological constraints willresult when the wigglez survey dataset is complete.

1108.0635	galaxy and mass assembly: stellar mass estimates	this paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically-derived stellarmass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z &lt; 0.65) galaxies in the galaxy andmass assembly (gama) spectroscopic redshift survey. these masses, as well asthe full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public aspart of gama data release 2. although the gama database does include nirphotometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fitsis significantly poorer when these nir data are included. further, for a largefraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from theoptical-plus-nir photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred fromthe optical data alone. this may indicate problems in our stellar populationlibrary, or nir data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for futureversions of the catalogue. for now, we have chosen to base our stellar massestimates on optical photometry only. in light of our decision to ignore theavailable nir data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained basedon optical data alone. we use generic properties of stellar populationsynthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle avery good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, m*/li. further, we use theobserved relation between restframe (g-i) and m*/li for real gama galaxies toargue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves,(g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate m*/li to an accuracy of &lt; ~0.1dex. this 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-m*/li relation offers a simple andtransparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimaldata, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their resultsto z &lt; ~0.4 measurements from gama.

1108.2637	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic expansion history  using the alcock-paczynski test and distant supernovae	astronomical observations suggest that today's universe is dominated by adark energy of unknown physical origin. one of the most notable consequences inmany models is that dark energy should cause the expansion of the universe toaccelerate: but the expansion rate as a function of time has proven verydifficult to measure directly. we present a new determination of the cosmicexpansion history by combining distant supernovae observations with ageometrical analysis of large-scale galaxy clustering within the wigglez darkenergy survey, using the alcock-paczynski test to measure the distortion ofstandard spheres. our result constitutes a robust and non-parametricmeasurement of the hubble expansion rate as a function of time, which wemeasure with 10-15% precision in four bins within the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt;0.9. we demonstrate that the cosmic expansion is accelerating, in a mannerindependent of the parameterization of the cosmological model (althoughassuming cosmic homogeneity in our data analysis). furthermore, we find thatthis expansion history is consistent with a cosmological-constant dark energy.

1109.6328	measures of galaxy environment - i. what is "environment"?	the influence of a galaxy's environment on its evolution has been studied andcompared extensively in the literature, although differing techniques are oftenused to define environment. most methods fall into two broad groups: those thatuse nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that usefixed apertures. the differences between the two inhibit a clean comparisonbetween analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data,different properties are actually being measured. in this work we apply twentypublished environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrainedto look like the local universe. we find that nearest neighbour-based measuresbest probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses theinter-halo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local densityvariations. the resulting correlation also shows that nearest neighbour galaxyenvironment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. conversely,aperture-based methods that probe super-halo scales accurately identifyhigh-density regions corresponding to high mass haloes. both methods show howgalaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of thelargest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the backgrounddark matter environment. we also warn against using photometric redshifts todefine environment in all but the densest regions. when considering environmentthere are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measuredwith nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo bestmeasured with apertures. this leads to the conclusion that there is nouniversal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scalebeing probed.

1206.0385	the 6df galaxy survey: the near-infrared fundamental plane of early-type  galaxies	we determine the near-infrared fundamental plane (fp) for $\sim10^4$early-type galaxies in the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs). we fit the distributionof central velocity dispersion, near-infrared surface brightness and half-lightradius with a three-dimensional gaussian model using a maximum likelihoodmethod. for the 6dfgs $j$ band sample we find a fp with$r_{e}$\,$\propto$\,$\sigma_0^{1.52\pm0.03}i_{e}^{-0.89\pm0.01}$, similar toprevious near-ir determinations and consistent with the $h$ and $k$ bandfundamental planes once allowance is made for differences in mean colour. theoverall scatter in $r_e$ about the fp is $\sigma_r$,=,29%, and is thequadrature sum of an 18% scatter due to observational errors and a 23%intrinsic scatter. because of the distribution of galaxies in fp space,$\sigma_r$ is not the distance error, which we find to be $\sigma_d$,=,23%.using group richness and local density as measures of environment, andmorphologies based on visual classifications, we find that the fp slopes do notvary with environment or morphology. however, for fixed velocity dispersion andsurface brightness, field galaxies are on average 5% larger than galaxies inhigher-density environments, and the bulges of early-type spirals are onaverage 10% larger than ellipticals and lenticulars. the residuals about the fpshow significant trends with environment, morphology and stellar population.the strongest trend is with age, and we speculate that age is the mostimportant systematic source of offsets from the fp, and may drive the othertrends through its correlations with environment, morphology and metallicity.

1210.2130	the wigglez dark energy survey: final data release and cosmological  results	this paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of thewigglez dark energy survey. we perform full analyses of different cosmologicalmodels using the wigglez power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and0.78, combined with other cosmological datasets. the limiting factor in thisanalysis is the theoretical modelling of the galaxy power spectrum, includingnon-linearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. in this paper weassess several different methods for modelling the theoretical power spectrum,testing them against the gigaparsec wigglez simulations (gigglez). we fit for abase set of 6 cosmological parameters, {omega_b h^2, omega_cdm h^2, h_0, tau,a_s, n_s}, and 5 supplementary parameters {n_run, r, w, omega_k, sum m_nu}. incombination with the cosmic microwave background (cmb), our results areconsistent with the lambdacdm concordance cosmology, with a measurement of thematter density of omega_m =0.29 +/- 0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8= 0.825 +/- 0.017. using wigglez data with cmb and other distance and matterpower spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parametersbeing inconsistent with their lambdacdm model values. the power spectra dataand theoretical modelling tools are available for use as a module for cosmomc,which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data . wealso release the data and random catalogues used to construct the baryonacoustic oscillation correlation function.

1212.3332	megamorph - multi-wavelength measurement of galaxy structure: complete  s\'ersic profile information from modern surveys	in this paper, we demonstrate a new method for fitting galaxy profiles whichmakes use of the full multi-wavelength data provided by modern largeoptical-near-infrared imaging surveys. we present a new version of galapagos,which utilises a recently-developed multi-wavelength version of galfit, andenables the automated measurement of wavelength dependent s\'ersic profileparameters for very large samples of galaxies. our new technique is extensivelytested to assess the reliability of both pieces of software, galfit andgalapagos on both real ugrizy jhk imaging data from the gama survey andsimulated data made to the same specifications. we find that fitting galaxylight profiles with multi-wavelength data increases the stability and accuracyof the measured parameters, and hence produces more complete and meaningfulmulti-wavelength photometry than has been available previously. the improvementis particularly significant for magnitudes in low s/n bands and for structuralparameters like half-light radius re and s\'ersic index n for which a prior isused by constraining these parameters to a polynomial as a function ofwavelength. this allows the fitting routines to push the magnitude of galaxiesfor which sensible values can be derived to fainter limits. the techniqueutilises a smooth transition of galaxy parameters with wavelength, creatingmore physically meaningful transitions than single-band fitting and allowsaccurate interpolation between passbands, perfect for derivation of rest-framevalues.

1302.5178	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic growth rate with  the two-point galaxy correlation function	the growth history of large-scale structure in the universe is a powerfulprobe of the cosmological model, including the nature of dark energy. we studythe growth rate of cosmic structure to redshift $z = 0.9$ using more than$162{,}000$ galaxy redshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. we divide thedata into four redshift slices with effective redshifts $z =[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.76]$ and in each of the samples measure and model the 2-pointgalaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to theline-of-sight. after simultaneously fitting for the galaxy bias factor werecover values for the cosmic growth rate which are consistent with our assumed$\lambda$cdm input cosmological model, with an accuracy of around 20% in eachredshift slice. we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details ofthe assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making closecomparison with a set of n-body simulations for calibration. our measurementsare consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similardataset, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. wedetermine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametricmanner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, andinvestigate the alcock-paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial modelon the results. our techniques should prove useful for current and futuregalaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the 2-dimensionalcorrelation function.

1306.4031	the wigglez dark energy survey: star-formation in uv-luminous galaxies  from their luminosity functions	we present the ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function of galaxies from thegalex medium imaging survey with measured spectroscopic redshifts from thefirst data release of the wigglez dark energy survey. this sample selectsgalaxies with high star formation rates: at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 the median starformation rate is at the upper 95th percentile of optically-selected (r&lt;22.5)galaxies and the sample contains about 50 per cent of all nuv &lt; 22.8, 0.6 &lt; z &lt;0.9 starburst galaxies within the volume sampled.  the most luminous galaxies in our sample (-21.0&gt;m_nuv&gt;-22.5) evolve veryrapidly with a number density declining as (1+z)^{5\pm 1} from redshift z = 0.9to z = 0.6. these starburst galaxies (m_nuv&lt;-21 is approximately a starformation rate of 30 \msuny) contribute about 1 per cent of cosmic starformation over the redshift range z=0.6 to z=0.9. the star formation ratedensity of these very luminous galaxies evolves rapidly, as (1+z)^{4\pm 1}.such a rapid evolution implies the majority of star formation in these largegalaxies must have occurred before z = 0.9.  we measure the uv luminosity function in 0.05 redshift intervals spanning0.1&lt;z&lt;0.9, and provide analytic fits to the results. at all redshifts greaterthan z=0.55 we find that the bright end of the luminosity function is not welldescribed by a pure schechter function due to an excess of very luminous(m_nuv&lt;-22) galaxies. these luminosity functions can be used to create a radialselection function for the wigglez survey or test models of galaxy formationand evolution. here we test the agn feedback model in scannapieco et al.(2005), and find that this agn feedback model requires agn feedback efficiencyto vary with one or more of the following: stellar mass, star formation rateand redshift.

1306.4963	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy radial alignments in gama groups	we constrain the distributions of projected radial alignment angles ofsatellite galaxy shapes within the galaxy and mass assembly survey groupcatalogue. we identify the galaxy groups using spectroscopic redshifts andmeasure galaxy projected ellipticities from sloan digital sky survey imaging.with a sample of 3,850 groups with 13,655 satellite galaxies with high qualityshape measurements, we find a less than 2-sigma signal of radial alignments inthe mean projected ellipticity components and the projected position angle whenusing galaxy shape estimates optimized for weak lensing measurements. ourradial alignment measurement increases to greater than 3-sigma significancerelative to the expectation for no alignments if we use 2-d s\'ersic model fitsto define galaxy orientations. our weak measurement of radial alignments is inconflict with predictions from dark matter n-body simulations, which weinterpret as evidence for large mis-alignments of baryons and dark matter ingroup and cluster satellites. within our uncertainties, that are dominated byour small sample size, we find only weak and marginally significant trends ofthe radial alignment angle distributions on projected distance from the groupcentre, host halo mass, and redshift that could be consistent with a tidaltorquing mechanism for radial alignments. using our lensing optimized shapeestimators, we estimate that intrinsic alignments of galaxy group members maycontribute a systematic error to the mean differential projected surface massdensity of groups inferred from weak lensing observations by -1 +/- 20% atscales around 300 kpc/h from the group centre assuming a photometric redshiftr.m.s. error of 10%, and given our group sample with median redshift of 0.17and median virial masses ~10^{13} h^{-1}m_{sun}.

1411.6355	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mass-size relations of z$&lt;$0.1 galaxies  subdivided by s\'ersic index, colour and morphology	we use data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey in the redshiftrange 0.01$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.1 (8399 galaxies in $g$ to $k_s$ bands) to derive thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations for various divisions of 'early'and 'late'-type samples. we find the choice of division between early and late(i.e., colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical, however, theadopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e., the careful rejection ofoutliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. in particular wenote that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits($&lt;10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$) the s\'ersic index bimodality, evident for highmass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separatorof early- and late-type systems. the final set of stellar mass $-$ half-lightradius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10bands ($ugrizzyjhk_s$) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-zbenchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. exploring the variation of thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlierfindings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at asmaller level than previously noted: at $10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$ bothspiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13% from $g$ to $k_s$(which is near linear in log wavelength). finally we note that the sizes usedin this work are derived from 2d s\'ersic light profile fitting (usinggalfit3), i.e., elliptical semi-major half light radii, improving on earlierlow-z benchmarks based on circular apertures.

1503.01465	the accretion histories of brightest cluster galaxies from their stellar  population gradients	we analyse the spatially-resolved stellar populations of 9 local ($z&lt;0.1$)brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) observed with vimos in ifu mode. our sampleis composed of 7 slow-rotating and 2 fast-rotating bcgs. we do not find aconnection between stellar kinematics and stellar populations in this smallsample. the bcgs have shallow metallicity gradients (median $\delta$[fe/h] $=-0.11\pm0.1$), high central metallicities (median $[$fe/h]$_{[\alpha/fe]=0} =0.13\pm0.07$), and a wide range of central ages (from 5 to 15 gyr). we proposethat the reason for this is diverse evolutionary paths in bcgs. 67 per cent ofthe sample (6/9) show $\sim 7$ gyr old central ages, which reflects an activeaccretion history, and 33 per cent of the sample (3/9) have central ages olderthan 11 gyr, which suggest no star formation since $z=2$. the bcgs show similarcentral stellar populations and stellar population gradients to early-typegalaxies of similar mass (m$_{dyn}&gt; 10^{11.3}$m$_{\odot}$) from theatlas$^{3d}$ survey (median [z/h] $= 0.04\pm0.07$, $\delta$[z/h] $=-0.19\pm0.1$). however, massive early-type galaxies from atlas$^{3d}$ haveconsistently old ages (median age $=12.0\pm3.8$gyr). we also analyse the closemassive companion galaxies of two of the bcgs. these galaxies have similarstellar populations to their respective bcgs.

1505.05518	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): trends in galaxy colours, morphology,  and stellar populations with large scale structure, group, and pair  environments	we explore trends in galaxy properties with mpc-scale structures usingcatalogues of environment and large scale structure from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. existing gama catalogues of large scale structure,group and pair membership allow us to construct galaxy stellar mass functionsfor different environmental types. to avoid simply extracting the knownunderlying correlations between galaxy properties and stellar mass, we create amass matched sample of galaxies with stellar masses between $9.5 \leq\log{m_*/h^{-2} m_{\odot}} \leq 11$ for each environmental population. usingthese samples, we show that mass normalised galaxies in different large scaleenvironments have similar energy outputs, $u-r$ colours, luminosities, andmorphologies. extending our analysis to group and pair environments, we showgalaxies that are not in groups or pairs exhibit similar characteristics toeach other regardless of broader environment. for our mass controlled sample,we fail to see a strong dependence of s\'{e}rsic index or galaxy luminosity onhalo mass, but do find that it correlates very strongly with colour. repeatingour analysis for galaxies that have not been mass controlled introduces andamplifies trends in the properties of galaxies in pairs, groups, and largescale structure, indicating that stellar mass is the most important predictorof the galaxy properties we examine, as opposed to environmentalclassifications.

1506.05466	h-atlas/gama: quantifying the morphological evolution of the galaxy  population using cosmic calorimetry	using results from the herschel astrophysical terrahertz large-area surveyand the galaxy and mass assembly project, we show that, for galaxy masses aboveapproximately 1.0e8 solar masses, 51% of the stellar mass-density in the localuniverse is in early-type galaxies (etgs: sersic n &gt; 2.5) while 89% of the rateof production of stellar mass-density is occurring in late-type galaxies (ltgs:sersic n &lt; 2.5). from this zero-redshift benchmark, we have used a calorimetrictechnique to quantify the importance of the morphological transformation ofgalaxies over the history of the universe. the extragalactic backgroundradiation contains all the energy generated by nuclear fusion in stars sincethe big bang. by resolving this background radiation into individual galaxiesusing the deepest far-infrared survey with the herschel space observatory and adeep near-infrared/optical survey with the hubble space telescope (hst), andusing measurements of the sersic index of these galaxies derived from the hstimages, we estimate that approximately 83% of the stellar mass-density formedover the history of the universe occurred in ltgs. the difference between thisand the fraction of the stellar mass-density that is in ltgs today impliesthere must have been a major transformation of ltgs into etgs after theformation of most of the stars.

1507.00737	the masses of satellites in gama galaxy groups from 100 square degrees  of kids weak lensing data	we use the first 100 sq. deg. of overlap between the kilo-degree survey(kids) and the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey to determine the galaxyhalo mass of ~10,000 spectroscopically-confirmed satellite galaxies in massive($m &gt; 10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm m}_\odot$) galaxy groups. separating the sample as afunction of projected distance to the group centre, we jointly model thesatellites and their host groups with navarro-frenk-white (nfw) densityprofiles, fully accounting for the data covariance. the probed satellitegalaxies in these groups have total masses $\log m_{\rm sub} /(h^{-1}{\rmm}_\odot) \approx 11.7 - 12.2$ consistent across group-centric distance withinthe errorbars. given their typical stellar masses, $\log m_{\rm\star,sat}/(h^{-2}{\rm m}_\odot) \sim 10.5$, such total masses imply stellarmass fractions of $m_{\rm \star,sat} /m_{\rm sub} \approx 0.04 h^{-1}$ . theaverage subhalo hosting these satellite galaxies has a mass $m_{\rm sub} \sim0.015m_{\rm host}$ independent of host halo mass, in broad agreement with theexpectations of structure formation in a $\lambda$cdm universe.

1509.05035	the gas phase mass metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies: dependence  on star formation rate and hi gas mass	using a sample of dwarf galaxies observed using the vimos ifu on the vlt, weinvestigate the mass-metallicity relation (mzr) as a function of star formationrate (fmr$_{\text{sfr}}$) as well as hi-gas mass (fmr$_{\text{hi}}$). wecombine our ifu data with a subsample of galaxies from the alfalfa hi surveycrossmatched to the sloan digital sky survey to study the fmr$_{\text{sfr}}$and fmr$_{\text{hi}}$ across the stellar mass range 10$^{6.6}$ to 10$^{8.8}$m$_\odot$, with metallicities as low as 12+log(o/h) = 7.67. we find the1$\sigma$ mean scatter in the mzr to be 0.05 dex. the 1$\sigma$ mean scatter inthe fmr$_{\text{sfr}}$ (0.02 dex) is significantly lower than that of the mzr.the fmr$_{\text{sfr}}$ is not consistent between the ifu observed galaxies andthe alfalfa/sdss galaxies for sfrs lower than 10$^{-2.4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,however this could be the result of limitations of our measurements in thatregime. the lowest mean scatter (0.01 dex) is found in the fmr$_{\text{hi}}$.we also find that the fmr$_{\text{hi}}$ is consistent between the ifu observeddwarf galaxies and the alfalfa/sdss crossmatched sample. we introduce thefundamental metallicity luminosity counterpart to the fmr, again characterizedin terms of sfr (fml$_{\text{sfr}}$) and hi-gas mass (fml$_{\text{hi}}$). wefind that the fml$_{\text{hi}}$ relation is consistent between the ifu observeddwarf galaxy sample and the larger alfalfa/sdss sample. however the 1$\sigma$scatter for the fml$_{\text{hi}}$ relation is not improved over thefmr$_{\text{hi}}$ scenario. this leads us to conclude that thefmr$_{\text{hi}}$ is the best candidate for a physically motivated fundamentalmetallicity relation.

1510.06038	the sami galaxy survey: can we trust aperture corrections to predict  star formation?	in the low redshift universe (z&lt;0.3), our view of galaxy evolution isprimarily based on fibre optic spectroscopy surveys. elaborate methods havebeen developed to address aperture effects when fixed aperture sizes only probethe inner regions for galaxies of ever decreasing redshift or increasingphysical size. these aperture corrections rely on assumptions about thephysical properties of galaxies. the adequacy of these aperture corrections canbe tested with integral-field spectroscopic data. we use integral-field spectradrawn from 1212 galaxies observed as part of the sami galaxy survey toinvestigate the validity of two aperture correction methods that attempt toestimate a galaxy's total instantaneous star formation rate. we show thatbiases arise when assuming that instantaneous star formation is traced bybroadband imaging, and when the aperture correction is built only from spectraof the nuclear region of galaxies. these biases may be significant depending onthe selection criteria of a survey sample. understanding the sensitivities ofthese aperture corrections is essential for correct handling of systematicerrors in galaxy evolution studies.

1512.02342	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the stellar mass budget by galaxy type	we report an expanded sample of visual morphological classifications from thegalaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey phase two, which now includes 7,556objects (previously 3,727 in phase one). we define a local (z &lt;0.06) sample andclassify galaxies into e, s0-sa, sb0-sba, sab-scd, sbab-sbcd, sd-irr, and"little blue spheroid" types. using these updated classifications, we derivestellar mass function fits to individual galaxy populations divided both bymorphological class and more general spheroid- or disk-dominated categorieswith a lower mass limit of log(mstar/msun) = 8 (one dex below earliermorphological mass function determinations). we find that all individualmorphological classes and the combined spheroid-/bulge-dominated classes arewell described by single schechter stellar mass function forms. we find thatthe total stellar mass densities for individual galaxy populations and for theentire galaxy population are bounded within our stellar mass limits and derivean estimated total stellar mass density of rho_star = 2.5 x 10^8 msun mpc^-3h_0.7, which corresponds to an approximately 4% fraction of baryons found instars. the mass contributions to this total stellar mass density by galaxiesthat are dominated by spheroidal components (e and s0-sa classes) and by diskcomponents (sab-scd and sd-irr classes) are approximately 70% and 30%,respectively.

astro-ph;0111364	evolution of brightest cluster galaxies in x-ray clusters	a recent paper (burke, collins &amp; mann 2000) presents the analysis of thek-band hubble diagram of 76 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in x-ray clustersand shows that the properties of bcgs depend on the x-ray luminosity (lx) oftheir host clusters. unfortunately, the low numbers of nearby clusters in thissample makes it difficult to constrain evolutionary trends. in this letter weextend the hubble diagram of burke et al. (2000) to a total of 155 clustersusing new data on 79 bcgs at z&lt;0.1 from the 2mass extended source catalogue. weshow that the major division between bcgs in high and low-lx clustersdisappears at z&lt;0.1, with bcgs having similar absolute magnitudes independentof the x-ray luminosity of their host clusters. at larger redshifts the k-bandlight of bcgs in high-lx systems is consistent with little or no merging backto z~0.8, whereas bcgs in the low-lx systems have a different evolutionaryhistory, with many increasing their mass by a factor &gt;4 since z~1. thisprovides direct evidence of hierarchical merging in a galaxy population.

astro-ph;0605279	southern gems groups i: dynamical properties	here we present an investigation of the properties of 16 nearby galaxy groupsand their constituent galaxies. the groups are selected from the groupevolution multi-wavelength study (gems) and all have x-ray as well aswide-field neutral hydrogen (hi) observations. group membership is determinedusing a friends-of-friends algorithm on the positions and velocities from the6-degree field galaxy survey (6dfgs) and nasa/ipac extra-galactic database(ned). for each group we derive their physical properties using thismembership, including: velocity dispersions (sigma_v), virial masses (m_v),total k-band luminosities (l_k(tot)) and early-type fractions (f_early) andpresent these data for the individual groups. we find that the gems x-rayluminosity is proportional to the group velocity dispersions and virial masses:l_x(r_500)\propto\sigma_v^{3.11\pm0.59} and l_x(r_500)\proptom_v^{1.13\pm0.27}, consistent with the predictions of self-similarity betweengroup and clusters. we also find that m_v\propto l_k(tot)^{2.0\pm0.9}, i.e.mass grows faster than light and that the fraction of early-type galaxies inthe groups is correlated with the group x-ray luminosities and velocitydispersions. we examine the brightest group galaxies (bggs), finding that,while the luminosity of the bgg correlates with its total group luminosity, thefraction of group luminosity contained in the bgg decreases with increasingtotal group luminosity. this suggests that bggs grow by mergers at early timesin group evolution while the group continues to grow by accreting infallinggalaxies.
