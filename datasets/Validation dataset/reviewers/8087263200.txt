84927690767	Risk of Dementia Among Patients With Asthma: A Nationwide Longitudinal Study	Background: Previous studies have suggested an association between asthma and dementia, but the results are still inconsistent. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we enrolled 11,030 participants aged more than 45 years with asthma and 44,120 (1:4) age-/sex-matched controls between 1998 and 2008, and followed them to the end of 2011. Cases of any dementia or Alzheimer's disease that developed during the follow-up period were identified. Results: Asthma was associated with an increased risk of developing any dementia [hazard ratio (HR): 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.87-2.52] and Alzheimer's disease (HR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.71-4.02).Stratified by age, both asthma in midlife (>45 years and <65 years) and in late life (≥65 years) was associated with a greater likelihood of any dementia (HR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.41; HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.74-2.44). Discussion: Asthma in midlife and in late life increased the risk of developing any dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The underlying mechanisms between asthma and dementia require further investigation.

14844290875	Association of AIDS and bipolar mania with rapid progression to dementia and death	Neuropsychiatric complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) may present clinically as acute or chronic organic brain syndrome, or mimic functional psychiatric diseases. Among such psychiatric diseases, mania tends to occur with increased frequency after the onset of AIDS. We report a case in which manic manifestations were noted before the diagnosis of AIDS. The patient had no past or family history of mood disorders, but had risk factors for HIV infection. He had a rapid downhill course from initial manic symptoms to depression, dementia and then death within 10 months. Such rapid cognitive deterioration into AIDS dementia after mania is consistent with previous reports. Cases like this will become more common with spread of the AIDS pandemic in Asian regions, including Taiwan. Clinicians should be mindful of HIV infection/AIDS as a differential diagnosis in patients with manic episodes and risk factors for HIV infection. © 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

22744440697	Add-on rTMS for medication-resistant depression: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in Chinese patients	Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been developed as a novel tool for improving depression by delivering magnetic stimulation to the brain. However, the apparent effects of rTMS on depression have been varied in different studies. The aims of this study were to determine whether left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rTMS can alleviate medication-resistant depression in Chinese patients and to investigate what demographic variables or clinical features may predict better response. Method: We designed a 2-week randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study of add-on rTMS. A total of 30 medication-resistant patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, depressed episode completed 10 sessions of active or sham rTMS-10 patients at each of 2 frequencies, faster (20 Hz) or slower (5 Hz) at 100% motor threshold, and 10 patients at sham stimulation. Results: Patients at both stimulation frequencies demonstrated a superior reduction of depression severity compared to sham stimulation (active = 55.7% vs. sham = 16.3%). The response rate for active rTMS was 60%, in contrast to 10% for the sham treatment. No difference in clinical response was observed between 5 Hz and 20 Hz active rTMS. Clinical variables showed that younger age and less severe depression at entry may predict the clinical response to rTMS. Except for 1 patient in which rTMS appeared to induce mania, this procedure posed no safety problem. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of rTMS in Chinese patients. Since not all the rTMS trials in previous reports had positive results, further larger trials are still warranted.

33646932496	Ziprasidone-associated pedal edema in the treatment of schizophrenia	It has been reported that second generation of antipsychotic drugs may induce pedal edema. The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate that the recently marketed antipsychotic drug, ziprasidone induced pedal edema with an increased plasma immunoglobulin E (IgE) level. A 51-year-old female schizophrenic patient who developed severe pedal edema was treated with ziprasidone for 6 weeks. Admission routine data that included biochemical, blood and urine analysis were normal except for the plasma IgE level, which was significantly elevated. Although the pedal edema subsided after discontinuation of ziprasidone and administration of diuretics, the plasma IgE level remained high. This is the first case report attempting to demonstrate the existence of ziprasidone-induced pedal edema in the treatment of schizophrenia. In this case, the pedal edema was associated with an IgE-related allergic reaction. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33746886660	Association of initial antipsychotic response to clozapine and long-term weight gain	Objective: The aim of this study was to test whether the initial antipsychotic response to clozapine is related to subsequent weight change. Method: This study was an 8-year retrospective chart review of 96 hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Data on monthly weight change, initial clinical response, age, gender, clozapine dose, and concomitant use of mood stabilizers and other antipsychotics were analyzed. Results: Fifty-five (57.3%) of the patients received clozapine over the entire 8-year period; these subjects experienced an average weight gain of 11.7 kg (SD=1.6). Seventeen of these patients (30.9%) who had a significant initial clinical response (CGI improvement rating of 1 or 2 during the first 14 months) gained significantly more weight (13.8 kg [SD=8.4]) than did the 38 patients without a significant initial response (4.5 kg [SD=12.0]). Multiple linear regression analysis showed significant initial clinical response and lower baseline body mass index were associated with significantly more weight gain. Conclusions: The results show that initial antipsychotic response to clozapine is associated with subsequent long-term weight gain as measured over 8 years.

33748325796	Neural correlates of antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia, an fMRI study	Schizophrenia patients were known to have oculomotor abnormalities for decades and several studies had found antisaccade impairment to be a biological marker of schizophrenia. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural circuits responsible for antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia. Ten normal controls and 10 DSM-IV schizophrenia patients performed antisaccade tasks and control tasks during fMRI. Data were analyzed and task-specific activations were identified using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM-2). In normal subjects, antisaccade tasks activated bilateral frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobules, inferior parietal lobules, occipital visual cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and lentiform nuclei (P < 0.001). By contrast, schizophrenia patients failed to show activation in bilateral lentiform nucleus, bilateral thalamus, and left inferior frontal gyrus during antisaccade performance. Our findings suggest that schizophrenic antisaccade deficits are associated with dysfunction of fronto-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits previously demonstrated to be responsible for suppression of the reflexive saccade. Left inferior frontal gyrus, which was known to be responsible for response inhibition on "go/no-go" testing, also plays an important role in schizophrenic antisaccade deficit. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33750717144	Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation of the nurses in a structured SARS caring unit during outbreak: A prospective and periodic assessment study in Taiwan	To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units. Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]). Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support. Results showed that depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (p < 0.05). For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p < 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred. The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit. Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings. Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress. In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33751015400	Dopamine transporters and cognitive function in methamphetamine abuser after a short abstinence: A SPECT study	The purpose of this study was to examine the change of dopamine transporters (DAT) binding in methamphetamine (METH) abusers in a two-week period of abstinence and its association with cognitive function. Seven healthy subjects and seven METH abusers were recruited. At baseline conditions, the values of specific uptake ratio (SUR) of DAT binding measured by single photon emission computed tomography were lower in METH abusers than in controls. After a two-week period of abstinence, DAT binding was partially recovered and there were no statistic differences in SUR between METH abusers and controls. There was a borderline correlation between the changes of DAT binding in the right, but not the left, striatum and the %Error of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. These findings indicate that DAT binding in METH abusers can be reversed in a short period of abstinence. The recovery of DAT binding was asymmetric and possibly parallel with the improvement of cognitive function. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

33847719912	The effect of templates on 99MTc-ECD SPECT healthy brain perfusion analysis using statistical parametric mapping	Objective: In vivo stability of tracer distribution of 99MTc-ECD SPECT images for healthy individuals are important to the application of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in neurological studies. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software has been designed for voxel-by-voxel analysis of the whole brain imaging. Spatial normalization is the essential preprocessing step to transform individual images into the MNI standard template which corresponds with Talairach anatomic coordinates. However, the SPECT standard template provided with SPM2 software is 99MTc-HMPAO brain perfusion image. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of templates on 99MTc-ECD test-retest study of healthy brain perfusion analysis. Material and Methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in this study. SPECT images were acquired at 30 minutes after injection of 740 MBq of 99MTc-ECD. We utilized three kinds of spatial normalization templates to assess the outcome of 99MTc-ECD test-retest study: (1) the standard SPM2 SPECT template; (2) an 99MTe-ECD template; and (3) an MRI-based normalization template. Statistical model of paired t-test was applied and the changes of rCBF were significant if corrected p value was less than 0.05. Results: Test-retest of 99MTc-ECD images showed no changes ofrCBFin each template. However, we found there are slight differences among the different normalization templates. Conclusion: Investigations of rCBF under varying input conditions, such as physiological state, could be neglected. Thus, we have good reproducibility of 99MTc-ECD images. In addition, using anatomical normalization, which requires MRI data from individual subject, may be the best spatial transformation approach.

32044454182	Selective posterior cerebral artery amobarbital test in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy for surgical treatment	Purpose: To evaluate whether the selective posterior cerebral artery amobarbital test (PCAAT) can predict postoperative memory function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) for surgical treatment and its clinical safety. Methods: The database included adult patients with intractable TLE undergoing presurgical evaluation at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1995 and 2002. The PCAAT was carried out on patients who had failed conventional intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) or had IAT results that evoked a concern of postoperative memory function decline. A battery of learning and memory testing was performed immediately before and after injection of amobarbital into the peduncular segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) on the presumed hemisphere of epileptogenicity. Neuropsychological assessments were followed in surgically treated patients. Results: A total of 16 patients completed PCAAT successfully and underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Four patients failed PCAAT angiographic procedures due to technical difficulty in one patient, transient signs of vasospasm in two patients, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in one patient. Of the 12 patients who performed well in PCAAT learning and memory testing items by free recall or recognition, only 1 patient demonstrated postoperative memory decline in follow-up neuropsychological assessments. In contrast, two of the four patients with a deficit in PCAAT memory testing showed postoperative memory decline. Regarding subjective memory function (not necessarily associated with objective memory decline), patients not seizure-free after ATL were more likely to have memory complaints (in 3 out of 6 patients) than patients with seizure-free outcomes (in 1 out of 10 patients). Conclusions: The PCAAT memory test reliably predicts postoperative memory function in patients with TLE for surgical treatment. However, the inherent risks of PCAAT must be considered and it should be used judiciously. © 2006 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0034524575	Comorbidity of depressive and anxiety disorders in chronic daily headache and its subtypes	Objective. - To investigate the frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders in patients with chronic daily headache. Background. - There is a lack of data in the literature on the extent of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with different subtypes of chronic daily headache. Methods. - We recruited consecutive patients with chronic daily headache seen in a headache clinic from November 1998 to December 1999. The subtypes of chronic daily headache were classified according to the criteria proposed by Silberstein et al. A psychiatrist evaluated the patients according to the structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess the comorbidity of depressive and anxiety disorders. Results. - Two hundred sixty-one patients with chronic daily headache were recruited. The mean age was 46 years, and 80% were women. Transformed migraine was diagnosed in 152 patients (58%) and chronic tension-type headache in 92 patients (35%). Seventy-eight percent of patients with transformed migraine had psychiatric comorbidity, including major depression (57%), dysthymia (11%), panic disorder (30%), and generalized anxiety disorder (8%). Sixty-four percent of patients with chronic tension-type headache had psychiatric diagnoses, including major depression (51%), dysthymia (8%), panic disorder (22%), and generalized anxiety disorder (1%). The frequency of anxiety disorders was significantly higher in patients with transformed migraine after controlling for age and sex (P= .02). Both depressive and anxiety disorders were significantly more frequent in women. Conclusion. - Psychiatric comorbidity, especially major depression and panic disorders, was highly prevalent in patients with chronic daily headache seen in a headache clinic. These results demonstrate that women and patients with transformed migraine are at higher risk of psychiatric comorbidity.

77954468916	A neuronal fiber tracking study for major depressive disorder using MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tractography	Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) had been proved to be a powerful tool to investigate the white matter integrity and visualize the neuronal axons in vivo. Most of the DTI-based studies mainly used the region-of-interest approach to investigate the abnormalities in areas of white matter tracts involved in mood regulation for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we explored the structure of the fiber connections in whole-brain white matter for both major depressive patients and healthy subjects based on the DTI tractography. With the automatic anatomical labeling (AAL) process, each individual brain can be partitioned into ninety regions in normalized space so that the number of the connected fibers and histograms of the fiber lengths between any paired regions can be estimated. Twenty-three MDD patients and twenty-four age and gender-matched normal subjects were recruited. Our results concluded that: 1) the numbers of connected fibers revealed significant increase (pvalue < 0.005) in the MDD group compared with the normal group in mood-regulation related region pairs consisting of right superior frontal gyrus to right pallidum, right putamen to right precuneus, left pallidum to left precuneus, left superior parietal gyrus to right superior occipital gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus to right middle temporal gyrus, and both side lingual gyrus to both side superior temporal gyrus. Only two region pairs manifested significant decrease (p-value < 0.005) in patient group, which were right insula to right superior temporal gyrus, and right precuneus to right inferior temporal gyrus; 2) the distributions of the connected fiber lengths for the detected region pairs with the increasing or decreasing fibers in MDD group were between 10 to 30 mm. © 2010 IEEE.

77954530579	Investigation of differences on cortical connectivity between patients with major depressive disorder and normal subjects using mr diffusion tensor imaging	Functional and structural neuroimaging studies of major depression disorder (MDD) have identified neurophysiologic abnormalities in multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex, the insula, the amygdale and the related parts of the striatum and thalamus. The functional knowledge of MDD was mainly obtained from the fMRI and PET studies, which reveal the local differences in blood oxygenation and metabolism of the specific neurotransmitters, respectively. For the structural studies, the T1-based and DTI (diffusion tensor image)-based studies, which defined the abnormalities in cortical thickness and the integrity of the white matter, respectively, were commonly used. However, most of these studies only addressed the local differences compared to the normal subjects and were limited to provide the overall associations of the cortical connectivity within the patient group. In this study, we employed the DTI-based fiber bundle tracking technique along with the graph theoretical analysis to investigate the difference of cortical connectivity between the patients with MDD and the normal group from both the global (mean properties for all regions) and local (region-by-region) aspects. Out results concluded that: 1) there were no globally but locally significant difference between two groups, specifically, the increase of the local connectivity in parietal and occipital lobes to compensate the decrease of the connectivity in frontal and temporal lobe; 2) the connection strength from left insula to left superior temporal pole was stronger in normal group than that in MDD group; 3) the connection strengths from left putamen to left triangular inferior frontal gyrus and left precuneus, were stronger in patient group than that in normal group. © 2010 IEEE.

84867322964	Major Depressive Disorder and Stroke Risks: A 9-Year Follow-Up Population-Based, Matched Cohort Study	Background and Purpose: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by recurrent depressive episodes and one of the treatment choices is antidepressants. Patients with MDD are at greater risk of developing major metabolic diseases that may in turn lead to stroke. Moreover, both depressive symptoms and taking antidepressant medications are associated with higher risk of stroke. However, whether and how clinical depression increases stroke risk remains an unanswered question. Our aim was to provide answers to this question. Methods: A matched cohort study of 5015 subjects (1003 MDD patients and 4012 control subjects) was conducted using a nationwide database. Subjects were followed to a maximum of 9 years to determine rates of newly-developed strokes, and controls and MDD groups with different levels of antidepressant refractoriness were compared to determine the temporal relation between stroke and three major metabolic comorbidities (i.e., diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia). The levels of depressive symptoms and the antidepressant medications before stroke onset were investigated. Results: Patients with MDD had significantly higher rates of stroke (4.3% vs. 2.8%, p<0.05) during the follow-up. Mediation regression analyses revealed that the occurrence of stroke in the MDD subjects was significantly mediated by the development of major metabolic diseases. Greater severity of depression, but not greater use of antidepressants, preceded the occurrence of stroke. Conclusions: A clinical diagnosis of major depression leads to stroke indirectly through more intense depressive symptoms and the development of major comorbidities. © 2012 Li et al.

84888045939	The risk of cancer among patients with sleep disturbance: A nationwide retrospective study in Taiwan	Purpose: To investigate the risk of cancer among patients with nonapnea sleep disorders (SDs). Methods: We included newly diagnosed SD patients aged 20 years and older without antecedent cancer between 2000 and 2010 from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancers were calculated to compare the cancer incidence of patients with SD with that of the general population. Results: During the 10-year study period, 2062 cancers developed among 63,381 SD patients, who were observed for 382,826 person-years (median follow-up of 6.23 years). The SIR for all cancers was 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.24). For specific cancer types, SD patients exhibited an increased SIR for liver and lung cancers (1.44; 95% CI, 1.28-1.61 and 1.34; 95% CI, 1.18-1.51, respectively). Conclusions: We observed that overall cancer risk is increased among Asian SD patients. In terms of individual cancers, the risks of liver and lung cancers were elevated. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of increased liver and lung cancers among SD patients in Taiwan. A prospective study is necessary to confirm these findings. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84897516992	Abnormal early gamma responses to emotional faces differentiate unipolar from bipolar disorder patients	This study investigates the cortical abnormalities of early emotion perception in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) using gamma oscillations. Twenty-three MDD patients, twenty-five BD patients, and twenty-four normal controls were enrolled and their event-related magnetoencephalographic responses were recorded during implicit emotional tasks. Our results demonstrated abnormal gamma activity within 100 ms in the emotion-related regions (amygdala, orbitofrontal (OFC) cortex, anterior insula (AI), and superior temporal pole) in the MDD patients, suggesting that these patients may have dysfunctions or negativity biases in perceptual binding of emotional features at very early stage. Decreased left superior medial frontal cortex (smFC) responses to happy faces in the MDD patients were correlated with their serious level of depression symptoms, indicating that decreased smFC activity perhaps underlies irregular positive emotion processing in depressed patients. In the BD patients, we showed abnormal activation in visual regions (inferior/middle occipital and middle temporal cortices) which responded to emotional faces within 100 ms, supporting that the BD patients may hyperactively respond to emotional features in perceptual binding. The discriminant function of gamma activation in the left smFC, right medial OFC, right AI/inferior OFC, and the right precentral cortex accurately classified 89.6% of patients as unipolar/bipolar disorders. © 2014 T.

84908138102	Is atopy in early childhood a risk factor for ADHD and ASD? A longitudinal study	Objective: Previous studies have found a temporal concordance in the increased prevalence of atopic diathesis/atopic diseases, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) worldwide. But, the temporal association among these 3 distinct diseases is unknown. Method: 14,812 atopic subjects diagnosed with any atopic disease (asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or allergic conjunctivitis) before the age of 3 (atopic cohort) and 6944 non-atopic subjects with no lifetime atopic disease (non-atopic cohort), born between 1997 and 2000, were enrolled and followed to December 31, 2010 to identify the development of ADHD and ASD. Results: The presence of any atopic disease in early childhood increased the risk of developing ADHD (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.97) and ASD (HR: 3.40) in later life. Greater numbers of atopic comorbidities (4 comorbidities: ADHD: HR: 2.53; ASD: HR: 4.29) were significantly related to a greater risk of developing ADHD and ASD. Discussion: Atopic diathesis in early childhood elevated the risk of developing ADHD and ASD in later life, with the dose-dependent relationship of more atopic comorbidities with a greater likelihood of ADHD and ASD.

44149114723	p11 is up-regulated in the forebrain of stressed rats by glucocorticoid acting via two specific glucocorticoid response elements in the p11 promoter	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. Despite the extensive study of the neurobiological correlates of this disorder, the underlying mechanisms of PTSD are still poorly understood. Recently, a study demonstrated that dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid, can up-regulate p11, known as S100A10-protein which is down-regulated in patients with depression, (Yao et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2003) a common comorbid disorder in PTSD. These observations led to our hypothesis that traumatic stress may alter expression of p11 mediated through a glucocorticoid receptor. Here, we demonstrate that inescapable tail shock increased both prefrontal cortical p11 mRNA levels and plasma corticosterone levels in rats. We also found that Dex up-regulated p11 expression in SH-SY5Y cells through glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) within the p11 promoter. This response was attenuated by either RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist or mutating two of three glucocorticoid response elements (GRE2 and GRE3) in the p11 promoter. Finally, we showed that p11 mRNA levels were increased in postmortem prefrontal cortical tissue (area 46) of patients with PTSD. The data obtained from our work in a rat model of inescapable tail shock, a p11-transfected cell line and postmortem brain tissue from PTSD patients outline a possible mechanism by which p11 is regulated by glucocorticoids elevated by traumatic stress.

4544282274	Prevalence and risk factors of insomnia in community-dwelling Chinese elderly: A Taiwanese urban area survey	Objective: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for self-reported sleep complaints in the elderly. Method: A cross-sectional interview study was conducted in a total of 2045 non-institutionalized older individuals aged 65 years or above of an urban community of Taiwan. Results: The prevalence of one-month insomnia was 6% overall with a higher rate in elderly women (8%) than men (4.5%). Frequent use of hypnotics over the past month was 8.4%. Among specific sleep complaints, poor sleep quality was the most commonly reported symptom, followed by difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep or early morning awakenings. Increasing age did not correlate with an increased rate of insomnia and female gender was not an independent risk factor. Factors associated with insomnia for both genders were nocturnal micturation (OR = 20.6) and regular use of hypnotics; (OR = 3.2). Pulmonary disease (OR = 2.7), not married (OR = 2.3), excessive daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.4), and mental illness (OR = 8.6) were risk factors for men while lack of education (OR = 1.8) and body pain (OR = 2.6) were risk factors for women. Depression (OR = 2.2) was strongly associated with insomnia in the elderly women as well. Conclusions: There was a low insomnia prevalence rate in the urban elderly community. Identified insomniacs required treatment of physical and mental problems, particularly in gender-specific risk factors. For those who complained of putative poor sleep quality symptom, early intervention may halt their progress of sleep disturbance and avoid unnecessary benzodiazepine use. Future longitudinal studies to investigate causes of insomnia, as well as its detrimental effects on mood and health, are warranted.

4544355375	Effect of 5 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cognition during a Go/NoGo task	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been developed as a novel tool for modulating cognition by delivering stimulation in the brain. However, the effects of rTMS on cognition are still controversial. This randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study was designed to determine whether rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) interferes with the Go/NoGo task and whether personal parameters such as age affect rTMS. A total of 24 healthy subjects (12 male and 12 female, aged 20-37 years) underwent one session of active rTMS followed by sham rTMS (total of 1600 pulses, 100% of motor threshold, 5 Hz, 8 s), or vice versa. The results did not show any differences between active and sham rTMS stimulation in terms of performance accuracy, response speed, or choice reaction time (cRT) implicating that short-term rTMS will not enhance or deteriorate cognition. However, percentage cRT shortening induced by active rTMS was negatively correlated with age (r=-0.57, P=0.005), whereas that induced by sham rTMS was not (r=-0.23, P>0.05), suggesting that cognition of younger subjects might have greater modulation by active stimulation than older ones. This finding may help explain some of the controversies or paradoxical results observed in studies of the effect of left DLPFC rTMS on cognition. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

46249126653	Effect of age, gender, menopausal status, and ovarian hormonal level on rTMS in treatment-resistant depression	This study examines how gender and menopausal status contribute to age effect on the antidepressant efficacy of repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS). Thirty-one women (17 premenopausal, 14 postmenopausal), and 16 men with treatment-refractory bipolar/major depression underwent 10 consecutive sessions of rTMS. Mood symptoms and female hormones were measured. ANOVA-R revealed a significant gender (p<0.05) and time effect (p<0.001) on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score. Percentage reduction of the rating correlated negatively with age in women (p<0.001). While no difference in the rTMS response was observed between male and premenopausal female patients (68.8% and 70.6%, respectively), postmenopausal women responded least (0%). We also found that greater improvement of depression score was associated with a higher estradiol/progesterone ratio in premenopausal women (p<0.05), suggesting an important role of female hormones in the therapeutic response. Regression analysis revealed that menopausal status and ovarian steroid levels, but not age, were the main determinants of antidepressant efficacy of rTMS in females. This is the first study to specifically investigate the effect of female hormones on rTMS therapeutic effect. Our data support changes in menopausal status and ovarian steroid levels as effectors of mood and the CNS neural substrate response to rTMS in refractory depression. However, the restricted number of patients and the shorter duration of rTMS treatment and follow-up might influence its generalization. Further study examining the interactions between mood, ovarian hormones, and rTMS treatment is warranted. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

53049094199	Impaired frontal synchronization of spontaneous magnetoencephalographic activity in patients with bipolar disorder	Recent functional imaging studies demonstrated that brain exhibit coherent, synchronized activities during resting state and the dynamics may be impaired in various psychiatric illnesses. In order to investigate the change of neural dynamics in bipolar disorder, we used a new nonlinear measurement "similarity index" to analyze the magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and test the hypothesis that there are synchronization changes within different frequency bands in the frontal cortex of patients with bipolar disorder. Ten patients with bipolar I disorder during euthymic phase and ten normal controls underwent 2 min eye-closed resting recording with a whole-head 306-channel MEG system. Eleven channels of MEG data from frontal area were selected for analysis. Synchronization level in the delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-24 Hz) bands was calculated for each subject and compared across group. The results showed that significant dynamic changes in bipolar patients can be characterized by increased synchronization of slow frequency oscillations (delta) and decreased synchronization of fast frequency oscillations (beta). Furthermore, the positive correlation between beta synchronization level and preservative errors in Wisconcin card sorting task was found which would implicate the deficit of executive function in bipolar patients. Our findings indicate that analysis of spontaneous MEG recordings at resting state using nonlinear dynamic approaches may disclose the subtle regional changes of neural dynamics in BD. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

56349165734	Adult normative data of the wisconsin card sorting test in Taiwan	Background: The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a widely used neuropsychological test for assessing executive functions. However, the lack of culture-specific norms has often limited clinical interpretation of performance on the WCST. The aims of this study were to establish adult norms for the WCST in Taiwan, and to understand the development of performance on the WCST among age groups. Methods: A total of 475 participants (233 males, 242 females) aged from 20 to 89 years were divided into 10 age groups. All of the participants completed the WCST, and 6 indices of WCST were calculated, including percent errors (PE), percent perseverative responses (PPR), percent perseverative errors (PPE), percent non-perseverative errors (PNPE), percent conceptual-level responses (PCLR), and categories completed (CC). Results: There were several findings. First, our data showed that there was no evidence of a significant difference between manual card and computerized card presentation versions of WCST on the PE, PPR, PPE, PNPE, PCLR, and CC indices. Second, no education and gender effects on WCST performance were found. Third, although WCST indices were significantly different among age groups, no remarkable differences among the groups after 30 years of age were found. Finally, compared with Heaton's USA norms, WCST performance in Taiwanese was poorer than the USA sample in most age groups. Conclusion: The WCST is not sensitive enough to detect aging-related cognitive changes in the Taiwanese population, and there are different performances on WCST between Taiwanese and USA people. The adult norms for WCST in Taiwan will provide an important reference for future research and clinical practice. © 2008 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

60249087027	Weight gain with clozapine: 8-year cohort naturalistic study among hospitalized Chinese schizophrenia patients	Objective: Clozapine is associated with significant weight gain. However, it is still debatable whether the majority of weight gain occurs in the early phase of treatment or if weight gain is a persistent side effect. The inconsistent results in previous outpatient studies may be due to many confounding factors, such as variations in drug adherence, diet content, activity level and environmental factors. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term weight changes in hospitalized Chinese schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine. Methods: Patients were admitted at the largest mental hospital in Taiwan and had routine monthly body weight monitoring during the study period. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted to obtain demographic data, age at which clozapine treatment was initiated, and weight changes after the initiation of clozapine treatment. Results: The study sample consisted of 349 hospitalized schizophrenic patients, including 204 males (58.8%), with an average age at clozapine initiation of 38.6 ± 9.3 and an average clozapine dosage of 318 ± 9.3 mg/day. Body weight increased over time, and reached a plateau at month 42. Younger age at clozapine initiation (P = 0.0038) and lower baseline body mass index (BBMI) (P < 0.0001) were associated with more weight gain. The patients with BBMI < 25 gained significantly more weight (10.98±8.48 kg) compared to patients with BBMI ≧ 25 (1.17 ± 13.29 kg) (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Similar to reports on Caucasians, clozapine-associated weight gain in Chinese patients reached a plateau at month 42. Younger patients with normal BBMI were associated with higher risk of weight gain. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

61849094296	Cortical complexity analysis of patients with bipolar disorder using three-dimensional gyrification index	Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common affective disorder. In morphometric brain imaging studies, BD subjects have atrophic gray matter, especially in the prefrontal area. These structural abnormalities could involve the change of cortical shape. Gyrification index (GI) is a useful metric to measure the degree of cortical complexity. This work aims to compare the cortical development between bipolar patients and healthy controls using GI. No significant difference was detected between two groups. However, we found asymmetry pattern of cortical complexity was increased in limbic lobe on bipolar patients. Significant negative correlation was also observed between rating scores and asymmetry coefficients in frontal lobe. © 2008 IEEE.

62649133735	White matter abnormalities in schizophrenia patients with tardive dyskinesia: A diffusion tensor image study	Objective: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a severe side effect of antipsychotics. While increasing evidence suggests that damaged brain microcircuitry of white matter (WM) is responsible for the clinical symptoms in schizophrenia, no reports of WM abnormality associated with TD were noted. Method: Brain white matter abnormalities were investigated among 20 schizophrenia patients with TD (Schizophrenia with TD group), 20 age-, gender-, and handedness-matched schizophrenic patients without TD (Schizophrenia without TD group), and 20 matched healthy subjects with magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging analysis. Voxel-wise analysis was used to compare fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of the white matter following intersubject registration to Talairach space. Clinical ratings included the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), and the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Results: The study subjects were 75% female with average of 40.1 ± 9. 8 years. The Schizophrenia with TD group had significantly higher PANSS total scores (p = 0.024), PANSS negative score (p = 0.001), SAS (p < 0.001) and AIMS (p < 0.001) scores; and demonstrated more widespread FA decreases than the Schizophrenia without TD group, especially over the inferior frontal gyrus, temporal sublobar extranuclear WM (around the basal ganglion), parietal precuneus gyrus WM (around somatosensory cortex), and medial frontal gyrus WM (around dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). The AIMS (p < 0.01) and SAS (p < 0.01) score positively correlated with decreased FA over these areas, and PANSS negative score positively correlated with FA decrease over medial frontal gyrus WM (p < 0.01). Conclusions: More widespread abnormality of white matter was noted among schizophrenia patients than those without, especially involved cortico-basal ganglion circuits with clinical symptom correlation of involuntary movements and negative symptoms. Further studies with larger sample size are required to validate the findings. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

65649141647	Comorbidity of cardiovascular diseases with mood and anxiety disorder: A population based 4-year study	Accumulating evidence from Caucasian patients has shown that depression, bipolar and anxiety disorders are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but reports in the Asian population are limited, and age effect is rarely investigated. This population-based study was carried out to examine and compare the CVD comorbidities among patients with mood and anxiety disorders in different age groups. Method: A 4-year cross-sectional survey was carried out using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2003. Results: An average total of 1 031 557 patients with mood and anxiety disorders were enrolled as study participants, including 76 430 cases of major depressive disorder, 41 557 cases of bipolar disorder, and 913 570 cases of anxiety disorder. When compared with the insured population without mood or anxiety disorders (average 21 356 304 people), the average relative risk (RR) of developing ischemic heart disease and hypertensive disorders in 1 031 557 study participants was 2.0 and 2.05, respectively. The highest RR was found in the age group under 20 years (RR = 4.74 and 4.08, respectively), and the lowest RR in the age group equal to or older than 65 years (RR = 0.47 and 0.58, respectively). Conclusions: Taiwanese patients with mood and anxiety disorders experience high cardiovascular morbidity, especially patients with anxiety disorders. Age acted as an important modifier variable that influenced the relationship between mood, anxiety disorder and CVD. This study highlights the need for future research in different age groups, in order to elucidate the causality and the trajectory of developing CVD among patients with mental disorders. © 2009 Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology.

67649313503	Medically Unexplained Symptoms and Somatoform Disorders: Diagnostic Challenges to Psychiatrists	Clinical limitations of the criteria of somatoform disorders (SDs) have been criticized. However, little objective evidence supports this notion. We aimed to examine the prevalence of SDs in a population with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS), which was expected to have higher probabilities meriting such diagnoses, and to evaluate factors that may influence the clinical judgment of psychiatrists. Methods: Data of subjects with MUS (n = 101, 9.5%) as their chief consulting problems, of 1,068 consecutive ethnic Chinese adult medical inpatients referred for consultation-liaison psychiatry services, were reviewed. Psychiatric diagnoses including SDs and clinical variables were collected. Those with SDs were followed-up 1 year later, and structured interviews were applied. Results: Patients with MUS had a high level of psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression (35.6%) and anxiety disorder (29.7%), rather than SDs (9.9%). Most diagnosed with SDs suffered from persistent MUS at the 1-year follow-up. Pain was the most common presentation of MUS. Most of the subjects diagnosed with SDs were female and younger, with multiple painful sites at presentation, no past psychiatric diagnosis and no comorbid organic diagnoses. The diagnosis of SDs was seldom given in those with simultaneous MUS and mood symptoms. Conclusion: A significant proportion (9.5%) of patients in psychiatric consultation suffered from MUS, and most were comorbid with depression and anxiety. The identification of SDs was made in only 9.9%. Because MUS are associated with a high rate of mental comorbidities, psychiatric consultations while facing such clinical conditions are encouraged. © 2009 Elsevier.

67349244019	Association of adiponectin and metabolic syndrome among patients taking atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia: A cohort study	Introduction: Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone controlling lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, has been suggested to be a biomarker for metabolic syndrome in the general population. This study investigated the association between adiponectin levels and metabolic syndrome in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Methods: Anthropometric and metabolic parameters and serum adiponectin levels were assessed in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia who had used the same atypical antipsychotic for at least 3 months. Retrospective reviews of the patients' medical records were conducted to obtain demographic data and pretreatment characteristics. Results: The study included 567 schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine (n = 231), olanzapine (n = 94) and risperidone (n = 242), for an average of 45.8 ± 27.8 months. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among all subjects was 23.8%. The clozapine group had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (28.7%) than did the olanzapine (24.2%) and risperidone groups (19.5%) (P = 0.039), and the clozapine group had lower levels of adiponectin (8.46 ± 6.02 mg/mL) than did the olanzapine (10.26 ± 4. 9 mg/mL) and risperidone groups (10.69 ± 7.43 mg/mL) (P = 0.001). Adiponectin level was negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) increase after initiation of antipsychotic treatment. Cross-sectional regression analysis showed that age (OR, = 1.042, P = 0.001), BMI (OR = 1.404, P < 0.0001), and adiponectin level (OR = 0.862, P < 0.0001) were significant factors in the presence of metabolic syndrome. Significant predictors of metabolic syndrome were age at initiation of antipsychotic treatment (OR = 1.04, P = .007), BMI at initiation of antipsychotic treatment (OR = 1.44, P < 0.0001), BMI increase after initiation of antipsychotic treatment (OR = 1.40, P < 0.0001), and adiponectin level (OR = 0.86, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Lower levels of adiponectin and weight gain after taking antipsychotics are associated with higher risk of metabolic syndrome in patients taking atypical antipsychotics.

68049142116	Gamma knife radiosurgery for the treatment of recurrent seizures after incomplete anterior temporal lobectomy	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in treating temporal lobe epilepsy, GKS was performed in four adult patients with recurrent complex partial seizures who underwent incomplete anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) but were reluctant to undergo a second resective surgery. A marginal dose of 24.5-25 Gy, corresponding to 65-70% isodose curve, was delivered to the treatment target that included the residual amygdala and the head and anterior body of the hippocampus. None of the patients had severe acute side effects but three patients had radiation-induced MRI signal changes around the target volume 13, 20, and 24 months after GKS, respectively. All four patients had significant seizure reduction during the first 6-month period and clinical efficacy persisted throughout the 2-year follow-up period. All of the patients also had improved neuropsychological profiles, including memory function and quality-of-life, compared to their pre-GKS conditions. In conclusion, the safety and clinical efficacy of GKS make it a reasonable and suitable therapeutic alternative for patients with recurrent seizures after incomplete ATL. A higher marginal dose of >25 Gy and wider coverage may be more clinically beneficial but warrant further investigation. © 2009 British Epilepsy Association.

68949212300	Levels of the potential biomarker p11 in peripheral blood cells distinguish patients with PTSD from those with other major psychiatric disorders	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severely debilitating anxiety disorder. Over 80% of patients with PTSD also exhibit other psychiatric condition, such as bipolar disorder (BP) or major depression (MDD). Previously, it has been found that p11 mRNA expression was significantly changed in post mortem cortex of patients with PTSD and depression. We hypothesize that p11 mRNA levels in the peripheral blood cells will be a potential biomarker for PTSD with heterogeneity in terms of type of trauma, time since trauma and duration of illness. We examined the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) P11 mRNA of patients with PTSD (n = 13), major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 16), bipolar disorder (BP, n = 24), and schizophrenia (SCZ, n = 12) or controls (n = 14) using quantitative real-time PCR and the circulating levels of cortisol in blood plasma and saliva of PTSD using radioimmunoassay kit CORT-CT2. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HARS), the Chinese version of the Davidson Trauma Scale-Frequency (CDTS-F) and the Chinese version of the Davidson Trauma Scale-Severity (CDTS-S), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were administered. We found that patients with PTSD had lower levels of p11 mRNA than control subjects, while those with MDD, BP and SCZ had significantly higher p11 levels than the controls. P11 mRNA levels were positively correlated with the scores of HAMD (r = 0.62, p < 0.05), CDTS-F (r = 0.71, p < 0.05) and CDTS-S (r = 0.62, p < 0.05), while they did not correlate with scores of HARS and IES-R. Basal levels of plasma and salivary cortisol of PTSD patients were not statistically different from those of controls. Our findings suggest that PBMC p11 mRNA expression levels may serve as a potential biomarker to distinguish PTSD from BP, MDD and SCZ.

70449363857	Depression is the Strongest Independent Risk Factor for Poor Social Engagement Among Chinese Elderly Veteran Assisted-living Residents	Background: Social engagement prolongs the lifespan and preserves cognition in the elderly. However, most studies concerning social engagement have been conducted in Western countries; few have been performed in the Chinese population. This study attempted to identify the risk factors for poor social engagement among elderly veterans in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 597 male veterans were enrolled, with a mean age of 80.8 ± 5.0 years. This cross-sectional study employed the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) Minimum Data Set (MDS), the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to investigate significant independent risk factors for poor social engagement, which were identified using the MDS Index of Social Engagement (ISE). Results: Mean ISE score was 1.5 ± 1.3 (range, 0-5); 52% of subjects had poor levels of social engagement (ISE < 2; 312/597). Regression analyses suggested that depression (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2.7-16.1; p < 0.001), illiteracy (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.8; p = 0.003), the presence of unsettled relationships (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.7; p = 0.004), and cognitive impairment (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9; p = 0.03) were significant independent risk factors for poor social engagement, after controlling for age, marital status, level of daily living activity and degree of sensory impairment. Conclusion: Poor social engagement is common among Chinese assisted-living veteran home residents. Depression is the greatest risk factor of poor social engagement in this population. © 2009 Elsevier.

70449371206	Sex Distribution and Psychiatric Features of Child and Adolescent Conversion Disorder Across 2 Decades	Background: Earlier research suggested female predominance in adult conversion disorder, and the strong association between conversion disorder and experiences of being abused is well known. However, the data for child and adolescent populations are limited. In Taiwan, the dramatic increase in child abuse may have some impact on the features of child and adolescent conversion disorder. This study aimed to compare the demographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, and experiences of being abused in Taiwanese children and adolescents diagnosed with conversion disorder in psychiatric consultations across 2 decades. Methods: Retrospective and consecutive chart reviews were conducted for child and adolescent patients (< 20 years old) who were newly diagnosed with conversion disorder in psychiatric consultations at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 1987 to 2006. The first group included patients who were diagnosed between 1987 and 1996 (the first decade), and the second group included patients who were diagnosed between 1997 and 2006 (the second decade). Results: A total of 42 patients diagnosed with conversion disorder were included in this study. Nineteen of the 42 subjects were diagnosed in the first decade (from 1987 to 1996), and 23 in the second decade (from 1997 to 2006). There existed among patients a tendency toward an increasing number of male subjects (p < 0.05), suffering more abuse (p < 0.05), and higher prevalence rates of depression and dysthymia comorbidity (p < 0.05) in the second decade compared to the first. Conclusion: The sex distribution in conversion disorder might have significantly changed over the past 2 decades. There is an increasing need for screening and interventions for psychiatric comorbidity and experiences of being abused in children and adolescents with conversion disorder. Because of the small sample size of our study, further studies that include multiple study sites and a larger number of patients are needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn. © 2009 Elsevier.

73349138625	Preoperative IQ predicts seizure outcomes after anterior temporal lobectomy	Purpose: IQ tests are frequently used in the preoperative neuropsychological assessment of candidates for anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). We reviewed IQ test results and surgery outcomes to evaluate the roles of IQ tests in the preoperative work-up. Methods: A total of 205 adult patients who had undergone ATL and whose seizure outcomes were followed for 2 years after surgery were included. The short form WAIS-R was used to estimate intelligence. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the variables for IQ and seizure outcomes. Results: Education, duration of epilepsy and gender were factors that accounted for 24.6% of the variance in the full-scale IQ (FSIQ) scores. The verbal IQ and performance IQ discrepancies at various magnitudes could not lateralize the seizure foci. Freedom of seizure was noted in 128 (62.4%) of the patients. Seizure outcomes, however, correlated with the preoperative FSIQ. After adjustment for variables that affect seizure outcomes, the FSIQ was an independent predictor of postoperative seizure outcomes (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p = 0.003). Of patients who had FSIQ lower than 70, 50% became free from seizures by 2 years after surgery. Conclusions: In our study, IQ tests were unable to lateralize seizure foci but may serve as an independent predictor of postoperative seizure outcomes. Since a longer duration of epilepsy had deleterious effects on intelligence, earlier surgical intervention might better preserve neuropsychological function and, consequently, allow better seizure control after ATL. Nonetheless, patients with lower IQ scores could still benefit from ATL. © 2009 British Epilepsy Association.

75249093084	Structural and cognitive deficits in remitting and non-remitting recurrent depression: A voxel-based morphometric study	Remission is the optimal outcome for major depressive disorder (MDD), but many patients do not improve appreciably despite treatment with medication. Treatment-resistant patients may experience deterioration in cognitive functions. Research has reported structural abnormalities in certain brain areas that may contribute to a poor clinical response. We hypothesize that there will be structural differences between patients able to achieve remission and those responding poorly to antidepressants. In the first voxel-based morphometric (VBM) study comparing remitting with non-remitting MDD, we investigated gray matter volume (GMV) differences between depressives to determine which structural abnormalities existed, and correlated these with diminished cognitive functioning. Of 44 adults with recurrent MDD, 19 had full remissions and 25 were non-remitters after a 6-week trial with antidepressant treatment. Remission was defined by 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores of ≤ 7 for at least 2 weeks. VBM and neuropsychological studies were conducted on all patients and 25 healthy controls. The patients who remitted revealed milder visual attention deficits than did controls. This correlated with reduced GMV in the left postcentral gyrus (Brodmann area, or BA, 3) and the bilateral medial/superior frontal gyrus (BA 6). The non-remitting patients had reduced GMV in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA 9), and impaired acoustic and visual attention associated with GMV differences in several cortical regions, thalamus and amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus. These findings indicated that patients whose MDD remitted were cognitively and morphologically different from non-remitters. Voxel-based structural deficits in the left DLPFC may characterize a subgroup of people with recurrent MDD who respond poorly to antidepressants. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

76449112167	Review of wireless and wearable electroencephalogram systems and brain-computer interfaces - A mini-review	Biomedical signal monitoring systems have rapidly advanced in recent years, propelled by significant advances in electronic and information technologies. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is one of the important research branches and has become a hot topic in the study of neural engineering, rehabilitation, and brain science. Traditionally, most BCI systems use bulky, wired laboratory-oriented sensing equipments to measure brain activity under well-controlled conditions within a confined space. Using bulky sensing equipments not only is uncomfortable and inconvenient for users, but also impedes their ability to perform routine tasks in daily operational environments. Furthermore, owing to large data volumes, signal processing of BCI systems is often performed off-line using high-end personal computers, hindering the applications of BCI in real-world environments. To be practical for routine use by unconstrained, freely-moving users, BCI systems must be noninvasive, nonintrusive, lightweight and capable of online signal processing. This work reviews recent online BCI systems, focusing especially on wearable, wireless and real-time systems. © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

76649104041	Gender differences in the relationship between depression and cardiac autonomic function among community elderly	Objective: The mechanism underlying the differential effect of depression on morbidity and mortality in men and women remains unknown. This survey was designed to examine gender effects on the relationship between depressive symptoms and cardiac autonomic function among community dwelling elderly. Methods: Six hundred and six randomly selected community-dwelling elderly men and women ≥65 years of age were enrolled. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Frequency-domain indices of HRV were obtained. Results:Among the subjects, 58.4% were male with a mean age of 77.9 years. Stratified analyses by gender revealed a dose-response association between depressive symptoms and lower cardiac vagal control among elderly males ( p=0.003). Male subjects with mild depressive symptoms (depression scores: 5-6) showed prominent cardiac sympathetic predominance compared with the reference group (depression scores:<5) ( p=0.005). In contrast, these findings did not exist among elderly females. Conclusions: The association of depressive symptoms with poor cardiac vagal control and sympathetic predominance was more robust among elderly males than females. This finding may help explain gender differences in the association of depression with morbidity and mortality. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

77950971206	Systemic Amyloidosis Manifesting as a Rare Cause of Hepatic Failure	In 1854, the term "amyloid" was first used in the description of a liver specimen at autopsy by Virchow. The kidneys and heart are the most commonly involved organs in amyloidosis; liver and gastrointestinal tract involvement is less common, and the symptoms are usually mild. Here, we report the case of a 57-year-old male patient who presented with oral hemorrhagic bullae, thrombocytopenia and jaundice. Disseminated intravascular coagulation profile was positive. Abdominal sonography showed ascites, and abdominal computed tomography disclosed heterogeneous enhancement of the liver, with focal low attenuation regions and splenomegaly with poor contrast enhancement. Liver decompensation was highly suspected. Diagnostic laparoscopy with liver biopsy and colonoscopic biopsy from the rectum were subsequently performed. Typical apple-green birefringence was demonstrated on polarized light microscopy by Congo red staining. Systemic amyloidosis was diagnosed and colchicine prescribed. However, liver function deteriorated and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding was found during the patient's hospitalization. The patient died due to uncorrectable coagulopathy and massive gastrointestinal bleeding. The final diagnosis was idiopathic amyloidosis with hepatic failure. Although amyloidosis rarely presents with hepatic failure, it should be considered in patients with signs of liver decompensation. Clinicians should be aware of this rare but potentially lethal presentation and arrange appropriate treatment promptly. © 2010 Elsevier.

77952428337	Intrinsic functional connectivity of the periaqueductal gray, a resting fMRI study	The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is known to play a crucial role in pain modulation and has shown a strong interaction with anterior cingulate cortex in previous functional imaging studies. We investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity of PAG using resting fMRI data from 100 subjects. The results showed that PAG is functionally connected to ACC (rostral and pregenual ACC) and also rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), forming a core ACC-PAG-RVM network for pain modulation even no pain stimulus is applied. The comparison between genders showed that for the contrast of female minus male, significant difference was observed at mid-cingulate cortex; for the contrast of male minus female, significant differences were observed at left medial orbital prefrontal cortex, and uncus; right insula/operculum and prefrontal cortex.We believe eluciation of this intrinsic PAG network duing the resting state will enhance our physiological and pathological understandings of the development and maintenance of chronic pain states. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77952549164	The Wada memory test and prediction of outcome after anterior temporal lobectomy	We reviewed the records of 77 Chinese-speaking adult patients to investigate the relationship between the Wada memory test and outcomes after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). The ipsilateral memory scores, contralateral memory scores and Wada asymmetry index (WAI) were calculated to evaluate their relationships with seizure and cognitive outcomes. The seizure outcomes did not correlate with the unilateral memory scores or the WAI. Patients who had a smaller WAI tended to have a post-operative decline in verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) (odds ratio: 13.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-156.11, p = 0.037). The seven patients who failed the Wada memory test after ipsilateral injection had a higher percentage of VIQ deterioration than the 70 who passed (p = 0.039). However, no patient displayed global amnesia after surgery. The Wada memory test was a predictor for post-operative VIQ changes in our study. Patients who failed the Wada memory test still benefitted from the ATL and showed good seizure outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77952105544	Distinct neuronal oscillatory responses between patients with bipolar and unipolar disorders: A magnetoencephalographic study	Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) have distinct pathophysiologies but similar depressive appearances. The present study aimed at the differentiation of the brain responses between BD and MDD patients. We hypothesized that different affective disorder patients may have distinct patterns of oscillatory cortical activities in response to negative emotional stimuli. Methods: Twenty BD patients, twenty MDD patients, and twenty age- and gender-matched healthy normal subjects were recruited. We adopted an implicit emotional task with facial image stimuli. The acquired event-related magnetoencephalographic signals were processed by the time-frequency analysis and beamformer-based source imaging techniques followed by statistical inference. Results: We found that there were gamma oscillation decreases in the frontal regions of both BD and MDD patients, gamma oscillation increases in the bilateral temporal regions of MDD, and alpha-beta rhythm increases in BD patients. Relative to the cortical activation in the control group, the BD patients displayed more widely increased oscillatory activities over the fronto-parieto-occipital regions than MDD patients. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the distinct neuropathological patterns of emotional responses in BD and MDD patients. The findings suggest that the dysfunction of emotion regulation in BD may result from the increased sensitivity to emotionally salient information, implicating the potential cause of the emotion lability. The present study also suggests that the implicit emotional task is an effective approach to differentiate bipolar from unipolar disorders and their distinct neuropathological patterns to emotional stimuli may provide objective and quantitative measures for potential diagnostic significance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77954463588	Investigation of differences on functional connectivity in major depressive disorder using functional magnetic resonance imaging	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common affective disorders which ranks among the top causes of worldwide disease burden and disability. Recent studies suggested that MDD resulted in the functional connectivity alteration in the resting state brain networks, such as the emotional circuit and the default mode network (DMN). In addition to these emotion-relevant networks, some other brain regions, such as cuneus gyrus, lingual gyrus and precuneus gyrus, were reported that the activity reduced while performing cognitive tasks. In this study, we examined three networks, i.e. the emotional circuit, the default mode network, and the whole brain network, derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the difference between MDD patients and normal subjects. Furthermore, we explored whether there is another network affected by MDD. The functional MRI data was acquired from 22 healthy subjects and 20 patients with MDD. All images of each subject were parcellated into 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions which were defined as the nodes of the network. The functional relations between the 90 regions were estimated by the time-frequency normalized mutual information (TFNMI). We found that the functional connectivity between any pair of brain regions within each of the three networks was significantly decreased in MDD group by using the t test. The significantly decreased connectivity for MDD in emotional circuit was found in the frontal lobe and between the frontal cortex and limbic regions, and that in DMN exhibited between the frontal cortex and superior temporal cortex. However, in the whole brain network, the most significantly decreased connectivity was revealed in occipital lobe, parietal-occipital, and frontal-occipital regions. Our findings suggested that the functional brain network affected by MDD comprised not only the frontal and limbic regions but also the parts of the parietal and occipital lobe. © 2010 IEEE.

77955862730	Symptomatic resolution among chinese patients with schizophrenia and associated factors	Background/Purpose: The remission and resolution criteria for schizophrenia were defined by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group in 2005, using eight core items of the positive and negative symptoms scale for schizophrenia. Subsequent studies of Caucasians have reported similar remission/resolution rates of approximately one-third. However, the remission/resolution rate in Chinese patients has not previously been reported. The present study assessed symptom resolution rates and associated factors among medicated and clinically stable Chinese schizophrenia patients. Methods: Chinese patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were followed-up 1 month after their last psychiatric hospitalization. Cross-sectional clinical assessments for psychopathology, side effect profiles, quality of life, psychosocial function, and neurocognition tests were performed. Results: Thirty-three (36.7%) of a total of 90 patients met the resolution criteria. They had a significantly higher level of education and lower scores for positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology on the positive and negative symptoms scale; they had lower scores on the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser Side Effect Rating Scale, and Simpson Angus Scale; and higher scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning and Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics scales, compared with patients who did not meet the resolution criteria. Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, sex, duration of illness, education, duration of index hospitalization, and antipsychotic dosage revealed that a higher Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser Side Effect Rating Scale score was related to lower rate of symptom resolution. The patients treated with clozapine and combinations of first generation antipsychotics and second generation antipsychotics had more severe psychopathology and side effects and showed a significantly lower resolution rate than did patients treated with first generation antipsychotics or second generation antipsychotics alone. Conclusion: Consistent with studies of Caucasian patients, one-third of clinically stable Chinese patients met the resolution criteria, as well as having fewer general side effects, better global functioning and subjective well-being. © 2010 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

77955894039	Sex differences in prevalence and risk indicators of geriatric depression: The Shih-Pai community-based survey	Background/Purpose: Information about sex difference is important for the development of better prevention and intervention strategies for geriatric depression. We investigated sex differences in prevalence and risk indicators associated with geriatric depression among community-dwelling elderly people in Shih-Pai, Taipei, Taiwan. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted from June 1999 to November 2002 among non-institutionalized residents aged ≥ 65 years in Shih-Pai community. Trained interviewers collected data through home visits. Geriatric depression was defined as a score of ≥ 5 on the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. Results: The prevalence of geriatric depression was 9.8% in 3970 participants, with a higher rate in women (12.4%) than men (7.8%). Geriatric depression was significantly associated with women [odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-2.07), separated/divorced marital status (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.51-7.18), living alone (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.38-4.77), past history of stroke (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 2.09-6.31), and cognitive impairment (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.96-4.09). Living alone (OR = 3.56, 95% CI = 1.48-8.57), living with children (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.02-3.78), and past history of gouty arthritis (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.27-4.79) were significantly associated with depression in women, but not in men. Conclusion: Women have a higher prevalence of geriatric depression than men. Our data support the differential exposure hypothesis and the differential vulnerability hypothesis of sex difference in geriatric depression. ©2010 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

78149336661	Integrated course in psychiatry and literature during preclinical years and medical students' grades in the general psychiatry curriculum	Aims and method: To examine the effect of taking an elective psychiatry and literature course during the first year of medical school on performance in the later mandatory general psychiatry curriculum. Class members were surveyed for baseline characteristics at the time of their admission to medical school. Following completion of their fourth year, average grades in psychiatry were calculated and results compared for those who did and those who did not take the course. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the effects of baseline characteristics that were significantly different between the groups. Results: Students who took the course had statistically significant (t= -3.34, P<0.001) higher grades in fourth year psychiatry. They had lower admission interview scores (t= -2.15, P<0.05) and reported less academic stress (t= -9.55, P<0.01) before taking the course. Clinical implications: Literature is an effective medium through which to teach medical students psychiatry as it can lead to a greater understanding of the topic. Declaration of interest: None.

78149358320	Antidepressant mechanism of add-on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in medication-resistant depression using cerebral glucose metabolism	Background: Add-on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in treating medication-resistant depression (MRD), but little is known about the rTMS antidepressant mechanism and pathophysiology underlying MRD. Methods: Twenty MRD patients received 2 weeks of navigated add-on rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Treatment response was defined as a ≥ 50% decrease in HDRS after treatment. Cerebral glucose metabolism was measured from all MRD patients twice, before and 3 months after rTMS, and from 20 healthy controls once at baseline. Results: At baseline, MRD subjects presented significant hypometabolism at the bilateral DLPFC and anterior cingulum, as well as hypermetabolism at several limbic and subcortical regions compared to the controls. Higher metabolism at the medial PFC and rostral anterior cingulum, and lower metabolism at the limbic structures, including the left parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus, predicted a response to rTMS. After successful rTMS treatment, the abnormally elevated metabolism in the left middle temporal cortex and fusiform gyrus decreased significantly, suggesting a reversal of metabolic imbalances. However, the overall metabolic pattern was still abnormal, even after their depression was under control. In contrast, the non-responders showed a worsening pattern of increased metabolism in the bilateral temporal cortex and fusiform gyrus. Conclusions: The antidepressant mechanism of add-on rTMS may be reflected as suppression of hyperactivity in the left temporal cortex and fusiform gyrus, perhaps through enhancing the function of the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulum. The limbic-cortical dysregulation of glucose metabolism might be a trait of an underlying mechanism of MRD. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

78149361151	Differences in white matter abnormalities between bipolar i and II disorders	Background: Although patients with bipolar I and II disorders exhibit heterogeneous clinical presentations and cognitive functions, it remains unclear whether these two subtypes have distinct neural substrates. This study aimed to differentiate the fiber abnormalities between bipolar I and II patients using diffusion tensor images. Method: Fourteen bipolar I patients, thirteen bipolar II patients, and twenty-one healthy subjects were recruited. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values calculated from diffusion tensor images were compared among groups using two-sample t-test analysis in a voxel-wise manner. Correlations between the mean FA value of each survived area and the clinical characteristics as well as the scores of neuropsychological tests were further analyzed. Results: Patients of both subtypes manifested fiber impairments in the thalamus, anterior cingulate, and inferior frontal areas, whereas the bipolar II patients showed more fiber alterations in the temporal and inferior prefrontal regions. The FA values of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortices for both subtypes correlated with the performance of working memory. The FA values of the right inferior frontal area of bipolar I and the left middle temporal area of bipolar II both correlated with executive function. For bipolar II patients, the left middle temporal and inferior prefrontal FA values correlated with the scores of YMRS and hypomanic episodes, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest distinct neuropathological substrates between bipolar I and II subtypes. The fiber alterations observed in the bipolar I patients were majorly associated with cognitive dysfunction, whereas those in the bipolar II patients were related to both cognitive and emotional processing. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78649945332	Drowsiness monitoring with EEG-based MEMS biosensing technologies	Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely adopted to monitor changes in cognitive states, particularly stages of sleep, as EEG recordings contain a wealth of information reflecting changes in alertness and sleepiness. In this study, silicon dry electrodes based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) were developed to bring high-quality EEG acquisition to operational workplaces. They have superior conductivity performance, large signal intensity, and are smaller in size than conventional (wet) electrodes. An EEG-based drowsiness estimation system consisting of a dry-electrode array, power spectrum estimation, principal component analysis (PCA)-based EEG signal analysis, and multivariate linear regression was developed to estimate drivers' drowsiness levels in a virtual-reality-based dynamic driving simulator. The proposed system can help elders who are often affected by periods of tiredness and fatigue. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.

79952620806	P11 (S100A10) as a potential biomarker of psychiatric patients at risk of suicide	Although suicide represents 1.8% of the global burden of disease, there are few objective assays for suicide risk. Being associated with depressive disorders, which have a high risk of suicide, the proteins P11, P2RX7, and S100β may be biomarkers for a suicidal disposition. We measured levels of p11 and P2RX7 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 26 psychiatric patients (11 suicide attempters, 15 suicide non-attempters) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), and 14 normal controls, using quantitative real-time PCR. We also conducted a meta-analysis of microarray data of p11, P2RX7 and S100β from post-mortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients who committed suicide (n = 56) and non-suicide controls (n = 61). We found that PBMC p11 mRNA levels were significantly lower in suicide attempters and higher in suicide non-attempters, when compared to normal controls. The PFC p11 mRNA levels in suicide completers were also lower than non-suicide controls (adjusted p = 0.007). Unlike p11, PBMC P2RX7 mRNA levels were significantly lower than normal controls in all patients including suicide attempters, suicide non-attempters, and suicide completers. In addition, levels of S100β in PFC did not differ between suicide completers and non-suicide controls. These results suggest that PBMC p11 mRNA levels may be a potential adjunctive biomarker for the assessment of suicide risk in mental disorders and warrants a larger translational study to determine its clinical utility. © 2010.

0036701784	Utilization of psychotropic drugs in Taiwan: An overview of outpatient sector in 2000	Background. Development of pharmacological treatment in mental disorders has risen drastically over the past decade in Taiwan. We performed a survey of the National Health Insurance claims for outpatient psychiatric services to study the utilization of psychotropic drugs. The analysis followed the drug classification and standardized measurements proposed by the World Health Organization. Methods. The sampling datasets from the National Health Insurance Research Database served as data sources. They represented 0.2% of the entire claims for outpatient medical services in 2000. The measurement units used for psychotropic drugs were either prescription volumes (drug items) or the number of defined daily doses (DDDs). To estimate the proportion of the population treated daily with psychotropic drugs, numbers of DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day were also calculated. Beside overall description, the data of psychotropic substance prescriptions were analyzed by stratifying patient's age, physician's specialty, accreditation status of hospital, and chemical subgroup of psychotropic drugs. Results. Prescription of psychotropic drug items (n = 63,539) was 3.24% of the total drug items (n = 1,958,820) claimed. The psychotropic drugs were prescribed to 9.2% of the total patients and in 9% of the total visits. Major consumers of psychotropic drugs were between 35 - 74 years of age and there were more women than men. The psychiatrist was the largest group of physicians who had prescribed psychotropic drugs and contributed 18.5% of all drug items and 38.3% of total DDDs of psychotropic drugs. The number of DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day for all kinds of psychotropic drugs was estimated to be 32.94 in Taiwan, where anxiolytics accounted 14.30, hypnotics and sedatives 10.64, antipsychotics 3.41, antidepressants 3.06 and mood stabilizers 1.43. Ordered by total DDDs, the top 10 most frequently used chemical substances were flunitrazepam, alprazolam, fludiazepam, oxazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, zolpidem, estazolam, zopiclone, and haloperidol. Conclusions. The usage level of psychotropic drugs in Taiwan was lower than in most industrialized countries, especially for antidepressants. The future goals are to focus on the longitudinal analysis of general trend for each psychotropic substance and to associate the pharmacoepidemiological data in parallel with the upcoming epidemiological study of mental disorders in Taiwan.

79960270411	Treatment dilemma in comorbidity of schizophrenia and idiopathic Parkinson's disease	Extrapyramidal symptoms are frequently found in patients with schizophrenia. Most are attributed as drug-induced parkinsonism, but comorbidity of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is also possible. We report a 59-year-old male with a diagnosis of schizophrenia for 32 years. Progressive hand tremor was noted from age 53; and then masked face, bradykinesia, dysphagia, sialorrhea; and unsteady shuffling gait became markedly exacerbated, even after discontinuing all antipsychotics for 6 months. The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was confirmed by Tc99m TRODAT SPECT. The dilemma of psychopharmacological treatment to control both disorders was encountered. Based on the review of treatment for Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), the recommended treatments suggest the utilization of quetiapine, clozapine, or aripiprazole. However, monotherapy with each of the three atypical antipsychotics failed due to poor efficacy or worsening of parkinsonism symptoms. After a 2-month cautious titration, a combination of quetiapine 50 mg/day and clozapine 37.5 mg/day finally achieved satisfactory efficacy. This case report illustrates the dilemma of treating a patient with schizophrenia and comorbid idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which differed from PDP and required more clinical data for a proper treatment recommendation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Many psychiatric disorders and therapies were also related to concentration of cerebral serotonin. I-123 ADAM was the novel radiopharmaceutical to image SERT in brain. The aim of this study was to measure reliability of SERT densities of healthy volunteers by automated anatomical labeling (AAL) method. Furthermore, we also used statistic parametric mapping (SPM) on a voxel by voxel analysis to find difference of cortex between test and retest of I-123 ADAM single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images.

80052440407	Faster onset of antidepressant effects of citalopram compared with sertraline in drug-naïve first-episode major depressive disorder in a chinese population: A 6-week double-blind, randomized comparative study	Several previous studies, including a meta-analysis, reported no significant differences between various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of major depressive disorder. However, because of the different chemical structure of SSRIs and the difference in the frequency of serotonin transporter polymorphisms between ethnic groups, a head-to-head comparative study between SSRIs in different populations may be enlightening. We compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of citalopram and sertraline in a double-blinded randomized clinical trial in a Chinese population of drug-naïve patients with first-episode major depressive disorder. Fifty-one patients were randomly assigned to citalopram or sertraline treatment. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used as the primary outcome. Efficacy and adverse effects were analyzed in an intent-to-treat population. Efficacy was analyzed using a last-observation-carried-forward method for early terminators. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics at baseline. No significant differences were found in MADRS scores between citalopram and sertraline at baseline (36.6 ± 5.5 vs 38.2 ± 4.9; P = 0.322) or at the end of treatment (week 6; 10.8 ± 10.0 vs 16.7 ± 11.3; P = 0.082). However, MADRS scores in the citalopram group were significantly lower at week 1 (25.2 ± 8.5 vs 30.4 ± 6.1; P = 0.029) and week 3 (15.9 ± 10.0 vs 22.1 ± 8.7; P = 0.037). Overall, treatment-emergent adverse effects were reported by 14.3% and 28.6% of patients in the citalopram and sertraline groups, respectively. In conclusion, citalopram and sertraline were both efficacious and well tolerated. However, citalopram exhibited a significantly faster onset than sertraline during the early weeks of treatment and tended to have a better efficacy in overall treatment, although the statistic was not significant. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

80054102222	Cortico-striatal disconnection within the cingulo-opercular network in schizophrenia revealed by intrinsic functional connectivity analysis: A resting fMRI study	The cingulo-opercular network (CON) is a newly defined control network responsible for various cognitive processes that have been consistently found to be impaired in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to use functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to test the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with functional disconnection within the CON. Thirty subjects with schizophrenia and thirty healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Each subject received resting fMRI scanning, clinical evaluations and cognitive examinations. The CON of each subject was derived by calculating the functional connectivity map of a seed in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). A between-group comparison was performed using a random effect analysis. Further network analyses with multiple regions of interest (ROIs) were performed to characterize the pattern of functional disconnection within the entire CON. Using the dACC seed in healthy controls, we derived the CON, which includes the following anatomical structures: the dACC; the bilateral anterior prefrontal, inferior parietal and anterior insular cortices; the putamen; the thalamus; and the cerebellum. Compared with healthy controls, schizophrenic patients showed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the bilateral putamens. Further network analysis demonstrated widespread cortico-striatal disconnection within the CON of schizophrenic patients. The disconnections correlated with negative symptom severity. Behavioral regression revealed that cortico-striatal functional connectivity predicted 2-back working memory performance in healthy controls, but not in schizophrenic patients. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with cortical-striatal disconnection within the CON. The result provides a network basis for the cortico-striatal disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

83055180740	Anatomical insights into disrupted small-world networks in schizophrenia	Schizophrenia is characterized by lowered efficiency in distributed information processing, as indicated by research that identified a disrupted small-world functional network. However, whether the dysconnection manifested by the disrupted small-world functional network is reflected in underlying anatomical disruption in schizophrenia remains unresolved. This study examined the topological properties of human brain anatomical networks derived from diffusion tensor imaging in patients with schizophrenia and in healthy controls. We constructed the weighted brain anatomical network for each of 79 schizophrenia patients and for 96 age and gender matched healthy subjects using diffusion tensor tractography and calculated the topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. The topological properties of the patients' anatomical networks were altered, in that global efficiency decreased but local efficiency remained unchanged. The deleterious effects of schizophrenia on network performance appear to be localized as reduced regional efficiency in hubs such as the frontal associative cortices, the paralimbic/limbic regions and a subcortical structure (the left putamen). Additionally, scores on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale correlated negatively with efficient network properties in schizophrenia. These findings suggest that complex brain network analysis may potentially be used to detect an imaging biomarker for schizophrenia. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84855424452	Screening depression among institutionalized older chinese men by minimum data set: We need a new instrument	Objective: To compare the effectiveness of the Minimum Data Set-based Depression Rating Scale (MDS-DRS) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in screening depression among older institutionalized Chinese men living in Taiwan. Method: MDS Nursing Home 2.1 Chinese version, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and short form Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) were used among elderly residents in Banciao Veterans Home. Screening results of MDS-DRS and GDS-15, and relationship between 16 MDS Mood and Anxiety symptoms and depression were evaluated. Results: The prevalence of depression defined by MDS-DRS and GDS were 0.2% and 8.7%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression disclosed that E1a (OR: 12.9, 95% CI: 2.8-58.8, p = 0.001), E1k (OR: 15.6, 95% CI: 5.6-43.5, p < 0.001), and E1l (OR: 22.2, 95% CI: 6.1-83.3, p < 0.001) were all independent associative factors for GDS-defined depression but only explained 51.9% of all depressive subjects. Conclusions: The effectiveness of MDS-DRS is limited, and a new MDS-based depression screening instrument is needed. © 2011 The Author(s).

84860761069	Increased risk of stroke after spinal cord injury: A nationwide 4-year follow-up cohort study	Objective: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases but whether or not the risk of cerebrovascular disease also increases remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of stroke in patients with disability caused by SCI. Methods: Study subjects were identified from a nationwide cohort of 18,690,066 people from 1998 to 2002 that was divided into an SCI group (n = 2,806), who were disabled from SCI, and a comparison group (n = 28,060), composed of age-, sex-, and propensity score- matched control subjects. Every subject was followed up for 4 years, unless they died or had a stroke by December 31, 2006. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: The incidence rate of stroke in the SCI group (5.96 per 1,000 person-years) was higher than that of the comparison group (p < 0.001). Stroke was more likely to occur in the SCI group than in the comparison group (crude hazard ratio 2.93, p < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio 2.85, p < 0.001). In the SCI group, the incidence of ischemic stroke was higher than that of hemorrhagic stroke (incidence rate ratio 3.42, p < 0.001). Conclusions: SCI patients with disability are at a higher risk of stroke, especially the ischemic type. Strategies to prevent stroke are therefore suggested for them.

84862777913	Sleep quality among community-dwelling elderly people and its demographic, mental, and physical correlates	Background: Sleep quality is an important predictor of well being in the elderly. However, the effects of depression and physical activity on sleep quality among elderly are less clear. Methods: One hundred older individuals who met the inclusion criteria were randomly sampled from a Taipei district elderly residential list. Door-to-door interviews were conducted. Sleep quality (the outcome variable), physical activity and depression symptoms were measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ), respectively. Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between the above major variables. Results: A half of the elderly had short sleep onset (<15 minutes) but reported poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5). Twenty-two percent of community-dwelling elders used psychoactive medication for sleep. The prevalence of depressive disorders (TDQ ≥ 19) was 7%. Although both physical activity and depression were significantly associated with sleep quality in the univariate analysis, only depression remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, education, marital status, and chronic illness confounders in logistic regression (OR = 1.31, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.52). Conclusion: Elderly depression symptoms was the only factor significantly associating with poor sleep quality after adjustment. Higher level of physical activity was associated with better sleep quality in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis, which considered the factor of elderly depression symptoms in the elderly. The role of physical activity in late life potentially influence sleep quality but may have less significance compared with depression. Therefore, we suggest the need for more future research to investigate the relationship between elderly people's sleep and physical activity. © 2011.

84862907550	Association between antidepressant resistance in unipolar depression and subsequent bipolar disorder: Cohort study	Background: People with major depressive disorder who fail to respond to adequate trials of antidepressant treatment may harbour hidden bipolar disorder. Aims: We aimed to compare the rates of a change in diagnosis to bipolar disorder among people with major depressive disorder with stratified responses to antidepressants during an 8-year follow-up period. Method: Information on individuals with major depressive disorder identified during 2000 (cohort 2000, n = 1485) and 2003 (cohort 2003, n = 2459) were collected from a nationally representative cohort of 1 000 000 health service users in Taiwan. Participants responding well to antidepressants were compared with those showing poor responses to adequate trials of antidepressants. Results: In 7.6-12.1% of those with a diagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorder this diagnosis was subsequently changed to bipolar disorder, with a mean time to change of 1.89-2.98 years. Difficult-to-treat participants presented higher rates of change to a bipolar diagnosis (25.6% in cohort 2000; 26.6% in cohort 2003) than easy-to-treat participants (8.8-8.9% in cohort 2000; 6.8-8.6% in cohort 2003; P<0.0001). Regression analysis showed that the variable most strongly associated with the change in diagnosis was antidepressant use history. The difficult-to-treat participants were associated most with diagnostic changing (cohort 2000: odds ratio (OR) = 1.88 (95% CI 1.12-3.16); cohort 2003: OR = 4.94 (95% CI 2.81-8.68)). Conclusions: This is the first large-scale study to report an association between antidepressant response history and subsequent change in diagnosis from major depressive disorder to bipolar disorder. Our findings support the view that a history of poor response to antidepressants in unipolar depression could be a useful predictor for bipolar diathesis. Declaration of interest: None.

84862791708	Different patterns of abnormal gamma oscillatory activity in unipolar and bipolar disorder patients during an implicit emotion task	This study investigates the distinct patterns of local and long-range gamma oscillations between patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Twenty BD patients, twenty MDD patients, and twenty normal controls participated in this study. For each participant, the event-related magnetoencephalographic responses while performing an implicit emotional task were recorded and processed with time-frequency analysis. Compared to normal controls, the BD patients exhibited the gamma power decease at the right frontal and prefrontal regions and yet gamma power increase at the right posterior temporal region. The abnormal long-range gamma oscillation between the right frontal and parietal-occipital region was also found. These results indicate that the BD patients may have hyperactivity in perceptual binding of emotional features and tend to be oversensitive to facial features. On the other hand, MDD patients displayed increased early gamma activity at the left anterior temporal region, which may imply their hyperactivated binding process of emotional features at corticolimbic regions. The distinct alterations of gamma patterns between the BD and MDD patients implicate that their impairments of binding processes are located at different regions. Gamma activity in the parietal and left posterior temporal regions may be a potential index to differentiate BD patients from MDD patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863371804	Effects of age, gender, and socio-economic status on the incidence of spinal cord injury: An assessment using the eleven-year comprehensive nationwide database of taiwan	This study used an 11-year nationwide database to analyze the incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) in subgroups by age, gender, injury level, etiology, and socioeconomic status. The National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, covering over 99% of the population accumulated from 1998 to 2008, was analyzed. All SCI patients>20 years of age and admitted to medical services were identified. Of the 168,832,051.4 person-years, 41,586 newly established diagnoses of SCI were identified, for a SCI incidence of 2.46 per 10,000 person-years, and 61.2% were traumatic. Cervical SCI was the highest at 1.28, followed by lumbar 0.56, and thoracic 0.30 per 10,000 person-years. Males were more likely to have SCI (HR=1.52). Compared to the age group of 20-39 years, the 40-59-year-old group and the group aged≥60 years were more likely to have SCI (HR=1.66 and 2.12, respectively). Those with the lowest insurance premium (which represents income level) were more likely to have SCI compared to the highest insurance premium group (HR=1.86). Those living in the eastern area were more likely to have SCI than those living in the northern area (where political and economic centers are located) (HR=1.52). Those in the most rural area were more likely (HR=1.69) to have SCI than those in the most urbanized areas. The overall national incidence of adult SCI in Taiwan was 246 per million-person-year. Several groups, such as elderly men with lower socioeconomic status, were more likely to experience SCI. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84864281042	Risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy in postmenopausal Chinese women	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess risks and benefits of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in postmenopausal Chinese women. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, a population-based healthcare claims dataset. Eligible women aged 50 to 79 years were classified as exposed to CEE 0.625 mg/day with MPA 5.0 mg/day (estrogen [E] + progestin [P], n = 4,712) or CEE 0.625 mg/day only (E-only, n = 1,208) and were age-matched to unexposed women (n = 10,125). Follow-up was complete in 96% of the participants. The primary outcomes were coronary heart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer. The global index summarized risks of primary outcomes, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colon and endometrial cancers, hip fractures, and death. Time-to-event analyses were performed. RESULTS: Median durations of exposure in the E + P and E-only groups were 6.9 and 9 months, respectively. Median follow-up was 110 months. Hazard ratios (95% CI) for E + P exposure were as follows: myocardial infarction, 0.78 (0.51-1.19); CHD death, 1.21 (0.53-2.70); breast cancer, 1.48 (1.20-1.83); global index, 0.79 (0.72-0.87). Hazard ratios for E-only exposure were as follows: myocardial infarction, 0.76 (0.35-1.68); CHD death, 0.57 (0.11-2.80); breast cancer, 1.44 (0.99-2.10); global index, 1.09 (0.92-1.28). Per 10,000 person-years, there were 12 excess breast cancer cases with E + P exposure; there were 39 fewer global index events with E + P exposure. Adjusting for age, statin and aspirin use, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension did not significantly change estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal Chinese women, CEE with or without MPA was not associated with increased rates of CHD, but CEE with MPA may be associated with a higher breast cancer rate. E + P exposure conferred lower global index event rates. © 2012 by The North American Menopause Society.

84865164395	Regional cortical thinning in patients with major depressive disorder: A surface-based morphometry study	This study uses surfaced-based morphometry to investigate cortical thinning and its functional correlates in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Subjects with MDD (N=36) and healthy control subjects (N=36) were enrolled in the study. Each subject received T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), clinical evaluations, and neuropsychological examinations of executive functions with the Color Trail Test (CTT) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). This study used an automated surface-based method (FreeSurfer) to measure cortical thickness and to generate the thickness maps for each subject. Statistical comparisons were performed using a general linear model. Compared with healthy controls, subjects with MDD showed the largest area of cortical thinning in the prefrontal cortex. This study also noted smaller areas of cortical thinning in the bilateral inferior parietal cortex, left middle temporal gyrus, left entorhinal cortex, left lingual cortex, and right postcentral gyrus. Regression analysis demonstrated cortical thinning in several frontoparietal regions, predicting worse executive performance measured by CTT 2, though the patterns of cortical thickness/executive performance correlation differed in healthy controls and MDD subjects. In conclusion, the results provide further evidence for the significant role of a prefrontal structural deficit and an aberrant structural/functional relationship in patients with MDD. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84864336273	Cardiac vagal control and theoretical models of co-occurring depression and anxiety: A cross-sectional psychophysiological study of community elderly	Background: In order to elucidate the complex relationship between co-occurring depression and anxiety with cardiac autonomic function in the elderly, this study examined the correlation between cardiac vagal control (CVC) and pre-defined, theoretical factors from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Methods: Three hundred fifty-four randomly selected Chinese male subjects aged ≥65 years and living in the community were enrolled. CVC was measured using a frequency-domain index of heart rate variability.Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the flat tripartite model of HADS provided a modest advantage in model fit when compared with other theoretical factor solutions. In the flat tripartite model, there was a significant negative association between anhedonic depression and CVC. In contrast, autonomic anxiety showed a significant positive correlation with CVC. In the hierarchical tripartite model, negative affectivity was not directly associated with CVC; instead, it had positive and negative indirect effects on CVC via autonomic anxiety and anhedonic depression, respectively. As scores for negative affectivity increased, these specific indirect effects diminished.Conclusions: Among competing models of co-occurring depression and anxiety, constructs from tripartite models demonstrate fair conformity with the data but unique and distinct correlations with CVC. Negative affectivity may determine the relationship of anhedonic depression and autonomic anxiety with CVC. Separating affective symptoms under the constructs of the tripartite models helps disentangle complex associations between co-occurring depression and anxiety with CVC. © 2012 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84865682940	Generalized EEG-based drowsiness prediction system by using a self-organizing neural fuzzy system	A generalized EEG-based Neural Fuzzy system to predict driver's drowsiness was proposed in this study. Driver's drowsy state monitoring system has been implicated as a causal factor for the safety driving issue, especially when the driver fell asleep or distracted in driving. However, the difficulties in developing such a system are lack of significant index for detecting the driver's drowsy state in real-time and the interference of the complicated noise in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. In our past studies, we found that the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum changes were highly correlated with the driver's behavior performance especially the occipital component. Different from presented subject-dependent drowsy state monitor systems, whose system performance may decrease rapidly when different subject applies with the drowsiness detection model constructed by others, in this study, we proposed a generalized EEG-based Self-organizing Neural Fuzzy system to monitor and predict the driver's drowsy state with the occipital area. Two drowsiness prediction models, subject-dependent and generalized cross-subject predictors, were investigated in this study for system performance analysis. Correlation coefficients and root mean square errors are showed as the experimental results and interpreted the performances of the proposed system significantly better than using other traditional Neural Networks (p-value <0.038). Besides, the proposed EEG-based Self-organizing Neural Fuzzy system can be generalized and applied in the subjects' independent sessions. This unique advantage can be widely used in the real-life applications. © 2012 IEEE.

84866945886	Abnormal topological organization of structural brain networks in schizophrenia	Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder characterized by disturbances of thought and emotion as well as neurocognitive deficits. It is hypothesized that the core symptoms of schizophrenia arise from the inability to integrate neural processes segregated across distributed brain regions. Graph theory allows us to verify this hypothesis at large-scale structural network level. In this study, a sample of 101 schizophrenic patients and 101 healthy controls was included. We sought to investigate the abnormality of network topological organization in patients with schizophrenia by using the cortical thickness measurement from magnetic resonance imaging. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding cortical thickness correlation matrices of 78 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared to healthy controls, patients showed increased characteristic path length and clustering coefficient in the structural cortical networks. Moreover, schizophrenia patients were associated with reduced nodal centrality in several regions of the default network and increased nodal centrality mainly in primary cortex and paralimbic cortex regions. These findings suggest that the structural networks of schizophrenic patients have a less optimal topological organization, resulting in reduced capacity to integrate information across brain regions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84866991635	The efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of treatment with sertindole or olanzapine in patients with chronic schizophrenia who did not respond successfully to their previous treatments: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, flexible-dose study	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sertindole in comparison with olanzapine in patients with chronic schizophrenia who did not respond successfully to their previous treatments. Patients with schizophrenia who were at least moderately ill and had failed to respond to previous antipsychotic treatment were randomized to double-blind sertindole or olanzapine treatment. A total of 389 patients were treated, 196 with sertindole (mean dose=17 mg/day) and 193 with olanzapine (mean dose=16 mg/day). Both drugs improved all the efficacy scale scores including the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score. Although sertindole failed to prove noninferiority to olanzapine in terms of reduction in PANSS total score with the last-observation-carried-forward analysis, this can be attributed to the higher withdrawal rate in the sertindole group by day 16 by which sertindole was up-titrated to the effective dose. On excluding early withdrawals, the noninferiority criterion was fulfilled, as also in the observed-case analysis. They had similar safety profiles with respect to the total incidence of adverse events. The incidence of asymptomatic QT prolongation was higher in the sertindole group. Sertindole has an efficacy and safety profile that is comparable to that of olanzapine. The slow titration schedule and lack of sedating effect of sertindole should be considered when initiating treatment with this drug. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84867748749	Comorbidity of allergic and autoimmune diseases in patients with autism spectrum disorder: A nationwide population-based study	Previous clinical and genetic studies have suggested autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is associated with immunological abnormalities involving cytokines, immunoglobulins, inflammation, and cellular immunity, but epidemiological reports are still limited. Patients with ASDs were identified in the National Health Insurance Database from 1996 to 2010, and compared with age and gender-matched controls (1:4) in an investigation of the association between ASDs and allergic/autoimmune diseases. A total of 1596 patients with ASDs were identified, and were found to have a significantly higher prevalence of allergic and autoimmune diseases than the control group. Patients with ASDs had increased risks of asthma (OR = 1.74, 95%CI = 1.51-1.99), allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.51-1.91), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.30-1.78), urticaria (OR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.12-1.69) and type 1 diabetes (OR = 4.00, 95%CI = 1.00-16.00), and a trend toward increasing comorbidity with Crohn's disease (OR = 1.46, 95%CI = 0.90-2.35). Our results support the association between ASDs and allergic diseases, and autoimmune comorbidities (type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease). Further basic study is required to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms and roles of allergy immunity and autoimmunity in the etiology of ASDs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that BD-I patients (compared to BD-II patients) would perform worse on tests of cognitive function because of abnormal metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and other mood-related brain areas. Methods: Thirty-four patients with remitted bipolar disorder (BD) (BD-I=17, BD-II=17) under treatment and 17 well-matched healthy controls received both fluorodeoxyglucose (

84868524569	Identification of psychiatric disorders among human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals in Taiwan, a nine-year nationwide population-based study	A previous survey had shown a high level of psychiatric morbidity among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, but the number of patients that are actually identified as having a psychiatric disorder in the medical service in Taiwan is unknown. Using the claims data of a nationally representative cohort from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, the diagnoses of psychiatric disorders among newly diagnosed HIV-infected individuals were investigated from 1998 through 2006. Two hundred and seventy-four (23.8%) of 1153 newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients were identified as having psychiatric disorders, with an average latency of 3.33±2.47 years after HIV infection. Anxiety and depressive disorders were the leading diagnoses. Male patients had lower morbidity (21.0% vs. 25.3%, p=0.056), but a shorter latency to be identified with a psychiatric disorder (2.1±2.13 vs. 3.9±2.40 years, p<0.001) than females. This first population-based cohort study showed a high morbidity of psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals, but with a long latency after infection, and a gender effect was noted. Regular psychiatric evaluation and follow-up and prompt intervention are necessary for HIV-infected individuals. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84872871614	Allergic rhinitis in adolescence increases the risk of depression in later life: A nationwide population-based prospective cohort study	Background: Many cross-sectional studies have suggested an association between allergic rhinitis (AR) and depression, but the timing relationship was not determined. Using a nationwide population-based prospective cohort study (1:4, age-/gender-matched), we hypothesized that AR in adolescence would increase the risk of depression in later life. Methods: In all, 1673 adolescents aged 12-15 that had AR between 1996 and 2000 were recruited for our study. Cases of major depressive disorder and any depressive disorder that occurred to the end of follow-up (December 31, 2010) were identified. Result: Adolescents with AR had a higher prevalence of major depression (2.5% vs. 1.2%, p<0.001) and any depressive disorder (4.9% vs. 2.8%, p<0.001) and an earlier onset of major depression (19.31±2.91 vs. 20.43±2.71 years, p=0.038) and any depressive disorder (19.35±2.63 vs. 20.43±2.62 years, p=0.002) compared with the controls. The Cox regression model showed that adolescents with AR had increased HRs of major depression (HR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.50) and any depressive disorder (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04-1.93) after controlling residence location and comorbid allergic diseases. Limitations: The prevalence of depressive disorder may be underestimated because only those who had medicine-seeking behaviors were enrolled. Conclusions: This first cohort case-control study showed an association between AR in early adolescence and depression in late adolescence and early adulthood. Our results suggested that allergic responses played important roles in the development of depression. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84874545552	The Risk of Cancer in Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder: A Nationwide Population-Based Study	Objective: To evaluate the risk of cancer among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in a nationwide population-based dataset. Methods: We recruited newly-diagnosed GAD patients aged 20 years or older without antecedent cancer from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research database between 2000-2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancers were calculated in GAD patients, and the subgroup of GAD patients diagnosed by psychiatric specialists. Results: A total of 559 cancers developed among 19,793 GAD patients with a follow-up of 89,485 person-years (median follow-up of 4.34 years), leading to a significantly increased SIR of 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.24]. Male GAD patients had a significantly increased SIR overall (1.30, 95% CI 1.15-1.46) and for lung and prostate cancer (1.77, 95% CI 1.33-2.30 and 2.17, 95% CI 1.56-2.93, respectively). Patients over 80 years of age also had a significantly increased SIR (1.56, 95% CI 1.25-1.92), especially in males. However, psychiatrist-diagnosed GAD patients did not show increased cancer risk relative to the general population, perhaps due to having fewer physical comorbidities than non-psychiatrist-diagnosed GAD patients. Conclusion: This study found that overall cancer risk is elevated among patients with GAD. The risk of lung and prostate cancer also increased in male patients with GAD. This increased cancer risk may be due to physical comorbidities and surveillance bias. Further prospective study is necessary to confirm these findings. © 2013 Shen et al.

84875422103	Symptomatic Menopausal Transition Increases the Risk of New-Onset Depressive Disorder in Later Life: A Nationwide Prospective Cohort Study in Taiwan	Introduction: The role of the menopausal transition and associated menopausal symptoms in the occurrence of depressive disorders has been discussed and debated for a long time. Most previous clinical studies had limited case samples, and did not control the attributable risk of medical comorbidities. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic menopausal transition and without a psychiatric history were enrolled in 2000 in Taiwan, and compared with age-matched controls (1:4). These subjects were followed to the end of 2010 to investigate the association between symptomatic menopausal transition and new-onset depressive disorder; the effect of medical comorbidities was also assessed. Results: A total of 5,837 women with symptomatic menopausal transition were identified, and compared with 23,348 age-matched controls in 2000. The follow-up showed that symptomatic menopausal transition was an independent risk factor for major depression (hazard ratio[HR]: 2.18, 95%CI: 1.79~2.65) and any depressive disorder (HR: 2.34, 95%CI: 2.08~2.63) after adjusting age at enrollment, monthly income, residence location, level of urbanization, and comorbid medical diseases. In addition, medical comorbidities, including cerebrovascular disease (HR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.52~2.07), cardiovascular diseases (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15~1.57), congestive heart failure (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.04~1.75), and liver diseases (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03~1.36) increased the risk of developing any depressive disorder. Conclusion: Our population cohort study, with the largest study sample and medical record diagnosis thus far, supports an association between symptomatic menopausal transition and depressive disorder in midlife women, and an increased risk of depressive disorder with medical comorbidities. © 2013 Chen et al.

84876285160	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, tic disorder, and allergy: Is there a link? A nationwide population-based study	Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tic disorder usually co-occur in the same individuals, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous evidence has shown that a frequent coexistence of allergic diseases was noted in patients with ADHD or tic disorder. We attempted to investigate the possible link among ADHD, tic disorder, and various allergic diseases. Methods: Utilizing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 1996 to 2010, 5,811 patients with ADHD alone, 1,816 patients with tic disorder alone, and 349 patients with dual diagnoses of ADHD and tic disorder were identified and compared with age-/gender-matched controls (1:4) in an investigation of the association among ADHD, tic disorder, and allergic diseases. Results: Patients with dual diagnoses of ADHD and tic disorder had a significantly higher prevalence of allergic diseases and psychiatric comorbidities, including allergic rhinitis (43% vs. 28.4% vs. 33.6% vs. 19.7%, p < 0.001), asthma (27.5% vs. 17.2% vs. 18.2% vs. 11.9%, p < 0.001), atopic dermatitis (10.6% vs. 8.4% vs. 7.0 vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001), allergic conjunctivitis (55.6% vs. 34.7% vs. 43.5% vs. 26.3%, p < 0.001), obsessive compulsive disorder (4.0% vs. 1.3% vs. 2.0% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and anxiety disorder (22.1% vs. 18.0% vs. 6.0% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001) than the ADHD alone group, the tic alone group, and the control group. Furthermore, ADHD patients with more allergic diseases (≥3 comorbidities: OR: 3.73, 95% CI: 2.65∼5.25; 2 comorbidities: OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.82∼3.47; 1 comorbidity: OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.41∼2.49) exhibited an increased risk of tic disorder compared with ADHD patients without allergic disease. Conclusion: A significant association among ADHD, tic disorder, and allergic diseases was noted in our study. The results may inspire further studies to clarify the underlying mechanisms and help us understand more about the complex etiology of ADHD, tic disorder, and their co-occurrence. © 2012 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

84878623588	Higher risk of developing mood disorders among adolescents with comorbidity ofattention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorder: Anationwide prospective study	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are frequently comorbid. Previous studies suggested that the comorbidity of CD and ODD in ADHD may increase the risk of a further development of mood disorder, but most studies had a small sample size. Using a population-based prospective study design, a large sample composed of 1277 adolescents with ADHD-alone, 46 with ADHD+ODD, 87 with ADHD+CD, and 5640 age/gender-matched controls were enrolled in 2003. These cases were followed to 2010 to identify the cases developing unipolar depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. ADHD+CD groups exhibited a higher prevalence of unipolar depressive disorder (23.0% vs. 13.0% vs. 8.7% vs. 0.7%, p<0.001) and bipolar disorder (3.4% vs. 2.2% vs. 1.3% vs. 0.2%, p<0.001) than ADHD+ODD group, ADHD-alone group, and control group. Adolescents with ADHD+CD, those with ADHD+ODD, and those with ADHD-alone had a higher likelihood of developing unipolar depressive disorder (hazard ratio [HR]: 44.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.95-71.36; HR: 18.76, 95%CI: 7.87-44.71; HR: 13.01, 95%CI: 8.99-18.82) and bipolar disorder (HR: 14.39, 95%CI: 4.00-51.80; HR: 8.32, 95%CI: 1.06-65.32; HR: 5.24, 95%CI: 2.44-11.24) than the controls. Adolescents with ADHD had elevated risks of unipolar depression and bipolar disorder in their later life, and especially, those with ADHD and comorbidity of CD or ODD exhibited the highest risk. Further study would be required to evaluate whether prompt intervention for ADHD and disruptive behavior problems would decrease the risk of developing mood disorder. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84878395220	Association between psychiatric disorders and iron deficiency anemia among children and adolescents: A nationwide population-based study	Background: A great deal of evidence has shown that iron is an important component in cognitive, sensorimotor, and social-emotional development and functioning, because the development of central nervous system processes is highly dependent on iron-containing enzymes and proteins. Deficiency of iron in early life may increase the risk of psychiatric morbidity.Methods: Utilizing the National Health Insurance Database from 1996 to 2008, children and adolescents with a diagnosis of IDA were identified and compared with age and gender-matched controls (1:4) in an investigation of the increased risk of psychiatric disorders.Results: A total of 2957 patients with IDA, with an increased risk of unipolar depressive disorder (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.58 ~ 3.46), bipolar disorder (OR = 5.78, 95% CI = 2.23 ~ 15.05), anxiety disorder (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.49 ~ 3.16), autism spectrum disorder (OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 1.79 ~ 5.28), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.29 ~ 2.17), tic disorder (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.03 ~ 2.78), developmental delay (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 2.00 ~ 3.00), and mental retardation (OR = 2.70, 95% CI = 2.00 ~ 3.65), were identified. A gender effect was noted, in that only female patients with IDA had an increased OR of bipolar disorder (OR = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.98 ~ 15.70) and tic disorder (OR = 2.95, 95% CI = 1.27 ~ 6.86).Conclusion: Iron deficiency increased the risk of psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and developmental disorders. Further study is required to clarify the mechanism in the association between IDA and psychiatric disorder. © 2013 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84878959744	Schizophrenia and the brain's control network: Aberrant within- and between-network connectivity of the frontoparietal network in schizophrenia	The deficit of executive control is a core feature of schizophrenia, and as such, it provides hints for the neural signature of this devastating mental illness. The frontoparietal network (FPN) is a newly defined network important for various tasks requiring executive control. This study aims to investigate both the within- and between-network connectivity of the FPN in schizophrenia using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI). Thirty-six subjects with schizophrenia and thirty-six healthy controls were enrolled. Each subject received resting fMRI scanning, clinical evaluations and cognitive examinations. Twenty-two regions of interest (ROIs) in the key hubs of the FPN were defined according to the functional connectivity map of the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and included the bilateral frontal pole, inferior parietal lobe (IPL), insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), middle cingulate cortex (mCC), precuneus, caudate, thalamus and cerebellum. Between-group comparisons were conducted using both multiple ROI-based and brain-wise analyses. The ROI-based analysis revealed that the schizophrenic participants were associated with a prominent cortico-subcortical disconnection within the FPN. Further brain-wise analyses demonstrated that the schizophrenia patients showed increased functional connectivity between several ROIs in the FPN and regions belonging to the primary sensory processing or default mode networks. These results indicated that schizophrenia is associated with both within- and between-network dysconnectivity of the FPN. Together with our previous findings of the cortico-striatal disconnection of the cingulo-opercular network, we suggest that the brain's control networks may play an important role in the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84880480214	Cortical Shape and Curvedness Analysis of Structural Deficits in Remitting and Non-Remitting Depression	In morphometric neuroimaging studies, the relationship between brain structural changes and the antidepressant treatment response in patients with major depressive disorder has been explored to search depression-trait biomarkers. Although patients were treated with serotonin-related drugs, whether the same treatment resulted in remission and non-remission in depressed patients is currently under investigation. We recruited 25 depressed patients and 25 healthy controls and acquired volumetric magnetic resonance imaging of each participant. We used the shape index and curvedness to classify cortical shapes and quantify shape complexities, respectively, in studying the pharmacological effect on brain morphology. The results showed that different regions of structural abnormalities emerged between remitting and non-remitting patients when contrasted with healthy controls. In addition to comparing structural metrics in each cortical parcellation, similar to the traditional voxel-based morphometric method, we highlighted the importance of structural integrity along the serotonin pathway in response to medication treatment. We discovered that disrupted serotonin-related cortical regions might cause non-remission to antidepressant treatment from a pharmacological perspective. The anomalous areas manifested in non-remitting patients were mainly in the frontolimbic areas, which can be used to differentiate remitting from non-remitting participants before medication treatment. Because non-remission is the failure to respond to treatment with serotonin-related drugs, our method may help clinicians choose appropriate medications for non-remitting patients. © 2013 Liao et al.

84880504313	The Risk of Cancer among Taiwanese Female Registered Nurses: A Nationwide Retrospective Study	Background:To evaluate the risk of cancer among Taiwanese female registered nurses (RNs) using a nationwide population-based dataset.Methods:We recruited female RNs without antecedent cancer from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research database during 2000-2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancer were calculated. We also compared rates of Papanicolaou (Pap) smear use between the RNs and the general population matched by age and sex.Results:A total of 2,077 cancers developed among 184,809 female RNs, with a follow-up of 1,371,910 person-years (median follow-up of 7.86 years), leading to an increased SIR of 1.10 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.15]. RNs aged between 40-59 years also had a significantly increased SIR (1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.21). For specific cancer types, RNs had an increased SIR for breast (1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.37), thyroid (1.26, 95% CI 1.10-1.43), lung and mediastinum (1.36, 95% CI 1.13-1.62), and uterine cancers (1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.49). A decreased SIR was found for cervix (0.48, 95% CI 0.37-0.61) and liver and biliary tract cancers (0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.90). Pap smear use averaged 5.80 times per person among female RNs aged 35 years or older and 5.50 times per person in the age-matched control group (p = 0.009).Conclusion:This study found that overall cancer risk was higher among female RNs than general population. For individual cancers, the risks of breast, lung, thyroid and uterine cancer were higher and the risks of cervix and liver cancer were lower than general population. The lower risk of cervical cancer might be partially explained by the increased use of Pap smears in the RNs group. Further large, unbiased population-based prospective studies are needed to investigate the association between nurses and cancer risk and identify the risk factors of cancer in nurses. © 2013 Shen et al.

84880787632	Brain Signature Characterizing the Body-Brain-Mind Axis of Transsexuals	Individuals with gender identity disorder (GID), who are commonly referred to as transsexuals (TXs), are afflicted by negative psychosocial stressors. Central to the psychological complex of TXs is the conviction of belonging to the opposite sex. Neuroanatomical and functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the GID is associated with brain alterations. In this study, we found that TXs identify, when viewing male-female couples in erotic or non-erotic ("neutral") interactions, with the couple member of the desired gender in both situations. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the TXs, as opposed to controls (CONs), displayed an increased functional connectivity between the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with dimorphic genital representation, and anterior cingulate cortex subregions, which play a key role in social exclusion, conflict monitoring and punishment adjustment. The neural connectivity pattern suggests a brain signature of the psychosocial distress for the gender-sex incongruity of TXs. © 2013 Ku et al.

84881600602	Gray Matter Abnormalities in Schizophrenia Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Voxel-Based Morphometry Study	Objective:The pathophysiological mechanism of TD remains unknown. All previous studies, using the region-of-interest method, focused on basal ganglion areas, were with inconsistent results. This whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study investigate the grey matter abnormality of TD and its correlates with clinical ratings.Method:High resolution T1-weighted brain volumetric MRI from 25 schizophrenia patients with TD (TD group), 25 age-, gender-, and handedness-matched schizophrenia patients without TD (non-TD group), and 25 matched healthy subjects (NC group) were analyzed using a VBM approach. Clinical ratings included the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), and the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS).Results:The TD group had significantly smaller total gray matter volumes than the NC group (p = 0.05). Compared to the non-TD group, the TD group had significantly higher PANSS negative (p<0.001), SAS (p<0.001), and AIMS (p<0.001) scores; and smaller bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, which correlated negatively with the PANSS negative scores (r = -0.366, p<0.05); and smaller right superior frontal gyrus, which correlated negatively with AIMS scores (r = -0.399, p<0.001), and PANSS general score (r = -0.338, p<0.05).Limitations:The cross-section design can't separate the gray matter change to TD from the context of the illness of schizophrenia, although TD with more severe clinical psychopathology could be a phenotype.Conclusions:The schizophrenia patients with TD had significantly reduced gray matter, mostly at the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus, which correlated with severity of clinical symptoms and involuntary movement, respectively. © 2013 Li et al.

84881249541	Resting-state fMRI mapping of cerebellar functional dysconnections involving multiple large-scale networks in patients with schizophrenia	Background: Recent findings have indicated that patients with schizophrenia have altered cortico-cerebellar connectivity, but the nature of these network dysconnections remains unclear. Aims: We applied a network-based approach to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) of the cerebellum in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Thirty-six patients with schizophrenia and 36 healthy controls underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging. We derived the following 6 major networks by applying group independent component analysis: (1) the cingulo-opercular network (CON); (2) the dorsal default-mode networks (dDMN); (3) the ventral default-mode network (vDMN); (4) the left frontoparietal networks (lFPN); (5) the right frontoparietal network (rFPN); and (6) the motor network (MOT). We defined 12 regions of interest (ROIs) by selecting the first 2 peaks of each network in the cerebellum. The FC map of all ROIs was calculated for each participant and compared between groups. Results: The schizophrenic patients showed a decrease in FC between the cerebellar ROIs and the thalamus in all networks except the MOT. The FC decreased between cerebellar ROIs and the frontal cortex in the CON, rFPN, and MOT. However, the FC increased with the precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus for the CON, lFPN, and dDMN. An increased FC with the occipital fusiform gyrus and the temporal occipital fusiform gyrus was also noted in the dDMN, vDMN, and MOT. Conclusions: The dysconnection of the cerebellum in the examined patients with schizophrenia was network-specific. The cerebellar-thalamic dysconnections were the most prominent findings and were common to all cognitive-related networks, whereas the cortico-cerebellar connectivity involved both an increase and decrease in FC, and depended more on the nature of the specific network. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84880924278	Risk of developing diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia among patients with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia: A 10-year nationwide population-based prospective cohort study	Background: The high comorbidity of metabolic side effects with severe mental disorders (SMDs), including bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia, had gained much attention, because the excess mortality of these patients is mainly due to physical illness. However, most of these studies were with cross-sectional study design, the time course of metabolic side effects and SMD cannot be elucidated without a cohort study. Method: Using a nationwide database with a large sample size and a matched control cohort study design, we enrolled patients with SMDs but without diagnoses of and medications for DM and hyperlipidemia from 1996 to 2000, and followed them to the end of 2010. We compared them with age and gender-matched controls (1:4) for the incidence of DM and hyperlipidemia. Results: The identified cases were 367 patients with BD, 417 patients with MDD, and 1993 patients with schizophrenia, with average age of 45.3±14.0, 46.5±13.7, and 45.9±12.3, respectively. The patients with BD and schizophrenia had increased risk of initiation of anti-diabetic medications (10.1% vs. 6.3%, p=0.012; 13.3% vs. 7.2% p<0.001; respectively), and anti-hyperlipidemia medications (15.8% vs.10.5%, p=0.004; 14.2% vs.12.1%, p=0.005; respectively) than the controls. After controlling age, gender, urbanization, and income, the Cox regression model showed significantly increased risk of initiation of anti-diabetic medications among patients with BD (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.702, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.155-2.507) and schizophrenia (HR of1.793, 95% CI: 1.532-2.098). Increased risk of initiation of anti-hyperlipidemia medications was also noted among patients with BD (HR of 1.506, 95% CI: 1.107-2.047) and schizophrenia (HR of 1.154, 95% CI: 1.002-1.329). The patients with MDD did not show increased risk of initiation of these medications than the controls. Conclusions: This first 10-year nationwide population-based prospective matched control cohort study showed increased risks of initiation of anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemia medications among patients with BD and schizophrenia. No significant increased risk was noted among the patients with MDD. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84880959431	Increased incidence of orthopedic fractures in cirrhotic patients: A nationwide population-based study	Background & Aims: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neuropsychiatric disorder in cirrhotic patients. The cognitive dysfunction and increased accidental falls in HE and osteodystrophy in cirrhotic patients may contribute to orthopedic fractures. This study investigated the fracture incidence and risk factors in cirrhotic patients with HE. Methods: In total, 3764 cirrhotic patients with HE were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database between 2000 and 2009. The fracture incidence of the HE patients was compared with that of 3764 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched cirrhotic patients without HE and non-cirrhotic controls. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the risk of fracture in the HE patients. Results: Cirrhotic patients with and without HE had comparable increased risks of fracture (p <0.05) and cumulative incidences of fracture than controls (log-rank p <0.001). The estimated fracture rates were 7.09% for the HE group, 7.72% for the cirrhosis without HE group, and 4.05% for the controls, during the 18-month follow-up. The HE group had a higher incidence rate of skull fractures (IRR = 2.61, 95% CI 1.04-6.57), but a lower rate of upper limb fractures (IRR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.70) than the cirrhosis without HE group. Alcoholism, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease were associated with increased risk of fracture in HE patients. Conclusions: Cirrhotic patients, with or without HE, are at an increased risk of orthopedic fractures. Skull fractures, rather than fractures in weight-bearing bones, are more frequently observed in HE patients, particularly those with comorbidities. © 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

84880991847	Impaired Prefronto-Thalamic Functional Connectivity as a Key Feature of Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Combined MEG, PET and rTMS Study	Prefrontal left-right functional imbalance and disrupted prefronto-thalamic circuitry are plausible mechanisms for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Add-on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), effective in treating antidepressant-refractory TRD, was administered to verify the core mechanisms underlying the refractoriness to antidepressants. Thirty TRD patients received a 2-week course of 10-Hz rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Depression scores were evaluated at baseline (W0), and the ends of weeks 1, 2, and 14 (W14). Responders were defined as those who showed an objective improvement in depression scores ≥50% after rTMS. Left-right frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) was measured by magnetoencephalography at each time point as a proxy for left-right functional imbalance. Prefronto-thalamic connections at W0 and W14 were assessed by studying couplings between prefrontal alpha waves and thalamic glucose metabolism (PWTMC, reflecting intact thalamo-prefrontal connectivity). A group of healthy control subjects received magnetoencephalography at W0 (N = 50) to study whether FAA could have a diagnostic value for TRD, or received both magnetoencephalography and positron-emission-tomography at W0 (N = 10) to confirm the existence of PWTMC in the depression-free state. We found that FAA changes cannot differentiate between TRD and healthy subjects or between responders and non-responders. No PWTMC were found in the TRD group at W0, whereas restitution of the PWTMC was demonstrated only in the sustained responders at W14 and euthymic healthy controls. In conclusion, we affirmed impaired prefronto-thalamic functional connections, but not frontal functional imbalance, as a core deficit in TRD. © 2013 Li et al.

84881126820	A nine-year follow-up study of sleep patterns and mortality in community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan	Study Objectives: To simultaneously explore the associations between mortality and insomnia, sleep duration, and the use of hypnotics in older adults. Design: A fixed cohort study. Setting: A community in Shih-Pai area, Taipei, Taiwan. Participants: A total of 4,064 participants over the age of 65 completed the study. Intervention: N/A. Measurements and Results: Insomnia was classified using an exclusionary hierarchical algorithm, which categorized insomnia as "no insomnia," "subjective poor sleep quality," "Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5 insomnia," "1-month insomnia disorder," and "6-month insomnia disorder." The main outcome variables were 9-year all-cause mortality rates. In the all-cause mortality analyses, when hypnotic use, depressive symptoms and total sleep time were excluded from a proportional hazards regression model, subjects with "Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5 insomnia" had a higher mortality risk (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45). In the full model, frequent hypnotic use and long sleep duration predicted higher mortality rates. However, the increased mortality risk for subjects with "Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5 insomnia" was not observed in the full model. On the contrary, individuals with a 6-month DSM-IV insomnia disorder had a lower risk for premature death (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.96). Conclusions: Long sleep duration and frequent hypnotics use predicted an increased mortality risk within a community-dwelling sample of older adults. The association between insomnia and mortality was affected by insomnia definition and other parameters related to sleep patterns.

84882820377	Efficacy and practical issues of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on chronic medically unexplained symptoms of pain	Abstract Chronic pain is a common issue worldwide and remains a big challenge to physicians, particularly when the underlying causes do not meet any specific disease for settlement. Such medically unexplained somatic symptoms of pain that lack an integrated diagnosis in medicine have a high psychiatric comorbidity such as depression, and will require a multidisciplinary treatment strategy for a better outcome. Thus, most patients deserted management in spite of being inadequately treated and even presented with high resistance to analgesic drugs. Noninvasive brain stimulation, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has been used to treat refractory neuropathic pain and the analgesic efficacy is promising. So far, some case series and randomized rTMS studies have reported on patients with certain medically unexplained symptoms (MUSs) of pain (e.g., psychogenic pain or somatic symptoms in major depression and fibromyalgia). However, there is still no review article that is specific to the efficacy of rTMS on chronic unexplained symptoms of pain. Therefore, in the present review, we ventured to clarify the terminology and summarized the analgesic effects of rTMS on chronic MUSs of pain. © 2013, Taiwan Society of Anesthesiologists.

84883411290	Hyperthyroidism and Risk for Bipolar Disorders: A Nationwide Population-Based Study	Background:Thyroid disorders have long been associated with psychiatric illness, often with symptoms suggestive of mood disorders. The most common clinical features associated with hyperthyroidism are anxiety and depression. The risk of bipolar disorders, especially bipolar mania, among patients with thyroid disorders has not been well characterized.Objective:We explored the relationship of hyperthyroidism and the subsequent development of bipolar disorders, and examined the risk factors for bipolar disorders in patients with hyperthyroidism.Methods:We identified patients who were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism between 2000 and 2010 in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A comparison cohort without hyperthyroidism was matched based on age, sex, and comorbidities. The occurrence of bipolar disorders was evaluated in both cohorts based on diagnosis and the use of mood stabilizer drugs.Results:The hyperthyroidism cohort consisted of 21, 574 patients, and the comparison cohort consisted of 21, 574 matched control patients without hyperthyroidism. The incidence of bipolar disorders (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.31, 95% CI 1.80-2.99, P<.001) was higher for the hyperthyroidism patients than the control patients. Multivariate, matched regression models showed that women (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.34-3.05, P =. 001), patients with alcohol use disorders (HR 3.03, 95% CI 1.58-5.79, P =. 001), and those with asthma (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.18-2.43, P =. 004) were independent risk factors for the development of bipolar disorders in hyperthyroidism patients.Conclusions:Although a possibility that the diagnosis of bipolar disorders in this study actually includes "bipolar disorders due to hyperthyroidism" cannot be excluded, this study suggests that hyperthyroidism may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorders. © 2013 Hu et al.

84884587312	Taiwan consensus of pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder is an important psychiatric disorder with different disease phases. The pharmacological treatment is complicated, and is updated frequently as new research evidence emerges. For the purpose of international collaboration, research, and education, the Taiwan consensus of pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorders was initiated by the Taiwanese Society of Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology (TSBPN) - the Bipolar Chapter, which was established in August 2010 and approved as a member of International Society of Bipolar Disorder. TSBPN is the country member of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP). The development of the Taiwan consensus for bipolar disorder was mainly based on the template of WFSBP Guidelines, with references to other international guidelines including the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, and British Association for Psychopharmacology. We have also added Taiwanese experts' experience, Taiwan national health insurance data, and the indications for the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder given by the Taiwan Department of Health, to emphasize the balance between efficacy and safety, and to make this consensus a concise, empirical, and important reference for clinical psychiatric practice. © 2013 .

84885579103	Asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A nationwide population-based prospective cohort study	Background Previous cross-sectional studies have suggested an association between asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the temporal relationship was not determined. Using a nationwide population-based prospective case-control cohort study (1:4, age-/gender-matched), we hypothesized that asthma in infanthood or early childhood would increase the risk of ADHD in later life. Methods In all, 2,294 children with asthma and 9,176 controls aged between 0 and 3 years in 2000 were included in our study. Cases of ADHD that occurred to the end of follow-up (31 December 2010) were identified. Results Children with asthma had a higher incidence of developing ADHD (7% vs. 4.6%, p <.001) than control cohort during the follow-up period. After adjusting for age at enrollment, gender, level of urbanization, and comorbid allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis), children with asthma had an elevated risk (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.59) of developing ADHD compared with control group. Discussion Our prospective study supported a temporal relationship between asthma and ADHD. Asthma in very early life increased the risk of developing ADHD during the school years. Further studies are required to investigate whether the prompt treatment of asthma and comorbid allergic diseases could prevent the development of ADHD or decrease ADHD symptoms. © 2013 The Authors.

84886580878	Classification of bipolar disorder using basal-ganglia-related functional connectivity in the resting state	The emotional and cognitive symptoms of bipolar disorder (BD) are suggested to involve in a distributed neural network. The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers an important tool to investigate the alterations in brain network level of BD. The aim of this study was to discriminate BD patients from healthy controls using whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns. The majority of most discriminating functional connectivities were between the basal ganglia and three core neurocognitive networks, including the default mode, executive control and salience networks. Using these resting-state functional connectivities between the basal ganglia and three core neurocognitive networks as the features, the clustering accuracy achieved 90%. © 2013 IEEE.

84888106806	Medical education in Ecuador	Background: Ecuador, the smallest of the Andean countries, is located in the northwest portion of South America. The nation's 14.5 million people have a tremendous need for high quality primary care. Aims: To describe the profound advances as well as the persistent needs in medical education in Ecuador that have occurred with globalization and with the modernization of the country. Methods: Through an extensive search of the literature; medical school data; reports from the Ecuador Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Education; and information from the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, and Innovation (SENESCYT), the medical education system in Ecuador has been thoroughly examined. Results: The National System of Higher Education in Ecuador has experienced significant growth over the last 20 years. As of 2009 the system boasts 19 medical schools, all of which offer the required education needed to obtain the title of Physician, but only 12 of which offer postgraduate clinical training. Of these 19 universities, nine are public, five are private and self-financed, and five are private and co-financed. Post-graduate options for medical students include: (1) Clinical specialization, (2) Higher diploma, (3) Course specialization, (4) Master's degree, and (5) PhD degree. Conclusion: The rapid growth of Ecuador's system of medical education has led to inevitable gaps that threaten its ability to sustain itself. Chief among these is the lack of well-trained faculty to supply its medical schools. To ensure an adequate supply of faculty exists, the creation of sufficient postgraduate, sub-specialization, and PhD training positions must be created and maintained. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

84891156662	Higher risk of developing major depression and bipolar disorder in later life among adolescents with asthma: A nationwide prospective study	Objective: Previous studies have suggested an immunological dysfunction in mood disorders, but rarely have investigated the temporal association between allergic diseases and mood disorders. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we attempted to investigate the association between asthma in early adolescence and the risk of unipolar depression and bipolar disorder in later life. Methods: In all, 1453 adolescents with asthma aged between 10 and 15 years and 5812 age-/gender-matched controls were selected in 1998-2000. Subjects with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder that occurred up to the end of follow-up (December 31 2010) were identified. Results: Adolescents with asthma had a higher incidence of major depression (2.8% vs. 1.1%, p<0.001), any depressive disorder (6.1% vs. 2.6%, p<0.001), and bipolar disorder (1.0% vs. 0.3%, p<0.001) than the control group. Cox regression analysis showed that asthma in early adolescence was associated with an increased risk of developing major depression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-2.89), any depressive disorder (HR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.27-2.37), and bipolar disorder (HR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.01-5.07), after adjusting for demographic data and comorbid allergic diseases. Discussion: Adolescents with asthma had an elevated risk of developing mood disorders in later life. Further studies would be required to investigate the underlying mechanisms for this comorbid association and elucidate whether prompt intervention for asthma would decrease the risk of developing mood disorders. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84891843464	Pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with somatic and pain symptoms in depression	Background More than two-thirds of depressed patients complain of somatic and pain symptoms, which are frequently regarded as a psychological reaction. Although there is a growing body of evidence showing that depression is related to immune abnormalities, few studies have investigated the association between inflammatory cytokines and somatic/pain symptoms. Method Patients with depressive disorder but without any medical disorders, and age/gender/body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. All the subjects completed the self-rating scales of the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale, which was comprised of depressive, somatic, and pain subscales. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), soluble interleukin 6 receptor (sIL-6R), soluble TNF-receptors (sTNF-R), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and adiponectin, were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results In all, 109 patients with depressive disorder and 126 normal controls were enrolled. The patients with depressive disorder had significantly more severe depression, somatic and pain symptoms (all p<0.001), and higher levels of sIL-2R (p<0.0001), sTNF-R (p<0.001), and sP-selectin (p=0.005) than the normal control group. Using multivariate regression analysis with controlling of age, gender, BMI, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, sIL-2R was the most significant predictor for depressive symptoms (p<0.0001); with further controlling of severity of depressive symptom, sP-selectin was the only predictor for somatic (p=0.002) and pain (p=0.059) symptoms. Conclusion The elevated sP-selectin associated with somatic symptoms in depression, may indicate early micro-vascular changes occur subtly, and provide neurobiological evidence for somatic and pain symptom in depression. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84891931018	Small-world Network for Investigating Functional Connectivity in Bipolar Disorder: A Functional Magnetic Images (fMRI) Study	Small-world network is a highly clustered system but with small mean path length between networks which allow the information transferred with high efficiency. The human brain can be considered as a sparse, complex network modeled by the small-world properties. Once the brain network was disrupted by disease, the small-world properties would be altered to manifest that the information integration was inefficiency and the network was loosely organized. The aim of this study is to investigate the difference of small-world properties of brain functional network derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) between the healthy subjects and the patients with Bipolar disorder (BD). The functional MRI data was acquired from 5 healthy subjects and 5 patients with Bipolar disorder. All images of each subject were parcellated into 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions which were defined as the nodes of the network. The functional relations between the 90 regions were estimated by the frequency-based mutual information followed by thresholding to construct a set of undirected graphs. Small-world properties, such as the degree and strength of the connectivity, clustering coefficient of connections, mean path length among brain regions, global efficiency and local efficiency, are examined between any pair of functional areas. Our findings indicated that, in comparison with the control subjects, the BD patients presented smaller values of the degree, the strength of the connectivity and the clustering coefficient of connections, whereas larger values of mean path length among brain regions. This suggested the reduced global and local efficiency of the small-world properties for BD patients. In addition, the small-world properties of BD patients were altered significantly in some regions in the frontal lobes and limbic system which were in good agreement with the dysfunction connectivity reported by the previous literatures in the study of bipolar disorder.

84892604542	Variant GADL1 and response to lithium therapy in bipolar I disorder	BACKGROUND: Lithium has been a first-line choice for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorders to prevent relapse of mania and depression, but many patients do not have a response to lithium treatment. METHODS: We selected subgroups from a sample of 1761 patients of Han Chinese descent with bipolar I disorder who were recruited by the Taiwan Bipolar Consortium. We assessed their response to lithium treatment using the Alda scale and performed a genomewide association study on samples from one subgroup of 294 patients with bipolar I disorder who were receiving lithium treatment. We then tested the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed the strongest association with a response to lithium for association in a replication sample of 100 patients and tested them further in a follow-up sample of 24 patients. We sequenced the exons, exon-intron boundaries, and part of the promoter of the gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase-like protein 1 (GADL1) in 94 patients who had a response to lithium and in 94 patients who did not have a response in the genomewide association sample. RESULTS: Two SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that are located in the introns of GADL1 showed the strongest associations in the genomewide association study (P = 5.50×10

84891967475	Potential biomarkers for bipolar disorder: P11 expression and PET	Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex, chronic psychiatric condition characterized by recurring episodes of depression and mania or hypomania. It is subdivided into BD-I and BD-II, based on the nature and severity of the mood episodes experienced. Substantial evidence demonstratesthat p11 (S100A10) and positron emission tomography (PET) are potential biomarkers for BD. For example, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) p11 mRNA was over-expressed in BD compared with non-BD controls. Comparing BD patients to healthy controls (HCs), normalized glucose metabolism (NGM) was higher in the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and amygdala, but lower in the anterior cingulate cortex (aCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), insula and thalamus. Compared to BD-II, BD-I had hypometabolism of glucose in the aCC, bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyrus, insula and striatum, and hypermetabolism of glucose in the left parahippocampus. In addition, PBMC p11 mRNA levels were significantly positively correlated with NGM in the mPFC, aCC, left insula, bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and left middle, inferior and superior temporal gyri, and withthe number of depressive episodes in BD patients, especially in BD-I patients. These data demonstrate that PBMC p11 mRNA expression is associated with neural activation in the brain of BD patients and warrants a larger translational study to determine its clinical utility. In this chapter, we will discuss the background information of p11 as a potential biomarker for BD. In addition, we develop the concept of combining blood p11 levels with PET as biomarkers for BD diagnosis. We will also discuss the current status of this research, including methods, such as blood sample collection, mRNA purification, real time PCR and PET data analysis for BD biomarker identification. Specifically, we will discuss the strategies for developing a blood test and PET for BD diagnosis from bench to bedside and/or from bedside to bench, a two-way approach. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

84892676188	Association between maternal behavior in infancy and adult mental health: A 30-year prospective study	Background Existing theories suggest that the mother-infant relationship has a potentially significant effect on long-term adult mental health, but there are few empirical data to support this view. Even fewer prior studies have examined the specific dynamics of the mother-infant relationship and their association with adult mental health. Methods A total of 1752 inner-city infants born between 1960 and 1965 were followed prospectively as a part of the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) and the Johns Hopkins Pathways to Adulthood Study. Multiple observations of development and an extensive adult interview were performed. Maternal behavior was observed and systematically rated at the infant's 4-month pediatric neurological evaluation and at 8 months by a developmental psychologist. Factor analysis was used to organize the maternal behavior variables into different types of dysfunctional mother-infant relationships. Adult mental health was assessed at the follow-up interview, when the infant had reached the age of 27-33 years, by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and self-perception of current mental health. Results There was a significant association between unsupportive maternal behavior at 8 months and subsequent poor adult mental health (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.026). There was no association between overly involved maternal behavior and poor mental health as an adult. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, the elevated rates of poor adult mental health in children of mothers who exhibited unsupportive maternal behavior at 8 months persisted (OR = 1.41 [95% CI = 1.00-1.97], p < 0.05). Conclusion Infants who experience unsupportive maternal behavior at 8 months have an increased risk for developing psychological sequelae later in life. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84892367435	Interleukin-1 beta C-511T polymorphism modulates functional connectivity of anterior midcingulate cortex in non-demented elderly Han males	Recent resting fMRI studies have suggested that the functional connectivity of the brain's large-scale networks is associated with the cognitive decline of aging and is modulated by genetic factors. Our previous study found a significant association between interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta) C-511T polymorphism and working memory performance among elderly people. This study investigates the effects of IL-1 beta C-511T polymorphism on the functional connectivity of the cognitive division of the cingulate cortex [i.e., the anterior midcingulate (aMCC)] in non-demented Han elderly people and tests the hypothesis that T/T carriers are associated with lowered FC. Non-demented elderly males (n = 95) received resting MRI scanning, genotyping, and cognitive evaluation using the cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI) and the Wechsler digit span task test. The functional connectivity map in each subject was derived based on positive correlations of low-frequency fMRI fluctuations with a seed in the aMCC according to structural definition. Between-group difference was compared by random effect analysis. Compared to the C/C or C/T carriers, the T/T carriers had a significantly worse CASI performance, especially in the abstraction scores. For the functional connectivity analysis, the T/T carriers exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity with several prefrontal areas and the left putamen. The cortico-striatal connection between the aMCC and left putamen was correlated with the CASI abstraction and attention scores. The results were consistent with our hypothesis and supported that the brains' functional connectivity in elderly people may be modulated by genetic polymorphism associated with local inflammation processes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84893585177	Delayed onset urticaria in depressive patients with bupropion prescription: A nationwide population-based study	Background: Bupropion, which is widely used in patients with depressive disorder, may cause allergic reactions. However, the real prevalence of these side effects may be overlooked and underreported due to the delayed onset phenomenon. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the real incidence of bupropion-induced urticaria and clarify the delayed onset phenomenon. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study between 2000 and 2009 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Dataset. Among 65,988 patients with depressive disorders, we identified new users of bupropion with depressive disorders (bupropion cohort, n = 2,839) and matched them at a ratio of 1:4 regarding age and sex (nonbupropion matched cohort, n = 11,356). The risk of urticaria was compared between the two cohorts. Results: The risk of urticaria occurrence was higher in bupropion users than in matched controls within 4 weeks of starting the medication (risk ratio 1.81; 95% confidence interval 1.28-2.54; p = 0.001). The occurrence of urticaria in the bupropion cohort were more frequent on Days 15-28 than Day 1-14 (p = 0.002). Cox proportional hazards model showed that a history of urticaria was an independent risk factor for developing bupropion-induced urticaria. Conclusions: Of the antidepressants, bupropion may pose a higher risk of drug-induced urticaria, and this condition might be ignored due to the delayed onset phenomenon. Depressive patients with a history of urticaria are at higher risk of the adverse drug reaction. This study emphasizes the need for increased clinical awareness of this adverse outcome to bupropion use. © 2013 Hu et al.

84893268700	Increased risk of autism spectrum disorder among early life asthma patients: An 8-year nationwide population-based prospective study	Previous research has suggested an association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and allergic disorders, but epidemiological evidence regarding asthma remains limited. We conducted a nationwide population-based prospective cohort study (1:4 case:control patients, age- and gender-matched), hypothesizing that asthma in infancy or toddlerhood increased the risk of ASD. The participants comprised 2134 asthmatic infants and children and 8536 controls aged 0-3 years in 2002. We identified cases of ASD that occurred near the end of the follow-up period (December 31, 2010), determining that asthmatic infants and children exhibited a higher accumulative incidence rate of ASD than did the controls (1.3% vs 0.7%, P =.007). After adjusting for age at enrollment, gender, level of urbanization, and comorbid allergic diseases (i.e., allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis), asthmatic infants and children exhibited an elevated risk of developing ASD (hazard ratio: 2.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.19-3.40). This prospective study indicated a temporal relation between asthma and subsequent ASD diagnosis, supporting the immune hypothesis of ASD pathogenesis. Further studies are required to clarify the probable interactional effects between these disorders and define a homogenous ASD subgroup. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84895060444	Higher risk of mood disorders among adolescents with ADHD and asthma: A nationwide prospective study	Background Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and asthma are commonly comorbid together, and are associated with an increased risk of development of mood disorders separately. However, there has been no study investigating the comorbid effect of these two disorders on developing mood disorder. Methods Using the National Health Insurance Research Database, adolescents with ADHD-alone, asthma-alone, ADHD comorbid with asthma, and age-/gender-matched (1:4) controls were recruited in 2003. Subjects who developed major depression, any depressive disorder, or bipolar disorder during the follow-up period (2003-2010) were identified. Results In all, 1172 adolescents with ADHD-alone, 487 with asthma-alone, 238 with ADHD+asthma, and 7552 controls were recruited in 2003. Adolescents with ADHD+asthma and those with ADHD-alone, but not those with asthma-alone, had an elevated risk of developing major depression (hazard ratio [HR]: 10.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.86-27.19; HR: 8.64, 95%CI: 5.00-14.93; HR: 2.11, 95%CI: 0.71-6.23) and bipolar disorder (HR: 31.25, 95%CI: 8.87-110.12; HR: 10.42, 95%CI: 4.60-23.63; HR: 1.91, 95%CI: 0.24-15.32) compared to the control group. Discussion Our results showed that ADHD adolescents had an increased risk of developing both unipolar depression and bipolar depression in their later life, and that the comorbidity of asthma with a synergistic effect increased this risk further. The underlying pathophysiology among ADHD, asthma, and mood disorders needs further investigation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84895753869	Risk of depressive disorder following non-alcoholic cirrhosis: A nationwide population-based study	Background & Aims: To evaluate the risk of depressive disorders among non-alcoholic patients by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of a matched cohort of 52 725 participants (10 545 non-alcoholic cirrhotic patients and 42 180 control patients) who were selected from the NHIRD. Patients were observed for a maximum of 11 years to determine the rates of newly onset depressive disorders, and Cox regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with depressive disorders in cirrhotic patients. Results: During the 11-year follow-up period, 395 (3.75%) non-alcoholic cirrhotic patients and 1 183 (2.80%) control patients were diagnosed with depressive disorders. The incidence risk ratio of depressive disorders between non-alcoholic cirrhotic patients and control patients was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.57-1.98, P<.001). After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, non-alcoholic cirrhotic patients were 1.75 times more likely to develop depressive disorders (95% CI, 1.56-1.96, P<.001) compared with the control patients. The hazard ratios for patients younger than 60 years old (1.31) and female (1.25) indicated that each is an independent risk factor for depressive disorders in non-alcoholic cirrhotic patients. Conclusions: The likelihood of developing depressive disorders is greater among non-alcoholic cirrhotic patients than among patients without cirrhosis. Symptoms of depression should be sought in patients with cirrhosis. © 2014 Perng et al.

84895795241	Disrupted thalamo-cortical connectivity in schizophrenia: A morphometric correlation analysis	Increasing studies have implicated the thalamus in schizophrenia, supporting the view that this structure has an important role in this disorder. Given that extensive reciprocal connections exist between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, it is believed that disruptions of the thalamo-cortical connections may underlie the multiplicity of schizophrenic symptoms. Therefore, assessing the relationship between the thalamus and the neocortex may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We analyzed magnetic resonance images from a sample of 101 schizophrenic patients and 101 healthy controls. By assessing the correlation between the thalamic volume and cortical thickness at each vertex on the cortical surface, a thalamo-cortical network was obtained for each group. We compared the patterns of thalamo-cortical connectivity between the two groups. Compared with healthy controls, less distributed cortical regions were identified in the thalamo-cortical network in patients with schizophrenia. Vertex-wise comparison revealed decreased thalamo-cortical connectivity in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, the left superior temporal gyrus and the right parieto-occipital region in schizophrenia. The observed disruptions in thalamo-cortical connectivity might be the substrate underlying the wide range of schizophrenic symptoms and provide further evidence to support the notion of schizophrenia as a disorder of brain dysconnectivity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84897400990	Is neonatal jaundice associated with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other psychological development? A nationwide prospective study	Neonatal jaundice may cause the lifelong sequelae of central nerve system developmental disorders. However, the results are inconsistent. 2016 newborns with neonatal jaundice and 8064 age-/gender-matched (1:4) controls were enrolled during 1999-2000. Participants of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other developmental disorders that occurred during the follow-up were identified. Newborns with neonatal jaundice had increased risks of developing ASD (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-2.90), any developmental delay (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.58), and developmental speech or language disorder (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.11-1.79). Newborn exposure to hyperbilirubinemia was related to the increased risk of developing ASD, any developmental delay, and developmental speech or language disorder in later life. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84897441804	High dosage of hypnotics predicts subsequent sleep-related breathing disorders and is associated with worse outcomes for depression	Objectives: The rates of sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD) and treatment outcomes of depression were compared among insomnia patients who had stratified levels of hypnotic use during a 10-year follow-up (2001-2010). Design: A nationwide population-based cohort study. Setting: A nationally representative cohort of 1,000,000 enrollees. Participants: Data were collected from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and comorbid insomnia during January 2001 to December 2003 (study cohort N = 3,235). The mean dosage of hypnotics at baseline in the study cohort was calculated, and this information was used to categorize the cohort into three equal-sized groups based on levels of hypnotic dosage. Main outcome measures: Patient response to antidepressants during a period that extended from 1 year before to 1 year after the study (short-term outcome) and patient psychiatric and non-psychiatric visits and hospitalizations during follow-up (long-term outcome) were analyzed. Results: High-dosage patients presented the highest rates of subsequent SRBD diagnosis (3.9%), compared to medium-dosage patients (2.2%) and low-dosage patients (2.0%) (P = 0.011). Significantly more patients in the high-dosage group were difficult to treat with antidepressants compared to the other 2 groups (8.7% vs. 4.1% vs. 3.0%, P < 0.001), and their long-term depression outcome was worse for most parameters. Logistic regression showed that high-dosage hypnotics predicted the development of SRBD later (OR 1.678 [CI, 1.051 to 2.680], P = 0.030). Conclusions: There is a reliable association between a history of high dosages of hypnotics, subsequent diagnosis of sleep related breathing disorder, and worse depression outcomes.

84897492408	Association of polypharmacy with fall-related fractures in older Taiwanese people: Age- and gender-specific analyses	Objective: To elucidate the associations between polypharmacy and age- and gender-specific risks of admission for fall-related fractures. Design: Nested case-control study. Setting: This analysis was randomly selected from all elderly beneficiaries in 2007-2008, and represents some 30% of the whole older insurers using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Participants: We identified 5933 cases newly admitted for fall-related fractures during 2007-2008, and 29 665 random controls free from fracture. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Polypharmacy was defined as the use of fall-related drugs of four or more categories of medications and prescribed related to fall within a 1-year period. Logistic regression models were employed to estimate the ORs and related 95% CIs. The interaction of polypharmacy with age and sex was assessed separately. Results: Compared with those who consumed no category of medication, older people who consumed 1, 2, 3 and ≥4 categories of medications were all at significantly increased odds of developing fall-related fractures, with a significant dose-gradient pattern (β=0.7953; p for trend <0.0001). There were significant interactions between polypharmacy and age, but no significant interactions between polypharmacy and gender. The dose-gradient relationship between number of medications category and risk of fall-related fractures was more obvious in women than in men (β=0.1962 vs β=0.1873). Additionally, it was most evident in older people aged 75-84 years (β=0.2338). Conclusions: This population-based study in Taiwan confirms the link between polypharmacy and increased risk of fall-related fractures in older people; and highlights that elderly women and older people aged 75-84 years will be the targeted participants for further prevention from fall-related fractures caused by polypharmacy.

84900424920	Altered resting-state functional connectivity of striatal-thalamic circuit in bipolar disorder	Bipolar disorder is characterized by internally affective fluctuations. The abnormality of inherently mental state can be assessed using resting-state fMRI data without producing task-induced biases. In this study, we hypothesized that the resting-state connectivity related to the frontal, striatal, and thalamic regions, which were associated with mood regulations and cognitive functions, can be altered for bipolar disorder. We used the Pearson's correlation coefficients to estimate functional connectivity followed by the hierarchical modular analysis to categorize the resting-state functional regions of interest (ROIs). The selected functional connectivities associated with the striatal-thalamic circuit and default mode network (DMN) were compared between bipolar patients and healthy controls. Significantly decreased connectivity in the striatalthalamic circuit and between the striatal regions and the middle and posterior cingulate cortex was observed in the bipolar patients. We also observed that the bipolar patients exhibited significantly increased connectivity between the thalamic regions and the parahippocampus. No significant changes of connectivity related to the frontal regions in the DMN were observed. The changed resting-state connectivity related to the striatal-thalamic circuit might be an inherent basis for the altered emotional and cognitive processing in the bipolar patients. © 2014 Teng et al.

84900872047	Risk of depressive disorder among patients with herpes zoster: A nationwide population-based prospective study	OBJECTIVE: Herpes zoster results from reactivation of the endogenous varicella zoster virus infection. Previous studies have shown that herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia were associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. However, no prospective study has investigated the association between herpes zoster and the development of depressive disorder. METHODS: Subjects were identified through the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients 18 years or older with a diagnosis of herpes zoster and without a psychiatric history were enrolled in 2000 and compared with age-/sex-matched controls (1:4). These participants were followed up to the end of 2010 for new-onset depressive disorder. RESULTS: A total of 1888 patients with herpes zoster were identified and compared with 7552 age-/sex-matched controls in 2000. Those with herpes zoster had a higher incidence of developing major depression (2.2% versus 1.4%, p = .018) and any depressive disorder (4.3% versus 3.2%, p = .020) than did the control group. The follow-up showed that herpes zoster was an independent risk factor for major depression (hazard ratio = 1.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.04-2.13) and any depressive disorder (hazard ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.70), after adjusting demographic data and comorbid medical diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the temporal association between herpes zoster and depressive disorder. Further studies would be required to clarify the underlying pathophysiology about this association and whether proper treatment of herpes zoster could decrease the long-term risk of depressive disorder. © 2014 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

84902113020	Comparison of inflammatory cytokine levels among type I/type II and manic/hypomanic/euthymic/depressive states of bipolar disorder	Objective Inflammatory cytokines have been suggested to be the trait or state markers of bipolar disorder, but with inconsistent results. This may be related to small sample sizes and poor control of some important confounding factors. Methods Gender/age-matched outpatients with bipolar disorder and normal controls were enrolled. The clinical symptoms were rated using the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. Inflammatory cytokines, including soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (sTNF-R1), soluble P-selectin receptor (sP-selectin), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results In total, 130 patients with bipolar disorder and 130 normal subjects were enrolled. Among the patients with bipolar disorder, 77 (59.2%) had bipolar I disorder, 53 (40.8%) had bipolar II disorder; 75 (57.7%) were in a euthymic state, 14 (10.8%) were in a manic/hypomanic state, and 41 (31.5%) were in a depressive state. The 130 bipolar patients had significantly higher levels of all cytokines than the normal controls (all p<0.0001). Using multivariate regression analysis with controlling of age, gender, BMI, smoking, duration of illness, and medication grouping, the patients with bipolar II disorder had significantly lower levels of sTNF-R1 than the patients with bipolar I disorder (p=0.038); the patients in a depressive state had significantly lower levels of sTNF-R1 than the patients in manic/hypomanic and euthymic states (p=0.009). Conclusion The study supported the association of bipolar disorder with inflammatory dysregulation, and sTNF-R1 may be a potential biomarker for staging bipolar disorder. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84903553668	Efficacy of prefrontal theta-burst stimulation in refractory depression: A randomized sham-controlled study	Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation could modulate cortical excitability and has the potential to treat refractory depression. However, there has been a lack of large randomized studies of the antidepressant efficacy of different forms of theta-burst stimulation, such as intermittent and continuous theta-burst stimulation. A randomized sham-controlled study was conducted to investigate antidepressant efficacy of theta-burst stimulation and to compare efficacy among left-prefrontal intermittent theta-burst stimulation, right-prefrontal continuous theta-burst stimulation and a combination of them in patients showing different levels of antidepressant refractoriness. A group of 60 treatment-refractory patients with recurrent major depressive disorder were recruited and randomized to four groups (Group A: continuous theta-burst stimulation; Group B: intermittent theta-burst stimulation; Group C: a combination of continuous and intermittent theta-burst stimulation; and Group D: sham theta-burst stimulation; 15 patients were included in each group). After 2 weeks of theta-burst stimulation treatment, depression improved in all groups. Groups B and C had better antidepressant responses (as reflected by % decreases in depression score) than Groups A and D (P = 0.001, post hoc analysis: B > A, B > D, C > A, and C > D), even after controlling for age and refractoriness scores. The mean antidepressant effect was highest in Group C and followed by that in Group B. Additionally, a significant placebo effect was found in patients with low refractoriness; this disappeared in patients with moderate-to-high refractoriness. A significant correlation existed between refractoriness scores and treatment responses. Treatment refractoriness was a significant factor negatively predicting efficacy of theta-burst stimulation (P = 0.039). This randomized sham-controlled study demonstrated that active theta-burst stimulation is a well-tolerated form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and has good antidepressant efficacy, particularly in depressed subjects within a certain range of treatment refractoriness. © 2014 The Author.

84903304792	A snapshot of the status of problem-based learning (PBL) in Chinese medical schools	Introduction: In North America, where it was born, problem-based learning (PBL) has seen dips and rises in its popularity, but its inherent strengths have led to its spread to medical schools all over the world. Although its use at medical schools in some Western countries has already been examined, no one has looked at its status in many other countries, including China. The aim of this study is to determine the number of schools currently using PBL in China, the degree to which they use it, and the reasoning behind such usage. Methods: We used survey and internet search to examine PBL usage at Chinese medical schools. We were able to collect data from 43 first-class Chinese medical schools that are geographically diverse and thus representative of medical schools all across China. Results: 34 (79.1%) of the 43 medical schools use PBL in the preclinical curriculum. Of the 34, data were collected from 24 (70.6%) medical schools regarding the extent of their PBL usage. Nine (37.5%) schools use PBL for less than 10% of preclinical hours, 14 (58.3%) schools use PBL for 10-50% of preclinical hours, and one (4.2%) school uses PBL for more than 50% of preclinical hours. Conclusion: In our sample of Chinese medical institutions, a large majority of schools use PBL, however, most schools use it for less than 50% of total preclinical curricular hours. Our results suggest that schools are interested in increasing the number of curricular hours devoted to PBL but are constrained by resources. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

84905400944	Autistic spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and allergy: Is there a link? A nationwide study	Previous studies showed that both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) were associated separately with a higher risk of allergic diseases. However, the comorbid effect of ADHD and ASD on the risk of allergic diseases is still unknown. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5386 children aged less than 18 years with ADHD alone, 578 with ASD alone, 458 with ADHD + ASD, and 25,688 non-ADHD/ASD age- and sex-matched (1:4) controls were enrolled in our study. The prevalence of allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic conjunctivitis, was evaluated among the four groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the ADHD + ASD group (odds ratio [OR]: 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83-2.79), ADHD-alone group (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.70-1.93), and ASD-alone group (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04-1.48) had an increased risk of allergic comorbidities compared to the control after adjusting age, sex, and level of urbanization. ASD children with more allergic comorbidities (≧3: OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.74-3.79; 2: OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.41-2.84; 1: OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.16-2.22) were associated with a greater likelihood of ADHD. Children with ADHD or ASD had an increased risk of allergic comorbidities, and those with both ADHD and ASD had the highest. These results may inspire more research to clarify the underlying mechanisms among ASD, ADHD, and allergic diseases. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84905583366	Risk of epilepsy among patients with atopic dermatitis: A nationwide longitudinal study	Summary Objective Both atopic dermatitis and epilepsy have been regarded as chronic inflammatory diseases. However, their association has yet to be investigated. Methods Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 35,312 patients with atopic dermatitis but without a history of epilepsy, and 35,312 age-/gender-matched controls were enrolled between 1998 and 2008, and followed to the end of 2011 to identify the development of epilepsy. Results Subjects with atopic dermatitis had a higher incidence of developing epilepsy (0.94 vs. 0.27/1,000 person-years, p < 0.001) than the control group. The Cox regression model showed that atopic dermatitis increased the risk of developing epilepsy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23-3.82) after adjusting for demographic data and medical comorbidities. Sensitivity tests showed consistent findings (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.68-2.96) after excluding the first year of observation. In addition, asthma (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.72) and allergic rhinitis (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.73) were related to the risk of epilepsy. Significance Subjects with atopic dermatitis were associated with an increased risk of developing epilepsy in later life. Further studies would be needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. © 2014 International League Against Epilepsy.

84908050009	A predisposition for allergies predicts subsequent hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: A nationwide longitudinal study	Background: Previous studies have shown that both severe mental disorders (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) and atopic diseases were associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. However, the role of atopy/the predisposition for allergies in the development of metabolic syndrome is still unknown among those with severe mental disorders. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5826 patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (1908 with a predisposition for allergies and 3918 without) were enrolled between 1998 and 2008. Those who developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, and/or diabetes mellitus were identified during the follow-up to the end of 2011. Results: A predisposition for allergies increased the risk of developing hypertension (HR: 1.67), dyslipidemia (HR: 1.82), and diabetes mellitus (HR: 1.37) in later life among those with severe mental disorders. A dose-dependent relationship was noted between having more atopic comorbidities and a greater likelihood of hypertension (1 atopic disease: HR: 1.60; ≧. 2 atopic comorbidities: HR: 1.87), dyslipidemia (HR: 1.73; HR: 2.12), and diabetes mellitus (HR: 1.26; HR: 1.69). Conclusion: A predisposition for allergies was an independent risk factor for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Further studies would be required to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology among atopy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and metabolic syndrome.

84922740058	Comorbidity of narcolepsy and schizophrenia in an adolescent patient	A 13-year-old boy suffered from hypersomnia, fragmented nighttime sleep, and cataplexy since age 10 years, and then developed prominent psychotic symptoms (i.e., auditory and visual hallucination, hallucinatory behavior, delusions of reference, and misidentification) that occurred persistently during the wakeful and consciously clear period when he was aged 12 years. The child underwent additional medical evaluation and testing, and comorbidity of narcolepsy and schizophrenia was diagnosed. The child's psychotic symptoms and narcolepsy improved significantly upon treatment with methylphenidate 30mg, olanzapine 25mg, and haloperidol 10mg. In this case, the child's symptomology of narcolepsy and schizophrenia and the dilemma of the use of antipsychotics and psychostimulants are representative examples of the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in adolescent psychiatry.

84924843506	Neural network of body representation differs between transsexuals and cissexuals	Body image is the internal representation of an individual's own physical appearance. Individuals with gender identity disorder (GID), commonly referred to as transsexuals (TXs), are unable to form a satisfactory body image due to the dissonance between their biological sex and gender identity. We reasoned that changes in the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) network would neurologically reflect such experiential incongruence in TXs. Using graph theory-based network analysis, we investigated the regional changes of the degree centrality of the rsFC network. The degree centrality is an index of the functional importance of a node in a neural network. We hypothesized that three key regions of the body representation network, i.e., the primary somatosensory cortex, the superior parietal lobule and the insula, would show a higher degree centrality in TXs. Twenty-three pre-treatment TXs (11 male-to-female and 12 female-to-male TXs) as one psychosocial group and 23 age-matched healthy cissexual control subjects (CISs, 11 males and 12 females) were recruited. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and binarized rsFC networks were constructed. The TXs demonstrated a significantly higher degree centrality in the bilateral superior parietal lobule and the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition, the connectivity between the right insula and the bilateral primary somatosensory cortices was negatively correlated with the selfness rating of their desired genders. These data indicate that the key components of body representation manifest in TXs as critical function hubs in the rsFC network. The negative association may imply a coping mechanism that dissociates bodily emotion from body image. The changes in the functional connectome may serve as representational markers for the dysphoric bodily self of TXs. © 2014 Lin et al.
