0901.0820	a keck/deimos spectroscopic survey of the faint m31 satellites and xv  and and xvi	we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discoveredm31 satellites and xv and and xvi, lying at projected distances from the centreof m31 of 93 and 130 kpc respectively. these satellites lie to the south ofm31, in regions of the stellar halo which wide field imaging has revealed asrelative voids (compared to the degree-scale coherent stream-like structures).using the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph mounted on the keck iitelescope, we have defined probable members of these satellites, for which wederive radial velocities as precise as ~6 km/s down to i~21.5. while thedistance to and xvi remains the same as previously reported (525pm50 kpc), wehave demonstrated that the brightest three stars previously used to define thetip of the red giant branch (trgb) in and xv are in fact galactic, and and xvis actually likely to be much more distant at 770pm70 kpc (compared to theprevious 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from mv -9.4 to mv~-9.8. the andxv velocity dispersion is resolved with vr =-339+7-6 km/s and sigma-v = 11+7-5km/s. the and xvi dispersion is not quite resolved at 1sigma with vr =-385+5-6km/s and sigma-v = 0+10-indef km/s. using the photometry of the confirmedmember stars, we find metallicities of and xv (median [fe/h]=-1.58, interquar-tile range +-0.08), and and xvi (median [fe/h]=-2.23, interquartile range+-0.12). stacking the spectra of the member stars, we find spectroscopic[fe/h]=-1.8 (-2.1) for and xv (and xvi), with a uncertainty of ~0.2 dex in bothcases. our measure- ments of and xv reasonably resolve its mass (~10^8 msun)and suggest a polar orbit, while the velocity of and xvi suggests it isapproaching the m31 escape velocity given its large m31-centric distance.

0903.3258	an hst/acs view of the inhomogeneous outer halo of m31	we present a high precision photometric view of the stellar populations inthe outer halo of m31, using data taken with the hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys (hst/acs). we analyse the field populationsadjacent to 11 luminous globular clusters which sample the galactocentricradial range 18 &lt; r &lt; 100 kpc and reach a photometric depth of ~2.5 magnitudesbelow the horizontal branch (m_f814w ~27 mag). the colour-magnitude diagrams(cmds) are well populated out to ~60 kpc and exhibit relatively metal-rich redgiant branches, with the densest fields also showing evidence for prominent redclumps. we use the dartmouth isochrones to construct metallicity distributionfunctions (mdfs) which confirm the presence of dominant populations with&lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -0.6 to -1.0 dex and considerable metallicity dispersions of 0.2 to0.3 dex (assuming a 10 gyr population and scaled-solar abundances). the averagemetallicity over the range 30 - 60 kpc is [fe/h] = -0.8 +/- 0.14 dex, with noevidence for a significant radial gradient. metal-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt;= -1.3)typically account for &lt; 10-20 % of the population in each field, irrespectiveof radius. assuming our fields are unbiased probes of the dominant stellarpopulations in these parts, we find that the m31 outer halo remainsconsiderably more metal-rich than that of the milky way out to at least 60 kpc.

0903.4701	a spectroscopic survey of ec4, an extended cluster in andromeda's halo	we present a spectroscopic survey of candidate red giant branch stars in theextended star cluster, ec4, discovered in the halo of m31 from our cfht/megacamsurvey, overlapping the tidal streams, stream cp and stream cr. theseobservations used the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph (deimos) mountedon the keck ii telescope to obtain spectra around the caii triplet region with~1.3 angstroms resolution. six stars lying on the red giant branch within 2core-radii of the centre of ec4 are found to have an averagevr=-287.9^{+1.9}_{-2.4}km/s and velocity dispersion of 2.7^{+4.2}_{-2.7}km/s,taking instrumental errors into account. the resulting mass-to-light ratio forec4 is m/l=6.7^{+15}_{-6.7}msun/lsun, a value that is consistent with aglobular cluster within the 1 sigma errors we derive. from the summed spectraof our member stars, we find ec4 to be metal-poor, with [fe/h]=-1.6+/-0.15. wediscuss several formation and evolution scenarios which could account for ourkinematic and metallicity constraints on ec4, and conclude that ec4 is mostcomparable with an extended globular cluster. we also compare the kinematicsand metallicity of ec4 with stream cp and stream cr, and find that ec4 bears astriking resemblance to stream cp in terms of velocity, and that the twostructures are identical in terms of both their spectroscopic and photometricmetallicities. from this we conclude that ec4 is likely related to stream cp.

0704.1318	the haunted halos of andromeda and triangulum: a panorama of galaxy  formation in action	we present a deep photometric survey of m31, conducted with the cfht and int,covering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the southern quadrant out to 150 kpc,and extending to m33. this is the first systematic panoramic study of this veryoutermost region of galaxies. we detect several streams and other large-scalestructures, and two new dwarf galaxies: and xv and xvi. the discovery ofsubstructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profilebetween 0.5 &lt; r &lt; 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', isparticularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflictingresults reported in previous studies. underlying the substructures lies afaint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least150 kpc. the smooth halo component in m31 has a profile that can be fit with ahernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 largerthan theoretical predictions. alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/-0.11 can be fit to the profile. the total luminosity of this structure issimilar to that of the halo of the milky way. this vast, smooth, underlyinghalo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpectedfrom modern galaxy formation models. m33 is also found to have an extendedmetal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a hernquist model also ofscale radius ~55 kpc. these extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide achallenge and strong constraints for further modeling.

0909.1456	deep gemini/gmos imaging of an extremely isolated globular cluster in  the local group	we report on deep imaging of a remote m31 globular cluster, mgc1, obtainedwith gemini/gmos. our colour-magnitude diagram for this object extends ~5magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch and exhibits featuresconsistent with an ancient metal-poor stellar population, including a long,well-populated horizontal branch. the red giant branch locus suggests mgc1 hasa metal abundance [m/h] ~ -2.3. we measure the distance to mgc1 and find thatit lies ~160 kpc in front of m31 with a distance modulus of 23.95 +/- 0.06.combined with its large projected separation of 117 kpc from m31 this implies adeprojected radius of rgc = 200 +/- 20 kpc, rendering it the most isolatedknown globular cluster in the local group by some considerable margin. weconstruct a radial brightness profile for mgc1 and show that it is bothcentrally compact and rather luminous, with mv = -9.2. remarkably, the clusterprofile shows no evidence for a tidal limit and we are able to trace it to aradius of at least 450 pc, and possibly as far as ~900 pc. the profile exhibitsa power-law fall-off with exponent -2.5, breaking to -3.5 in its outermostparts. this core-halo structure is broadly consistent with expectations derivedfrom numerical models, and suggests that mgc1 has spent many gigayears inisolation.

0911.1365	a keck/deimos spectroscopic survey of the faint m31 satellites and ix,  and xi, and xii, and and xiii	we present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint m31 satellitegalaxies, andxi and andxiii, and a reanalysis of existing spectroscopic datafor two further faint companions, and ix and andxii. by combining data obtainedusing the deimos spectrograph mounted on the keck ii telescope with deepphotometry from the suprime-cam instrument on subaru, we have calculated globalproperties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicites andhalf-light radii.we find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([fe/h] -2 bothphotometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and assuch, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationshipestablished with brighter dwarfs. we are unable to resolve a dispersion for andxi due to small sample size and low s/n, but we set a one sigma upper limit ofsigma-v &lt;5 km/s. for and ix, and xii and and xiii we resolve velocitydispersions of v=4.5 (+3.4,-3.2), 2.6(+5.1,-2.6) and 9.7(+8.9,-4.5) km/s, andderive masses within the half light radii of 6.2(+5.3,-5.1)x10^6 msun, 2.4(+6.5,-2.4)x10^6 msun and 1.1(+1.4,-0.7)x10^7 msun respectively. we discusseach satellite in the context of the mateo relations for dwarf spheroidalgalaxies, and the universal halo profiles established for milky way dwarfs(walker et al. 2009). for both galaxies, this sees them fall below theuniversal halo profiles of walker et al. (2009). when combined with thefindings of mcconnachie &amp; irwin (2006a), which reveal that the m31 satellitesare twice as extended (in terms of both half-light and tidal radii) as theirmilky way counterparts, these results suggest that the satellite population ofthe andromeda system could inhabit halos that are significantly different fromthose of the milky way in terms of their central densities (abridged).

1005.5198	computational advances in gravitational microlensing: a comparison of  cpu, gpu, and parallel, large data codes	to assess how future progress in gravitational microlensing computation athigh optical depth will rely on both hardware and software solutions, wecompare a direct inverse ray-shooting code implemented on a graphics processingunit (gpu) with both a widely-used hierarchical tree code on a single-core cpu,and a recent implementation of a parallel tree code suitable for a cpu-basedcluster supercomputer. we examine the accuracy of the tree codes throughcomparison with a direct code over a much wider range of parameter space thanhas been feasible before. we demonstrate that all three codes presentcomparable accuracy, and choice of approach depends on considerations relatingto the scale and nature of the microlensing problem under investigation. oncurrent hardware, there is little difference in the processing speed of thesingle-core cpu tree code and the gpu direct code, however the recent plateauin single-core cpu speeds means the existing tree code is no longer able totake advantage of moore's law-like increases in processing speed. instead, weanticipate a rapid increase in gpu capabilities in the next few years, which isadvantageous to the direct code. we suggest that progress in other areas ofastrophysical computation may benefit from a transition to gpus through the useof "brute force" algorithms, rather than attempting to port the current bestsolution directly to a gpu language -- for certain classes of problems, thesimple implementation on gpus may already be no worse than an optimisedsingle-core cpu version.

1010.5276	the kinematic identification of a thick stellar disc in m31	we present the first characterization of a thick disc component in theandromeda galaxy (m31) using kinematic data from the deimos multi-objectspectrograph instrument on keck ii. using 21 fields in the south west of thegalaxy, we measure the lag of this component with respect to the thin disc, aswell as the dispersion, metallicity and scale length of the component. we findan average lag between the two components of &lt;dv&gt;=46.0+/-3.9km/s. the velocitydispersion of the thick disc is sigma_{thick}=50.8+/-1.9km/s, greater than thevalue of dispersion we determine for the thin disc,sigma_{thin}=35.7+/-1.0km/s. the thick disc is more metal poor than the thindisc, with [fe/h]_{spec}=-1.0+/-0.1 compared to [fe/h]_{spec}=-0.7+/-0.05 forthe thin disc. we measure a radial scale length of the thin and thick discs ofh_r=7.3+/-1.0 kpc and h_r=8.0+/-1.2 kpc. from this, we infer scale heights forboth discs of 1.1+/-0.2 kpc and 2.8+/-0.6 kpc, both of which are ~2--3 timeslarger than those observed in the milky way. we estimate a mass range for thethick disc component of 2.4x10^{10}msun&lt; m_{*,thick} &lt;4.1x10^{10}msun. thisvalue provides a useful constraint on possible formation mechanisms, as anyproposed method for forming a thick disc must be able to heat (or deposit) atleast this amount of material.

1102.0403	exploring the properties of the m31 halo globular cluster system	following on from our discovery of a significant population of m31 outer haloglobular clusters (gcs), and updates to the revised bologna catalogue of m31gcs, we investigate the gc system of m31 out to an unprecedented radius(~120kpc). we derive various ensemble properties, including the magnitude,colour and metallicity distributions, as well as the gc number density profile.one of our most significant findings is evidence for a flattening in the radialgc number density profile in the outer halo. intriguingly, this occurs at agalactocentric radius of ~2 degrees (~30 kpc) which is the radius at which theunderlying stellar halo surface density has also been shown to flatten. the gcswhich lie beyond this radius are remarkably uniform in terms of their blue(v-i)o colours, consistent with them belonging to an ancient population withlittle to no metallicity gradient. structural parameters are also derived for asample of 13 newly-discovered extended clusters (ecs) and we find the lowestluminosity ecs have magnitudes and sizes similar to palomar-type gcs in themilky way halo. we argue that our findings provide strong support for ascenario in which a significant fraction of the outer halo gc population of m31has been accreted.

1102.3501	density variations in the nw star stream of m31	the pan andromeda archeological survey (pandas) cfht megaprime survey of them31-m33 system has found a star stream which extends about 120 kpc nw from thecenter of m31. the great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it doesnot significantly intersect the disk of m31, means that it is unusually wellsuited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a testfor the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. the main result of thispaper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about threetimes the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. the probability thatthe variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.as a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the samelocation in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [fe/h]=[0, -0.5] andfind no variations above the expected shot noise. the lumpiness of the streamis not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,nor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible m31satellite galaxies. the stream's density variations appear to be consistentwith the effects of a large population of steep mass function dark mattersub-halos, such as found in lcdm simulations, acting on an approximately 10gyrold star stream. the effects of a single set of halo substructure realizationsare shown for illustration, reserving a statistical comparison for anotherstudy.

1103.2121	the scatter about the "universal" dwarf spheroidal mass profile: a  kinematic study of the m31 satellites, and v and and vi	while the satellites of the milky way (mw) have been shown to be largelyconsistent in terms of their mass contained within one half--light radius(m_{half}) with a "universal" mass profile, a number of m31 satellites arefound to be inconsistent with such relations, and seem kinematically colder intheir central regions than their mw cousins. in this work, we present newkinematic and updated structural properties for two m31 dsphs, and v and and viusing data from the keck low resolution imaging spectrograph (lris) and thedeep imaging multi-object spectrograph (deimos) instruments and the subarusuprime-cam imager. we measure systemic velocities of v_r=-393.1+/-4.2km/s and-344.8+/-2.5km/s, and dispersions of sigma_v=11.5{+5.3}{-4.4}km/s andsigma_v=9.4{+3.2}{-2.4}km/s for and v and and vi respectively, meaning thesetwo objects are consistent with the trends in sigma_v and r_{half} set by theirmw counterparts. we also investigate the nature of this scatter about the mwdsph mass profiles for the "classical" (i.e. m_v&lt;-8) mw and m31 dsphs. whencomparing both the "classical" mw and m31 dsphs to the best--fit mass profilesin the size--velocity dispersion plane, we find general scatter in both thepositive (i.e. hotter) and negative (i.e. colder) directions from theseprofiles. however, barring one exception (cvni) only the m31 dsphs are found toscatter towards a colder regime, and, excepting the and i dsph, only mw objectsscatter to hotter dispersions. we also note that the scatter for the combinedpopulation is greater than expected from measurement errors alone. we assessthis divide in the context of the differing disc-to-halo mass (i.e. stars andbaryons to total virial mass) ratios of the two hosts and argue that theunderlying mass profiles for dsphs differ from galaxy to galaxy, and aremodified by the baryonic component of the host.

1103.4883	gravitational microlensing as a probe of the electron scattering region  in q2237+0305	recent observations have provided strong evidence for the presence of anelectron scattering region (esr) within the central regions of agns. this isresponsible for reprocessing emission from the accretion disk into polarisedradiation. the geometry of this scattering region is, however, poorlyconstrained. in this paper, we consider the influence of gravitationalmicrolensing on polarised emission from the esr in the quadruply imaged quasar,q2237+0305, demonstrating how correlated features in the resultant light curvevariations can determine both the size and orientation of the scatteringregion. this signal is due to differential magnification betweenperpendicularly polarised views of the esr, and is clearest for a small esrwidth and a large esr radius. cross- and auto-correlation measures appear to beindependent of lens image shear and convergence parameters, making it ideal toinvestigate esr features. as with many microlensing experiments, the time-scalefor variability, being of order decades to centuries, is impractically long.however, with a polarization filter oriented appropriately with respect to thepath that the quasar takes across the caustic structure, the esr diameter andradius can be estimated from the auto- and cross-correlation of polarized lightcurves on much shorter time-scales.

1107.3206	a bayesian approach to locating the red giant branch tip magnitude (part  i)	we present a new approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch(trgb) which, as we show, works robustly even on sparsely populated targets.moreover, the approach is highly adaptable to the available data for thestellar population under study, with prior information readily incorporableinto the algorithm. the uncertainty in the derived distances is also madetangible and easily calculable from posterior probability distributions. weprovide an outline of the development of the algorithm and present the resultsof tests designed to characterize its capabilities and limitations. we thenapply the new algorithm to three m31 satellites: andromeda i, andromeda ii andthe fainter andromeda xxiii, using data from the pan-andromeda archaeologicalsurvey (pandas), and derive their distances as $731^{(+ 5) + 18}_{(- 4) - 17}$kpc, $634^{(+ 2) + 15}_{(- 2) - 14}$ kpc and $733^{(+ 13)+ 23}_{(- 11) - 22}$kpc respectively, where the errors appearing in parentheses are the componentsintrinsic to the method, while the larger values give the errors afteraccounting for additional sources of error. these results agree well with thebest distance determinations in the literature and provide the smallestuncertainties to date. this paper is an introduction to the workings andcapabilities of our new approach in its basic form, while a follow-up papershall make full use of the method's ability to incorporate priors and use theresulting algorithm to systematically obtain distances to all of m31'ssatellites identifiable in the pandas survey area.

1108.0504	gravitational microlensing of a reverberating quasar broad line region -  i. method and qualitative results	the kinematics and morphology of the broad emission line region (belr) ofquasars are the subject of significant debate. the two leading methods forconstraining belr properties are microlensing and reverberation mapping. herewe combine these two methods with a study of the microlensing behaviour of thebelr in q2237+0305, as a change in continuum emission (a "flare") passesthrough it. beginning with some generic models of the belr - sphere, bicones,disk - we slice in velocity and time to produce brightness profiles of the belrover the duration of the flare. these are numerically microlensed to determinewhether microlensing of reverberation mapping provides new information aboutthe properties of belrs. we describe our method and show images of the modelsas they are flaring, and the unlensed and lensed spectra that are produced.qualitative results and a discussion of the spectra are given in this paper,highlighting some effects that could be observed. our conclusion is that theinfluence of microlensing, while not strong, can produce significant observableeffects that will help in differentiating the properties of belrs.

1111.6666	probing planetary mass dark matter in galaxies: gravitational  nanolensing of multiply imaged quasars	gravitational microlensing of planetary-mass objects (or "nanolensing", as ithas been termed) can be used to probe the distribution of mass in a galaxy thatis acting as a gravitational lens. microlensing and nanolensing light curvefluctuations are indicative of the mass of the compact objects within the lens,but the size of the source is important, as large sources will smooth out alight curve. numerical studies have been made in the past that investigate arange of sources sizes and masses in the lens. we extend that work in two ways- by generating high quality maps with over a billion small objects down to amass of 2.5\times10-5m\odot, and by investigating the temporal properties andobservability of the nanolensing events. the system studied is a mock quasarsystem similar to mg 0414+0534. we find that if variability of 0.1 mag inamplitude can be observed, a source size of ~ 0.1 einstein radius (er) would beneeded to see the effect of 2.5\times10-5m\odot masses, and larger, in themicrolensing light curve. our investigation into the temporal properties ofnanolensing events finds that there are two scales of nanolensing that can beobserved - one due to the crossing of nanolensing caustic bands, the other dueto the crossing of nanolensing caustics themselves. the latter are very small,having crossing times of a few days, and requiring sources of size ~ 0.0001 erto resolve. for sources of the size of an accretion disk, the nanolensingcaustics are slightly smoothed-out, but can be observed on time scales of a fewdays. the crossing of caustic bands can be observed on times scales of about 3months.

1202.2100	the structure of star clusters in the outer halo of m31	we present a structural analysis of halo star clusters in m31 based on deephubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) imaging. theclusters in our sample span a range in galactocentric projected distance from13 to 100 kpc and thus reside in rather remote environments. ten of theclusters are classical globulars, while four are from the huxor et al. (2005,2008) population of extended, old clusters. for most clusters, contamination bym31 halo stars is slight, and so the profiles can be mapped reliably to largeradial distances from their centres. we find that the extended clusters arewell fit by analytic king (1962) profiles with ~20 parsec core radii and ~100parsec photometric tidal radii, or by sersic profiles of index ~1 (i.e.approximately exponential). most of the classical globulars also have largephotometric tidal radii in the range 50-100 parsec, however the king profile isa less good fit in some cases, particularly at small radii. we find 60% of theclassical globular clusters exhibit cuspy cores which are reasonably welldescribed by sersic profiles of index ~2-6. our analysis also reinforces thefinding that luminous classical globulars, with half-light radii &lt;10 parsec,are present out to radii of at least 100 kpc in m31, which is in contrast tothe situation in the milky way where such clusters (other than the unusualobject ngc 2419) are absent beyond 40 kpc.

1203.6081	the recent stellar archeology of m31 - the nearest red disk galaxy	we examine the star-forming history (sfh) of the m31 disk during the past fewhundred myr. the luminosity functions (lfs) of main sequence stars at distancesr_gc &gt; 21 kpc (i.e. &gt; 4 disk scale lengths) are matched by models that assume aconstant star formation rate (sfr). however, at smaller r_gc the lfs suggestthat during the past ~10 myr the sfr was 2 - 3 times higher than during thepreceding ~100 myr. the rings of cool gas that harbor a significant fraction ofthe current star-forming activity are traced by stars with ages ~100 myr,indicating that (1) these structures have ages of at least 100 myr, and (2)stars in these structures do not follow the same relation between age andrandom velocity as their counterparts throughout the disks of other spiralgalaxies, probably due to the inherently narrow orbital angular momentumdistribution of the giant molecular clouds in these structures. thedistribution of evolved red stars is not azimuthally symmetric, in the sensethat their projected density along the north east segment of the major axis isroughly twice that on the opposite side of the galaxy. the north east arm ofthe major axis thus appears to be a fossil star-forming area that dates tointermediate epochs. such a structure may be the consequence of interactionswith a companion galaxy.

1206.5730	dynamics in the satellite system of triangulum: is andxxii a dwarf  satellite of m33?	we present results from a spectroscopic survey of the dwarf spheroidal andxxii and the two extended clusters ec1 and ec2. these three objects arecandidate satellites of the triangulum galaxy, m33, which itself is likely asatellite of m31. we use the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph mounted onthe keck-ii telescope to derive radial velocities for candidate member stars ofthese objects and thereby identify the stars that are most likely actualmembers. eleven most probable stellar members (of 13 candidates) are found forandxxii. we obtain an upper limit of sigma_v &lt; 6.0 km s-1 for the velocitydispersion of andxxii, [fe/h] ~ -1.6 for its metallicity, and 255pc for theplummer radius of its projected density profile. we construct a colourmagnitude diagram for andxxii and identify both the red giant branch and thehorizontal branch. the position of the latter is used to derive a heliocentricdistance to and xxii of 853 pm 26 kpc. the combination of the radial velocity,distance, and angular position of andxxii indicates that it is a strongcandidate for being the first known satellite of m33 and one of the very fewexamples of a galactic satellite of a satellite. n-body simulations imply thatthis conclusion is unchanged even if m31 and m33 had a strong encounter in thepast few gyr. we test the hypothesis that the extended clusters highlighttidally stripped galaxies by searching for an excess cloud of halo-like starsin their vicinity. we find such a cloud for the case of ec1 but not ec2. thethree objects imply a dynamical mass for m33 that is consistent with previousestimates.

1212.1540	argos iii: stellar populations in the galactic bulge of the milky way	we present the metallicity results from the argos spectroscopic survey of thegalactic bulge. our aim is to understand the formation of the galactic bulge:did it form via mergers, as expected from lambda cdm theory, or from diskinstabilities, as suggested by its boxy/peanut shape, or both? we have obtainedspectra for 28,000 stars at a spectral resolution of r = 11,000. from thesespectra, we have determined stellar parameters and distances to an accuracy of&lt; 1.5 kpc. the stars in the inner galaxy span a large range in [fe/h], -2.8 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; +0.6. from the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as afunction of [fe/h] (ness et al. 2012a), we propose that the stars with [fe/h] &gt;-0.5 are part of the boxy/peanut bar/bulge. we associate the lower metallicitystars ([fe/h] &lt; -0.5) with the thick disk, which may be puffed up in the innerregion, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disk and inner halo.for the bulge stars with [fe/h] &gt; -0.5, we find two discrete populations; (i)stars with [fe/h] ~ -0.25 which provide a roughly constant fraction of thestars in the latitude interval b = -5 deg to -10 deg, and (ii) a kinematicallycolder, more metal-rich population with mean [fe/h] ~ +0.15 which is moreprominent closer to the plane. the changing ratio of these components withlatitude appears as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. we attributeboth of these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation fromthe thin disk. we do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generatedbulge component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulgestars with such a classical bulge component.

1212.4576	metallicity bias in the kinematics of the milky way stellar halo	here we study the metallicity bias in the velocity dispersions, the derivedquantity called anisotropy and the mean azimuthal velocity profiles of themilky way stellar halo using blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars taken fromsdss/segue survey. the comparatively metal-rich sample ([fe/h]&gt;-2) has progrademotion and is found to have an offset of 40 km/s in the mean azimuthal velocitywith respect to a metal-poor sample ([fe/h]&lt;=-2) which has retrograde motion.the difference in rotation between the most metal-poor and most metal-richpopulation was found to be around 65 km/s. for galactocentric distances r&lt;16kpc, an offset in velocity dispersion profiles and anisotropy can also be seen.in the inner regions, the metal-poor population is in average tangential orbit;however, anisotropy is found to decrease monotonically with radius independentof metallicity. beyond r = 16 kpc, both the metal-rich and the metal-poorsamples are found to have tangential motion. the metallicity bias in thekinematics of the halo stars qualitatively supports the co-existence of atleast two-components in the halo having different formation history e.g.in-situ formation and formation by accretion.

1301.7069	precession of the sagittarius stream	using a variety of stellar tracers -- blue horizontal branch stars,main-sequence turn-off stars and red giants -- we follow the path of thesagittarius (sgr) stream across the sky in sloan digital sky survey data. ourstudy presents new sgr debris detections, accurate distances and line-of-sightvelocities that together help to shed new light on the puzzle of the sgr tails.for both the leading and the trailing tail, we trace the points of theirmaximal extent, or apo-centric distances, and find that they lie at $r^l$ =47.8 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc and $r^t$ = 102.5 $\pm$ 2.5 kpc respectively. the angulardifference between the apo-centres is 93.2 $\pm$ 3.5 deg, which is smaller thanpredicted for logarithmic haloes. such differential orbital precession can bemade consistent with models of the milky way in which the dark matter densityfalls more quickly with radius. however, currently, no existing sgr disruptionsimulation can explain the entirety of the observational data. based on itsposition and radial velocity, we show that the unusually large globular clusterngc 2419 can be associated with the sgr trailing stream. we measure theprecession of the orbital plane of the sgr debris in the milky way potentialand show that, surprisingly, sgr debris in the primary (brighter) tails evolvesdifferently to the secondary (fainter) tails, both in the north and the south.

0801.0002	globular clusters in the outer halo of m31: the survey	we report the discovery of 40 new globular clusters (gcs) that have beenfound in surveys of the halo of m31 based on int/wfc and chft/megacam imagery.a subset of these these new gcs are of an extended, diffuse nature, and includethose already found in huxor et al.

1311.0906	major substructure in the m31 outer halo: the south-west cloud	we undertake the first detailed analysis of the stellar population andspatial properties of a diffuse substructure in the outer halo of m31. thesouth-west cloud lies at a projected distance of ~100 kpc from the centre ofm31, and extends for at least ~50 kpc in projection. we use pan-andromedaarchaeological survey photometry of red giant branch stars to determine adistance to the south-west cloud of 793 +/- 45 kpc. the metallicity of thecloud is found to be [fe/h] = -1.3 +/- 0.1. this is consistent with thecoincident globular clusters pandas-7 and pandas-8, which have metallicitiesdetermined using an independent technique of [fe/h] = -1.35 +/- 0.15. wemeasure a brightness for the cloud of m_v = -12.1 mag; this is ~75 per cent ofthe luminosity implied by the luminosity-metallicity relation. under theassumption that the south-west cloud is the visible remnant of an accreteddwarf satellite, this suggests that the progenitor object was amongst m31'sbrightest dwarf galaxies prior to disruption.

1404.5807	the outer halo globular cluster system of m31 - i. the final pandas  catalogue	we report the discovery of 59 globular clusters (gcs) and two candidate gcsin a search of the halo of m31, primarily via visual inspection of chft/megacamimagery from the pan-andromeda archaeological survey (pandas). the superiorquality of these data also allow us to check the classification of remoteobjects in the revised bologna catalogue (rbc), plus a subset of gc candidatesdrawn from sdss imaging. we identify three additional new gcs from the rbc, andconfirm the gc nature of 11 sdss objects (8 of which appear independently inour remote halo catalogue); the remaining 188 candidates across both lists areeither foreground stars or background galaxies. our new catalogue representsthe first uniform census of gcs across the m31 halo - we find clusters to thelimit of the pandas survey area at projected radii of up to r_proj ~ 150 kpc.tests using artificial clusters reveal that detection incompleteness cuts in atluminosities below m_v = -6.0; our 50% completeness limit is m_v ~ -4.1. weconstruct a uniform set of pandas photometric measurements for all known gcsoutside r_proj = 25$ kpc, and any new gcs within this radius. with these datawe update results from huxor et al. (2011), investigating the luminosityfunction (lf), colours and effective radii of m31 gcs with a particular focuson the remote halo. we find that the gclf is clearly bimodal in the outer halo(r_proj &gt; 30 kpc), with the secondary peak at m_v ~ -5.5. we argue that the gcsin this peak have most likely been accreted along with their host dwarfgalaxies. notwithstanding, we also find, as in previous surveys, a substantialnumber of gcs with above-average luminosity in the outer m31 halo - apopulation with no clear counterpart in the milky way.

1406.0186	the outer halo globular cluster system of m31 - ii. kinematics	we present a detailed kinematic analysis of the outer halo globular cluster(gc) system of m31. our basis for this is a set of new spectroscopicobservations for 78 clusters lying at projected distances between rproj ~20-140kpc from the m31 centre. these are largely drawn from the recent pandasglobular cluster catalogue; 63 of our targets have no previous velocity data.via a bayesian maximum likelihood analysis we find that gcs with rproj &gt; 30 kpcexhibit coherent rotation around the minor optical axis of m31, in the samedirection as more centrally- located gcs, but with a smaller amplitude of86+/-17 km s-1. there is also evidence that the velocity dispersion of theouter halo gc system decreases as a function of projected distance from the m31centre, and that this relation can be well described by a power law of index ~-0.5. the velocity dispersion profile of the outer halo gcs is quite similar tothat of the halo stars, at least out to the radius up to which there isavailable information on the stellar kinematics. we detect and discuss variousvelocity correlations amongst subgroups of gcs that lie on stellar debrisstreams in the m31 halo. many of these subgroups are dynamically cold,exhibiting internal velocity dispersions consistent with zero. simple montecarlo experiments imply that such configurations are unlikely to form bychance, adding weight to the notion that a significant fraction of the outerhalo gcs in m31 have been accreted alongside their parent dwarf galaxies. wealso estimate the m31 mass within 200 kpc via the tracer mass estimator,finding (1.2 - 1.6) +/- 0.2 10^{12}m_sun. this quantity is subject toadditional systematic effects due to various limitations of the data, andassumptions built in into the tme. finally, we discuss our results in thecontext of formation scenarios for the m31 halo.

0803.2614	the nature and origin of substructure in the outskirts of m31. i.  surveying the stellar content with hst/acs	we present the largest and most detailed survey to date of the stellarpopulations in the outskirts of m31 based on the analysis of 14 deep hst/acspointings spanning the range 11.5-45.0 kpc. we conduct a quantitativecomparison of the resolved stellar populations in these fields and identifyseveral striking trends. the color-magnitude diagrams (cmds), which reach ~3magnitudes below the red clump, can be classified into two main categoriesbased on their morphologies. `stream-like' fields, so named for theirsimilarity to the cmd of the giant stellar stream, are characterized by a redclump that slants bluewards at fainter magnitudes and an extended horizontalbranch. on the other hand, `disk-like' fields exhibit rounder red clumps withsignificant luminosity width, lack an obvious horizontal branch and showevidence for recent star formation (~0.25 - 2.0 gyr ago). we compare thespatial and line-of-sight distribution of stream-like fields with a recentsimulation of the giant stream progenitor orbit and find an excellentagreement. these fields, found across the face of m31, attest to the highdegree of pollution caused by this event. disk-like material resides in theextended disk structure of m31 and is detected out to 44 kpc (projected); theuniform populations in these fields, including the ubiquitous presence of youngpopulations, and the strong rotation reported elsewhere are most consistentwith a scenario in which this structure has formed through heating anddisruption of the existing thin disk, perhaps due to the impact of the giantstream progenitor. our comparative analysis sheds new light on the likelycomposition of two of the ultra-deep pointings formerly presented as pure outerdisk and pure halo in the literature.

1408.2907	sailing under the magellanic clouds: a decam view of the carina dwarf	we present deep optical photometry from the decam imager on the 4m blancotelescope of over 12 deg$^2$ around the carina dwarf spheroidal, with completecoverage out to 1 degree and partial coverage extending out to 2.6 degrees.using a poisson-based matched filter analysis to identify stars from each ofthe three main stellar populations, old, intermediate, and young, we confirmthe previously identified radial age gradient, distance, tidal radius, stellarradial profiles, relative stellar population sizes, ellipticity, and positionangle. we find an angular offset between the three main elliptical populationsof carina, and find only tentative evidence for tidal debris, suggesting thatpast tidal interactions could not have significantly influenced the carinadwarf. we detect stars in the vicinity of, but distinct to, the carina dwarf,and measure their distance to be 46$\pm$2 kpc. we determine this population tobe part of the halo of the large magellanic cloud at an angular radius of over20 degrees. due to overlap in colour-magnitude space with magellanic stars,previously detected tidal features in the old population of carina are likelyweaker than previously thought.

1409.7065	a pandas view of m31 dwarf elliptical satellites: ngc147 and ngc185	we exploit data from the pan-andromeda archaeological survey (pandas) tostudy the extended structures of m31's dwarf elliptical companions, ngc147 andngc185. our wide-field, homogeneous photometry allows to construct deepcolour-magnitude diagrams (cmds) which reach down to $\sim3$ mag below the redgiant branch (rgb) tip. we trace the stellar components of the galaxies tosurface brightness of $\mu_g \sim 32$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and show they have muchlarger extents ($\sim5$ kpc radii) than previously recognised. while ngc185retains a regular shape in its peripheral regions, ngc147 exhibits pronouncedisophotal twisting due to the emergence of symmetric tidal tails. we fit singlesersic models to composite surface brightness profiles constructed from diffuselight and star counts and find that ngc147 has an effective radius almost 3times that of ngc185. in both cases, the effective radii that we calculate arelarger by a factor of $\sim2$ compared to most literature values. we alsocalculate revised total magnitudes of $m_g=-15.36\pm0.04$ for ngc185 and$m_g=-16.36\pm0.04$ for ngc147. using photometric metallicities computed forrgb stars, we find ngc185 to exhibit a metallicity gradient of[fe/h]$\sim-0.15$ dex/kpc over the radial range 0.125 to 0.5 deg. on the otherhand, ngc147 exhibits almost no metallicity gradient, $\sim-0.02$ dex/kpc from0.2 to 0.6 deg. the differences in the structure and stellar populations in theoutskirts of these systems suggest that tidal influences have played animportant role in governing the evolution of ngc147.

1502.04767	the galah survey: scientific motivation	the galah survey is a large high-resolution spectroscopic survey using thenewly commissioned hermes spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. thehermes spectrograph provides high-resolution (r ~28,000) spectra in fourpassbands for 392 stars simultaneously over a 2 degree field of view. the goalof the survey is to unravel the formation and evolutionary history of the milkyway, using fossil remnants of ancient star formation events which have beendisrupted and are now dispersed throughout the galaxy. chemical tagging seeksto identify such dispersed remnants solely from their common and uniquechemical signatures; these groups are unidentifiable from their spatial,photometric or kinematic properties. to carry out chemical tagging, the galahsurvey will acquire spectra for a million stars down to v~14. the hermesspectra of fgk stars contain absorption lines from 29 elements including lightproton-capture elements, alpha-elements, odd-z elements, iron-peak elements andn-capture elements from the light and heavy s-process and the r-process. thispaper describes the motivation and planned execution of the galah survey, andpresents some results on the first-light performance of hermes.

1511.04793	major substructure in the m31 outer halo: the east cloud	we present the first detailed analysis of the east cloud, a highly disrupteddiffuse stellar substructure in the outer halo of m31. the core of thesubstructure lies at a projected distance of $\sim100$ kpc from the centre ofm31 in the outer halo, with possible extensions reaching right into the innerhalo. using pan-andromeda archaeological survey photometry of red giant branchstars, we measure the distance, metallicity and brightness of the cloud. usinghubble space telescope data, we independently measure the distance andmetallicity to the two globular clusters coincident with the east cloud core,pa-57 and pa-58, and find their distances to be consistent with the cloud. fourfurther globular clusters coincident with the substructure extensions areidentified as potentially associated. combining the analyses, we determine adistance to the cloud of $814^{+20}_{-9}$ kpc, a metallicity of $[fe/h] =-1.2\pm0.1$, and a brightness of $m_v = -10.7\pm0.4$ mag. even allowing for theinclusion of the potential extensions, this accounts for less than $20$ percent of the progenitor luminosity implied by the luminosity-metallicityrelation. using the updated techniques developed for this analysis, we alsorefine our estimates of the distance and brightness of the south-west cloud, aseparate substructure analyzed in the previous work in this series.

0807.0105	the nucleus of the sagittarius dsph galaxy and m54: a window on the  process of galaxy nucleation	we present the results of a thorough study of the nucleus of the sgr dwarfspheroidal galaxy and of the bright globular cluster m54 that resides withinthe same nucleus (sgr,n). we have obtained accurate radial velocities andmetallicity estimates for 1152 candidate red giant branch stars of sgr and m54lying within ~ 9 arcmin from the center of the galaxy, from keck/deimos andvlt/flames spectra of the infrared calcium ii triplet. using both velocity andmetallicity information we selected two samples of 425 and 321 very-likelymembers of m54 and of sgr,n, respectively. the two considered systems displaysignificantly different velocity dispersion profiles: m54 has a steeplydecreasing profile from r=0, where sigma= 14.2 km/s, to r=3.5 arcmin where itreaches sigma=5.3 km/s, then it appears to rise again to sigma= 10 km/s at r=7arcmin. in contrast sgr,n has a uniformly flat profile at sigma=9.6 km/s overthe whole 0 &lt; r &lt; 9 arcmin range. using data from the literature we show thatthe velocity dispersion of sgr remains constant at least out to r ~ 100 arcminand there is no sign of the transition between the outerflat-luminosity-profile core and the inner nucleus in the velocity profile.these results - together with a re-analysis of the surface brightness profileof sgr,n and a suite of dedicated n-body simulations - provide very strongsupport for the hypothesis that the nucleus of sgr formed independently of m54,which probably plunged to its present position, coincident with sgr,n, becauseof significant decay of the original orbit due to dynamical friction.

0808.0755	the kinematic footprints of five stellar streams in andromeda's halo	(abridged) we present a spectroscopic analysis of five stellar streams (`a',`b', `cr', `cp' and `d') as well as the extended star cluster, ec4, which lieswithin streamc, all discovered in the halo of m31 from our cfht/megacam survey.these spectroscopic results were initially serendipitous, making use of ourexisting observations from the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph mountedon the keck ii telescope, and thereby emphasizing the ubiquity of tidal streamsthat account for ~70% of the m31 halo stars in the targeted fields. subsequentspectroscopy was then procured in streamcr/p and streamd to trace the velocitygradient along the streams. for the cluster ec4, candidate member stars withaverage [fe/h]~-1.4 (fe/h_spec=-1.6), are found at v_{hel}=-285 km/s suggestingit could be related to streamcp. no similarly obvious cold kinematic candidateis found for streamd, although candidates are proposed in both of twospectroscopic pointings along the stream (both at -400 km/s). spectroscopy nearthe edge of streamb suggests a likely kinematic detection, while a candidatekinematic detection of streama is found (plausibly associated to m33 ratherthan m31). the low dispersion of the streams in kinematics, physical thickness,and metallicity makes it hard to reconcile with a scenario whereby these streamstructures as an ensemble are related to the giant southern stream. we concludethat the m31 stellar halo is largely made up of multiple kinematically coldstreams.

astro-ph;0110691	sub-structure of the outer galactic halo from the 2 micron all sky  survey	a pole-count analysis of the infrared 2mass survey is presented, in order toidentify faint stream-like structures within the halo of the milky way.selecting stars with colours consistent with m-giant stars, we find a strongover-density of sources on a stream with pole (l=95,b=13), which corresponds tothe pole of the orbit of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. this great-circlefeature of width ~12 degrees, contains 5% of the late m-giants in the halo. noother stream-like structures are detected in m-giants in the 2mass secondincremental data release (2idr), and in particular, we find no evidence for astellar component to the magellanic stream. this suggests that the presentaccretion rate of low-mass satellites with a luminous component is very low,and the formation of the luminous component of the halo must have beenessentially complete before the accretion of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy, morethan 3gyr ago. we also search for great-circle streams using almost allhigh-latitude (|b|&gt;30) sources in the 2idr dataset. no narrow great-circlestreams of width 0.5-2 degrees were found, though we were only sensitive torelatively nearby (&lt;17kpc) remnants of massive (10^6 msun) globular clusters.if the galactic potential is close to being spherical, as some recentobservations suggest, the lack of observed great-circle streams is consistentwith the presence of dark matter substructures in the halo. althoughalternative explanations cannot be ruled out from our analysis of the 2idrdataset, future experiments with better statistics have the potential to revealthe heating effect of dark matter substructure on stellar streams.

astro-ph;0211075	the properties of microjansky radio sources in the hdf-n, ssa13, and  ssa22 fields	(abridged) we present multiwavelength observations for a large sample ofmicrojansky radio sources detected in ultradeep 1.4ghz maps centered on thehubble deep field-north (hdf-n) and the hawaii survey fields ssa13 and ssa22.our spectroscopic redshifts for 169 radio sources reveal a flat median redshiftdistribution, and these sources are hosted by similarly luminous optical l*galaxies, regardless of redshift. this is a serious concern for radio estimatesof the local star formation rate density, as a substantial fraction of theultraviolet luminosity density is generated by sub-l* galaxies at lowredshifts. from our submillimeter measurements for 278 radio sources, we finderror-weighted mean 850micron fluxes of 1.72$\pm$0.09 mjy for the total sample,2.37$\pm$0.13 mjy for the optically-faint (i&gt;23.5) subsample, and 1.04$\pm$0.13mjy for the optically-bright (i&lt;23.5) subsample. we significantly (&gt;3\sigma)detect in the submillimeter 50 of the radio sources, 38 with i&gt;23.5.spectroscopic redshifts for three of the i&lt;23.5 submillimeter-detected radiosources are in the range z=1.0-3.4, and all show agn signatures. using only thesubmillimeter mapped regions we find that 69\pm9% of the submillimeter-detectedradio population are at i&gt;23.5. we also find that 66\pm7% of the s850&gt;5 mjy(&gt;4\sigma) sources are radio-identified. we find that millimetric redshiftestimates at low redshifts are best made with a fir template intermediatebetween a milky way type galaxy and a starburst galaxy, and at high redshiftswith an arp220 template.

astro-ph;0301067	one ring to encompass them all: a giant stellar structure that surrounds  the galaxy	we present evidence that the curious stellar population found by the sloandigital sky survey in the galactic anticentre direction extends to otherdistant fields that skirt the plane of the milky way. new data, taken with theint wide field camera show a similar population, narrowly aligned along theline of sight, but with a galactocentric distance that changes from ~15 kpc to\~20 kpc (over ~100 degrees on the sky). despite being narrowly concentratedalong the line of sight, the structure is fairly extended vertically out of theplane of the disk, with a vertical scale height of 0.75+/-0.04 kpc. thisfinding suggests that the outer rim of the galaxy ends in a low-surfacebrightness stellar ring. presently available data do not allow us to ascertainthe origin of the structure. one possibility is that it is the wraith of asatellite galaxy devoured long-ago by the milky way, though our favouredinterpretation is that it is a perturbation of the disk, possibly the result ofancient warps. assuming that the ring is smooth and axisymmetric, the totalstellar mass in the structure may amount to 2x10^8 up to 10^9 solar masses.

astro-ph;0301233	the bi-variate luminosity-color distribution of iras galaxies, and  implications for the high redshift universe	we present a characterization of the local luminosity-color, bi-variatedistribution of iras galaxies from the 1.2jy sample, selected at 60 micron. thes60/s100 infrared color is used as the best single parameter description of their spectral energy distribution of galaxies. we derive an analytical form ofthe distribution and use it to constrain the effect of the ir colordistribution on evolution models for high redshift, farir luminous galaxies.our adopted evolution retains the locally observed correlation betweenluminosity and color, such that the larger characteristic luminosities athigher redshift have a warmer characteristic color. the width of the colordistribution at a given luminosity remains constant for all redshifts. wedemonstrate that there is the potential for both hotter and colder sources tobe missed in cosmological surveys. an evolving bi-variate luminosity functioncoupled with the cold source bias of sub-mm selected surveys suggests theexistence of a large population of cold sources appearing in such surveys.likewise, a hot source bias for most sirtf wavebands together with a bi-variatemodel suggests an excess of hot sources being selected. we test theevolutionary form against available data for higher redshift, farir galaxies.the data do not reveal evidence for any strong evolution in the characteristicluminosity-color distribution as a function of redshift over 0&lt;z&lt;1. however,there is marginal evidence for a broadening of the color distribution at higherredshifts, consistent with our locally characterized trend of a broadening inthe ir color distribution at the highest luminosities.

astro-ph;0305160	the three dimensional structure of the giant stellar stream in andromeda	the wide-field ccd camera at the cfh telescope was used to survey the giantstellar stream in the andromeda galaxy, resolving stars down the red giantbranch in m31 to i ~ 25, a magnitude deeper than our previous int survey ofthis galaxy and extending 1 degree further out. the stream is seen to extendout to the south-east of m31 as far as we have surveyed (some 4.5 degrees,corresponding to a projected distance ~60 kpc). it is a linear structure inprojection, and the eastern edge of the stream presents a sharp boundary instar counts suggesting that it remains a coherent structure. by analysing theluminosity function of the metal rich component of the stream we find that, atthe furthest extent of our survey, the stream is 100 kpc further away along theline of sight than m31. it can then be traced to a point on the north-westernside of the galaxy where it is some 30 kpc in front of m31, at which point thestream turns away from our survey area.

astro-ph;0311010	a dwarf galaxy remnant in canis major: the fossil of an in-plane  accretion onto the milky way	we present an analysis of the asymmetries in the population of galacticm-giant stars present in the 2mass all sky catalogue. several large-scaleasymmetries are detected, the most significant of which is a strongelliptical-shaped stellar over-density, close to the galactic plane at (l=240,b=-8), in the constellation of canis major. a small grouping of globularclusters (ngc 1851, ngc 1904, ngc 2298, and ngc 2808), coincident in positionand radial velocity, surround this structure, as do a number of open clusters.the population of m-giant stars in this over-density is similar in number tothat in the core of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. we argue that this object isthe likely dwarf galaxy progenitor of the ring-like structure that has recentlybeen found at the edge of the galactic disk. a numerical study of the tidaldisruption of an accreted dwarf galaxy is presented. the simulated debris fitswell the extant position, distance and velocity information on the ``galacticring'', as well as that of the m-giant over-densities, suggesting that allthese structures are the consequence of a single accretion event. the disrupteddwarf galaxy stream orbits close to the galactic plane, with a pericentre atapproximately the solar circle, an orbital eccentricity similar to that ofstars in the galactic thick disk, as well as a vertical scale height similar tothat of the thick disk. this finding strongly suggests that the canis majordwarf galaxy is a building block of the galactic thick disk, that the thickdisk is continually growing, even up to the present time, and that thick diskglobular clusters were accreted onto the milky way from dwarf galaxies inco-planar orbits.

astro-ph;0407391	why the canis major overdensity is not due to the warp: analysis of its  radial profile and velocities	in response to criticism by momany et al. (2004), that therecently-identified canis major (cma) overdensity could be simply explained bythe galactic warp, we present proof of the existence of a stellar population inthe direction of cma that cannot be explained by known galactic components. byanalyzing the radial distribution of counts of m-giant stars in this direction,we show that the momany et al. (2004) warp model overestimates the number ofstars in the northern hemisphere, hence hiding the cma feature in the south.the use of a better model of the warp has little influence on the morphology ofthe overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a distanceof d=7.2\pm 0.3 kpc. to lend further support to the existence of a populationthat does not belong to the galactic disc, we present radial velocities ofm-giant stars in the centre of the cma structure that were obtained with the2df spectrograph at the aat. the extra population shows a radial velocity ofvr=109\pm4 km/s, which is significantly higher than the typical velocity of thedisc at the distance of cma. this population also has a low dispersion (13\pm4km/s). the canis major overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due tothe galactic warp, adding weight to the hypothesis that we are observing adisrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants. this leads to questions on what partof cma was previously identified as the warp and how to possibly disentanglethe two structures.

astro-ph;0503703	correcting the influence of an asymmetric line spread function in  2-degree field spectrograph data	we investigate the role of asymmetries in the line spread function of the2-degree field spectrograph and the variations in these asymmetries with theccd, the plate, the time of observation and the fibre. a data-reductionpipeline is developed that takes these deformations into account for thecalibration and cross-correlation of the spectra. we show that, using theemission lines of calibration lamp observations, we can fit the line spreadfunction with the sum of two gaussian functions representing the theoreticalsignal and a perturbation of the system. this model is then used to calibratethe spectra and generate templates by downgrading high resolution spectra.thus, we can cross-correlate the observed spectra with templates degraded inthe same way. our reduction pipeline is tested on real observations andprovides a significant improvement in the accuracy of the radial velocitiesobtained. in particular, the systematic errors that were as high as ~20 km/swhen applying the aao reduction package 2dfdr are now reduced to ~5 km/s. eventhough the 2-degree field spectrograph is to be decommissioned at the end of2005, the analysis of archival data and previous studies could be improved bythe reduction procedure we propose here.

astro-ph;0503705	a radial velocity survey of low galactic latitude structures: i.  kinematics of the canis major dwarf galaxy	as part of a radial velocity survey of low galactic latitude structures thatwe undertook with the 2df spectrograph on the aat, we present the radialvelocities of more than 1500 red giant branch and red clump stars towards thecentre of the canis major dwarf galaxy. with a mean velocity of 72\pm7 km/s ata heliocentric distance of 5.5 kpc and 114\pm2 km/s at 8.5 kpc, these starspresent a peculiar distance -- radial velocity relation that is unlike thatexpected from thin or thick disc stars. moreover, they belong to akinematically cold population with an intrinsic dispersion that may be as lowas 11_{-1}^{+3} km/s. the radial velocity distribution is used to select canismajor stars in the ucac2.0 proper motion catalogue and derive proper motions ingalactic coordinates of (\mu_l,\mu_b)= (-3.6\pm0.8 mas/yr, 1.5\pm0.4 mas/yr)for the dwarf galaxy, which after correcting for the reflex solar motion alongthis line-of-sight gives (\mu_l',\mu_b')= (-6.8\pm0.8 mas/yr, 0.8\pm0.4mas/yr)$, corresponding to a prograde orbit with a tangential velocity of\sim235 km/s at the average distance of \sim7.2 kpc. all these kinematicconstraints can be reproduced in simulations of the accretion of a dwarf ontothe galactic disc. such a process could also be responsible for the monocerosring that has recently been shown to encompass the galactic disc. however,without constraints on the kinematics of the tidal arms emerging from the canismajor dwarf, it is not yet possible to definitively prove a link between thetwo structures.

astro-ph;0504494	the core of the canis major galaxy as traced by red clump stars	the recently-discovered stellar system in canis major is analysed usinghe-burning red clump stars as tracers. canis major turns out to be thestrongest and most spatially confined overdensity of the whole galactic disc,both in terms of number density and of statistical significance. when projectedonto the galactic plane, it appears as an elongated and compact overdensityextending from l ~ 200 to l ~ 280 with a roundish core toward l ~ 240. we findthat the main body of the system has an integrated absolute magnitude m_v=-14.4+/- 0.8, a central surface brightness \mu_{v,0} = 24.0 +/- 0.6 mag/arcsec^2 anda line-of-sight profile peaked at d_{sun}=7.2 +/- 1.0 kpc with half width athalf maximum ~ 2.0 kpc, in excellent agreement with the results obtained withwidely different tracers (m giants and main sequence stars) in previousanalyses. the mean distance to the main body of canis major is observed toincrease with increasing galactic longitude, from d_{sun} ~ 6.3 kpc at l ~ 225,to d_{sun} ~ 9.3 kpc at l ~ 265, in good agreement with the predictions of ourmore recent n-body simulation that models cma as a dwarf galaxy being accretedin a planar orbit onto the disc of the milky way. we confirm that the canismajor system has all the characteristics of the relic of a dwarf galaxy seen ontop of a large-scale overdensity that we detect all over the third and fourthgalactic quadrants (180&lt;l&lt;360, with a strong maximum around l=290 and b&gt; -5)that is identified as the stellar component of the southern galactic warp...(abridged)....

0705.4622	a keck/deimos spectroscopic survey of faint galactic satellites:  searching for the least massive dwarf galaxies	[abridged] we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recentlydiscovered faint milky way satellites boo, umai, umaii and wil1. using thedeimos spectrograph on keck, we have obtained samples that contain from 15 to85 probable members of these satellites for which we derive radial velocitiesprecise to a few km/s down to i~21-22. about half of these stars are observedwith a high enough s/n to estimate their metallicity to within \pm0.2 dex. fromthis dataset, we show that umaii is the only object that does not show a clearradial velocity peak. however, the measured systemic radial velocity(v_r=115\pm5 km/s) is in good agreement with recent simulations in which thisobject is the progenitor of the recently discovered orphan stream. the threeother satellites show velocity dispersions that make them highly dark-matterdominated systems. in particular the willman 1 object is not a globular clustergiven its metallicity scatter over -2.0&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-1.0 and is therefore almostcertainly a dwarf galaxy or dwarf galaxy remnant. we measure a radial velocitydispersion of only 4.3_{-1.3}^{+2.3} km/s around a systemic velocity of-12.3\pm2.3 km/s which implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~700 and a total massof ~5x10^5 msun for this satellite, making it the least massive satellitegalaxy known to date. such a low mass could mean that the 10^7 msun limit thathad until now never been crossed for milky way and andromeda satellite galaxiesmay only be an observational limit and that fainter, less massive systems existwithin the local group. however, more modeling and an extended search forpotential extra-tidal stars are required to rule out the possibility that thesesystems have not been significantly heated by tidal interaction.
