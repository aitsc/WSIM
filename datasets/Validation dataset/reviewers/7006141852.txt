14944348284	Weak and strong singularities reflecting multiscale damage: Micro-boundary conditions for free-free, fixed-fixed and free-fixed constraints	Analytical modeling of the multiscale character of the material microstructure has been problematic because of the inability of continuum mechanics to consider scale effects. The introduction of length parameters into theories that advocate the vanishing of element size are equally unsatisfying since they hardly contest the main issue of how the constituents at a very small scale can affect the behavior of the same material at a much larger scale. Microscopic effects can sometimes have a significant influence on the macroscopic behavior of material. It is therefore pertinent to have a model that can couple the microscopic effects to those at the macroscopic scale. A new scheme is no doubt needed to overcome the conventional approach adopted in continuum mechanics. The singularity representation scheme will be considered where the local damage at the different scales will be modeled by different orders of the stress singularities. Using the 1/r

15844424149	Scaling of volume energy density function reflecting damage by singularities at macro-, meso- And microscopic level	The 1/r singular field for the strain energy density function dW/dV is the same as that for the intermolecular attraction. In fact, it applies also to the law of gravitation for large bodies at the cosmos scale. The unique character of this function being independent of the specific material type has been used widely in fracture mechanics for analyzing the failure of material and structure when distinctions are made between the local and global behavior. When system homogeneity is preserved the product of dW/dV and the distance r is governed by a perfect hyperbola. This is the situation that prevails ahead of an idealized macro-crack. At the microscopic scale where heterogeneity is the rule rather than the exception, the dW/dV versus r relation will differ and can be denoted by (dW/dV)

1842523294	Hysteresis loops predicted by isoenergy density theory for polycrystals. Part II: Cyclic heating and cooling effects predicted from non-equilibrium theory for 6061-T6 aluminum, SAE 4340 steel and Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V titanium cylindrical bars	Mathematical tools and physical models should fit like hand and glove. Traditionally, such an understanding has worked surprisingly well in mechanics and physics. Differential calculus enabled the determination of motion of celestial bodies. Heisenberg's use of Hilbert space applied to calculations in quantum mechanics. These foot steps, however, failed to continue in the field of material science when attempting to address the evolution of material damage. On one hand, the mathematical formulation of the Riemann-Hilbert problem achieved great success for solving macrocrack problems but whether the same tool could be used for lower scale defects seems to be of less concern. This is a surprise because it is not obvious by any means whether microcracks can be distinguished from macrocrack by size difference alone, particularly when they are both treated in a single formulation. There are several issues of the fatigue problem that must be addressed. To begin with, local failure initiating near a surface should be distinguished from global failure that correspond to separation of a specimen into two or more pieces. The interim stages of initiation and termination would depend on the ductility and brittleness of the material in addition to the history of cyclic loading. Three different materials 6061-T6 aluminum, SAE 4340 steel and Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V titanium will therefore be analyzed to show how their uniaxial properties would compare with the dissipation energy density functions and oscillation in temperature. Hysteresis loops for the local material points are determined. Their averages for the ASTM standard hour-glass specimen are then found. They give the global hysteresis loops corresponding to measurements from the uniaxial tests. The local dissipative energy density loops represent the irreversible nature of the materials are also taken into consideration. They are calculated for the soft aluminum and the hard titanium with steel being in between. Obtained also are the cyclic cooling and heating characteristics of the material under fatigue; they fluctuate about the ambient temperature. The H-function designating the order and disorder of the fatigue process is also found to be oscillatory in character. Unlike entropy, it is not non-increasing or non-decreasing. It can change sign in a given process. This implies that the order of a system can be enhanced and then impeded or vice versa. Such a behavior is shown to prevail during the initial stage of the fatigue. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1842526980	Hysteresis loops predicted by isoenergy density theory for polycrystals. Part I: Fundamentals of non-equilibrium thermal-mechanical coupling effects	When a polycrystal is stressed or strained at fifty percent of the corresponding yield value, damage will be inflicted non-homogeneously in the material due to the fact that the stress and/or strain distribution is non-uniform even if isotropy and homogeneity are assumed for the initial microstructure. This effect will be cumulated for each cycle of the load if the applied stress or strain is repeated continuously. Nucleation of microcracks can eventually lead to the propagation of a macrocrack. The process of damage accumulation in fatigue is defined to be sufficiently slow such that inhomogeneity of material behavior created by loading is a significant factor that can not be arbitrarily dismissed without a good reason. What this means specifically is that the difference of the stress and strain behavior at each point in a fatigue specimen must be accounted for in the analytical model in order to predict the correct cumulative effect. Such a requirement translates into a non-equilibrium formulation where the constitutive relations for each point and loading cycle must be determined separately. In this sense, the true problem of fatigue cannot be completely treated by the classical continuum mechanics approach that is limited to equilibrium mechanics for a closed system. Having said this, the isoenergy density theory will be applied to estimate the hysteresis loops of a hour-glass profile cylindrical bar specimen as recommended by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for low-cycle fatigue. The work will be divided into two parts. Part I will cover the fundamentals of a non-equilibrium theory where the continuum elements are finite in size; they do not vanish in the limit. Therefore, size effects are immediately encountered as a function of time. General expressions for the rate change of volume of these elements with surface area are derived such that they can be computed from the nine displacement gradients. These elements can differ in size and must fit together without discontinuities or gaps to form the continuum. The condition of isoenergy energy density is invoked such that the size of these individual elements under large and finite deformation and rotation can be determined without loss in generality. The existence of such a space having the property of the same isoenergy density in all directions is thus proved. This enables the establishment of the one dimensional energy state with that in three dimensions without restriction, the absence of which has prevented the development of a complete non-linear theory of mechanics that can be solved in a direct fashion in contrast to the inverse method of assuming the displacement field. Illustration is provided for deriving the constitutive relation incrementally for a given location for the hour-glass specimen made of 6061-T6 aluminum. Once the specimen is loaded, each material point will follow a different stress and strain curve according to the local displacement rate. Hence, the method applies to material with non-homogeneous microstructure if their individual expressions can be assessed and fed into the computer. Part II computes for the non-equilibrium temperature and an entropy-like quantity that can be positive and negative. This implies that the system can absorb or dissipate energy with reference to the surrounding. Additional data for hysteresis loops are given for 6061-T6 aluminum, SAE 4340 steel and Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V titanium. Accumulation of the local hysteresis energy per cycle is found to be the highest near the surface of the uniaxial specimen where load symmetry prevails. This is a consequence of the difference in accumulation of the energy density due to distortion in contrast to dilatation at the specimen center. This is why fatigue cracks tend to nucleate near the specimen surface, at a small distance towards the interior. Another distinct feature of fatigue is that the non-equilibrium temperature is found to oscillate about the ambient temperature while the local stress states fluctuate between tension and compression. This temperature reversal behavior is typical of non-equilibrium behavior and also occurs under monotonic loading. The space and time variations of the dissipated energy density for different materials are found to be related to the initial monotonic energy density or area under the true stress and true strain curve. What will be demonstrated is that no special consideration need to be made when applying the isoenergy density theory for analyzing the nucleation of micro and macrocracks in addition to failure of the specimen. Crack nucleation under fatigue is assumed to occur when the total hysteresis energy reaches a critical value. It is possible to establish a relation between the average hysteresis energy per cycle and the number of cycles to failure. The proposed method requires only a knowledge of the initial monotonic energy density curve for a given material. Predicted results for the fatigue of cylindrical bar specimens with hour-glass profile are given and they can be found in Part II of this work. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1842526982	Surface displacement characteristics of line crack trespassing the Rayleigh wave speed barrier as influenced by velocity and applied stress dependent local zone of restrain	Modern computational and experimental technologies have revealed physical details of the crack propagation process that seems to have created great ecstasy in the field of two-dimensional in-plane theory of classical elastodynamics. One of the curiosities that has attracted the attention of investigators is concerned with driving a line crack beyond the Rayleigh wave speed. Up to now, the proposed analytical and experimental models seem to weigh heavily on the possibility that this could be done only for in-plane shear load where symmetry does not prevail across the crack plane. In a homogeneous material, the crack would not propagate in a straight path and this would slow down crack growth. It has therefore been stipulated that there must be some other mechanisms that drive the crack beyond the Rayleigh and or perhaps the shear wave speed. Off hand, such arguments seem to go against physical intuition. That is a line crack could be driven to a higher velocity under in-plane shear and not under in-plane extension. The search for experimental evidence has been at best inconclusive because the crack would curve under shear. Artificial and weak path had to be created to force the crack to run straight under shear. This, however, introduces non-homogeneity in the material which in essence has changed the problem. A dilemma has thus been created for the past three decades. The argument for favoring the shear mode appears to lie in the invokement of friction and slip because these conditions are not present in the crack opening model under plane extension. The given impression is that the slip weakening mechanism seems to be involved with making an in-plane crack grow beyond the Rayleigh wave speed. The theoretical upper limit of the crack speed in an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous material is set at the Rayleigh wave speed. This is made so only because of the assumptions invoked in the theory of classical elastodynamics. The result is that the crack opening displacement (COD) increases with crack speed and tends to approach infinity as the crack approaches the Rayleigh wave velocity. The strain energy density function dW/dV at a finite from the crack also becomes unbounded. Infinite crack opening and energy density function are inadmissible. These limitations arise on account of the idealization that the material ahead of the running crack remains linearly elastic regardless of the velocity of the propagating crack while the crack tip radius of curvature would also remain zero. These conditions of course are unattainable physically. Depending on the material, the crack would run with a finite radius of curvature that is difficult to model analytically. Moreover, the local material would not likely to behave linearly. These conditions would defy solutions in analytical form while numerical solution have problems that are equally difficult to overcome. One of the intentions of this work is to illustrate that it is not necessary to assume slip weakening nor in-plane shear for a line crack to run beyond the Rayleigh speed. The applied load could be in-plane extension. Hence, the conditions of friction and slip are not unique other than the fact they must be implemented under in-plane shear. Assumed in this work is a non-linear velocity and applied stress dependent local restraining stress that account for the spatio-temporal contiguities between the exchange of the local thermal and mechanical energy as the crack propagates. The magnitude of this passive stress depends on the operational conditions while its spatial distribution is taken to be the same for all velocities, merely to simplify the analysis. The restraining stress is not intrinsic of the material; it can change with the state of affairs ahead of the moving crack. In other words, the local conditions are velocity dependent, not to mention the changing physical location of the crack nucleation site which is regarded as a part of the crack propagation process. No doubt the properties of this zone of restrain would depend on the atomic or molecular structure of the material. The COD should be distinguished from that of the restrained zone opening displacement (RZOD). The former is associated with traction free surfaces while the latter with surfaces on which restraining stresses prevail. The size of RZOD can depend on the crack velocity and applied stress. Velocity dependent non-linear restraining stress distributions are considered for exploring how crack speeds are affected. When using a constant velocity crack model for studying the limiting crack speed, it is necessary to impose a corresponding limit on the applied stress. This is assumed to coincide with the situation when the size of the restraining zone ceases to increase with the applied load. Determination of the maximum speed that a crack could reach in an isotropic and homogeneous material has also been related to the bifurcation phenomenon of a high speed running crack. Bifurcation has been attributed to the excess of local energy that would require two crack branches to dissipate. The corresponding energy dissipation would depend on the size scale under consideration. The energy density packed in two adjacent planes with distances of 10

21144442361	Screw dislocations generated from crack tip of self-consistent and self-equilibrated systems of residual stresses: Atomic, meso and micro	All materials are known to contain residual stresses and strains, the magnitude of which depends on the history of the processing procedure. These initial disturbances will undergo rise and fall when energy is added or extracted from the system. In general, the system tends to damp out the fluctuations and possesses the tendency to achieve equilibrium. Since the energy states of any portion of the system, or the sub-systems, will not reach equilibrium at the same time, the residual effects will not be uniform and will be more pronounced at locations where defects and stress concentrators are present. Considerations of their influence on material behavior at the macroscopic scale are well known. Recent interest on sub-micron devices in microelectronics has prompted the examination of initial stresses and strains at the microscopic and atomic scale. A particular situation corresponds to the defects or imperfections caused at the atomic scale due to residual stresses and strains at the microscopic scale. That is after the external disturbances have been removed from the system. These defects will be referred to as dislocations. One of the objectives is to develop a model that can estimate the number and type of dislocations for a given distribution and magnitude of stress and strain state ahead of a micro-crack. Both uniform and varying residual stress distributions are assumed to examine how they would affect the dislocation emissions of an internally self-equilibrating system where no external disturbances prevail. A mesoscopic zone is introduced between the atomic and microscopic scale to smooth out the transition. The sizes of these zones and number of dislocations generated for a particular microscopic residual stress state are determined analytically by solving a system of highly non-linear equations. Because of the gap between the atomic- and micro-scale, a "scale multiplier" was introduced to connect two ranges of scale. This tends to facilitate and smooth out the numerical computations. Such a multiplier is reminiscent of the stress compatibility condition used in early works where force or energy criterion is employed. To simplify the analysis, a screw motion of dislocation is selected for illustration mainly since it involves only one non-trivial out-of-plane displacement. All stresses and strains out side of this plane of deformation vanish. The results show that an enormous number of screw dislocations can be generated from the microscopic residual stresses. Depending on the ratio of the residual stress to the elastic modulus, the number of screw dislocations would first increase with the segment over which they prevail and then decreases. The effect becomes less distinct when the residual stress magnitude is decreased. For a constant amplitude residual distribution, the estimated number of dislocations is about 10

24144493075	Equilibrium mechanics model of multiscaling by segmentation: Asymptotic solution for macro-meso-micro damage in anti-plane shear deformation	A multiscaling model of cracking is developed whereby a closed form solution is obtained for the description of microscopic material damage corresponding to different constraints of the micro-crack. Coupling between the damage at the macro- and micro-scale is made via the mesoscopic zone to smooth out the transition. The range of each scale can be controlled to permit the application of equilibrium mechanics. In principle, the procedure can be applied to simulate the behavior of a non-equilibrium process by a series of segmented equilibrium processes. It is rarely possible to obtain closed form solution for multiscale damage models. Exception is found for the present model of macro-meso-micro damage by cracking under anti-plane shear deformation. Accuracies in numerical computations are thus reduced to the evaluation of algebraic equations. Examined, in particular, are the inhomogenities at the microscale arising from uneven stiffness of the material microstructures which can vary the constraints on the micro-crack. These geometrically created inhomogeneities are simulated by the free-free, fixed-fixed and free-fixed boundary conditions. The encouraging aspect of this work is that the results for anti-plane are found to be similar to those for in-plane extension. This suggests further exploration of the procedure where scale segmentation can indeed be reduced to any size at will, in the limit approaching zero. This would in principle correspond to the non-equilibrium process. Keeping in mind that the present modeling process involves segmentation and connection, the latter requires a scale invariant criterion. To this end, the volume energy density function is used with a length parameter or an area parameter so that the product can cross scale. The details of this procedure would be beyond the scope of this discussion. Nevertheless, ample evidence will be shown in the work to follow that the volume energy density function is fundamental not only to the scale shifting process but also in the ways how microscopic constraints can influence macroscopic behavior. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

26844453374	Triple scale segmentation of non-equilibrium system simulated by macro-micro-atomic line model with mesoscopic transitions	The concept of restraining stress ahead of a macro-crack was first applied to the development of a dual scale line crack model. The local stress intensity is said to be lowered due to the restraint represented by the opposing intensity of the strip zone, the size of which determines the amount of restraint. The description used for this effect may have been referred to as plastic flow, energy dissipation region, or cohesive stress zone. They, however, encounter conceptual difficulties when scales are gradually reduced. A general interpretation is needed that can be applied to both the macroscopic, microscopic and lower size scales. This restraining stress is passive. Its exact nature is not known except it decreases with increasing degradation of the material quantified by its zone size. While the foregoing assumption is clear, the resulting crack behavior still depends on available energy ahead of the crack that is loading specific. This energy can decrease or increase with damage and react with the restraint in a complicated manner. In macroscopic terms, the combined reaction of load with material has escaped the attention of the analysts except when the size is enlarged to that of a full scale structure. This is a particular concern for the behavioral properties of matter at the atomic scale. Experimental evidence of this behavior can be seen from the different dislocation patterns emitted from a macro-crack tip when the macroscopic loading is altered in magnitude and/or type. When the energy input is localized to the crack tip, less and less energy would reach the crack front as the damage extends. This situation may represent the release of initial or residual stresses trapped in the microstructure. The local damage would settle to an equilibrium position once dissipated. On the other hand, if a crack is engulfed in a far remote, applied stress field, it would experience continuous input energy and damage. The restraint in the material would be overshadowed. These features will be reflected by the results of the present triple scale line segment crack/dislocation model. Similar trends of the local stress intensity may be caused by different physical mechanisms. Decrease of stress intensification at the macro-crack due to microscopic and atomic effects are shown to be second and third order effects. The influence of dislocations to the micro-crack can be first/ second order. All imperfections considered take the configuration of lines. They can have different sizes stretching from the atomic or smaller scale to that of the macroscopic scale. More precisely, three sections are considered. They consist of the macro-, micro- and dislocation- segments. Two mesoscopic zones are introduced to smooth out the transitions where the scale range is shifted. Each scale segment are defined arbitrarily as sub-atomic to nano from 10

26844514174	Edge dislocations generated from a microcrack under initial residual stress of non-uniform distribution	Crystal nucleation gives rise to inhomogeneity in the crystal lattice. The prevailing stresses and strains caused by non-uniform cooling can create microcracks with residual stresses locked-in at the end segments. These stresses can have a non-uniform distribution where the amplitude can increase or decrease from the microcrack tip which is highly strained to generate edge dislocations under in-plane shear. A dual scale microdislocation crack model is considered by focusing attention near the microcrack tip singularity such that more than 10 orders of magnitude in lineal dimension can be covered from the atomic to the microscopic scale. The concept of a scale multiplier is employed to connect the microscopic and atomic scale results. Discontinuity at the cross-scaling location is necessitated by dividing the full range of the non-equilibrium process into two regions within which equilibrium mechanics can be used. When needed, additional mesoregions can be added to reduce the transient discontinuities. Solved in closed form is the solution for the generation of edge dislocations due to non-uniform residual stress distributions at the end segment of the microcrack tip which will henceforth be referred to simply as the "tip". Three different Cases I, II and III will be considered where the residual stress will possess a peak at the different locations. Case I for the furthest away from the tip, Case II for the peak nearest to the tip and Case III for the peak in the middle of the residual stress segment. Compared are the scale multiplier α whose maximum value being one corresponding to no discontinuity at cross-scaling. Hence, small α corresponds to large discontinuity. For Cases I, II and III, αs are found, respectively 0.17, 0.43 and 0.28. The largest discontinuity occurred at α = 0.17 when the peak of the residual stress is farthest away from the microcrack tip. The largest number of edge dislocations or imperfections are also generated for Case I. The precise location of the residual stress peak is related to the magnitude and the segment length of the residual stress. These findings are manifestation of the variety of non-homogeneities that can arise in a metal alloy during crystal formation, not to mention the prevailing conditions at the grain boundaries. The idea is not to account for the details per se but to test the sensitivities of the microscopic and atomic parameters involved. To this end, the energy density function for the dual scale model will be determined and discussed in connection with what has been emphasized. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

30944443094	Signatures of rapid movement of electrons in valence band region: Interdependence of position, time and temperature	Position, time and temperature are the fundamental variables that describe the local energy state of electrons. In general, ionization defined only in terms of the average behavior of the electrons over an atom. The velocity, acceleration and path type of the electron will be different for electrons at different position, time and temperature in the atom since electrons are known to occupy different orbits depending on shell-type that would vary from atom to atom. These variations when summed for millions and billions of electrons can be significant in situations where the assumed qualitative character of physical events will affect the quantitative outcome, particularly when the results are brought up to the engineering scale. The accuracy required for identifying the initiation mechanism of aging of metals in contrast to that of stress corrosion may be quite different, not to mention the added effects of the environment involving high temperature and/or irradiation. The activities of the electrons near the peripheral region of the atom have known to dominate the engineering properties of matter. They, howerer, are least known in quantum physics because past interest has been centered on releasing energy from the atomic nucleus. The advent of nanotechnology has given hopes to the engineers that they may soon find the answers to their problems at the subatomic scale level with the assistance of high resolution electron microscopes where the detail observation of electron behavior may be made possible in the not too distant future. It is with this spirit that an initial effort is made to find the interdependence relation for the position r, time t and temperature T of an electron traveling at constant velocity and constant acceleration. The difference is explored by keeping in mind that the long journey cannot start without taking the first step. In this respect, the behavior of electrons in a hydrogen atom will be taken as the model to show that electrons move rapidly in the atom at 2.88 × 10

There exists no strict definition of what is microscopic and what is macroscopic in view of the transitional region where one scale blends into another which can be referred to as the mesoscopic zone. Under alternating loads, microcracks can open and become macrocracks that can also close and revert back to microcracks.

33748414604	Simultaneous occurrence of double micro/macro stress singularities for multiscale crack model	It is rare to find two distinct stress singularities with different order at the same crack tip while the local displacements remained regular. Such a discovery was made when developing a dual scale micro/macro crack model and validated from a closed form asymptotic analytical solution for a micro/macro crack subjected to mixed boundary conditions. The two different orders of the stress singularities are 0.75 and 0.25 for an incompressible material. The existence of multi-singularities with different orders at the crack point is an unexplored area of research. For a sharp notch wedge, multi-stress singularities at the wedge point can prevail and they depend on the notch angle and Poisson's ratio. Physical implications of such solutions when viewed at the microscopic scale are particularly significant as they tend to suggest that the multiple combinations of geometries and materials can yield so many different combinations of distortional and dilatational effects. No wonder microscopic irregularities seem to be the rule. Discontinuous numerically solutions, however, may or may not correspond to singularities. In view of the recent research emphases on multiscaling, the multiple singularity solution at a point seems to signify the inherent characteristics of micro-defects. They are irregular and defy self-similarity. The double singularity alone implies that a microcrack can extend in two different directions from the same location, known as branching in the very rapid propagation of a macrocrack. At the microscopic scale, double singularity implies the possibility that branching can occur under macroscopic static load. Such a behavior of static branching of microcracks associated with double singularity is being established. A fundamental aspect of this model is the inherent existence of restraining stress from the material that is essential for the microcrack and only sometimes for the macrocrack. As a rule, the microcrack being smaller would react to the material restraint more readily. Such a feature is necessary in the model in addition to the effects of micro/macro material interaction and the macrocrack characteristic length with reference to the macrocrack length. In normalized form, the minimum of three parameters, say μ

33750942987	Multiscale evaluation of microstructural worthiness based on the physical-analytical matching (PAM) approach	By selecting the appropriate spatial and temporal variables, physical abnormalities at the microscale can be limited to the essentials such that effective analytical solutions can be made available and identified with high resolution TEM and SEM micrographs. A catalogue of physical-analytical pairs can be stored electronically for the evolution of material damage from micro (or nano) up to macroscopic failure. High speed digital processing can organize such information and make forecast on potential failure in the cyberspace. The micro/macro line cracking model is used to illustrate the use of the PAM (physical-analytical matching) technique although it is still at the early stage of development. Three essential parameters describing the inhomogeneity of the material serve as the basis of the approach while specific microstructural details can be accounted for by using the incidental variables as programmed by PAM in the future. Demonstration is made by using the dual scale micro/macro line crack model where closed form asymptotic solution can be obtained from singularity representation. No generality is lost from the line crack configuration. This is analogous to taking the shape of an atom to be spherical since the exact shape is not relevant. The essential quantities are the energy density and characteristic length associated with the equivalent crack length defined with reference to the spatial and temporal variables under consideration. For a macroscopic tensile specimen containing a micro/macrocrack, multiple microcracking patterns are generated. A priori assumptions related to the grain geometries and/or cohesive force laws to create branching will not be made. Instead, values of the essential parameters are selected to obtain multiple minima of the volume energy density functions. These minima are very closely spaced. This implies that the initiation of multiple microcracking is probable even though dynamic effects are not present. This is in contrast to macrocrack branching where the crack velocity had to approach that of the Rayleigh wave speed. The formulation also shows that empirical approach blind folds the details of microscopic and scaling effects. The double singularity line crack model is used to illustrate that different multiple microcracking patterns can be predicted from the volume energy density fracture criterion that has been used extensively for examining the initiation of macrocracking. The criterion relies on identifying the locations of the stationary values of the energy density function with the potential threshold sites dominated by dilatation or distortion without assuming that the two energy density components are the linear sum, a condition invoked in linear elasticity. To reiterate, three essential parameters are defined to describe the non-homogeneous behavior of the material while two incidental variables are used for the double singularity line crack to account for specific microstructural effects. It is the ease with which asymptotic closed form solution can be obtained and identified with observed damage patterns that suggests the possibility to develop the PAM technique in the cyberspace. © 2006.

33750946730	Evaluation of microstructural parameters for micro/macro-line crack damage model	Considered is a line crack model that can account for multiple unsymmetrical microcracking patterns even the applied macrostress is symmetrical across the plane of the initial microcrack. The multiple unsymmetric micro-branchings arise from the three essential parameters that are implicit in the micro/macro-model. They account for the inhomogeneity and/or anisotropy of the material. Matching of the analytical predictions from the assumed fracture criteria and the physical observations are problem specific and subjective. The work prepares the ground for the development of the general scheme known as the physical-analytical matching approach. The main objective is to link the results found from several size and time scales that are referred to as multiscaling. Demonstrated is the linking of macro- and micro-effects. In particular, the model will show that micro-unsymmetry need not be explicitly invoked in the macro-geometry and/or loading. The double singularity line crack model shows that a variety of single, double and triple branching patterns can be predicted from the volume energy density criterion in contrast to the maximum stress criterion that is limited in predictive capability. There is no loss in generality by using a linear analysis as long as the scale range is segmented to exclude non-linearity. Moreover, the emphasis on the energy level and characteristic length of the micro- and macro-defects rather than precise geometric shape of the defect which can be a line, notch or other configurations. Such an approach is justified by the existence of a hierarchy of spatial and temporal combination of the material damage process. The ones that are commonly encountered are the macromechanical, microstructural and nanochemical. This study is concerned with the microstructural where macro-loading applied to a structural body can introduce microcracking because of the interaction of inherent microscopic defect with the material internal structure. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

34547601108	Random property of micro/macro fatigue crack growth behavior predicted from energy density amplitude range	Fatigue crack growth characteristics are sensitive to the combined effects of geometry and microstructure of the material in addition to the mean stress and amplitude of the repeated load where failure initiation starts from the microscopic scale and gradually spreads to the macroscopic scale. The prevailing stress amplitude of interest for engineering applications is about 50% of the yield stress. Incorporation of damage accumulation into a model that accounts for microstructural effects has been a goal that appears to be beyond reach. The contradicting circumstances seem to rest on the requirement of a workable model for solving a complex physical system. Some of the desirable features for describing fatigue damage may include scale transition, say from micro to macro, material inhomogeneity and micro-asymmetry independent of macro-symmetry of applied load. Current work is divided into two categories: (i) seek a model that will yield the best fit from known data and (ii) develop a model based on physical and/or mathematical requirements. The former relies on savoir faire while the latter requires validation from test data. Both approaches have obtained partial success in specific situations. The instigation was initiated from nanotechnology to examine events at smaller time and size scale. The quest for more refined models will not cease as long as the need for fatigue failure prevention is in demand. Within the framework of the two-parameter relation, a dual scale micro/macro fatigue crack growth model will be developed by invoking a statistical representation for the geometry-material-load parameters that are irregular at the lower scale. The assumed is to possess a random normal distribution with different mean and standard deviation. This leads to dispersion around the mean for the relative shear modulus μ

37649015754	Fatigue crack growth behavior of cables and steel wires for the cable-stayed portion of Runyang bridge: Disproportionate loosening and/or tightening of cables	The cable-stayed portion of the Runyang bridge has a main span of 400 m supported between towers by 52 cables on each side. The cable length and location differ contributing to different tension that would vary depending on the traffic conditions. High stresses prevail in cables near the free ends of the cantilever while the low stresses occur near quarter way of the main span and at the middle of the bridge. Such a variation has the tendency of tightening and loosening the cables in a complicated manner. The ways with which this variation would affect the damage of the cables by fatigue crack growth becomes increasingly more important in time, particularly for developing the methodology of inspection and maintenance of the bridge cables the failure of which by fatigue is likely to be location specific. One of the objectives of this work is to develop a model that can systematically determine the fatigue crack growth in pre-tensioned bridge cables that are made of stranded steel wires. The idealized cable containing 100% solidly packed wires correspond to β = 1.0 in the model. This parameter is shown to have a significant effect on the fatigue strength of the cables when using a dual scale crack growth rate relation that accounts for both macro- and micro-effects in geometry and material property. The combined influence of mean stress and stress amplitude on crack growth is shown to depend on tightening and loosening of the cables and steel wires. Variation of the tension in the cable and/or wire can be assessed by a parameter α such that α = 1 (normal tension) can serve as the reference. More and less tension correspond, respectively, to α ≥ 1 and α ≤ 1. In this way, the effect of traffic on fatigue can be delineated from that without the traffic. The results are presented graphically and discussed systematically for the cables subjected to high and low stresses. This provides an overall assessment of the fatigue crack growth behavior in the Runyang cable-portion of the bridge for a total of two million cycles. In general, it can be said that. Varying max. stress in cable with traffic: cable fatigue life can be enhanced and impeded, respectively, by loosening and tightening of tension in cable. Varying max. stress in cable without traffic: cable fatigue life can be enhanced and impeded, respectively, by tightening and loosening of tension in cable. Since geometric symmetry of the 52 cables cannot be satisfied exactly about the middle of the bridge, the high stresses in cable #3 is only approximately equal to that in cable #50. The same applies to the low stresses in cable #14 when compared to that in cable #28. Because of the significant difference in the fatigue life of cable #50 and #28, it is worthwhile to use a higher modulus material for cables #3 and #50 in contrast to that for cables #14 and #28. This conclusion is based on using energy density function of the dual scale micro-/macro-crack growth model. Since the results depend on the choice of the fatigue crack growth criterion, validation of engineering application should rely on minimizing contradictions and inconsistencies. Moreover, multiple criteria may be considered for the future design of bridges similar to the design of airborne vehicles that incorporate the concept of "fail safe". © 2007.

0034249798	Energy density theory formulation and interpretation of cracking behavior for piezoelectric ceramics	Any attempt made to separate energy into electrical and mechanical parts may lead to inconsistencies as they do not necessarily decouple. This is illustrated by application of the energy density function in the linear theory of piezoelasticity. By assuming that a critical energy density function prevails at the onset of crack initiation, it is possible to establish the relative size of an inner and outer damage zone around the crack tip; they correspond to the ligaments at failure caused by pure electric field and pure mechanical load. On physical grounds, the relative size of these zones must depend on the relative magnitude of the mechanical and electrical load. Hence, they can vary in size depending on the electromechanical material and damage resistance properties. Numerical results are obtained for the PZT-4, PZT-5H, and P-7 piezoelectric ceramics. These two ligaments for the two damage zones may coincide for appropriate values of the applied electrical field and mechanical load. Explicit expression of the energy density factor S is derived showing the mixed mode electromechanical coupling effects. The factor S can increase or decrease depending on the direction of the applied electric field with reference to the poling direction. This is in contrast to the result obtained from the energy release rate quantity, which remains unchanged for electric field in the direction of poling or against it.

0034300391	Multiscale behavior of crack initiation and growth in piezoelectric ceramics	The multiscale nature of cracking in ferroelectric ceramics is explored in relation to the crack growth enhancement and retardation behavior when the direction of applied electric field is reversed with reference to that of poling. An a priori knowledge of the prevailing fracture behavior is invoked for the energy dissipated in exchange of the macro- and micro-crack surface. To avoid the formalism of developing a two-scale level model, a single dominant crack is considered where the effect of microcracking could be reflected by stable crack growth prior to macro-crack instability. This is accounted for via a length ratio parameter λ. Micro- and macro-crack damage region would necessarily overlap in the simplified approach of applying equilibrium mechanics solutions to different scale ranges that are connected only on the average over space and time. The strain energy density theory is applied to determine the crack growth segments for conditions of positive, negative and zero electric field. The largest and smallest crack segments were found to correspond, respectively, to the positive and negative field. All of the three piezoceramics PZT-4, PZT-5H and P-7 followed such a trend. This removes the present-day controversy arising from the use of the energy release rate concept that yields results independent of the sign of the electric field. Interaction of non-similar crack growth with the direction of electric field is also discussed in relation to Mode II cracking. The crack initiation angle plays a dominant role when the growth segment is sufficiently small. Otherwise, a more complex situation prevails where consideration should also be given to the growth segment length. Failure stresses of Modes I and II cracking are also obtained and they are found to depend not only on the electric field density but also on crack length and the extent of slow crack growth damage. These findings suggest a series of new experiments. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

84867335584	Sustainable reliability of brain rhythms modeled as sinusoidal waves with frequency-amplitude trade-off	Brain activities are quantifiable by wave forms with interactive frequency, amplitude, and phase angle. They have been known as the gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta waves, in accordance with the intensity and quality of waveforms measured by electroencephalography (EEG) at different locations of the scalp. However, the established interrelations of these waves associated with different sensory stimuli and setting of various encephalopathies are mostly empirical. Possible redundancies of the classification of these waves can be explored by studying the transitory character of one kind of these waves with another under controlled sensory stimuli. A case in point is the association of the gamma waves having high frequency and low amplitude with alpha waves having lower frequency and higher amplitude. The biological-electrical-chemical process of the neurons further implicates the spatial-temporal scale changes from the nano to the macro via the micro. The characterization of this highly transitory character of the information transmission process can be made by the combined use the transitional function from Ideomechanics (IDM) and the Principle of Least Variance (PLV).Using the wave length as one of the root functions of IDM, the time intervals for sustaining the minima of least variances of the five waves can be determined. The degree of sustainability of the waves is shown to decrease with time as the minima of the least variances increase with time. These trends are consistent with the waveforms observed from electroencephalography (EEG). The combined variations of the frequencies, phase angles, and amplitudes can thus be analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to define brain waveforms, mitigating the empiricism of observing EGG data alone.Gamma and alpha band response to photic driving stimulus in human and rat hippocampus have been observed via amplitude modulation. An interaction was observed between the gamma and alpha oscillatory activity in the human visual system. The visual stimulus has an onset time range of 75-150. ms. These data correspond well with the minima of least variances of 0.11 for gamma and 0.23 for alpha at 22-25. ms and 0.19 for gamma and 0.02 for alpha at about 75. ms. The analytical switch over from gamma to alpha occurred at about 46. ms. The precise numbers can vary with duration of the stimulus. Based on the Principle of Least Variance (PLV), the gamma waves are more sustainable and reliable at 22-25. ms, since 0.11. <. 0.23, representing the gamma phase-on, while the alpha phase becomes more sustainable and reliable at about 75. ms, since 0.02. <. 0.19. Suggested are the ON and OFF phases of gamma and alpha.The least variances suggest that the apparent waves can further delineate the brain behavior characteristics, notwithstanding the difference of the sub-atomistic character of gamma, alpha and beta entities. The overlapping classification of the apparent waves is likely to be caused by the ambiguities in distinguishing gamma, alpha and beta. The results from IDM and PLV, however, do indicate that the EGG data possess sufficient details for assessing the degree of normality and abnormality of brain waves. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84876825822	On-off switching of theta-delta brain waves related to falling asleep and awakening	The monoscale time span transitions from minutes-to-minutes are examined in relation to the interaction of delta and theta waves. Sustainability and stability of the delta and theta waves are evaluated by the severity of the oscillatory behavior of the least variance, a principle established for ranking cell growth. The relative order or disorder of delta and theta waves can be applied to distinguish the difference between falling asleep (FA) and awakening (AW). The brain wave frequency, amplitude and phase angles are regarded as the governing parameters in conjunction with the concept of synchronicity via the weighting functions.Awakening (AW) is found to be more controllable with a shorter time of sustainability as compared to falling asleep (FA). This corresponds to theta waves stabilized at a shorter time interval of 0-5. min than delta waves at 0-10. min. These results are based on the least variances averaged over the time span depicted. They are presented to encourage additional experiments on FA and AW.The monoscale time span study of delta-theta waves should be further reinforced by a dual scale time span of seconds-minutes with reference to the NREM and REM cycle of FA and AW. In particular, the direction of arrow from K-Complex (KC) to sleep spindle (SS) such as KC. →. SS deserves attention in relation to the reverse order of SS. →. KC. The reversal behavior may be associated with the N1 to N3 segment and N3 to REM segment of the FA-AW cycle. The monoscale study provides the impetus to further study the multiscale time span behavior of brain waves in general. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

49749128939	Birth of mesomechanics arising from segmentation and multiscaling: nano-micro-macro	Two generic functions μ(t) and ν(t) are proposed to describe the material microstructure degradation for a given design specification concerned with fatigue crack growth. This is accomplished by applying the concept of mesomechanics supplemented by multiscaling. Linearity and superposition are preserved from the appropriate range of scale segmentation. The dual scale model of micro- and macro-cracking in fatigue is used to derive μ(t) and ν(t) using only the initial values μ(0) and ν(0) at t = 0 that is prior to the onset of material damage. Fatigue crack growth results are obtained for pre-cracked 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum panels with the respective initial crack lengths of 2.0 mm and 0.3 mm and a fatigue life of 20 years. The basic scheme relies on the use of three dual scale parameters μ*(t), σ*(t) and d*(t). Anticipated are their relative behavior referred to two scales, say micro and macro. The relations between the measured (macro) and conceptualized (micro) material parameters at least prior to damage are more forgiving and can be established as the initial conditions for the prediction. Matching of the predicted with the available macroscopic crack growth results for the 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum alloys demonstrates that the methodology spares a detailed knowledge of the complex microstructure. In principle, the scheme can also be applied to characterize the behavior of carbon nano-tube reinforced composites, however complex, from a knowledge of its macroscopic behavior by tests. The corresponding micro- and nanobehavior are assumed to be obtainable by analysis. To this end, there remains the formulation of the dual scale nano/microcracking model in fatigue. © 2008.

51749084874	Micro/macro-crack growth due to creep-fatigue dependency on time-temperature material behavior	The implicit character of micro-structural degradation is determined by specifying the time history of crack growth caused by creep-fatigue interaction at high temperature. A dual scale micro/macro-equivalent crack growth model is used to illustrate the underlying principle of multiscaling which can be applied equally well to nano/micro. A series of dual scale models can be connected to formulate triple or quadruple scale models. Temperature and time-dependent thermo-mechanical material properties are developed to dictate the design time history of creep-fatigue cracking that can serve as the master curve for health monitoring. In contrast to the conventional procedure of problem/solution approach by specifying the time- and temperature-dependent material properties as a priori, the desired solution is then defined for a class of anticipated loadings. A scheme for matching the loading history with the damage evolution is then obtained. The results depend on the initial crack size and the extent of creep in proportion to fatigue damage. The path dependent nature of damage is demonstrated by showing the range of the pertinent parameters that control the final destruction of the material. A possible scenario of 20 yr of life span for the 38Cr2Mo2VA ultra-high strength steel is used to develop the evolution of the micro-structural degradation. Three micro/macro-parameters μ

53349168062	Anomalies concerned with interpreting fatigue data from two-parameter crack growth rate relation in fracture mechanics	Early studies on metal fatigue have concerned primarily with testing the bulk properties of smooth or notch specimens. The fine line crack configuration became a standard ASTM specimen when local effects were recognized to play a decisive role in failure initiation. The size of the failure initiation crack can range from a few cm to a few mm or smaller depending on the application that can involve through cracks in metal sheets, surface cracks extruding grain boundaries and embedded cracks interior to the material microstructure. The state-of-the-art in fracture control for the most part is to monitor the length of an equivalent crack, say "a", such that the corresponding rate da/dN can be related to the integrity of the system depending on the geometry, load and material. Consistent data interpretation has been a concern because of the enormous range of physical defect size that the design must cover to assure the effective application of the failure criterion from nano to structural scale size. The design may have to demonstrate that nanocracks are controlled in miniature devices as macrocracks are kept in the sub-critical state for larger structures, As more nanostructures are being used, consideration of small cracks in the damage evolution process is becoming the rule rather than the exception. Whether the ordinary two-parameter da/dN versus ΔK representation referred to Regions I-III would still accommodate microcrack and/or nanocrack behavior is an issue that deserves attention. Because of the empirical nature of the current da/dN approach, different physical meanings can be attached to the same crack growth rate data. The final decision will invariably favor the best fit of the data to certain pre-conceived condition. Non-uniqueness of the physical interpretation must therefore be kept in mind. Often, it is the a priori assumption based on physics that determines the outcome. Some of the possible differences are discussed with emphases placed on using an equivalent crack length and a corresponding energy density state such that the segmented state of affairs at the different scales can be connected. The time history of material damage including the degradation of the microstructure should be the primary concern in determining the system integrity. Scale segmentation avoids over stretching the ability of theories, most of which are short ranged. The dual scale approach will be offered as the basis for developing multiscale models. Advent of the modern electronic computer offers the opportunity for optimizing several unknown variables at the same time to arrive at the desired solution that can correspond to the design specification. © 2008.

5444253755	Kinetics of microcrack blunting ahead of macrocrack approaching shear wave speed	The fracturing of glass and tearing of rubber both involve the separation of material but their crack growth behavior can be quite different, particularly with reference to the distance of separation of the adjacent planes of material and the speed at which they separate. Relatively speaking, the former and the latter are recognized, respectively, to be fast and slow under normal conditions. Moreover, the crack tip radius of curvature in glass can be very sharp while that in the rubber can be very blunt. These changes in the geometric features of the crack or defect, however, have not been incorporated into the modeling of running cracks because the mathematical treatment makes use of the Galilean transformation where the crack opening distance or the change in the radius of curvature of the crack does not enter into the solution. Change in crack speed is accounted for only via the modulus of elasticity and mass density. For this simple reason, many of the dynamic features of the running crack have remained unexplained although speculations are not lacking. To begin with, the process of energy dissipation due to separation is affected by the microstructure of the material that distinguishes polycrystalline from amorphous form. Energy extracted from macroscopic reaches of a solid will travel to the atomic or smaller regions at different speeds at a given instance. It is not clear how many of the succeeding size scales should be included within a given time interval for an accurate prediction of the macroscopic dynamic crack characteristics. The minimum requirement would therefore necessitate the simultaneous treatment of two scales at the same time. This means that the analysis should capture the change in the macroscopic and microscopic features of a defect as it propagates. The discussion for a dual scale model has been invoked only very recently for a stationary crack. The objective of this work is to extend this effort to a crack running at constant speed beyond that of Rayleigh wave. Developed is a dual scale moving crack model containing microscopic damage ahead of a macroscopic crack with a gradual transition. This transitory region is referred to as the mesoscopic zone where the tractions prevail on the damaged portion of the material ahead of the original crack known as the restraining stresses, the magnitude of which depends on the geometry, material and loading. This damaged or restraining zone is not assumed arbitrarily nor assumed to be intrinsically a constant in the cohesive stress approach; it is determined for each step of crack advancement. For the range of micronotch bluntness with 0 < β < 30° and 0.2 ≤σ

67649444292	Ideomechanics of transitory and dissipative systems associated with length, velocity, mass and energy	Validation of Ideomechanics (IDM) is manifested by removing the inconsistency of applying open system test data to closed system theories. Instead, the available open system test data can be used rightly to determine the physical parameters of the transitional functions defined by the mean values of length (free path), velocity, mass and energy. Multiscaling and size/time effects are considered. Ambiguities are mitigated when energy takes precedent in lieu of the concept of force. Determined directly from IDM is the energy density function from the velocity that can represent the magnitude of the energy sink and source. The formulation involves grouping pairs of variables of opposing poles that can be constructed as ideograms, much like yin-yang of I-Chin. The flow of Chi implicates the arrow of time and irreversibility. Mass activation/inactivation (AIA) is assumed to be related to the expansion/contraction (EXCO) of matter. Inadvertently, physical systems are identified with inhaling and exhaling of energy corresponding, respectively, to direct-absorption and self-dissipation (DASD). They are postulated to be the basic process for determining the integrity of the system. In contrast to Newtonian/Einsteinian mechanics (NEM) that uses field equations for determining the behavior of the whole everywhere for all time, IDM considers the mean behavior at any given size/time scale, however, large and small. Uncertainties are addressed by the scale transitional functions. The new paradigm can be applied to scaling shifting and to construct equivalence relations for open systems and to the use of existing test data free of ambiguities. Classical conservation laws for closed systems are reducible from the equivalence principles of open systems. The same holds for the classical kinetic molecular theory of matter that can be modified to include dissipation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

68949125192	Enforcement of multiscaling in energy dissipation based on local pico-/nano-/micro-structure properties	Unloading of uniaxial specimens is distinguished from the inherent process of self-dissipation energy in regions of non-homogeneity where material damage starts. Transfer of coupon test data to the design of large bodies differs fundamentally from the corresponding rules applied to small bodies with large ratios of surface to volume. Large bodies make use of bulk material properties whereas small bodies depend on the local properties that cannot be found by standard tests. The transitional region with high energy gradients must thus be delineated accordingly. The stiffness gradient criterion generally used for large bodies no longer applies to smaller bodies governed by different physical laws, a fact known to those work in nanotechnolgy associated with MEMS. When the size scale is refined, local inhomogeneity becomes dominant and cannot be averaged. Non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior emerges and must be addressed accordingly. This overwhelming difficulty can be circumvented by adopting the scheme of multiscaling and segmentation for modeling progressive damage. That is by regarding a series of segmented damage initiation/termination processes which may consists of, say picocracking to nanocracking and nanocracking to microcracking followed by microcracking to macrocracking and so on. The "crack tip" is ideal for showing the cause and effect of material damage because it has no dimension or mass to speak of and yet it can be regarded as the sink and source that absorb and dissipate energy, respectively. The processes of direct-absorption and self-dissipation energy activated by the crack tip will be considered as the manifestation of field inhomogeneity that can be modeled by isolated pockets of energy sinks and sources without loss in generality. The threshold for each scale range is assumed to depend on the square of the crack tip velocity a

70349748793	Energy absorption and dissipation associated with mass activation and deactivation for open systems	Energy dissipation at the macroscopic scale, applied to large bodies, relies on using the average bulk or global properties. The normal procedure is to load/unload a uniaxial tensile specimen, and account for the difference of the area under the stress and strain curve, even though unloading does not occur in reality. The same procedure, however, is not feasible for treating the energy dissipation at the microscopic scale, applied to small bodies, where the space/time dependency of the local material properties plays a role. That is the transient character of the energy transfer between the specimen surface and surrounding can no longer be neglected. Moreover, there is no way to simulate microscopic unloading. Besides, the coupon test scheme of load/unload, an artifact, that has been used because of no other choice. Energy lost is an intrinsic process that defies empirical determination in the true sense. Incomplete homogeneous loading and/or unloading rate at all locations of the material gives rise to dissipation. This effect has been described by using the transitional function that entails multiscaling and segmentation for the simulation of material damage at the different scales. Segmented damage initiation/termination thresholds are invoked that may consist of, say pico- to nano-cracking and nano- to micro-cracking followed by micro- to macro-cracking and so on. The idealized "crack tip" is used to model the sink and source that can absorb and dissipate energy, respectively. The mass surrounding the crack tip is said to be activated by direct-absorption of energy and deactivated by self-dissipation of energy. The threshold for each scale range is assumed to depend on the square of the crack tip velocity over(a, ̇)

77956338938	Scale shifting laws from pico to macro in consecutive segments by use of transitional functions	Systems with parts that vary in size from pico to macro inclusive are vulnerable of being incapacitated when a single part fails owing to deterioration of material properties. The majority of system failure can be attributed to incompatibility of integrated parts that were designed individually for general purpose. Total reliability calls for all parts, small and large, to be compatible in life spans. Mass, when regarded as energized matter, can vary as a function of time. This, in retrospect, explains why non-equilibrium and non-homogeneity cannot be avoided for multiscale shifting laws.

77956343881	Sustainability aspects of large structures: Energy efficiency	Efficiency has been known as a measure of energy output to that of input in a thermo-dynamic sense. The extension of this definition to structural systems in sustainable development, however, requires ramification if environmental factors are to be included. Inefficient use of energy can contribute to the emission of green house gas and global warming. A common denominator should be found for weighing the different cause connected with wasted energy that leads to undesirable effects. This can be achieved by transforming efficiency into the dimensionless ratio of dissipated to available energy density, referred to as D/A such that the deficiency of a building, an air transport, a bridge, a power plant and the alike can be summed and assessed on a global level. Judgment and tangible factors can be by the use of three parameters D/A, Ω and η. The latter two are, respectively, the weighting factor and the efficiency. Based on the concept of payload from aerospace application, a stone bridge would score an exceedingly low efficiency because the payload of an ox cart carrying vegetable would be negligibly small compared to the weight of the bridge. However, the D/A and Ω would be correspondingly small for the green material of the stone bridge. While the cable-stayed bridge would have a much higher payload efficiency r| but the D/A and Ω would be higher because steel making contaminates the environment. The final verdict would depend on the combined assessment of D/A, Ω and η as postulated in this work. For illustration, the three-parameter model is applied to the Boeing 787-3,-8 and -9 air transport to demonstrate how η and D/A are computed and adjusted by the weighting factor Ω that takes the incidental factors such as weather, air traffic, etc. into the calculation. Favorable conditions can increase the efficiency of η=53% based on normal condition Ω=1 for the Boeing 787-9 to 55-66% with Ω<1 and D/A<0.47. Unfavorable conditions can reduce the efficiency to 30-40% with Ω>1 and D/A>0.47. The results are relative to the norm condition just mentioned. The use of D/A permits adding the energies dissipated in relation to the available for each of the sub-systems to arrive at the total account for the globe and make a comparison with the emission level of CO

78650269524	Mesomechanics of energy and mass interaction for dissipative systems	Small and large specimen data cannot be connected because the respective theories are developed independently by different physical laws. The disparities are becoming more and more transparent as nanospecimen data cannot be brought up to the macroscopic scale. The inability to address quantum and gravitational field mechanics in a unified manner adds to the diversification. One of the apparent deficiencies is not being able to treat small (atomic) and large (galaxial) bodies by a common multiscale model for addressing nonequilibrium and nonhomogeneous conditions. The time of arrow must also be reflected to invoke finiteness of the life sustaining energy. The synergis-tic thought leads to a pulsating mass manifested by matter activated by energy absorption and dissipation. The near simultaneity of energy intake and outlet of physical systems resembles the pulsation arising from contraction and expansion. The pulses, caused by the fatigue of metals, are within the range of micropulsations of geomagnetic energy fluctuations. The dualism of energy absorption and dissipation provides a common dialogue for establishing multiscale shifting laws. Mass pulsation, coupled with the equivalence of motion and energy, gives a unique mass-matter relation, bypassing the diversities of current concepts and theories in physics and mechanics.The scheme of scaling by segments such as pico, nano, micro and macro creates gaps among the scale ranges that requires cementation. Mesomechanics serves this purpose for developing scale shifting laws for connecting the gaps. Determination of energy density from velocity of physical systems was shown to be possible from the application of crack tip mechanics and ideomechanics. Four fundamental parameters l, v, M and Ware used. They stand, respectively, for the length, velocity, mass density and energy density. Their combinations can be formulated into unique mathematical groups. The three scale ranges: pico-nano, nano-micro and micro-macro are selected for demonstration. The objective is to explain real accelerated test data without making idealized assumptions for determining the life distributed over the three scale ranges.In short, a nonclassical approach will be adopted to derive scale shifting laws consisting of the transitional functions R

78650757793	Principle of least variance for dual scale reliability of structural systems	A R-integral is defined to account for the evolution of the root functions from Ideomechanics. They can be identified with, though not limited to, the fatigue crack length or velocity. The choice was dictated by the available validated data for relating accelerated testing to real time life expectancy. The key issue is to show that there exists a time range of high reliability for the crack length and velocity that correspond to the least variance of the time dependent R-integrals. Excluded from the high reliability time range are the initial time span where the lower scale defects are predominant and the time when the macrocrack approaches instability at relatively high velocity. What remains is the time span for micro-macro cracking. The linear sum (ls) and root mean square (rms) average are used to delineate two different types of variance. The former yields a higher reliability in comparison with that for the latter. The results support the scale range established empirically by in-service health monitoring for the crack length and velocity. The principle of least variance can be extended to multiscale reliability analysis and assessment for multi-component and multi-function systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The process can be enhanced or impeded depending on the ways in which the material microstructures are designed to react against the operational conditions. Undesirable chemical reactions can be the main source of strength degradation for load-supporting large structural members. Assessment of the remaining strength of damaged cable wires for cable-stayed or suspension bridges can rely on a knowledge of strength and/or fatigue life depending on the prevailing stress amplitude and whether the cables are stayed or not. Although large-scale computer schemes are available for making detailed failure analyses, they are not conducive to retrieving technical information within a relatively short time. Computer simulation has not advanced to the stage where experimental validation could be spared. To this end, effective analytical/experimental methodologies are much in need of development. The fracture mechanics approach appears to have gained ground in recent times, notwithstanding of its extension to include material microstructure effects. The present work was motivated by the successful completion of the Wuhu Changjiang River Bridge (WCRB) where the fatigue life of the cable and anchorage was a concern as the cable-stayed double-deck bridge can carry heavy loads for both highway and railway transportations. Use was made of the available information on the fatigue of bridge cables consisting of strands of steel wires to develop a fatigue crack growth rate model for examining possible micro-/macro-crack transition that is conducive to eutectoid and hypereutectoid steels with pearlite microstructures that has been drawn to possess very high strength. The static strength range under study for bridge wires is about 1770 MPa. The current state of the art relies on testing the cables with limited studies on the steel wires based on the static strength evaluation. Nevertheless, it is not possible to elude the fact that the fatigue lives of the steel wires have to be qualified by the manufacturers. After all, the cable fatigue lives do depend on those of wires in the bundle. The specification for the WCRB is two million cycles for steel wire while allowing only 2% of the wires to fail for a fatigue life of two million cycles for the cable. The prediction of wire bundle strength from a single wire would be analogous to that for the fibre bundle in composite studies that has been subsided in time. Following a brief account of the current approach for determining the fracture strength of high strength bridge cable steel wires under tension and/or bending, the predicted results are scrutinised against the different shapes and sizes of the crack profiles invoked in the analysis. The assumed crack profiles are also tested by using a fatigue crack growth model for a high strength steel with the same mechanical properties such that the model-dependent fatigue crack growth rate parameters can be determined. Because of the large difference of the cable and wire size, the rules of geometric similarities must be restrained from application to strength evaluation. Bodies with large surface to volume ratios will invariably contain more surface defects in contrast to those with small surface to volume ratios where failure will initiate from the interior rather than the surface. This is precisely the difference between the physical mechanisms of failure in static tension and fatigue. Keep in mind that the surface to volume ratio of the thin wire used for the WCRB differs by an order of magnitude and more for the cable by assuming an equivalent cross-sectional area of the cable to the wire bundle consisting of two cases, one with 73 and other with 85 steel wires of 7 mm in diameter. Both lens shaped and straight line crack front geometries were considered in the application of the fracture mechanics approach. Results for six cases in total, three for tension and three for bending, are obtained. The ranking based on the static fracture strength agreed with the predictions of the fatigue cracking model despite the fact that actual failure mechanisms in the two situations are known to be different as mentioned. The fatigue crack growth rate model, however, has the potential to address the transitional behaviour of microcracking and macrocracking; whether the conditions corresponding to strength measurement coincides with the triggering of a dominant macrocrack with or without the influence of microcracking has been a debatable issue in fracture mechanics known as 'plasticity effects'. Aside from using the dual scale model to study the transitional behaviour of micro- and macro-cracking, an equivalent bridge cable with homogeneously distributed wire may be developed to circumvent the irreconcilable difference in size effects of the wire and the cable. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

79953024185	Multiscale reliability of physical systems based on the principle of least variance	Multiscale reliability places priority on the shifting of space-time scale while dual-scale reliability concentrates on time limits. Both can be ranked by applying the principle of least variance, although the prevailing criteria for assessment may differ. The elements measuring reliability can be ideally assumed to be non-interactive or interactive as a rule. Different formulations of the latter can be adopted to yield weak, strong, and mixed reliability depending on the application. Variance can also be referred to the average based on the linear sum, the root mean square, or otherwise. Preference will again depend on the physical system under consideration. Different space-time scale ranges can be chosen for the appropriate time span to failure. Up to now, only partial validation can be made due to the lack of lower scale data that are generated theoretically. A set of R-integrals is defined to account for the evolution effects by way of the root functions from Ideomechanics. The approach calls for a " pulsating mass" model that can connect the physical laws for the small and large bodies, including energy dissipation at all scale level. Non-linearity is no longer an issue when characterization of matter is made by the multiscaling of space-time. Ordinary functions can also be treated with minor modifications. The key objective is not to derive new theories, but to explain the underlying physics of existing test data, and the reliability of diversified propositions for predicting the time span to failure. Present and past investigations have remained at the micro-macro or mi-ma scale range for several decades due to the inability to quantify lower scale data. To this end, the available mi-ma fatigue crack growth data are used to generate those at the na-mi and pi-na scale ranges. Reliability variances are computed for the three different scale ranges, covering effects from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. They include the initial crack or defect length and velocities. Specimen with large initial defects are found to be more reliable. This trend also holds for each of the na-mi and pi-na scale range. Also, large specimen data had smaller reliability variances than the smaller specimens making them more reliable. Variances for the nano- and pico-scale range had much more scatter and were diversified. Uncertainties and un-reliabilities at the atomic and sub-atomic scale are no doubt related, although their connections remain to be found. Reliability with high order precisions are also defined for multi-component systems that can involve trillions of elements at the different scale ranges. Such large scale computations are now within reach by the advent of super-speed computers, especially when reliability, risk, and among other factors may have to be considered simultaneously. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79953026363	Assurance of reliable time limits in fatigue depending on choice of failure simulation: Energy density versus stress intensity	The principle of least variance is applied to evaluate the reliability of the design conditions of the Runyang cable-stayed bridge. Monitored fatigue load in service data are analyzed in conjunction with the specimen fatigue crack growth data for bridge steel. Aside from size differences, the interactive effects of material behavior with load amplitude and frequency would vary with the depicted physical model for the reliability of life prediction. Based on the same crack growth history in time or cycle, the two choice selected for comparison are stress intensity factor (SIF) range, and the strain energy density (SED) range. Reliability is found to depend on the trade off between load amplitude and frequency. Considered are high-amplitude; low-frequency and low-amplitude; high-frequency. In each case, the chances are the reliable time span of fatigue crack growth will not coincide with the useful portion of bridge life, simply because the load frequency must be anticipated as an educated estimate. It is subject to change. Conversion of the crack length fatigue cycle history to the corresponding time history requires the specification of load frequency that can set the time span of the useful life. This is demonstrated for the Runyang bridge, where approximately 30. MPa and 8. MPa would correspond to the high and low fatigue load, respectively. Significant variances were found for the SIF and SED models. The difference can be attributed to the inclusion of the mean stress in the SED that is more forgiving since it accounts for both the stress and strain effects, in contrast to the SIF model that leaves out the strain and the mean stress. Since the principle of least variance refers to the average of the R-integrals, the results based on the linear sum (LS) and root mean square (RMS) will differ quantitatively, but not qualitatively. The obvious mismatch of the fatigue load used to determine the material property and that for the bridge design can be adjusted and absorbed into the appropriate choice for the load frequency, a compensating factor not realized up to now. To this end, the weighted functions in the R-integrals further emphasize long run effects of the least variance reliability analysis. Attention is called to Changeability in addition to determinability and probability for predicting the time to failure. That is to better anticipate the change in the fatigue load frequency, to which the assistance of health monitoring should provide. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

0035696534	Implication of scaling hierarchy associated with nonequilibrium: Field and particulate	The advent of nanotechnology has necessitated a better understanding of how material microstructure changes at the atomic level would affect the macroscopic properties that control the performance. Such a challenge has uncovered many phenomena that were not previously understood and taken for granted. Among them are the basic foundation of dislocation theories which are now known to be inadequate. Simplifying assumptions invoked at the macroscale may not be applicable at the micro- and/or nanoscale. There are implications of scaling hierrachy associated with in-homegeneity and nonequilibrium of physical systems. What is taken to be homogeneous and equilibrium at the macroscale may not be so when the physical size of the material is reduced to microns. These fundamental issues cannot be dispensed at will for the sake of convenience because they could alter the outcome of predictions. Even more unsatisfying is the lack of consistency in modeling physical systems. This could translate to the inability for identifying the relevant manufacturing parameters and rendering the end product unpractical because of high cost. Advanced composite and ceramic materials are cases in point. Discussed are potential pitfalls for applying models at both the atomic and continuum levels. No encouragement is made to unravel the truth of nature. Let it be particulates, a smooth continuum or a combination of both. The present trend of development in scaling tends to seek for different characteristic lenghts of material microstructures with or without the influence of time effects. Much will be learned from atomistic simulation models to show how results could differ as boundary conditions and scales are changed. Quantum mechanics, continuum and cosmological models provide evidence that no general approach is in sight. Of immediate interest is perhaps the establishment of greater precision in terminology so as to better communicate results involving multiscale physical events. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035702281	Mesofracture mechanics: A necessary link	Classical fracture mechanics is based on the premise that small scale features could be averaged to give a larger scale property such that the assumption of material homogeneity would hold. Involvement of the material microstructure, however, necessitates different characteristic lengths for describing different geometric features. Macroscopic parameters could not be freely exchanged with those at the microscopic scale level. Such a practice could cause misinterpretation of test data. Ambiguities arising from the lack of a more precise range of limitations for the definitions of physical parameters are discussed in connection with material length scales. Physical events overlooked between the macroscopic and microscopic scale could be the link that is needed to bridge the gap. The classical models for the creation of free surface for a liquid and solid are oversimplified. They consider only the translational motion of individual atoms. Movements of groups or clusters of molecules deserve attention. Multiscale cracking behavior also requires the distinction of material damage involving at least two different scales in a single simulation. In this connection, special attention should be given to the use of asymptotic solution in contrast to the full field solution when applying fracture criteria. The former may leave out detail features that would have otherwise been included by the latter. Illustrations are provided for predicting the crack initiation sites of piezoceramics. No definite conclusions can be drawn from the atomistic simulation models such as those used in molecular dynamics until the non-equilibrium boundary conditions can be better understood. The specification of strain rates and temperatures should be synchronized as the specimen size is reduced to microns. Many of these results obtained at the atomic scale should be first identified with those at the mesoscale before they are assumed to be connected with macroscopic observations. Hopefully, "mesofracture mechanics" could serve as the link to bring macrofracture mechanics closer to microfracture mechanics. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

0036650726	A field model interpretation of crack initiation and growth behavior in ferroelectric ceramics: Change of poling direction and boundary condition	Strain energy density expressions are obtained from a field model that can qualitatively exhibit how the electrical and mechanical disturbances would affect the crack growth behavior in ferroelectric ceramics. Simplification is achieved by considering only three material constants to account for elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric effects. Cross interaction of electric field (or displacement) with mechanical stress (or strain) is identified with the piezoelectric effect; it occurs only when the pole is aligned normal to the crack. Switching of the pole axis by 90° and 180° is examined for possible connection with domain switching. Opposing crack growth behavior can be obtained when the specification of mechanical stress σ

0036744352	Electromechanical influence of crack velocity at bifurcation for poled ferroelectric materials	The piezoelastodynamic field equations are solved to determine the crack velocity at bifurcation for poled ferro-electric materials where the applied electrical field and mechanical stress can be varied. The underlying physical mechanism, however, may not correspond to that assumed in the analytical model. Bifurcation has been related to the occurrence of a pair of maximum circumferential stress oriented symmetrically about the moving crack path. The velocity at which this behavior prevails has been referred to as the limiting crack speed. Unlike the classical approach, bifurcation will be identified with finite distances ahead of a moving crack. Nucleation of microcracks can thus be modelled in a single formulation. This can be accomplished by using the energy density function where fracture initiation is identified with dominance of dilatation in relation to distortion. Poled ferroelectric materials are selected for this study because the microstructure effects for this class of materials can be readily reflected by the elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric permittivity constants at the macroscopic scale. Existing test data could also shed light on the trend of the analytical predictions. Numerical results are thus computed for PZT-4 and compared with those for PZT-6B in an effort to show whether the branching behavior would be affected by the difference in the material microstructures.

79957947971	Reliability of cell division traits and triolism of wave-particle-change of DNAs	Reliability assures the time span of the physical events to occur on pre-determined path. The time dependent and multi-path process of cell growth and division can vary with a combination of effects that can add, negate, and compensate. Their trade-offs can be hidden in the test data, especially when the spatial-temporal scales are allowed to cross scale ranges. Cell entities consisting of dissolved chemicals are likely to wonder from scale to scale. Interaction of large and small bodies with long and short term effects can be the rule rather than the exception. Cell replication is inherently a multiscale phenomenon. The end results can be affected by the environment in ways that are not always determinable. Ranking the possible outcome by occurrence " reliability" provides a positive guidance. This can be accomplished by using the four root parameters obtained from the theory of Ideomechanics (IDM). They consist of length (size), velocity (growth rate), mass density (quantification), and energy density (life). A set of R-integrals and weighted functions are used and derived by satisfying a set of a posteriori conditions together with the principle of least variance. The general character of the time span of reliability can then be found. The approach has worked for non-living organisms and should apply equally well for living organisms, since the principle of Ideomechanics remains valid from the macroscopic to the picoscopic scale range, covering the genetic events of DNA by the 64 ideograms. It is a matter of identifying causes with effects from the early stages of evolution of organisms. The three scale ranges used are pico-nano, nano-micro, and micro-macro. The possible occurrence of a macroscopic event can thus be predicted by connecting the results on reliability of the three scale ranges. A limited portion of this complete scheme will be considered for demonstration.In what follows, the cell growth characteristics will be explored by analyzing the reliability time spans of cell dividing frequency and fraction, in addition to the cell volume change versus time behavior. The method of approach involves converting one of the " length" root function in Ideomechanics to an ordinary function. A description of the entire process of cell growth will need information on the remaining three root parameters. The triolism (TRLM) of wave-particle-change emphasizes the need to include the local energy dissipation owing to space-time non-homogeneity that was neglected in the dualism (DULM) of wave-particle in quantum mechanics. Two additional laws were discovered: one for space-energy trade-off and one for mass-motion interaction. Their presence were necessary in cellular microbiology. The concept of Newtonian " force" must also be discounted to define a generalized energy-based viscosity in multiscaling such that the true behavior of the cells, organelles, subunits, and adenosine triphosphates (ATPs) can be simulated. Deoxyribonucleic acid molecule (DNAM) will be considered as the exchange unit of chemical elements in KMT and the root parameters in IDM. Discussed are also symptoms of neuron degeneration (NDG) diseases need to be detected before they reaches the irreversible stage. Their occurrence may be related to the improper division of diseased cells and/or DNAs. © 2011.

80053597297	The camel back marvel of multiscale DNA learning for female and male	The camel-back-like pubertal growth rate spurts of 11-12 years of age for female and 13-14 years of age for male have motivated this research connected with DNA learning and memory in relation to neurobiology. Four primary variables (ℓ,v,M,W) are used to model the size (height), velocity (growth rate), mass density (weight or body mass index), and energy density (macro-molecules or smaller). They can be segmented at the pico, nano, micro and macro scales to mimic the different parts of the organ and cell structures via the laws of scale shifting. Aside from the weighted function determined previously from height age data, three additional weighted functions α(t), β(t) and γ(t) are derived from the respective transitional functions for the growth rate, body mass index and the energy density function found from Ideomechanics (IDM). The available test data for female and male of the 5-19 years of age were used to determine the sustainable reliability properties of the transitional functions. Definite trends of the camel back behavior are established even though much more elaborate considerations are needed.The preliminary results provide a framework under which redundancy can be tested from the existing physiological age data that are interpreted on the basis of least variance principle. In the same vein, spatial-temporal data of the neurons can also be used and related to those of learning and memory. Segmentation and multiscaling are essential to this work. © 2011.

0037347190	Crack size and speed interaction characteristics at micro-, meso- and macro-scale	The motivation to examine physical events at even smaller size scale arises from the development of use-specific materials where information transfer from one micro- or macro-element to another could be pre-assigned. There is the growing belief that the cumulated macroscopic experiences could be related to those at the lower size scales. Otherwise, there serves little purpose to examine material behavior at the different scale levels. Size scale, however, is intimately associated with time, not to mention temperature. As the size and time scales are shifted, different physical events may be identified. Dislocations with the movements of atoms, shear and rotation of clusters of molecules with inhomogeneity of polycrystals; and yielding/fracture with bulk properties of continuum specimens. Piecemeal results at the different scale levels are vulnerable to the possibility that they may be incompatible. The attention should therefore be focused on a single formulation that has the characteristics of multiscaling in size and time. The fact that the task may be overwhelmingly difficult cannot be used as an excuse for ignoring the fundamental aspects of the problem. Local nonlinearity is smeared into a small zone ahead of the crack. A "restrain stress" is introduced to also account for cracking at the meso-scale.The major emphasis is placed on developing a model that could exhibit the evolution characteristics of change in cracking behavior due to size and speed. Material inhomogeneity is assumed to favor self-similar crack growth although this may not always be the case. For relatively high restrain stress, the possible nucleation of micro-, meso- and macro-crack can be distinguished near the crack tip region. This distinction quickly disappears after a small distance after which scaling is no longer possible. This character prevails for Mode I and II cracking at different speeds. Special efforts are made to confine discussions within the framework of assumed conditions. To be kept in mind are the words of Isaac Newton in the Fourth Regula Philosophandi: " Men are often led into error by the love of simplicity which disposes us to reduce things to few principles, and to conceive a greater simplicity in nature than there really is ... We may learn something of the way in which nature operates from fact and observation; but if we conclude that it operates in such a manner, only because to our understanding that operates to be the best and simplest manner, we shall always go wrong ." - Isaac Newton. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0038336559	Dilatational and distortional behavior of cracks in magnetoelectroelastic materials	Dilatation and distortion are the two basic modes of deformation in continuum mechanics. They occur at different time and position depending on the size scale under consideration. At the macroscopic scale, dilatational waves are said to arrive prior to distortional waves at a given location. Macro-plastic deformation caused by distortion off to the side of a macro-crack precedes that of macro-fracture caused by dilatation ahead of a macro-crack. Micro-plasticity and micro-cracking can introduce non-linearity to the macroscopic material behavior. Such effects can be modeled directly as geometric defects (dislocations and/or micro-cracks) or indirectly by introducing effective material coefficients in the constitutive relations. Material anisotropy and/or inhomogeneity, however, do not separate hydrostatic tension (or compression) state of stress from that of shear on the octahedral planes. The latter is the basis of the von-Mises yield criterion. Stated in terms of the strain energy density function, linear separation into one part for dilatation and another for distortion can be made only if the material is linearly isotropic and homogeneous. Recent trends of miniaturization of electronic components requires a better knowledge of how the micro-structure would affect the material response due to mechanical stress as well as other sources of disturbances. Continuum mechanics results need to be interpreted over a wider range of time and size scales, and a better understanding of their limitations need to be achieved. In what follows, the stationary values of the strain energy density function dW/dV will be shown to yield an interpretation of the local dilatational and distortional behavior of anisotropic (or non-homogeneous) materials with or without cracks. This quantity is not only attractive from the view point of mathematics and mechanics because it is positive definite, it also makes physical sense for non-linear materials where the quotient dW/dV could still be used to separate dilatation from distortion. Application of the minimum local energy density function should be distinguished from the global energy minimization method used in molecular dynamics which is applied to determine the equilibrium configuration of atoms. The response of a line crack in a magnetoelectroelastic (MEE) material will be used for discussion in order to illustrate the character of multi-scaling. Expressed differently is that the time and size scales for the transfer of magnetic, electric and elastic energies may not be the same. An arbitrary limiting process that assumes vanishing crack segments created by all forms of energy may not be justified at the local scale levels. What has been assumed at the global scale for isotropic and homogeneous situations may not be valid at the local scale levels where anisotropy and non-homogeneity are the rule rather then the exception. Numerical results are obtained for the composite BaTiO

0037717113	Crack initiation behavior in magnetoelectroelastic composite under in-plane deformation	While the method of solution for crack problems in anisotropic elasticity and magnetoelectroelasticity is nearly identical, the prediction of crack initiation and/or growth behavior based on the asymptotic stress fields can differ widely depending on the chosen failure criterion. The latter has no haven to hide. Avoidance of contraction and satisfaction of the first law of thermodynamics are the rules that need to be observed. A negative crack tip energy release rate would infer the creation of energy and a negative strain energy density would imply the non-uniqueness of solution in classical linear continuum mechanics theories. Under these conditions, the crack initiation and growth behavior in a magnetoelectroelastic material will be examined. For the sake of notation and continuity, this work gives a brief account of the well-known solution for a line crack in a magnetoelectroelastic medium. Not to be underestimated is the derivation of the asymptotic form of the strain energy density function that was first given for the piezoelectroelastic crack problem. The equivalent expression for the magnetoelectroelastic case is given here. This sets the stage for a physical interpretation of how a crack would behave in a composite possessing the mixed properties of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic materials. The individual terms in the strain energy density function shows how the applied electric and magnetic field would affect the critical applied mechanical normal and shear stress to trigger crack initiation, respectively. When both normal and shear action prevail, the direction of crack initiation is no longer obvious and it needs to be determined since the energy stored ahead of the crack depends on the direction of prospective crack initiation. Numerical results are given for a BaTiO

If a particular solution in exact form may be found for the out-of-plane case, the same may not hold for the in-plane case. Hence, there may be a good reason for discussing the out-of-plane crack problem in certain situations that should be emphasized. Otherwise, the reason may lie in the exploration of possible application to the in-plane problem, a direct solution of which would have required a considerable effort.

84869801095	Singularity representation of multiple scaling in mesofracture	A material damage model is presented that possesses the capability to reach down from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale in a consistent manner. This is accomplished by adding a microscopic size notch tip to the front of a macroscopic crack where the continuity and compatibility of the crack opening displacement are satisfied. The model extends the treatment of defect size in length by three to four orders of magnitude. The energy density function has been used for assessing the relative influence of micro-defects at the microscopic scale relative to that at the macroscopic scale. It is found that a micro-defect would increase the energy density level represented by lines in a log-log plot undergoing a translational shift as the bluntness of the micro-defect increases. The opposite effect is predicted at the microscopic distance away from the original crack where the energy density level would decrease by a rotational shift when the bluntness of the micro-crack increases. The procedure can be applied to any two adjoining scale levels such as microscale and nanoscale.

The interplay of dW/dV and ℓ in relation to multiscaling damage of materials has been demonstrated and will be further connected to the local and global failure of structures. The time dependent parameter ℓ is also known as the fail-safe index that defines the distance between the locations of maximum of local minimum (MOLM) dW/dV and maximum of global minimum (MOGM) dW/dV.

84875507190	Efficacy of invariant surface energy density for multiscale shifting of volume energy density	Uniaxial test data stand as monoscale average material property. They are unable of making connection with those at the microscopic scale. This impasse can be circumvented by using the surface energy density (SED) to establish a scale shifting law advocating the relation between the volume energy density (VED) and the length or size parameter for non-homogeneous systems. The homogeneous system corresponds to a perfect hyperbola when referred to the segmented scale of measurement standard of the Système international d'unités or simply the SI system.Scale segmentation is the lesser of two evils that avoids addressing the inconceivable limits of infinity. Dualscaling forms the basis for constructing multiscale systems. Invariancy of SED yields the scaling shifting law between the VED and the rate change of volume with surface, a length parameter. Evaluation of the sustainable and stable time of material microstructure can thus be made possible in segments and connected for a description of the evolutionary changes. The process corresponds to extending from the present into the past and future, regardless of the beginning and ending. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875510995	Sustainable time and stability of hippocampal and cortical EEG theta waves	Sinusoidal wave function is used to quantify brain rhythms characterized by the interaction of frequency, amplitude, and phase angle (FAP). Their combinations have been differentiated in terms of gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta waves, in accordance with test data obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) at different locations of the scalp, and hence neurons at the different locations of the brain. The standard wave-type classifications, however, refer to a wide range of situations that are changeable according to variations of the sensory stimuli such that one wave type may switch into another. Even for the same wave type, say theta, a perturbation of frequency and/or amplitude can alter the sustainable time of the wave.The Least Variance Principle (LVP) is applied to determine the stable and reliable state of the " hippocampal" and " cortical" EEG theta waves having the, respective, frequency ranges of 7-9. Hz and 4-7. Hz. The sustainable time of the hippocampal waves are longer and more stable while those of the cortical waves are shorter and less stable. These findings are in general agreement with the available experimental results obtained from small mammals and humans. Also keep in mind of the difference in the method of recording the EEG waves. Seven different cases are reported from the LVP model. They are characterized by a comparative scheme for testing the sensitivity of the frequency and phase angle changes.Using the average frequencies of 8.0. Hz for the hippocampal waves and a higher phase angle and 5.5. Hz for the cortical waves and a lower phase angle, the, respective, sustainable times are found to be 2.2. s and 0.5. s. The hippocampal waves were found to be more stable. These results correspond precisely to test measurements where perturbation of the frequencies and phase angles can correspond to large variations in the sustainable time of the hippocampal and cortical theta waves. In general, larger frequencies and phase angles favor longer sustainable and stable time. That is perturbation of the theta wave frequency and phase angle can result in appreciable change of the sustainable time of the theta wave. These features are exhibited consistently by the results for seven different FAPs. Other situations can be generated to propose additional theta wave oscillation experiments. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Scale transmissibility of stress and strain must be validated by models and/or laws. Material testing philosophy of the 18th century are not valid for the 21st century applications, where microscopic and nanoscopic effects enter into design. Simply put, the dual scaling of distortion (micro) and dilatation (macro) is no longer uncommon.The use of true versus engineering stress and strain (S&S) can be troublesome as they entail contrasting physical interpretation for the same material, say for the 4130 steel for example. The true S&S curve shows hardening while the engineering S&S curves exhibit softening. The fictitious concept of elastic and plastic unloading also renders different meanings. Dissipated and available energy density from the uniaxial data can yield positive and negative efficiencies for 4130 steel. The benefit of micro and/or nano effects to macro properties can depend on the sustainable time of the test data. The active holding time of the nano interface reinforcement depends on manufacturing know-how, a highly guided trade secret that cannot be commonly acquired without the analytical skill and knowledge of non-equilibrium mechanics and metallurgy.The competition of the 21st century rests on energy efficiency for the use of super strength materials and structural systems. The axiomaticism of material testing can no longer walk alone without the emphasis of " identifiability and synchronicity" (I&S) of I-Ching or the Books of Changes. Uncertainties are not likely to be revealed by postulating and testing models without a knowledge of I&S. Physical events are biased by synchronicity, a property that can mitigate uncertainty. As application is extended from the macro to the nano or even smaller scale, multiscaling models will be the rules in material science research rather than the exception. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84879785579	Dwelling time of normal and abnormal brain waves connected with their transformability and sustainability	Normality and abnormality of EEG brain waves are associated with the transformability and sustainability time of the five waves types, namely gamma, beta, alpha, theta and delta in the order of their descending frequencies. Normal brain waves are transformable from one type to another with sustainable time in the order of seconds and minutes, while the transformability and sustainability time of abnormal brains may be of the order of months and years for situations where abnormalities are recoverable. Many of the exceptions caused by rhythmic irregularities and/or inappropriate EEG measurements can be identified with their respective wave type and sustainability time. This is done by using the least variance principle (LVP) where abnormalities in frequencies and amplitudes are captured by the variances and their sustaining time.The general notion is that normal waves would have less irregularities and are more predictable by the EEG wave frequencies and phase angles. Normal waves are not only more stable but they have a longer sustainable dwelling time. Waves with abnormally small (abs) and abnormally large (abl) frequencies on the other hand are more persistent on distinct dwelling times that can also affect the waveform stability. Dwelling time intervals of 0-6. min. and 4-10. min. are selected for abnormal waves in contrast to 0-10. min. for normal waves. The average frequencies are decreased from those for gamma waves to delta waves for determining the degree of persistency of dwelling times. Results from LVP show that the time occurrence of abnormally small (abs) and abnormally large (abl) frequencies affects the quality of the waveforms for the same dwelling time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84884842429	Fatigue crack growth rate of cable-stayed portion of runyang bridge: Part II - Steel wire crack growth due to disproportionate cable tightening/loosening and traffic loading	Having completed an investigation in Part I that deals with the fatigue crack growth in the cables of the Runyang cable-stayed bridge based the design data for the cables, Part II of this work is concerned with the fatigue crack growth of the steel wires being the constituents of the cables. The objective is not only to check the compatibility of the fatigue crack growth behavior of the cable and wire but also the independent design fatigue limits imposed on both the cable and wire. In particular, assumptions are made to relate the mechanical and fatigue properties of the cable in relation to those for the steel wire. The mean stress and stress amplitude are accounted for simultaneously such that the increase and decrease of the initial cable tension on the fatigue cracking of steel wires can be assessed. The increase use of higher strength wire materials calls for consideration of damage at both the micro- and macro-scale. That is more advanced material can absorbed more energy at the microscopic scale in contrast to energy dissipated by macrocracking. A dual scale fatigue crack model is therefore required to address the micro/macro interaction for the mechanical and fatigue properties of the material and their influence on crack growth. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

84884845913	Invariant form of micro-/macro-cracking in fatigue	The size/time transitory character of fatigue cracking can be hidden in the data or revealed explicitly depending on the manner of presentation. The former can correspond to the crack length while the latter to the crack growth rate variations, both referred to the number of fatigue cycles. Conventionally speaking, the sigmoidal curve for the plot of log da/dN against log δK consists of three regions known as I, II and III. They arereferred to, respectively, as crack initiation, stable crack growth and fast fracture although the transition from one region to another involving scale shifting is seldom discussed. Even though damage by very small defects are recognized in fatigue but their representation may become dubious when the parameter "a" in the crack growth rate expression da/dN may have to adopt a different physical interpretation. Using the line crack configuration for describing crack growth in metals, reference will be made to three approximate crack size range of a ≈10-80 mm (macromechanical) for regions II and III, a ≈10-3 to 10-1mm (micro- structural) for region I and presumably a ≈10-4 mm or smaller (nano- chemical) for the lower scale regions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

84884872848	Fatigue crack growth rate of cable-stayed portion of runyang bridge: Part I - Cable crack growth due to disproportionate cable tightening/loosening and traffic loading	Relatively little is known about the fatigue crack growth behavior of bridge cables. Such information can become increasingly more important in time for the cable-stayed bridges whose structural integrity can be greatly affected by the degradation of the individual cable material due to aging as well as defect growth. Moreover, crack initiation and propagation are intimately related such that they have to be treated as one of the same process. This requires a dual scale fatigue crack growth model involving both micro- and macro-cracking where the interaction of three micro/ macro material, geometric and load parameters is considered. Based on the design data for the stresses in the 52 cables of the Runyang cablestayed bridge, three typical cables referred to as #28, #38 and #50 are selected for analyzing fatigue crack growth under traffic and no traffic conditions. The initial tension in the cable can vary by using α=1 as the reference such that deviation from the design condition may be regarded as tightening and loosening. Under traffic, initial tightening and loosening of the cable can enhance and impede fatigue crack growth, respectively. When traffic is removed, initial tightening and loosening of the cable can impede and enhance fatigue crack growth. Opposing effects of fatigue crack growth are observed for cables with and without traffic. These results are discussed in terms of crack growth rate and crack length as a function of the fatigue cycles assuming that the cable has a life of two million cycles. Substantial variance in fatigue crack growth is found. Crack © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

0041691164	Piezomagnetic and piezoelectric poling effects on mode I and II crack initiation behavior of magnetoelectroelastic materials	The ferrite and ferroelectric phase of magnetoelectroelastic (MEE) material can be selected and processed to control the macroscopic behavior of electron devices using continuum mechanics models. Once macro- and/or microdefects appear, the highly intensified magnetic and electric energy localization could alter the response significantly to change the design performance. Alignment of poling directions of piezomagnetic and piezoelectric materials can add to the complexity of the MEE material behavior to which this study will be concerned with. Appropriate balance of distortional and dilatational energy density is no longer obvious when a material possesses anisotropy and/or nonhomogeneity. An excess of the former could result in unwanted geometric change while the latter may lead to unexpected fracture initiation. Such information can be evaluated quantitatively from the stationary values of the energy density function dW/dV. The maxima and minima have been known to coincide, respectively, with possible locations of permanent shape change and crack initiation regardless of material and loading type. The direction of poling with respect to a line crack and the material microstructure described by the constitutive coefficients will be specified explicitly with reference to the applied magnetic field, electric field and mechanical stress, both normal and shear. The crack initiation load and direction could be predicted by finding the direction for which the volume change is the largest. In contrast to intuition, change in poling directions can influence the cracking behavior of MEE dramatically. This will be demonstrated by the numerical results for the BaTiO

84890144425	Segmented multiscale approach by microscoping and telescoping in material science	Scaling in size and time has led to the establishment of a hierarchy of length scale for identifying the material damage process that can be described in terms of physical inhomogeneities and boundary conditions via the order of stress singularities. The scale dependent nature of some of these parameters such as stress, strain, energy density, etc., however, needs to be recognized. Based on the scale invariant property of force, scale segments other than those known as macro-stress, micro-stress and dislocation-stress. They correspond to characteristic lengths of 10-6.5 cm and 10-5.0 cm and can be, but not necessarily, related to pile of dislocations and subgrain boundary precipitates. This provides a full range of imperfections ranked by the lineal dimension from 10-2.0 cm to 10-8.0 cm. The corresponding stress-like quantities referred to as primary take the units of MPa, GPa, TPa, PPa and EPa which are separated by three orders of magnitude in Pascal. The open slots involving TPa and PPa fill in the gap between GPa and EPa that were not recognized previously. The intermediate orders of the stress singularities connected with TPa and PPa follow accordingly. The full range of stress singularity considered is for a macrocrack and for an edge dislocation. Here, r denotes the distance from the singular point. Indeed, the intermediate singularity models can be shown to exist by the Fadle eigenfunction expansion technique. Their solutions satisfy the axioms in mechanics such that the stresses can be discontinuous but the displacements are required to be finite and continuous at the singular points. The singularity representation approach has worked well in linear fracture mechanics and there is no reason why the concept cannot be extended to include other orders of singularities, either stronger or weaker than the The combination of stress singularities, characteristic lengths and physical inhomogeneities serves as the basis of the proposed scaling scheme. By the same token, similar features of size scaling can be found by observing larger objects that are cosmic in size. Instead of using a characteristic length, a characteristic particle size of 10 42 cm in lineal dimension can be used. This offers a scaling scheme for the size of the universe, galaxy, solar system and earth with the respective dimensions of 1038, 1023, 1013 and 108 cm. This corresponds to 1080, 1065, 1055 and 1050 particles. The same particle size, however, will not yield a reasonable size spectrum for objects smaller than the macroscopic. This observation suggests not only a discontinuity in the process of scaling but also the possibility of not being able to reconcile the difference between organic and inorganic substances by shifting time and size scales. That is the establishment of a common ground for material and life science in terms of scaling remains as an unexplored possibility. © 2007 Springer.

84890192347	Mode i segmented crack model: Macro/symmetry, micro/ anti-symmetry and dislocation/skew-symmetry	Multiscale consideration is given to the stress and displacement field symmetry at the macro-, micro- and dislocation-scale level. Under Mode I loading, symmetry with reference to the macro-crack is preserved. However, anti-symmetry is allowed at the micro-scale to account for the irregular micro-crack path that need not be normal to the tensile applied stress at the macro-scale. Micro-normal and micro-shear tractions can prevail in the transitional region where micro- and dislocation-effects merge. For illustration, only edge dislocation emission from the micro-crack is considered. Estimates are made for the number of dislocation generated by changing the applied stress, material constant and length segments of the crack and dislocation. Optimum conditions are found for the maximum number of dislocations generated with reference to the length segment on which dislocations appear. These results are exhibited graphically. Discontinuities of the volume energy densities at the junctions of scaling crossing are caused by segmentation of the scale ranges in the model. This was done to allow the use of equilibrium mechanics in each of three scale ranges, including that of dislocation. Such an idealization is not completely unphysical since the occurrence of micro-cracking ahead of a macro-crack need not be a completely smooth process. The cracking of individual grains ahead of crack is a case in point. The spirit of developing multiscale models is to show that extended scale ranges can be made by connecting the results obtained from components scales. Nevertheless, it is essential to include coupling effects among the scales. This was made possible by using the scale multipliers in addition to the compatibility of the local displacement fields. The ways with which the results are affected by parameters at a higher or lower scale are assessed quantitatively. Restraining or material resistance can respond differently depending on the scale considered. This can be shown by the radial decay character of the volume energy density. © 2007 Springer.

84890222437	Multiscaling in molecular and continuum mechanics: Interaction of time and size from macro to nano: Application to biology, physics, material science, mechanics, structural and processing engineering	The recent trend of miniaturization of devices and mechanics components has demanded a better understanding of how macroscopic data are related to those at the microscopic scale or smaller. The concept of multiscaling is to handle inhomogeneity that arises when material is viewed microscopically. A scale invariant concept that can quantify the degree of inhomogeneity is applied to overcome the difficulty such that the methodology can be kept at a level that the practicing engineer can grasp and use. The model works much like a microscope that can magnify the results from the atomic to the micro, then to the meso and to the macro in an analytical fashion. This provides a means for translating the experience in designing macroscopic size components to those at the lower scales. For the first time, a book is being edited to address how results from one scale can be shifted or related to another scale, say from macro to micro or vice versa. This is accomplished via a meso zone such that the transition from one scale to the next is made smooth by application of the stress and displacement compatibility conditions. Multiscaling is modelled much like a microscope such that the magnification ratio can be changed, except that this is done analytically. The results crossing scales are interactive and shown to be governed by highly non-linear equations in continuum mechanics. This is a new topic that is not well known up to now. The closest field to this topic is Mesomechanics which is also a relatively new field in order to meet the demand of how to treat devices in microns and coatings in nanometers. The disciplines in classical mechanics and physics rarely consider relatingthe results at the different scales such as macro to micro or to atomic. Although many discussions have been alluded to this subject, little progress has been made because of the non-equilibrium nature of the problem when size is made much smaller. The new approach retains the use of the equilibrium mechanics within a scale level such that cross scale results can be connected by scale invariant criteria. In this way the level of presentation can be kept at the level where most engineers can grasp within a short period of time. Engineers in different disciplines should be able to understand and use the results. They include those in physics, chemistry, mechanics, biology, materials science, etc. The topics treated will be of an interdisciplinary character. © 2007 Springer. All rights reserved.

84890251177	Mode II segmented crack model: Macro/skew-symmetry micro/anti-symmetry and dislocation/skew-symmetry	Material non-homogeneity can vary with different degrees of severity depending on the size scale at which the observation is being made. For a polycrystalline material, the state of affairs within a grain can differ widely from those in a cluster of grains. The situation is further complicated by the presence of defects and imperfections which may grow under load while the stress symmetry conditions with reference to the defects in the form of a line or area can also change with size scale. Macro/symmetry for a line defect or crack dominated by applied load may no longer prevail when viewed at the microscopic scale where the material structure can influence the symmetric. In the work to follow, in-plane macro-shear load is considered such that the corresponding macro-stress field would be skew-symmetric with reference to a line defect if the grain size is small in comparison with the continuum element. When the grain structure comes into play, the line defect may no longer be in a state of pure in-plane shear. Micro-normal and micro-shear stresses may both be present on the micro-crack rendering a state of mixed mode micro-crack extension. This effect will be considered in addition to the generation of edge dislocations from the end of a micro-crack. According to the classical theory of dislocations, edge dislocations pertain only to the skew-symmetric stress field. The transitions from mode II macro/ skew-symmetry to mixed mode micro/anti-symmetry and finally to dislocation/skew-symmetry is considered in a line defect model using the continuum mechanics approach while realizing the physical process from macro to atomic is one of non-equilibrium in addition to the effect of material non-homogeneity where the properties of the bulk and those of the local region can differ. Segmentation of the scale range is made to alleviate the use of non-equilibrium behavior, the complexities of which would be beyond the scope of this investigation. Discontinuities of the volume energy densities are thus introduced at the scale crossing junctions. Their severity can be adjusted by the prevailing material and geometric parameters that are also affected by the applied macroscopic load. The presented analytical model is useful for making sensitivity analyses involving the influence of atomic and microscopic effects on the macroscopic behavior. As it is to be expected, the results depend on a combination of load, geometry and material at the different scales. © 2007 Springer.

84891061756	Directional dissimilarity of transitional functions: Volume energy density factor	Scale segmentation of the SI system of measurement has necessitated the use of transitional function for connecting the results of the segmented scales. The state-of-the-art of measurement in the 1800s is reflected by the coarseness of scale segmentation. By up-to-day standard of nanonization, scale refinement is necessary to account for the interactive benefits of multiscaling, the building block of which is dual scaling, say macro-micro or micro-nano. The directional dissimilarity between two adjacent scales, say macro → micro and micro → macro, arises naturally in physical processes. An index Λ is defined to measure the severity of directional dissimilarity that may prevail in the volume energy density factor (VEDF) for macro → micro. A similar index Ω applies to micro → macro. Both A and Ω reflect the combined effects of loading, material and geometry. The macro-micro transition of VEDF

84891588738	Multiscale approach to micro/macro fatigue crack growth in 2024-T3 aluminum panel	When two contacting solid surfaces are tightly closed and invisible to the naked eye, the discontinuity is said to be microscopic regardless of whether its length is short or long. By this definition, it is not sufficient to distinguish the difference between a micro- and macro-crack by using the length parameter. Microcracks in high strength metal alloys have been known to be several centimeters or longer. Considered in this work is a dual scale fatigue crack growth model where the main crack can be micro or macro but there prevails an inherent microscopic tip region that is damaged depending on the irregularities of the microstructure. This region is referred to as the "micro-tip" and can be simulated by a sharp wedge with different angles in addition to mixed boundary conditions. The combination is sufficient to model microscopic entities in the form of voids, inclusions, precipitations, interfaces, in addition to subgrain imperfections, or cluster of dislocations. This is accomplished by using the method of "singularity representation" such that closed form asymptotic solutions can be obtained for the development of fatigue crack growth rate relations with three parameters. They include: (1) the crack surface tightness σ represented by σ

84891590913	From monoscale to multiscale modeling of fatigue crack growth: Stress and energy density factor	The formalism of the earlier fatigue crack growth models is retained to account for multiscaling of the fatigue process that involves the creation of macrocracks from the accumulation of micro damage. The effects of at least two scales, say micro to macro, must be accounted for. The same data can thus be reinterpreted by the invariancy of the transitional stress intensity factors such that the microcracking and macrocracking data would lie on a straight line. The threshold associated with the sigmoid curve disappears. Scale segmentation is shown to be a necessity for addressing multiscale energy dissipative processes such as fatigue and creep. Path independency and energy release rate are monoscale criteria that can lead to unphysical results, violating the first principles. Application of monoscale failure or fracture criteria to nanomaterials is taking toll at the expense of manufacturing super strength and light materials and structural components. This brief view is offered in the spirit of much needed additional research for the reinforcement of materials by creating nanoscale interfaces with sustainable time in service. The step by step consideraton at the different scales may offer a better understanding of the test data and their limitations with reference to space and time. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84898814963	Short and long crack data for fatigue of 2024-T3 Al sheets: Binariness of scale segmentation in space and time	Pedagogically speaking, crack initiation-growth-termination (IGT) belongs to the process of fracture, the modelling of which entails multiscaling in space and time. This applies to loadings that are increased monotonically or repeated cyclically. Short and long crack data are required to describe IGT for scale ranges from nano to macro, segmented by the SI system of measurement. Unless the data at the nano scale can be connected with the macro, IGT remains disintegrated. The diversity of non-homogeneity of the physical properties at the different scale ranges results in non-equilibrium. These effects dubbed as non-equilibrium and non-homogeneous are hidden in the test specimens and must be realized. They can be locked into the reference state of measurement at the mi-ma scale range by application of the transitional functions and transferred to the nano-micro and macro-large scale ranges. The aim of this work is to convert the ordinary crack length data to those referred to as short cracks that are not directly measurable. All test data are material, loading and geometry (MLG) specific. The results obtained for the 2024-T3 aluminium sheets hold only for the MLG tested. The differences are more pronounced for the short cracks. These effects can be revealed by comparing the incremental crack driving force (CDF) for the ma-mi range ΔSmicromacro, the ma-large range ΔSlargemacro and the na-mi range ΔSnanomicro. The CDF is equivalent to the incremental volume energy density factor (VEDF). The incremental mi-ma CDF is found to be 10-10

84898840583	Dual scale fatigue crack monitoring scheme considering random material, geometric and load characteristics	Effectiveness of the existing fracture control methodology depends on the non-destructive evaluation of defects arising from repeated service of structures. Damage detection is by far being automatic since not all defects are dangerous. The correct diagnostics require not only a knowledge of the size of the prevailing defects but also their likely locations of occurrence from the initial design and/or past experience. What is not known is the time when the defects will become critical since the service conditions change as a rule and the material age in time. These inherent variables can affect the accuracy of non-destructive evaluation which in its strict sense implies certain cut-off scale of small defects that are assumed to be not harmful. Material microstructural effects have been known to affect the structural integrity. The obvious implication is multiscaling, the least consideration of which involves the dual scale of micro/macro. Hence, defect monitoring presents over whelming difficulties because of the entanglement of multi-variables. Starting with the basic quantities of the local force and displacement that can be detected from the commercially available transducers, continuous records can be made available for the local compliance C and its time rate history, say dC/dt or dC/dN in fatigue with N being the number of cycles. These data can be stored in microprocessors and made available for analyses. The conversion of the force and displacement records to damage by fatigue crack growth is the challenge of this work. Appeal is made to a dual scale micro/macro fatigue crack growth model that has the capability to delineate micro- And macro-cracking. The model makes use of three parameters μ d and σ. They account for the interaction between the micro/ macro effects in terms of the, respective, relative shear modulus μmicro/μmacro, the micro-tip characteristic length d/do and the crack surface tightness ratio σo/σ∞ that controls the opening of the fatigue crack. These parameters are assumed to vary in a random fashion as the crack size increase with the repetition of loading. Random normal distribution of statistical values of μ, d and σ is investigated for different mean <μ> and standard deviation <σ>. The amount of dispersion around the mean is examined for the crack length a and crack growth rate da/dN in addition to the compliance C and its rate dC/dN. It is demonstrated that randomness of the material microstructure has an effect on the local compliance which will increase with crack growth in a stable fashion and then rises more quickly with the number of cycles. The characteristic is reminiscent of the compliance to crack length relation used for determining the energy release rate in fracture mechanics. The ability to account for micro/macro damage transition is considered to be fundamental for assessing the meaning of the compliance data. Randomness of the material microstructure parameters provides the means for studying the dispersion of the results in terms of fatigue crack growth. The preliminary findings are encouraging and suggest several new directions of research for health monitoring. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

84905970902	Short crack data derived from the fatigue data of 2024-T3 Al with long cracks: Material, load and geometry effects locked-in by transitional functions	The relationship of short and long crack data is analyzed for the fatigue of 2024-T3 aluminum. The micro-macro scale range is selected as the reference state of data measurement. Three transitional functions (TRs) contained in δSmacromicro are used. They correspond to the micro-macro scale portion of the plot of the crack growth rate da/. dN vs the volume energy density (VED) factor increment δSmacromicro. Throughout this work, δ. S is understood to represent the incremental volume energy and not the surface energy. Form-invariance of δSmacromicro using the transitional functions or variables (μ,. σ,. d) justify scale shifting to obtain the corresponding test data for the nano-micro and macro-large scale segments. A straight line relationship is established for finding δSmicronano and δSlargemacro from δSmacromicro. The effects of load, material and geometry are locked into the macro-micro data and transferred to the nano-micro and macro-large data by using a transitionalized crack length (TCL) of the two parameter model. A scaling law for non-equilibrium and non-homogeneous (NENH) is derived without violating the first principles.The micro-macro test data for crack lengths 3-55mm are used to derive short crack data of lengths 0.040-0.043mm.

84905982947	Scalability and homogenization of transitional functions: Effects of non-equilibrium and non-homogeneity	Mono-scale functions refer to the individual scale range of the SI system of measurement. Coarseness of the segmented scale was dictated by state-of-the-art of technology at that time. By to-day's standard, non-equilibrium and non-homogeneity (NENH) are first order considerations whereby scales must be refined to include micro, nano and pico effects. The conventional technology applies to monoscaling, confined to equilibrium and homogeneity (E&M). Their conversion to multiscaling requires the use of transitional functions. The ultra high strength and light weight structural materials rely on the absorption of energy at more than one scale. For considerations are effects at microscopic, nanoscopic and picoscopic scales.The irony is that NENH are subject to eventual homogenization for otherwise the multiscale effects could not be transferred to improve and modify the monoscale rules in practices. To this end, additional Postulate and Corollary are needed to account for scale directionality of energy transfer, prevalent to NENH. Direction-dependency differentiates the transition of macro. →. micro and micro. →. macro. Transitional functions are not the same when they traverse up and down the scale. Homogenization averages out NENH effects such that corrections may be applied to monoscaling.Transitional functions can lock-in the load, material and geometry effects of the macro-micro test data to produce the nano-pico data. This is related to the obtainment of small crack data from large crack test data. To this end, the volume energy density factor (VEDF) or the volume energy density (VED) can be used as the transitional functions as a form-invariant criterion such that multiscale effects can be used to correct and modify monoscale results. When NENH effects are highly localized and cannot be averaged out, the time rate of VEDF and VED or the equivalent of the power energy density must be used.The scalar correction for NENH is derived for the macro-micro cracking of a line crack subject to the combined effects of loading, material and geometry. Two correction factors Λ and Ω are used, one for macro. →. micro and another for micro. →. macro. The outcome can be checked by results for crack length and/or crack growth rate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

10944225958	Volume fraction effect of magnetoelectroelastic composite on enhancement and impediment of crack growth	Uniaxial or multi-axial strength test results are not adequate for the design of composites for they lack of predictive capability in terms of damage that change with load direction and type. The same applies to fracture toughness, a concept that is in general not valid for materials that possess inhomogeneity and anisotropy. Recent findings related to the behavior of crack initiation and growth for piezoelectric materials have further shown that seemingly innocent fracture initiation criterion such as the energy release rate could lead to conclusions contrary to physics. Because of the wide usage of materials with electric and magnetic properties in the electronic industry, it might be premature to assume that material characterization methods established for simple materials and loadings could be extended on an ad hoc basis to multi-functional materials involving the interaction of elastic, electric and magnetic effects as they are damaged by defect initiation and growth, not to mention how these effects would appear to be different at the various scale levels. Assume that the basic constituents of the analytical model is sufficiently small such that continuum mechanics remains valid while the crystal lattice effects may still be reflected by the material parameters of the analytical model. Analyzed in particular is the crack initiation and growth behavior of a line crack in a magnetoelectroelastic composite that is made of BaTiO

10044248661	Dual scaling damage model associated with weak singularity for macroscopic crack possessing a micro/mesoscopic notch tip	Multi-scale damage of material has been a concern in recent times owing to emphases of making devices in sizes smaller and smaller until the bulk average of the macroscopic material properties are no longer adequate while particle physics still lacks the expediency of engineering applications. There is the mesoscopic range between the microscopic and macroscopic size scale where the functional well being of engineering products must be addressed in terms of material damage. By in large, the only successful model developed during the early l960s and used up to now has been that of linear elastic fracture mechanics based on the concept of a single dominant macroscopic crack. There are apparent reasons still not understood why the simple model works so well while the refined theories, non-linear or otherwise, of the past half century or more have made insignificant contributions; they have been a disappointment, to say the least. There are signs to revive the atomistic models that have been attempted previously. The efforts were short lasted mainly because of the inability to connect the results with those at the macroscopic scale. It is not so much of the difference in size scale as the contrasting views of the particulate and continuum, a unsettled debate since the days of Aristotle and earlier. What ever it takes, it does appear that there is a need to extend the size scale of applicability for a given formulation where self-consistency is observed. With this in mind, the weak singularity approach is attempted in this work even for no better reasons other than being more satisfying than the piece meal empirical approach. One of the main objectives of this work is to describe the macroscopic and microscopic material damage ahead of a crack covering three to four orders of magnitudes of size effects in a single formulation that satisfies the continuum mechanics axioms with consistency. This includes the continuity of the crack opening displacements from the macro-scale to the micro-scale. More specifically, a micro-notch tip that can vary in shape and hence singularity prevails at the front of the macro-crack. The macro-to-micro geometric continuity provides not only the interacting effects for two scale levels but also a clue of the conditions under which cross scaling effects should be considered. Micro-crack blunting tends to elevate the macroscopic energy density field following a translational shift of the curves while the same effect at the tends to decrease the microscopic energy density field following a rotational shift of the curves. This behavior is shown to hold for both the symmetric and skew-symmetric loadings. The former refers to in-plane extension and latter to in-plane shear. Hence, the way with which material inhomogeneity affects crack tip behavior is not a simple matter of being close or far away from the site of potential failure. The combined effects of load, geometry and material will all contribute. More specifically, the stress state ahead of the main crack is found to be hydrostatic at the macroscopic scale but no so at the microscopic scale where the x- and y-component of the local normal stresses are not the same. This is because the micro-notch tip shape in this model can change shape. When the applied remote stress is in-plane shear, both the macroscopic and microscopic stress state near the main crack is hydrostatic. This implies that micro-cracking ahead of the main crack is more likely to occur under remote applied shear than remote applied normal stress, a result that has not been found or explained previously by analytical means. Hence, it might be useful for the practitioners to establish some rules of thumb in making decisions. The translational and rotational shifts of the energy density levels caused by different degree of micro-defect blunting can also serve a useful purpose for the development of new materials when considering the shapes of micro-defects in fabrication processes. The present approach of singularity representation emphases the need to put more weight on the influence of defect geometry such that non-linearity of constitutive relations can be relaxed as their emphases seem to have exceeded the contribution they are capable of offering. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

10244222306	Simultaneity of multiscaling for macro-meso-micro damage model represented by strong singularities	The state of affairs near a crack tip is very different when viewed at the different scales, say from the macroscopic to the atomic. These different appearances have intrigued solid state physicists, mechanists and material scientists for decades. Although they are physically connected, it is not obvious what roles would their mathematical relationships play? Investigations associated with scaling in size and time, evolution of material damage, multiscaling of macro-, meso- and micro-mechanics theories are presumably topics that could provide insights to the behavior of the internal structures of matters and their interactions at the different scales. When seeking for analytical models that can address multiscaling, continuum mechanics seems to give way to the particle approach when the scale reduces to that for the atoms. It is also not clear whether the particle and continuum view points should be regarded as separate disciplines for their differences have generated much discussion with little to gain. There is the general feeling that a re-examination of what has been taken for granted may be in order. Based on the comments made earlier, a multiscale crack damage model is developed by duplicating the physics much like the capability of an optical or electronic microscope. The model contains the macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic damage represented by singularities. The results at the different scale levels are connected via stress and displacement compatibility conditions in continuum mechanics and they can switch from one scale to another in a discrete manner where equilibrium is assumed within the range of an arbitrarily defined scale. The sizes involved at the different scales depend on the material, load and geometry and they are determined by solving two highly non-linear equations. Simplicity is gained by using singularities to represent the geometrical discontinuities such as intergranular or transgranular failure. This discussion is limited to a particular group of material damage that can be modelled by the so-called strong singularities as compared to the r
