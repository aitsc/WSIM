84930240665	Distributed resource environment: A cloud-based design knowledge service paradigm	Design can be viewed as a knowledge intensive process, which requires more and more collaboration between design resources within and without an enterprise for product innovation. A company's capacity for product innovation essentially means the ability to discover, use, and manage different kinds of design resources. However, design resources are distributed unevenly within or across organizational boundaries. In order to benefit from the outsourcing of design knowledge within different design resources, with lower costs and within a shorter time, is a great challenge for enterprises. The design knowledge must flow quickly and reliably from when and where it is located to when and where it is needed for design activity. Unfortunately, there are many barriers having a negative influence on quick and reliable knowledge flow between knowledge owners and knowledge demanders. The lack of supporting mechanisms (e.g., a knowledge service platform) between service providers and consumers is one of the barriers. Thus, there is a need to develop mechanisms to overcome the barriers and thereby improve the performance of knowledge flow. This chapter introduces a cloud-based knowledge service environment, i.e., a distributed resource environment, which enables companies to utilize collective open innovation and rapid product development with reduced costs. The definition, function, structure, and characteristics of a distributed resource environment are presented. Then, the concept of a cloud-based knowledge service framework is proposed to organize the knowledge sources in a distributed resource environment. The knowledge sources are composed of design entities' knowledge cloud and resource units' knowledge cloud. The former is the knowledge consumer and latter is the knowledge provider in a distributed resource environment. Next, a cloud-based knowledge service framework is presented for the well effective operation of a distributed resource environment. Two agents, i.e., a knowledge service publishing agent (KSPA) and a knowledge service consuming agent (KSCA) are developed to implement the online knowledge service. KSPA can be used by knowledge providers to encapsulate and publish their design knowledge as a service into the service market, whereas KSCA can be used by knowledge consumers to request knowledge service from the service market. Finally, an inner-enterprise distributed resource environment is implemented to verify the proposed knowledge service paradigm.

15844398638	Publishing and discovering knowledge services for design on UDDI	A precondition for internet-based collaborative design under an environment of distributed intelligent resources is that knowledge service providers can publish their own services globally, and knowledge service requesters can conveniently and accurately discover the units, which can provide matched services via the internet. The widely supported specification of Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) gives a considerable capability to publish and discover services via the internet. The paper introduces a conceptual framework and proposes a lifecycle model of publishing and discovering the intelligent resource units and matched services with UDDI. A project for improving the bearing system design of a turbo-expander is presented as a case study. The project deals with changing the traditional sliding bearings with active magnetic bearings. Technologies of different areas are involved in design and many resource units in prominent universities in China join the collaborative activities. The publication of knowledge services and discovery of knowledge services are implemented on a private UDDI registry operated by the Internet-Based Collaborative Research Center on Modern Design and Manufacturing.

21444451123	Influence of cylinder liner out-of-roundness on dynamic lubrication and friction characteristics of piston	The pressure fields and friction forces at the skirt of the piston were analyzed by using relevant mathematic models based on hydrodynamic lubrication theory and piston dynamics. Thus the transverse movement of the piston was analyzed and the pressure field and friction forces at the skirts of the piston were calculated by taking into account the out-of-roundness of the cylinder liner produced in the running of the gasoline engine. The results indicated that the peak value of the pressure field of the oil film decreased and the friction forces at the piston skirt increased after considering the out-of-roundness of the cylinder liner. The larger the degree of the out-of-roundness of the cylinder liner, the larger the increments of the friction force and friction power consumption. Thus it was imperative to take into account the effect of the cylinder liner out-of-roundness on the lubrication and friction characteristics of the piston skirt in the design of the piston.

2442653100	Coupling effect between dynamic behavior and lubricating behavior of cylinder-piston system in internal combustion engine	A model was established to analyze the coupling effect between the dynamic behavior and the lubricating behavior of the cylinder-piston system in an internal-combustion engine. Software ANSYS and FORTRAN program were combined to carry out the numerical simulation of the model. Thus the finite element method model of the cylinder was established and its transient dynamic response was computed with the ANSYS software. The lubrication of the cylinder-piston pair was simulated with an average Reynolds equation considering the second-vibration of the piston. The time-dependent minimum film thickness, friction force and friction power loss were calculated by making use of the sequential field-coupling analysis. It was found that the coupling action between the lubricating behavior and the dynamic behavior of the cylinder-piston system had significant effects on the lubricating characteristics as compared with the analytical results excluding the vibration of the cylinder. Namely, in consideration of the cylinder vibration, the cylinder-piston system registered larger friction force, friction power loss and oil film thickness variation.

2542610658	Shakedown analysis of rolling contact surface with short-wavelength corrugation	The contact of a rail-wheel was analyzed by making use of three-dimensional elasto-plastic finite element method, with respect to the short wavelength corrugation on the wheel/rail contact surface. The plastic deformation process on the contact surface of the rail in the presence of high frequency force was analyzed based on the calculating results. It was shown that the rail contact surface experienced hardening and plastic deformation in the repetitive rolling of the high frequency force under certain conditions, which led to short wavelength strain and corrugation of the rail. The plastic deformation and shakedown limit of the rail were related to the sleeper distance and the friction coefficient, which was attributed to the kinematic hardening of the rail material. The yielding of the rail material occurred at some spot of the sub-surface when the friction coefficient was below 0.3, while it occurred on the contact surface when the friction coefficient was above 0.3, and in the latter case the rail material would fail faster than in the former case.

2942700242	Case-based conceptual design	The current method of case-based design (CBD) can be well practiced for configuration design in which design experience knowledge is involved. However, since the design case is confined to a certain application domain, it is difficult for CBD to be applied to conceptual design process that develops concepts to meet design specifications. A function factor description space is erected to provide an exhibition room for all functions of design cases. The approach for identifying the space state of function factor in description space is proposed, including the determination of the similarities between function factors of design case. A general object-oriented representation for design case is presented by bringing the class of function and in-out flow into the current case representation. A example for electro-pet design that illustrates the implementation of the method for case-based conceptual design based on distributed design case repositories is described.

34547115944	Tribological behaviors of spot-textured TiN coatings on M2 high-speed steel under boundary lubricated conditions	Abstract: The effect of sliding duration on the tribological behaviors of spot patterned coatings was investigated. Two patterns based on physical vapor deposition (PVD) TiN coatings were used, such as, in-lined (IN) and staggered (ST) spots. The tribological behaviors were evaluated by using a Cameron-Plint wear test rig. The M2 steel discs deposited TiN coatings with IN and ST patterns slid against the ASSAB 17 tool steel pins at a speed of 0.23 m/s, in Shell Tellus T32 lubricant and were loaded with 900 N. The testing results on disc specimens with two types of PVD TiN spot patterns, ail coated with a bias voltage of -180 V and slid for 4, 8 and 11 h respectively, were presented. The results revealed that the in-lined coatings possessed relatively better wear behaviors than the staggered pattern coatings. Mechanisms for such superiority and for the cause of peeling were discussed. A relevant design approach was suggested for the application of such patterned coatings. © 2007 University of Science and Technology Beijing.

37349018673	Some basic concepts in modern design theory	In the long march of development of design theories, many terms have been coined for explaining their new ideas. Some times one term is used by different authors with different definitions or different means, say concepts. Other times different terms are used by different authors with the same mean or concept. It is rational and necessary for the modern design theory in the way of its growth to examine the definitions, means and concepts of all these terms. In considering the character of global economy and the change in manufacturing, some new definitions, means and concepts have been given to the terms for working with the theory and related methodology, and form a base of the development of the theory. The purpose of the paper is to summarize existed results and call further study on the definitions, means and concepts of such terms to match the state-of-the-art requirements. Insufficient in precision use of a term will occasionally lead to a different result in theoretical research. The concepts of performance, function, quality, constrain, requirements, features, requirement driving, state etc. studied and used previously in the modern design theory are collected and discussed.

33644946859	Analysis on friction mechanism of superposition of end gap of piston ring in internal combustion engine	The deflection of crankpin and reciprocating rotation of piston were calculated according to the mathematic model based on the torque transmission theory of crankshaft. The discriminant of synchronous rotation of piston ring with piston was put forward. Moreover, the analytical model about the opposite rotation of the piston ring was established, by taking into account various forces including combustion gas pressure, liquid friction, and reciprocating inertia force, and various moments including rotational friction, rotational inertia, and gas friction moment. It was found that the positive and negative deflections of the crankpin resulted in the reciprocating rotation of the piston in the IC engine work cycles. The peak values of the deflection and rotation were near to the crank angle position in deflagration. Because the clingy moment of the compression ring was less than the rotational resistance moment in a few section of the crank angle, it was unable for the ring to keep synchronism with the piston and hence rotated opposite to the piston. Rotation angle of the second compression ring was larger than that of the first ring. The superposition of the end gaps of the two compression rings occurred when they turned to the same angle position.

84877304387	Knowledge flow rules of modern design under distributed resource environment	The process of modern design under the distributed resource environment is interpreted as the process of knowledge flow and integration. As the acquisition of new knowledge strongly depends on resources, knowledge flow can be influenced by technical, economic, and social relation factors, and so forth. In order to achieve greater efficiency of knowledge flow and make the product more competitive, the root causes of the above factors should be acquired first. In this paper, the authors attempt to reveal the nature of design knowledge flow from the perspectives of fluid dynamics and energy. The knowledge field effect and knowledge agglomeration effect are analyzed, respectively, in which the knowledge field effect model considering single task node and the single knowledge energy model in the knowledge flow are established, then the general expression of knowledge energy conservation with consideration of the kinetic energy and potential energy of knowledge is built. Then, the knowledge flow rules and their influential factors including complete transfer and incomplete transfer of design knowledge are studied. Finally, the coupling knowledge flows in the knowledge service platform for modern design are analyzed to certify the feasibility of the research work. © 2013 Junning Li et al.

84887579945	Thermoelastohydrodynamic behavior of misaligned plain journal bearings	Under severe operating conditions, the thermal effects and various deformations play an important role in determining the performance of misaligned plain journal bearings. However, the thermal effects and various deformations are rarely considered simultaneously in most studies on the misaligned plain journal bearings. In this article, a comprehensive thermoelastohydrodynamic model of the misaligned plain journal bearings is developed that involves the synthetic solution of the generalized Reynolds equation, three-dimensional energy equation, and heat conduction equations of the solids. Based on this model, series of simulation results are provided to examine the influence of the thermal effects and deformations on the behavior of the misaligned plain journal bearings. In addition, the comparisons between the thermohydrodynamic and complete thermoelastohydrodynamic model are also presented for different misalignment angle and magnitude. Results show that the thermal effects and various deformations should not be ignored because of their significant influence on the film thickness, film pressure as well as other bearings characteristics. © 2013 IMechE.

42549158004	Study on tribological properties of pseudoelastic Ti-Ni alloys with laser surface micro-convexes	Micro-convexes on Ti-Ni shape memory alloy surface were produced with laser. Their tribological properties were evaluated with a pin-on-disc tester under various loads and velocities. The results show that surface convexes can reduce the friction coefficient obviously under lubricated conditions. The top amount of friction coefficient reduction rate is up to 44.6% on the disc with low surface convex density while the initial contact pressure is 0.21 MPa and the velocity is 0.25 m/s. The anti-wear property of the discs with convexes is better than that without convexes. The anti-wear property of the disc with high surface convex density is the best in all convex discs. The grooves surrounding the convexes can trap debris and be beneficial to control surface ploughs and improve wear resistance.

The round bearing was made of 45# steel with babbitt alloy bushing and the bearing journal was made of 45# steel. High stress of the water content of 0%, 1%,3% in lubricant, 10 times of a normal load of 2200 N, and the rotating speeds at 500, 1000, 2000 rpm were adopted in accelerated experiment. A quantitative index of particle coverage area (IPCA) together with wear debris ferro-image was used to characterize wear degree and wear mechanisms. Three wear stages with corresponding wear debris ferro-images were identified from IPCA variations characterized by bathtub curve trend. The first one was running-in stage characterized by the highest wear debris producing rate and higher large debris content. The second one was normal wear stage characterized by the lowest wear debris producing rate and small normal debris. The final one was failure initiation stage characterized by higher wear debris producing rate and higher large debris content. The corresponding dominant wear mechanisms were micro-ploughing and micro-cutting induced by rough initial surfaces in the running-in stage, local rub due to vibration in the normal stage, and fatigue and abrasive wear in the failure initiation stage. © 2008 Trans Tech Publications.

66549086827	Analysis of piston secondary motion considering the variation in the system inertia	The secondary motion of a piston has a significant impact on the performance and reliability of an internal combustion engine. However, the variation in the system inertia, namely the variable inertia of the piston-connecting-rod-crankshaft mechanism due to the change in their positions relative to the crankshaft axis, has been neglected in most studies on piston secondary motion. A novel mathematical model is developed for piston-connecting-rod-crankshaft dynamics by taking the variation in the system inertia into consideration. Then a coupling model of the piston secondary dynamics and the fluid dynamic lubrication is built. The simulations show that the variation in the system inertia influences the piston secondary motion and piston side force, and that the piston side force plays an important role in determining the piston lateral motion. Results also show that the engine speed and the centre-of-mass (COM) positions of the connecting rod have considerable effect on the piston secondary motion. The analysis of the COM positions can be employed to optimize the design of the connecting rod. © IMechE 2009.

The first was that the design entity should be able to conduct decomposition, integration of design tasks and be able to evaluate the knowledge service. The second was that there should be many hierarchical resource units, especially the applicable resource units which could assume massive design tasks. The third was that there should be an agency to support the search of resource units and the implementation of knowledge service. Analysis results demonstrated that if knowledge service environment was perfect, there would be strong design chain resulting from competitive selections. And this would ensure the smooth product development whenever the knowledge service environment was available.

70349118099	System parameters identifying and performance predicting of ICEs combining multidisciplinary model with system responding data	For complex equipments, the phenomena of system declining such as wear and fatigue often takes place and spreads after a period of running. So it is important to identify the interior structural change of system during maintenance to avoid the system to be broken abruptly. Traditionally there are two methods to analyze and predict the structural change of system. One is from the monitoring data of equipments. Another is from the mechanism of structural changing and the interior working process of equipments. In this paper a combining method, which combining the advantages of the above two methods, is used to identify the structural change of internal combustion engines. The principle of the method is to firstly build an analytical system model, in which the system parameters stand for the structural parameters or constraints. Then the current value of system parameters in the model can be identified by comparing the calculating responding results and the detected responding data. From the varying of system parameters the structural change of system can be deduced. For internal combustion engines (ICEs), the most important CPSR (combustion Chamber-Piston-cylinder Sleeve-piston Rings) system is taken as the research object. A multidisciplinary model is built to simulate the interior working processes, especially the combustion process, the structural dynamics process, the tribology process and the coupling processes among them. Then the seeking-roots method (SRM) is used to identify the value of system parameters. A case study on a low power gasoline engine verifies the above method. In the case study, the blow by gap, which stands for the wear of piston rings and cylinder sleeve, is identified with the detected combustion pressure. The case study shows that the method of this paper can identify the structural change of complex equipments. It can provide accurate information for equipments maintenance as well as the residual life prediction. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.

70349150940	Knowledge flow in product design	Product design (PD) is viewed as a knowledge-based, socially mediated, technical activity, and knowledge represents the critical resource in the PD. As knowledge is action enabled, knowledge flows can improve product performance. However, Knowledge flow (KF) has been defined and developed in the organization domain. Unfortunately, the knowledge management field does not have the benefit of strong theory on knowledge flows to inform the enhancement of Knowledge flows to enable and support PD. This paper presents the definition of KF in the domain of PD and analyzes types of KF. The key elements of KF have been introduced respectively and the four types of KF in a distributed resource environment (DRE) are presented and analyzed.

70349159531	Product modern design platform to support product development in distributed resource environment	The manufacturers are competing against each other based on their development ability. A manufacturer who wants to do better than others must emphasize its ability of product development. The resources that product development relies on are more distributed than ever along with the varying of the global design environment. So more and more resources outside of enterprises are needed during the product design process. The platform supporting the product modern design under the circumstance of distributed resources will meet the requirement of the enterprise's product design and development under such conditions. The platform will aslo simplify the implementation on the integral of the IT support system for design resources outside of enterprises. In this paper the characteristics and supporting technologies of product design platform, which supporting the distributed design resource circumstance and centering on the enterprise, are studied. The building method of the platform is presented and a prototype of the product design platform is developed. Three subsystems are included in the platform. They are the product requirements analysis system, the product design planning system and the knowledge management system. Many design tasks can be supported on the platform, such as product requirement analysis, concept design, detail design, experiment, and maintenance knowledge acquirement. The distributing, implementing, tracking and managing of product lifecycle tasks can also be supported on the platform. The distributed design resources could be sealed as application components to provide design services. Design work flow model and knowledge flow model are built and controlled through the FIPER software. The design knowledge is managed based on the ontology theory. The virtual prototype of a complex product can be built and run more easily with the design platform. The process of building a virtual prototype could be described simply as following. Firstly the distributed models are sealed as application components. Then the components are published in the FIPER environment. Finally, the virtual prototype is built in the form of design work flow model in which the distributed components are integrated. To simulate the coupling of multi-discipline behaviors in a complex product design, the coupling formula is proposed to express the relations of different discipline behaviors. Based on the coupling formula, the coupling simulation can be run on the platform. Finally, a lifecycle performance prototype of an internal combustion engine is developed through the platform to verify the platform's functions. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.

The first situation was the variation of valve clearance resulting from the wear and distortion of the distribution mechanism. The second situation was the variation of blow by clearance results from the wear of cylinder liner-piston assembly. It was shown from the simulation that the engine performance declined markedly in the two wear situations. Therefore, proper tribological measurements should be adopted to prolong the no-failure lifetime of key parts at design stage.

72449159239	Time-varying performance prediction and system identification of internal combustion engines	Design for life-time performance and proper maintenance measures are usually needed to prolong the mean-time-between-failures of complex equipments such as internal combustion engines. To reach this, it is important to obtain the information of time-varying system performance in design stage and to identify the structural change at each moment. So a multidisciplinary model based method is studied in this paper to unify the time-varying performance (TVP) prediction and system identification (SI) of equipments. The related multidisciplinary model in this paper should be not only precise to give simulation results but also sensitive to the variation of system parameters. So the varying history of system performance along with the structural change can be obtained from the model. Then the value of system parameters can be identified by seeking roots with given detected responding data and relationship between system responding data and system parameters. A case study on a low power gasoline engine shows that the method presented in this paper can provide useful information for the development and maintenance of complex equipments. Copyright.

77049124809	Methodology of designing for time-varying performance of complex products	The methodology of designing for time-varying performance of products is analyzed to overcome the system degradation of products during running. For complex mechanical products, the following three key problems are presented to be solved. First, a benchmark of working condition or system degradation process should be set up to evaluate time-varying performance of different design schemes. Second, the coupling among different disciplines should be analyzed to simulate the transient system behaviors of products. Third, the degradation process of system structure and performance should be predicted and analyzed to provide information for the design decision. The case study on the internal combustion engine demonstrates that the system wear or other system degradation phenomena influence the system performance obviously. So the key factors related with performance should be found out and optimized on the basis of system time-varying performance degradation analysis. The research indicates that the time-varying performance is vital to complex products and the methodology presented in this paper will lay a foundation for improving the time-varying performance of products. ©2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

77949893750	On the system theory and modeling of tribo-systems	System thinking has arisen since the early stage of tribology study. No significant development in the overall theory of tribology results no significant development in the system theory and modeling of tribo-systems. Based on the three axioms of tribology and by integrating the general system theory with engineering system analysis, the function and the composition of tribo-systems are investigated. It is concluded that tribo-systems provide for moving systems a motion guarantee function which keeps all components in a moving system with definite relative motions. The function is implemented by all tribo-pairs in the system together with several sub-systems to support tribo-pairs working reliably. Therefore tribo-systems are the sub-systems of moving systems abstracted from which for investigating tribology behaviors therein. The motion guarantee function determines that there must be parameters concerning with motions of components in the system state parameter sets and these parameters are very important for tribology study. The structure of tribo-systems is on history depending and with state variation following. Therefore tribo-systems are time-variable and non-linear. Fortunately such two kinds of variations are with different time scales, of very long period and of very short period in comparison with the former. It founds a theoretical base to establish an algorithm of piecewise stationarized and piecewise linearized with different time scales. Most simplifications taken previously in structure modeling to avoid unintegrable can then be considered. Many factors simplified before are important and cannot be ignored for tribo-systems. Simultaneously the behaviors of different disciplines can then be coupled and applied together on the tribo-system through a history depending and state following structure as well in modeling. A tribo-system including cylinder liner-piston skirt pair, conrod big and small head bearings and crank shaft bearings of IC engines is given as a computational example.

77950130223	A new on-line visual ferrograph	An on-line visual ferrograph (OLVF) characterized by direct reading and on-line analysis was developed based on magnetic deposition and image analysis. A digital sensor was integrated with a CMOS image sensor to obtain images of deposited wear debris under illumination conditions. An electromagnetic instrument was designed to deposit the wear debris flowing through an oil flow channel. The oil flow channel, fixed on the electromagnet, was arranged parallel to the magnetic flux in the air gap between two electromagnet poles. The deposition effect on wear debris was analyzed theoretically. The result shows that the wear debris in different sizes can be deposited in the same zone by controlling the oil flow rate and magnet field intensity. Corresponding application software for image sampling and processing was developed. An index of relative wear debris concentration, IPCA (Index of Particle Coverage Area), is given as an output in addition to wear debris images. Finally, two kinds of experiments were specified to assess the effect and validity of the OLVF. The results show that the OLVF has effective deposition and identification for both relatively large and small wear debris with rational control parameters. The validity examinations with the commercial particle quantifier (PQ) and direct reading ferrograph (DR) show that the OLVF has an approaching trend to the reference instruments in both heavily and lightly contaminated oil. © Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers.

The variations of the engine speed, the piston secondary motion and piston skirt friction loss in the startup were simulated. The piston lateral motion and the piston skirt friction force in the startup and in the steady-state were analyzed. Results showed that the model can be applied to transient study the piston secondary motion and the piston skirt tirbological behavior.

77952864997	A numerical simulation of the coupling between dynamic behavior and tribological behavior in cylinder-piston system in IC engine	A mathematical model for cylinder-piston system considering the coupling between dynamic behavior and tribological behavior is presented in this paper. The three-dimensional finite element method is used to compute the engine block vibrations. The lubrication of cylinder-piston pair was described by an average Reynolds equation considering the piston second-vibration and asperity contact of rough surface. The corresponding computing program developed can be used to calculate the engine block vibrations, the entire piston trajectory, the Piston slap forces, friction forces and oil film thickness etc. as functions of crank angle under engine running conditions. The numerical simulation results show that the coupling between engine block dynamical behavior and lubrication has big influence for the secondary motion of piston and the engine block vibration in cylinder-piston system. It is essential to consider the engine block vibration in the analysis of cylinder-piston tribology. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.

78650598797	Engine wear monitoring with OLVF	In this article, an on-line visual ferrograph (OLVF) was used to monitor the wear condition of a vehicle engine during a bench test. A quantitative index of particle coverage area (IPCA) and wear debris ferro-image were obtained via OLVF to characterize wear degrees. On-line ferrograph analysis indicated some problems with the engine from about the 17th hour. A linear threshold value method to identify running condition of engines with the OLVF data was proposed. The OLVF data were in a fault zone after running for 25 h, when a base bolt broke and the engine stopped working during the test. The engine was disassembled and inspected after the test. Several wear scars were found on the cylinder walls as well as on the bearing surfaces. The oil was added at the 26th and 55th hours, which was also reflected by the variation of IPCA. Moreover, several off-line analyses were carried out in parallel. Off-line ferrograph data did not give any information about the abnormality and only showed stable wear debris content. Spectrometric oil analysis showed that there was no significant change in contents of metal elements. © Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers.

78651423608	Wear characterization by an on-line ferrograph image	Wear characterization with ferrography is an effective off-line method for monitoring a machine's wear condition. The new challenge of real-time wear reporting appeared in condition-based maintenances. Newly developed on-line technologies focus on wear debris concentration rather than on ferrograph images. However, wear rate and wear mechanism are two necessary aspects in describing the wear condition. An on-line ferrograph image provided by an on-line visual ferrograph sensor gives a new solution. By analysing the features of an on-line ferrograph image, new wear characterization with rapid and statistical analysis was investigated for on-line wear reporting. The focus of this method is wear debris chains rather than single wear debris as focused on in traditional ferrography. First, an on-line ferrograph image is preprocessed into a binary image with improved quality. Then the binary image is transformed into a projection curve by parallel radon transformation. The low-frequency component characterizing wear debris chains is extracted from the projection curve by wavelet transformation, which shifts the focus on wear debris chains other than single wear debris. Spectrum analysis is performed to extract the wear characteristics from the low-frequency component of the projection curve. As the main result, two statistical indexes are constructed, as value of point to point and equivalent diameter of larger wear debris, representing the statistical wear debris concentration and the equivalent diameter of larger wear debris, respectively. The indexes correspond qualitatively to wear rate and wear mechanism, respectively. The method was further examined with on-line images from the bench tests of the Eaton engine and the gear reducer of the mine scraper conveyor. The results show that the indexes are effective and independent in describing wear condition, which are promising prospects for on-line wear monitoring with ferrography.

The common features of integrated design in distributed resources environment are summarized as follows: centering on specific design requirements, organizing related design resources to perform design activities, outputting design results, carrying on value analysis of design results, and then making design decisions on the basis of value analysis. Based on the common features, a structural model of integrated design activities in distributed resources environment is built, which presents the structural expression of knowledge flow by defining the design requirements, the design resource input, the result output, the design activities, the relationship between the design activities, and the values of the design activities. Design activities at different levels are defined according to the design process models at different levels. A design activity that has been defined can be packaged into design components.

80052128017	A general knowledge-based framework for conceptual design of multi-disciplinary systems	Designers are encouraged to explore in wide multi-disciplinary solution spaces for finding novel and optimal principle solutions during conceptual design. However, as cultivated in limited disciplines, they often don't have sufficient multidisciplinary knowledge for fulfilling such tasks. A viable solution to this issue is to develop an automated conceptual design system so that knowledge from various disciplines can be automatically synthesized together. Since conceptual design is often achieved through reusing and synthesizing known principle solutions, this paper proposes a knowledge-based framework for achieving automated conceptual design of multi-disciplinary systems, which comprises three primary parts, i.e. a flexible constraint-based approach for representing desired functions, a situation-free approach for modeling functional knowledge of known principle solutions, and an agent-based approach for synthesizing known principle solutions for desired functions. A design case demonstrates that the proposed framework can effectively achieve automated conceptual design of multi-disciplinary systems. Therefore, designers can then be automatically guided to explore in multi-disciplinary solution spaces during conceptual design.

80054792150	Numerical study of piston skirt-liner elastohydrodynamic lubrication and contact by the multigrid method	The cylinder liner-piston system of internal combustion engines is one of the key friction pairs running at the most rigor working conditions. Under the influence of elastohydrodynamic lubrication and contact between the piston skirt and the liner, the dynamic process of piston is a nonlinear and stiff problem difficult to be analyzed accurately and easily. To reach a stable and rapid convergence in analysis, the MEBDF method and the multigrid method are used to solve the piston-skirt elastohydrodynamic lubrication and contact problem. Firstly the solving process of the piston dynamics is analyzed based on the MEBDF method. Then the residual equations for the elastohydrodynamic lubrication pressure are built based on the multigrid method. And the solving method of the nonlinear residual equations is presented based on the quasi Newton-Raphson method. Finally the numerical simulation program is developed based on the MEBDF method and the multigrid method. The elastohydrodynamic lubrication and contact problem of the piston skirt-liner system is simply analyzed based on the simulation. The study in this paper can provide an effective method for tribological analysis and optimization of piston-liner system in the future. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.

84862626515	Understanding and representing functions for conceptual design	As a fundamental concept, function plays a crucial role in engineering design. Particularly, a formal functional representation methodology is indispensable for intelligent CAD (computer aided design) systems to reason about functions in a free way. This paper surveys various functional definitions systematically, resulting in the identification of the drawbacks of current understandings about function. A comprehensive functional definition is then given, based on which, functions are then classified as object-focused ones, process-focused ones and relation-focused ones. A formal functional representation methodology, composed of multiple approaches, is then presented to represent these kinds of functions. Cases demonstrate that the proposed approach can represent functions in an ontological way and is therefore convenient for computers to manipulate the functional information.

However, partial shape description and retrieval may be used more frequently in the fields of product design and manufacture. In order to resolve the problem that the retrieval efficiency for complex model descriptors is low, a CAD model retrieval method based on local surface region decomposition is presented in this paper. First, according to the salient geometric features of the mechanical part, the surface boundary of a solid model is divided into local convex, concave and planar regions. Then, we give a kind of region codes that describe the surface regions and their links in the CAD model. Finally, the model retrievals are realized based on the similarity measurement between two models' region codes. Experimental results have shown that this approach is able to support partial retrieval of CAD models. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84880521559	Effects of the connecting-rod-related design parameters on the piston dynamics and the skirt-liner lubrication	With the development of high-performance and high-speed engines, the effects that the connecting-rod-related design parameters have on the performance of the piston-liner system have become more important. Based on a new model of the piston dynamics presented by the present authors, the effects of the connecting-rod-related parameters on the side force, the oil-film thickness, the frictional force, and the piston dynamics are investigated. The results show that the changes in the extra transverse force and the piston's secondary motion are the main reasons for the different performances of the system. When the mass and the rotational inertia of the connecting rod are decreased, the extra transverse force is significantly reduced. When the location of the center of mass of the connecting rod is changed, the extra transverse force obviously changes in amplitude and trend. When the length of the connecting rod is increased, the amplitude of the extra transverse force increases during the upper half-stroke near the top dead center and decreases during the bottom half-stroke near the bottom dead center. Because of these changes in the connecting rod, the change in the extra transverse force leads to different behaviors of the side force, the minimum oil-film thickness, and the piston's secondary motion. However, changing the connection position of the connecting rod to the piston gives rise to very different behaviors of the piston's secondary motion, and the change in the piston's secondary motion generates significant differences in the minimum oil-film thickness. This study shows that the connecting-rod-related parameters are significant to the performance of the piston-liner system. © IMechE 2013.

First, we attempt to clarify the concept of behavior, which is closely related to function and is also shown as an ambiguous concept in engineering. Second, the concept of action is imported from scientific ontology into design science. Third, a scientific ontology based concept of function is proposed, together with an ontology-based functional taxonomy. A case of a function definition of a civil aircraft type demonstrates that the proposed concept of function is more explicit and precise than previous ones, and it can lead to better functional design results.

84883658113	A part affordance-based approach for capturing detailed design knowledge	Design knowledge reuse is widely accepted as an effective strategy for designers to develop robust artifacts with less time and lower cost. However, there has been very little research on how to help designers capture detailed design knowledge for reuse. As a result, most detailed design knowledge still has to remain in designers' memories as tacit knowledge, which can easily get lost due to oblivion or the mobility of designers. Therefore, this paper attempts to develop a part affordance-based approach for externalizing and capturing detailed design knowledge for effective reuse. It first introduces a part model for representing the detailed design-related information. Based on the relational theory for design, the concept, part affordance, is then employed to help designers externalize and capture various lifecycle factors that are implicit in a detailed design. Based on the affordance constraint axiom, a systematic approach is then proposed for deriving tacit design knowledge from captured part affordances through the analysis of extreme working situations. The proposed approach has been implemented as the Design Knowledge-Capturing System (DKCS). A fixture design case has been employed to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to identify those cultural barriers to knowledge flow in the design process of SMEs. Interviews with and questionnaires to designers from different SMEs were conducted. Empirical studies show that designers hesitate to share their knowledge; lack of trust and the thick wall among functional departments are major barriers influencing effective knowledge flows in the product design process.

84886903864	A novel semi-heuristic planning approach for automated conceptual design synthesis	Automated conceptual design often shows significant promise for generating conceptual solutions automatically through searching and synthesizing known principle solutions for a desired function. However, existing automated conceptual design systems lack an efficient heuristic search strategy and a knowledge-based planning mechanism, which lead to less chance of finding promising principle solutions within a limited time. This article proposes a novel semi-heuristic planning approach for automated conceptual design which comprises two successive steps, i.e. DESIGN PLAN and DESIGN COMBINATION. During the stage of DESIGN PLAN, the planning-graph technique is employed to extract a design plan from a planning graph, which is composed of various principle solution clusters. Under the guidance of the design plan, in the second stage, DESIGN COMBINATION combines compatible principle solutions from the principle solution clusters in the design plan until finding promising conceptual solutions. A prototype system and design case illustrate that the proposed semi-heuristic planning approach can successfully achieve an automated conceptual design synthesis. © IMechE 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

84888262150	Thermoelastohydrodynamic lubrication analysis of misaligned plain journal bearings	By the synthetic solution of the generalized Reynolds equation, three-dimension energy equation, and heat conduction equations and deformations of the solids, this paper developed the thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) model of misaligned plain journal bearing (MPJB). On the basis, series of results were provided to examine the effects of elastic and thermal deformations on the performance of the MPJB. The results show that the elastic and thermal deformations have remarkable influence on the performance of the MPJB. The elastic deformation leads to the creation of the local "pocket" in the oil film thickness. Under this condition, the maximum oil film pressure decreases significantly. The thermal deformation gives rise to the emergence of the local "bowl" in the oil film thickness. Therefore, the minimum oil film thickness increases obviously. However, the influence of the thermal deformation on the maximum oil film pressure is very small. All properties of the bearing vary significantly for the complete TEHD simulation, thus, it is essential to develop the TEHD model for analyzing the bearing performance.

84891916871	Prediction of wear in revolute clearance joints in flexible multibody systems	By integrating wear prediction with flexible multibody dynamics, the wear at the revolute clearance joint in flexible mechanical systems was predicted. The flexible component was modeled based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF), and the contact force in the clearance joint was calculated using continuous contact force model. An iterative wear prediction procedure based on Archad's wear model was employed. In order to determine wear coefficient, pin-on-disc experiments were performed, and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) technique was introduced to deal with tests data to obtain the wear coefficient at different contact conditions. Finally, a planar slider-crank mechanism with clearance joint was used to perform numerical simulations. The results show that after taking components' flexibility into account, the impact value in the clearance joint was much lower than that in the case without considering such factor, and the wear result predicted was also slightly reduced. Moreover, this difference was more pronounced when the simulation time was longer.

The core of this method was achieved the geometries involved in assembly shared by the similar components'models and set criteria by them. The assembling geometries were found by traversing the models, and then the datums were added by them automatically. After that, the added datum was unified naming by traversing the feature tree of the model. Then, the automatic assembly of models was realized using the added datums. Meanwhile, took two gears with different processes of modeling and different structures as an example, the definition principle and process of assembly datum were studied. The features of six similar components in the single-stagecylindrical gear reducer were analyzed, and the corresponding programs were developed to accomplish the automatic definition of datum of the components in the single-stage cylindrical gear reducer and then they were assembled automatically. The result showed that the automatic definition of the datum could be completed effectively, without the limited of the modeling process and non-main structures.

84894035277	A multi-agent-based approach for conceptual design synthesis of multi-disciplinary systems	It is encouraged that designers should explore in wide multi-disciplinary solution spaces for finding novel and promising principle solutions to desired functions during conceptual design. However, due to lack of sufficient multi-disciplinary knowledge, it is often difficult for human designers to explore in wide multi-disciplinary solution spaces. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-agent-based approach for assisting designers in achieving multi-disciplinary conceptual design synthesis. The roles of different kinds of designing agents are identified, and the collaborative mechanisms among these agents are also elaborated. The conceptual design test case of a solar toy demonstrates that the proposed multi-agent-based design synthesis approach, compared with our previous approach, can achieve higher efficiency and better robustness through collaborative conceptual design synthesis. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

84900467028	Single asperity contact and its use for fractal surface contact	This work first presents an elastic-plastic contact model of single hemisphere asperity with a rigid smooth flat based on the finite element method. The material of the deformable asperity was modeled as elastic-perfectly plastic, 9 kinds of materials were covered in this work to account for effects of material properties on the asperity deformation. Based on the results of finite element analysis, new empirical formulations with the consideration of material properties were proposed to predict the dependence of contact area, contact pressure and contact load on contact interference. Four regimes of asperity deformation as well as the transition points between them were also clearly reported. Then, the contact model of single hemisphere asperity was extended to three-dimensional rough surfaces to develop the elastic-plastic contact model of contacting surfaces using fractal theory. A new general contact stiffness model was also proposed to study the normal stiffness between rough surfaces. Numerical results of the presented models were validated by experimental data and those of other existing models. The effects of fractal dimension, roughness parameter and yield strength on contact behaviors of contacting surfaces were also be investigated.

84903558217	Effects of thermal boundary conditions on thermohydrodynamic lubrication analysis of plain journal bearing	A THD model of plain journal bearings was proposed herein. This model involved the synthetic solution of the generalized Reynolds equation, three-dimensional energy equation, and heat conduction equations of the solids. On the basis of that, series of results were provided to examine the effects of thermal boundary conditions. The results show the thermal boundary conditions have considerable effects on the THD analysis of plain journal bearings. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the thermal boundary conditions according to the actual operating conditions, so as to obtain reliable calculating results.

84904633230	Numerical study of parametric effects on joint wear in the flexible multibody systems with different flexibilities and clearance sizes	This paper proposes a numerical approach for the modeling and prediction of wear at revolute clearance joint in flexible multibody mechanical systems by integrating the procedures of wear prediction with multibody dynamics. In the approach, the flexible component was modeled by using absolute nodal coordinate formulation-based element, while the rigid component was described by employing the natural coordinate formulation. The clearance joint was modeled as a dry contact pair, in which the continuous contact force model proposed by Lankanrani and Nikravesh was applied to evaluate the normal contact force, and the friction effect was considered using the LuGre friction model. The calculation of wear was performed by an iterative wear prediction procedure based on Archard's wear model. Using this approach, a planar slider-crank mechanism including a flexible rod and clearance joint was numerically investigated as a demonstrative example. Furthermore, the effects of the flexibility of the mechanism and the clearance size on the wear at clearance joint were also studied. © IMechE 2014.

84907562844	An automated planning-based conceptual design synthesis approach	To improve the solving efficiency of computer aided conceptual design (CACD) systems, this paper proposes a novel heuristic planning approach for automated conceptual design synthesis based on the idea of automated planning in artificial intelligence. The proposed method represented the functional knowledge of principle solution based on the state-action method. With the proposed three integration-solving search strategies (e.g., forward chaining integration, backward-chaining integration and forward-backward-chaining integration), the proposed methods can efficiently solve design problems. Finally, a design case of tidal power system illustrates that the proposed heuristic planning approach can successfully achieve an automated conceptual design synthesis.

84908306381	Multisensor information integration for online wear condition monitoring of diesel engines	A diesel engine bench test was performed, and the online visual ferrograph (OLVF) and performance monitoring sensors were used to evaluate engine wear. The sliding window method was used to segment OLVF-monitoring data; features such as probability of smaller value and accumulated wear coefficient were extracted to clarify wear degree. The weighted combination multisensor information integration method was developed to calculate current engine condition factors. The results show that OLVF monitoring exhibits more sensitivity than other performance monitoring sensors. Using multisensor information provides an early warning of performance degradation ∼40 h before the diesel engine experiences a catastrophic fault.

84912011576	A part affordance-based approach for detailed design process planning in collaborative environment	Detailed design process planning refers to determining the sequence of assigning values to design parameters of a product. A reasonable approach for planning a detailed design process can not only shorten development time but also reduce design iterations. Therefore, this article proposes a formal approach for detailed design process planning in a collaborative environment. It first introduces the concept of part affordance, which can be used to derive the dependency knowledge among design parameters. Then a part affordance-based approach is proposed, which can employ the dependency knowledge to generate a part affordance matrix and a part affordance constraint matrix, to help designers plan the detailed design process in a collaborative environment. The proposed approach is implemented with a detailed design process planning system. Finally, the detailed design of a two-stage gear box is used as an example to demonstrate the proposed research.

84916623328	An inner-enterprise design knowledge flow management approach	Design knowledge is distributed unevenly across organizational boundaries within large enterprises. Within this context, there are two main barriers to quick and reliable knowledge flow. The first is the organizational boundaries which will influence the efficiency of new design knowledge flow from when and where it is located to when and where it is need for application. The second is that one organization or sub-company of the same large enterprise often knows little about what kind of design knowledge or capability another one has. These barriers will prevent the flow of knowledge. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods and tools to improve the performance of knowledge flow within large enterprises. This paper first presents a brief introduction to the context and background information of our knowledge flow management practice in a large enterprise. Then the definition of key elements of design knowledge flow are introduced and analyzed. After that, we propose a service-based framework for the management of design knowledge flow; this framework focuses on organizing knowledge providers and developing a knowledge service platform. The proposed approach was primarily validated and verified in a large construction machinery enterprise. In addition, future work on improving the approach to knowledge flow management is also briefly discussed.

84919822578	Effects of mechanical flexibility on joint wear in multibody systems with different flexibilities	By integrating wear prediction with flexible multibody dynamics, the wear at the revolute clearance joint in flexible mechanical systems was predicted. The flexible component was modeled by using absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF)-based element. The contact force in the clearance joint was calculated using continuous contact force model. The clearance joint was modeled as a dry contact pair, in which the continuous contact force model proposed by Lankanrani and Nikravesh was applied to evaluate the normal contact force, and the friction effect was considered using the LuGre friction model. The calculation of wear was performed by an iterative wear prediction procedure based on Archard's wear model. In order to improve computational efficiency, the parallel computation procedure was introduced. Using this approach, a planar slider-crank mechanism including a flexible rod and clearance joint was numerically investigated as a demonstrative example. Furthermore, the effects of the flexibility of the mechanism and the clearance size on the wear at clearance joint were also studied. The results show that mechanical flexibility not only highly deadened the impacts at the revolute clearance joint, but also weakened the joint wear. Furthermore, this influence was more obvious when the mechanism had a higher flexibility.

84925012979	Experimental study on skid damage of cylindrical roller bearing considering thermal effect	A skid damage test rig was developed to simulate the dynamic contact between bearing ring and roller, to reveal the reason why the skid damage of roller bearing sometimes occurs and/or sometimes does not under high-speed and lightload condition at the same slip rate. The mechanism of skid damage to a roller bearing was examined by changing experimental conditions such as the surface topography, slip, inner ring speed, radial load and lubrication. An orthogonal experiment design was used, and the results showed that the slip affected the temperature rise the most followed by the radial load, lubrication and inner ring speed. The relationship between the temperature rise and skid damage was examined; skid damage occurred when the temperature increased rapidly and continually, and non-skid damage occurred when the temperature remained constant or increased very slowly. The temperature varied directly with the inner ring speed. Skid damage is mostly thermal failure where metal-to-metal contact occurs in the contact area of the bearing ring and roller after the oil film is broken; this can result in a sharp temperature rise and material transfer, and the damage can quickly extend to the whole contact area. The preliminary test result showed that the unbalanced loading and muddy oil lubrication are prone to accelerate the damage process and intensify the degree of skid damage.
