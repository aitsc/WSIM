0906.1314	large scale bias and the inaccuracy of the peak-background split	the peak-background split argument is commonly used to relate the abundanceof dark matter halos to their spatial clustering. testing this argumentrequires an accurate determination of the halo mass function. we present amaximum likelihood method for fitting parametric functional forms to haloabundances which differs from previous work because it does not require binnedcounts. our conclusions do not depend on whether we use our method or moreconventional ones. in addition, halo abundances depend on how halos aredefined. our conclusions do not depend on the choice of link length associatedwith the friends-of-friends halo-finder, nor do they change if we identifyhalos using a spherical overdensity algorithm instead. the large scale halobias measured from the matter-halo cross spectrum b_x and the haloautocorrelation function b_xi (on scales k~0.03h/mpc and r ~50 mpc/h) candiffer by as much as 5% for halos that are significantly more massive than thecharacteristic mass m*. at these large masses, the peak background splitestimate of the linear bias factor b1 is 3-5% smaller than b_xi, which is 5%smaller than b_x. we discuss the origin of these discrepancies: deterministicnonlinear local bias, with parameters determined by the peak-background splitargument, is unable to account for the discrepancies we see. a simple linearbut nonlocal bias model, motivated by peaks theory, may also be difficult toreconcile with our measurements. more work on such nonlocal bias models may beneeded to understand the nature of halo bias at this level of precision.

0906.4545	large-scale structure in brane-induced gravity i. perturbation theory	we study the growth of subhorizon perturbations in brane-induced gravityusing perturbation theory. we solve for the linear evolution of perturbationstaking advantage of the symmetry under gauge transformations along theextra-dimension to decouple the bulk equations in the quasistaticapproximation, which we argue may be a better approximation at large scalesthan thought before. we then study the nonlinearities in the bulk and braneequations, concentrating on the workings of the vainshtein mechanism by whichthe theory becomes general relativity (gr) at small scales. we show that at thelevel of the power spectrum, to a good approximation, the effect ofnonlinearities in the modified gravity sector may be absorbed into arenormalization of the gravitational constant. since the relation between thelensing potential and density perturbations is entirely unaffected by the extraphysics in these theories, the modified gravity can be described in thisapproximation by a single function, an effective gravitational constant fornonrelativistic motion that depends on space and time. we develop a resummationscheme to calculate it, and provide predictions for the nonlinear powerspectrum. at the level of the large-scale bispectrum, the leading ordercorrections are obtained by standard perturbation theory techniques, and showthat the suppression of the brane-bending mode leads to characteristicsignatures in the non-gaussianity generated by gravity, generic to models thatbecome gr at small scales through second-derivative interactions. we comparethe predictions in this work to numerical simulations in a companion paper.

0906.4548	large-scale structure in brane-induced gravity ii. numerical simulations	we use n-body simulations to study the nonlinear structure formation inbrane-induced gravity, developing a new method that requires alternate use offast fourier transforms and relaxation. this enables us to compute thenonlinear matter power spectrum and bispectrum, the halo mass function, and thehalo bias. from the simulation results, we confirm the expectations based onanalytic arguments that the vainshtein mechanism does operate as anticipated,with the density power spectrum approaching that of standard gravity within amodified background evolution in the nonlinear regime. the transition is verybroad and there is no well defined vainshtein scale, but roughly thiscorresponds to k_*~ 2 at redshift z=1 and k_*~ 1 at z=0. we checked that whileextrinsic curvature fluctuations go nonlinear, and the dynamics of thebrane-bending mode c receives important nonlinear corrections, this mode doesget suppressed compared to density perturbations, effectively decoupling fromthe standard gravity sector. at the same time, there is no violation of theweak field limit for metric perturbations associated with c. we find goodagreement between our measurements and the predictions for the nonlinear powerspectrum presented in paper i, that rely on a renormalization of the linearspectrum due to nonlinearities in the modified gravity sector. a similarprediction for the mass function shows the right trends. our simulations alsoconfirm the induced change in the bispectrum configuration dependence predictedin paper i.

0908.2598	the baryonic acoustic feature and large-scale clustering in the sdss lrg  sample	we examine the correlation function \xi of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) luminous red galaxy sample (lrg) at large scales (60&lt;s&lt;400 mpc/h) usingthe final data release (dr7; 105,831 lrgs between 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47). using mockcatalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and largerscale signal are consistent with lcdm at the 1.5\sigma level. the signal at155&lt;s&lt;200 mpc/h tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; thisslight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the lrgs. fittingdata to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain thepeak position at s_p=103.6+3.6-2.4 mpc/h when fitting the range 60&lt;s&lt;150 mpc/h(1\sigma uncertainties measured from the mocks. this redshift-space distances_p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r_s after taking intoaccount matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxyclustering bias. mock catalogs show that the probability that a dr7-sizedsample would not have an identifiable peak is at least 10%. as a consistencycheck of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s_p to obtain the distanced_v=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3) relative to the acoustic scale. we findr_s/d_v(z=0.278)=0.1394+-0.0049. this result is in excellent agreement withpercival et. al (2009), who examine roughly the same data set, but using thepower spectrum. comparison with other determinations in the literature are alsoin very good agreement. we have tested our results against a battery ofpossible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimatedsample variance.

1004.2244	regarding the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature in the sloan  digital sky survey and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey luminous red  galaxy samples	we analyze the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature in the two-pointcorrelation function {\xi} of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) luminous redgalaxy (lrg) sample (0.16 &lt; z &lt; 0.47). by defining a narrow line-of-sightregion, rp &lt; 5.5 mpc/h, where rp is the transverse separation component, wemeasure a strong excess of clustering at ~ 110 mpc/h, as previously reported inthe literature. we also test these results in an alternative coordinate system,by defining the line-of-sight as {\theta} &lt; 3{\deg}, where {\theta} is theopening angle. this clustering excess appears much stronger than the feature inthe better-measured monopole. a fiducial {\lambda}cdm non-linear model inredshift-space predicts a much weaker signature. we use realistic mock catalogsto model the expected signal and noise. we find that the line-of-sightmeasurements can be explained well by our mocks as well as by a featureless{\xi} = 0. we conclude that there is no convincing evidence that the strongclustering measurement is the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature. we alsoevaluate how detectable such a signal would be in the upcoming baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey lrg volume (boss). mock lrg catalogs (z &lt; 0.6)suggest that: (i) the narrow line- of-sight cylinder and cone defined aboveprobably will not reveal a detectable acoustic feature in boss; (ii) aclustering measurement as high as that in the current sample can be ruled out(or confirmed) at a high confidence level using a boss-sized data set; and(iii) an analysis with wider angular cuts, which provide better signal-to-noiseratios, can nevertheless be used to compare line-of-sight and transversedistances, and thereby constrain the expansion rate h(z) and diameter distanceda(z).

1007.2414	three-point correlation functions of sdss galaxies: luminosity and color  dependence in redshift and projected space	the three-point correlation function (3pcf) provides an important view intothe clustering of galaxies that is not available to its lower order cousin, thetwo-point correlation function (2pcf). higher order statistics, such as the3pcf, are necessary to probe the non-gaussian structure and shape informationexpected in these distributions. we measure the clustering of spectroscopicgalaxies in the main galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),focusing on the shape or configuration dependence of the reduced 3pcf in bothredshift and projected space. this work constitutes the largest number ofgalaxies ever used to investigate the reduced 3pcf, using over 220,000 galaxiesin three volume-limited samples. we find significant configuration dependenceof the reduced 3pcf at 3-27 mpc/h, in agreement with lcdm predictions and indisagreement with the hierarchical ansatz. below 6 mpc/h, the redshift spacereduced 3pcf shows a smaller amplitude and weak configuration dependence incomparison with projected measurements suggesting that redshift distortions,and not galaxy bias, can make the reduced 3pcf appear consistent with thehierarchical ansatz. the reduced 3pcf shows a weaker dependence on luminositythan the 2pcf, with no significant dependence on scales above 9 mpc/h. onscales less than 9 mpc/h, the reduced 3pcf appears more affected by galaxycolor than luminosty. we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the 3pcf tosystematic effects such as sky completeness and binning scheme, along with thedifficulty of resolving the errors. some comparable analyses make assumptionsthat do not consistently account for these effects.

1009.3449	modeling scale-dependent bias on the baryonic acoustic scale with the  statistics of peaks of gaussian random fields	models of galaxy and halo clustering commonly assume that the tracers can betreated as a continuous field locally biased with respect to the underlyingmass distribution. in the peak model pioneered by bbks, one considers insteaddensity maxima of the initial, gaussian mass density field as an approximationto the formation site of virialized objects. in this paper, the peak model isextended in two ways to improve its predictive accuracy. firstly, we derive thetwo-point correlation function of initial density peaks up to second order anddemonstrate that a peak-background split approach can be applied to obtain thek-independent and k-dependent peak bias factors at all orders. secondly, weexplore the gravitational evolution of the peak correlation function within thezel'dovich approximation. we show that the local (lagrangian) bias approachemerges as a special case of the peak model, in which all bias parameters arescale-independent and there is no statistical velocity bias. we apply ourformulae to study how the lagrangian peak biasing, the diffusion due to largescale flows and the mode-coupling due to nonlocal interactions affect the scaledependence of bias from small separations up to the baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) scale. for 2-sigma density peaks collapsing at z=0.3, our model predictsa ~ 5% residual scale-dependent bias around the acoustic scale that arisesmostly from first-order lagrangian peak biasing (as opposed to second-ordergravity mode-coupling). we also search for a scale dependence of bias in thelarge scale auto-correlation of massive halos extracted from a very largen-body simulation provided by the mice collaboration. for halos with massm&gt;10^{14}msun/h, our measurements demonstrate a scale-dependent bias across thebao feature which is very well reproduced by a prediction based on the peakmodel.

1012.3462	three-point correlation functions of sdss galaxies: constraining  galaxy-mass bias	we constrain the linear and quadratic bias parameters from the configurationdependence of the three-point correlation function (3pcf) in both redshift andprojected space, utilizing measurements of spectroscopic galaxies in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample. we show that bright galaxies (m_r&lt; -21.5) are biased tracers of mass, measured at a significance of 4.5 sigma inredshift space and 2.5 sigma in projected space by using a thorough erroranalysis in the quasi-linear regime (9-27 mpc/h). measurements on a faintergalaxy sample are consistent with an unbiased model. we demonstrate that alinear bias model appears sufficient to explain the galaxy-mass bias of oursamples, although a model using both linear and quadratic terms results in abetter fit. in contrast, the bias values obtained from the linear model appearin better agreement with the data by inspection of the relative bias, and yieldimplied values of sigma_8 that are more consistent with current constraints. weinvestigate the covariance of the 3pcf, which itself is a measurement of galaxyclustering. we assess the accuracy of our error estimates by comparing resultsfrom mock galaxy catalogs to jackknife re-sampling methods. we identifysignificant differences in the structure of the covariance. however, the impactof these discrepancies appears to be mitigated by an eigenmode analysis thatcan account for the noisy, unresolved modes. our results demonstrate that usingthis technique is sufficient to remove potential systematics even when usingless-than-ideal methods to estimate errors.

1108.5512	large-scale bias and efficient generation of initial conditions for  non-local primordial non-gaussianity	we study the scale-dependence of halo bias in generic (non-local) primordialnon-gaussian (png) initial conditions of the type motivated by inflation,parametrized by an arbitrary quadratic kernel. we first show how to generatenon-local png initial conditions with minimal overhead compared to local pngmodels for a general class of primordial bispectra that can be written aslinear combinations of separable templates. we run cosmological simulations forthe local, and non-local equilateral and orthogonal models and present resultson the scale-dependence of halo bias. we also derive a general formula for thefourier-space bias using the peak-background split (pbs) in the context of theexcursion set approach to halos and discuss the difference and similaritieswith the known corresponding result from local bias models. our pbs biasformula generalizes previous results in the literature to include non-markovianeffects and non-universality of the mass function and are in better agreementwith measurements in numerical simulations than previous results for a varietyof halo masses, redshifts and halo definitions. we also derive for the firsttime quadratic bias results for arbitrary non-local png, and show thatnon-linear bias loops give small corrections at large-scales. the resultingwell-behaved perturbation theory paves the way to constrain non-local png frommeasurements of the power spectrum and bispectrum in galaxy redshift surveys.

1201.3614	gravity and large-scale non-local bias	the relationship between galaxy and matter overdensities, bias, is most oftenassumed to be local. this is however unstable under time evolution, we provideproofs under several sets of assumptions. in the simplest model galaxies arecreated locally and linearly biased at a single time, and subsequently movewith the matter (no velocity bias) conserving their comoving number density (nomerging). we show that, after this formation time, the bias becomes unavoidablynon-local and non-linear at large scales. we identify the non-localgravitationally induced fields in which the galaxy overdensity can be expanded,showing that they can be constructed out of the invariants of the deformationtensor (galileons). in addition, we show that this result persists if weinclude an arbitrary evolution of the comoving number density of tracers. wethen include velocity bias, and show that new contributions appear, a dipolefield being the signature at second order. we test these predictions bystudying the dependence of halo overdensities in cells of fixed matter density:measurements in simulations show that departures from the mean bias relationare strongly correlated with the non-local gravitationally induced fieldsidentified by our formalism. the effects on non-local bias seen in thesimulations are most important for the most biased halos, as expected from ourpredictions. the non-locality seen in the simulations is not fully captured byassuming local bias in lagrangian space. accounting for these effects whenmodeling galaxy bias is essential for correctly describing the dependence ontriangle shape of the galaxy bispectrum, and hence constraining cosmologicalparameters and primordial non-gaussianity. we show that using our formalism weremove an important systematic in the determination of bias parameters from thegalaxy bispectrum, particularly for luminous galaxies.

1203.6609	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: a large sample of mock galaxy catalogues	we present a fast method of producing mock galaxy catalogues that can be usedto compute covariance matrices of large-scale clustering measurements and testthe methods of analysis. our method populates a 2nd-order lagrangianperturbation theory (2lpt) matter field, where we calibrate masses of darkmatter halos by detailed comparisons with n-body simulations. we demonstratethe clustering of halos is recovered at ~10 per cent accuracy. we populatehalos with mock galaxies using a halo occupation distribution (hod)prescription, which has been calibrated to reproduce the clusteringmeasurements on scales between 30 and 80 mpc/h. we compare the samplecovariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discussdifferences. we have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to datarelease 9 of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss),producing 600mock catalogues of the "cmass" galaxy sample. these mocks enabled detailedtests of methods and errors that formed an integral part of companion analysesof these galaxy data.

1204.5770	halo sampling, local bias and loop corrections	we develop a new test of local bias, by constructing a locally biased halodensity field from sampling the dark matter-halo distribution. our test differsfrom conventional tests in that it preserves the full scatter in the biasrelation and it does not rely on perturbation theory. we put forward that biasparameters obtained using a smoothing scale r can only be applied to computingthe halo power spectrum at scales k ~ 1/r. our calculations can automaticallyinclude the running of bias parameters and give vanishingly small loopcorrections at low-k. our proposal results in much better agreement of thesampling and perturbation theory results with simulations. in particular,unlike the standard interpretation of local bias in the literature, ourtreatment of local bias does not generate a constant power in the low-k limit.we search for extra noise in the poisson corrected halo power spectrum atwavenumbers below its turn-over and find no evidence of significant positivenoise (as predicted by the standard interpretation) while we find evidence ofnegative noise coming from halo exclusion for very massive halos. usingperturbation theory and our non-perturbative sampling technique we alsodemonstrate that nonlocal bias effects discovered recently in simulationsimpact the power spectrum only at the few percent level in the weakly nonlinearregime.

1207.1465	mptbreeze: a fast renormalized perturbative scheme	we put forward and test a simple description of multi-point propagators (mp),which serve as building-blocks to calculate the nonlinear matter powerspectrum. on large scales these propagators reduce to the well-known kernels instandard perturbation theory, while at smaller scales they are suppresed due tononlinear couplings. through extensive testing with numerical simulations wefind that this decay is characterized by the same damping scale for both twoand three-point propagators. in turn this transition can be well modeled withresummation results that exponentiate one-loop computations. for the firsttime, we measure the four components of the non-linear (two-point) propagatorusing dedicated simulations started from two independent random gaussian fieldsfor positions and velocities, verifying in detail the fundamentals ofpropagator resummation.  we use these results to develop an implementation of the mp-expansion for thenonlinear power spectrum that only requires seconds to evaluate at bao scales.to test it we construct six suites of large numerical simulations withdifferent cosmologies. from these and  lasdamas runs we show that the nonlinear power spectrum can be described atthe ~ 2% level at bao scales for redshifts in the range [0-2.5]. we make apublic release of the mptbreeze code with the hope that it can be useful to thecommunity.

1207.7117	non-local lagrangian bias	halos are biased tracers of the dark matter distribution. it is often assumedthat the patches from which halos formed are locally biased with respect to theinitial fluctuation field, meaning that the halo-patch fluctuation field can bewritten as a taylor series in that of the dark matter. if quantities other thanthe local density influence halo formation, then this lagrangian bias willgenerically be nonlocal; the taylor series must be performed with respect tothese other variables as well. we illustrate the effect with monte-carlosimulations of a model in which halo formation depends on the local shear (thequadrupole of perturbation theory), and provide an analytic model whichprovides a good description of our results. our model, which extends theexcursion set approach to walks in more than one dimension, works both whensteps in the walk are uncorrelated, as well as when there are correlationsbetween steps. for walks with correlated steps, our model includes two distincttypes of nonlocality: one is due to the fact that the initial density profilearound a patch which is destined to form a halo must fall sufficiently steeplyaround it -- this introduces k-dependence to even the linear bias factor, butotherwise only affects the monopole of the clustering signal. the other is dueto the surrounding shear field; this affects the quadratic and higher orderbias factors, and introduces an angular dependence to the clustering signal. inboth cases, our analysis shows that these nonlocal lagrangian bias terms can besignificant, particularly for massive halos; they must be accounted for inanalyses of higher order clustering such as the halo bispectrum in lagrangianor eulerian space. although we illustrate these effects using halos, ouranalysis and conclusions also apply to the other constituents of the cosmic web-- filaments, sheets and voids.

0712.0017	an analytic model for the bispectrum of galaxies in redshift space	we develop an analytic theory for the redshift space bispectrum of darkmatter, haloes and galaxies. this is done within the context of the halo modelof structure formation, as this allows for the self-consistent inclusion oflinear and non-linear redshift space distortions and also for the non-linearityof the halo bias. the model is applicable over a wide range of scales: on thelargest scales the predictions reduce to those of the standard perturbationtheory (pt); on smaller scales they are determined primarily by the nonlinearvirial velocities of galaxies within haloes, and this gives rise to theu-shaped anisotropy in the reduced bispectrum -- a finger print of thefinger-of-god distortions. we then confront the predictions with bispectrummeasurements from an ensemble of numerical simulations. on very large scales,k=0.05 h/mpc, we find reasonably good agreement between our halo model, pt andthe data, to within the errors. on smaller scales, k=0.1 h/mpc, the measuredbispectra differ from the pt at the level of 10-20%, especially for colineartriangle configurations. the halo model predictions improve over pt, but areaccurate to no better than 10%. on smaller scales k=0.5-1.0 h/mpc, our modelprovides a significant improvement over pt, which breaks down. this impliesthat studies which use the lowest order pt to extract galaxy bias informationare not robust on scales k&gt;0.1 h/mpc. the analytic and simulation results alsoindicate that there is no observable scale for which the configurationdependence of the reduced bispectrum is constant--hierarchical models for thehigher order correlation functions in redshift space are unlikely to be useful.it is hoped that our model will facilitate extraction of information fromlarge-scale structure surveys of the universe.

1309.5389	novel probes of gravity and dark energy	the discovery of cosmic acceleration has stimulated theorists to considerdark energy or modifications to einstein's general relativity as possibleexplanations. the last decade has seen advances in theories that go beyondsmooth dark energy -- modified gravity and interactions of dark energy. whilethe theoretical terrain is being actively explored, the generic presence offifth forces and dark sector couplings suggests a set of distinct observationalsignatures. this report focuses on observations that differ from theconventional probes that map the expansion history or large-scale structure.examples of such novel probes are: detection of scalar fields via labexperiments, tests of modified gravity using stars and galaxies in the nearbyuniverse, comparison of lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies and clusters,and the measurements of fundamental constants at high redshift. theobservational expertise involved is very broad as it spans laboratoryexperiments, high resolution astronomical imaging and spectroscopy and radioobservations. in the coming decade, searches for these effects have thepotential for discovering fundamental new physics. we discuss how the searchescan be carried out using experiments that are already under way or with modestadaptations of existing telescopes or planned experiments. the accompanyingpaper on the growth of cosmic structure describes complementary tests ofgravity with observations of large-scale structure.

1404.3725	constraining primordial non-gaussianity with moments of the large scale  density field	we use cosmological n-body simulations to investigate whether measurements ofthe moments of large-scale structure can yield constraints on primordialnon-gaussianity. we measure the variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the evolveddensity field from simulations with gaussian and three different non-gaussianinitial conditions: a local model with f_nl=100, an equilateral model withf_nl=-400, and an orthogonal model with f_nl=-400. we show that the moments ofthe dark matter density field differ significantly between gaussian andnon-gaussian models. we also make the measurements on mock galaxy catalogs thatcontain galaxies with clustering properties similar to those of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs). we find that, in the case of skewness and kurtosis, galaxybias reduces the detectability of non-gaussianity, though we can still clearlydiscriminate between different models in our simulation volume. however, in thecase of the variance, galaxy bias greatly amplifies the detectability ofnon-gaussianity. in all cases we find that redshift distortions do notsignificantly affect the detectability. when we restrict our measurements tovolumes equivalent to the sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss-ii) or baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) samples, the probability of detecting adeparture from the gaussian model is high by using measurements of thevariance, but very low by using only skewness and kurtosis measurements. wefind that skewness and kurtosis measurements are never likely to yield usefulconstraints on primordial non-gaussianity, but future surveys should be largeenough to place meaningful constraints using measurements of the galaxyvariance.(abridged)

1407.6740	the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies within halos: measuring  the very small scale angular clustering of sdss galaxies	we measure the angular clustering of galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey data release 7 in order to probe the spatial distribution of satellitegalaxies within their dark matter halos. specifically, we measure the angularcorrelation function on very small scales (7-320") in a range of luminositythreshold samples (absolute r-band magnitudes of -18 up to -21) that areconstructed from the subset of sdss that has been spectroscopically observedmore than once (the so-called plate overlap region). we choose to measureangular clustering in this reduced survey footprint in order to minimize theeffects of fiber collision incompleteness, which are otherwise substantial onthese small scales. we model our clustering measurements using a fullynumerical halo model that populates dark matter halos in n-body simulations tocreate realistic mock galaxy catalogs. the model has free parameters thatspecify both the number and spatial distribution of galaxies within their hosthalos. we adopt a flexible density profile for the spatial distribution ofsatellite galaxies that is similar to the dark matter navarro-frenk-white (nfw)profile, except that the inner slope is allowed to vary. we find that theangular clustering of our most luminous samples (mr&lt; -20 and -21) suggests thatluminous satellite galaxies have substantially steeper inner density profilesthan nfw. lower luminosity samples are less constraining, however, and areconsistent with satellite galaxies having shallow density profiles. our resultsconfirm the findings of watson et al. 2012 while using different clusteringmeasurements and modeling methodology.

1506.02729	fast estimators for redshift-space clustering	redshift-space distortions in galaxy surveys happen along the radialdirection, breaking statistical translation invariance. we construct estimatorsfor radial distortions that, using only fast fourier transforms (ffts) of theoverdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the powerspectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimatorsto the bispectrum. using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noiseof two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require differentnumber of ffts and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole andhexadecapole. the resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. for the bosssurvey requires about three minutes for $\ell=0,2,4$ power spectra for scalesup to $k=0.3~h/$mpc and about fifteen additional minutes for $\ell=0,2,4$bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to $k=0.2~h/$mpc on a singlecore. the speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible tocompute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogswith realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improvedconstrains of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.

1511.01909	effective window function for lagrangian halos	the window function for protohalos in lagrangian space is often assumed to bea tophat in real space. we measure this profile directly and find that it ismore extended than a tophat but less extended than a gaussian; its shape iswell-described by rounding the edges of the tophat by convolution with agaussan that has a scale length about 5 times smaller. this effective window$w_{\rm eff}$ is particularly simple in fourier space, and has an analytic formin real space. together with the excursion set bias parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$describes the scale-dependence of the lagrangian halo-matter cross correlationup to $kr_{\rm lag} \sim 10 $, where $r_{\rm lag}$ is the lagrangian size ofthe protohalo. moreover, with this $w_{\rm eff}$, all the spectral moments ofthe power spectrum are finite. while this simplifies analysis of the excursionset peak model, the predicted mass function which results is significantlylower, and hence appreciably lower than in simulations for halos of mass$\lesssim 10^{14} m_{\odot}/h $.

0806.2334	multi-point propagators in cosmological gravitational instability	we introduce the concept of multi-point propagators between linear cosmicfields and their nonlinear counterparts in the context of cosmologicalperturbation theory. such functions express how a non-linearly evolved fouriermode depends on the full ensemble of modes in the initial density field. weidentify and resum the dominant diagrams in the large-$k$ limit, showingexplicitly that multi-point propagators decay into the nonlinear regime at thesame rate as the two-point propagator. these analytic results generalize thelarge-$k$ limit behavior of the two-point propagator to arbitrary order. wemeasure the three-point propagator as a function of triangle shape in numericalsimulations and confirm the results of our high-$k$ resummation. we show thatany $n-$point spectrum can be reconstructed from multi-point propagators, whichleads to a physical connection between nonlinear corrections to the powerspectrum at small scales and higher-order correlations at large scales. as afirst application of these results, we calculate the reduced bispectrum atone-loop in renormalized perturbation theory and show that we can predict thedecrease in its dependence on triangle shape at redshift zero, when standardperturbation theory is least successful.

1512.07295	accurate estimators of correlation functions in fourier space	efficient estimators of fourier-space statistics for large number of objectsrely on fast fourier transforms (ffts), which are affected by aliasing fromunresolved small scale modes due to the finite fft grid. aliasing takes theform of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the fourier contentdisplaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. thesespurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of fourier-spacestatistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing gridsize and discarding high-frequency modes. this results in inefficient estimatesfor e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well underper-cent level. we show that using interlaced grids removes odd images, whichinclude the dominant contribution to aliasing. in addition, we discuss thechoice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations on the fftgrid and demonstrate that using higher-order interpolation kernels than thestandard cloud in cell algorithm results in significant reduction of theremaining images. we show that combining fourth-order interpolation withinterlacing gives very accurate fourier amplitudes and phases of densityperturbations. this results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates thathave systematic biases below 0.01% all the way to the nyquist frequency of thegrid, thus maximizing the use of unbiased fourier coefficients for a given gridsize and greatly reducing systematics for applications to large cosmologicaldatasets.

astro-ph;0004086	the bispectrum: from theory to observations	the bispectrum is the lowest-order statistic sensitive to the shape ofstructures generated by gravitational instability and is a potentially powerfulprobe of galaxy biasing and the gaussianity of primordial fluctuations.although the evolution of the bispectrum is well understood theoretically fromnon-linear perturbation theory and numerical simulations, applications togalaxy surveys require a number of issues to be addressed. in this paper weconsider the effect on the bispectrum of stochastic non-linear biasing, radialredshift distortions, non-gaussian initial conditions, survey geometry andsampling.  we find that: 1) bias stochasticity does not affect the use of the bispectrumto recover the mean biasing relation between galaxies and mass, at least formodels in which the scatter is uncorrelated at large scales. 2) radial redshiftdistortions do not change significantly the monopole power spectrum andbispectrum compared to their plane-parallel values. 3) survey geometry leads tofinite volume effects which must be taken into account in current surveysbefore comparison with theoretical predictions can be made. 4) sparse samplingand survey geometry correlate different triangles leading to a breakdown of thegaussian likelihood approximation.  we develop a likelihood analysis using bispectrum eigenmodes, calculated bymonte carlo realizations of mock surveys generated with second-order lagrangianperturbation theory and checked against n-body simulations. in a companionpaper we apply these results to the analysis of the bispectrum of irasgalaxies.

astro-ph;0006319	how many galaxies fit in a halo? constraints on galaxy formation  efficiency from spatial clustering	we study galaxy clustering using halo models, where gravitational clusteringis described in terms of dark matter halos. at small scales, clusteringstatistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales,correlations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory withhalo biasing. galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, andgalaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function ofhalo mass. this approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy powerspectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, andthe galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scalesthan their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. we findthat requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the apmgalaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. the data atlarge scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at smallmasses, m =10^10 msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the numberof galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-masslimit. these constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosityfunction or tully-fisher relation. we also predict the power spectrum,bispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. although halomodels agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higherorder sp parameters in n-body simulations, the model assumption that halos arespherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of thebispectrum at small scales. we stress the importance of finite volume effectsin higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.

astro-ph;0009167	linear and nonlinear contributions to pairwise peculiar velocities	we write the correlation function of dark matter particles, xi(r), as the sumof two terms - one which accounts for nonlinear evolution, and dominates onsmall scales, and another which is essentially the term from linear theory, anddominates on large scales. we use models of the number and spatial distributionof haloes and halo density profiles to describe the nonlinear term and itsevolution. the result provides a good description of the evolution of xi(r) insimulations. we then use this decomposition to provide simple and accuratemodels of how the single particle velocity dispersion evolves with time, andhow the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution dependon scale. the key idea is to use the simple physics of linear theory on largescales, the simple physics of the virial theorem on small scales, and our modelfor the correlation function to tell us how to weight the two types ofcontributions (linear and nonlinear) to the pairwise velocity statistics. whenincorporated into the streaming model, our results will allow a simple accuratedescription of redshift-space distortions over the entire range of linear tohighly nonlinear regimes.

astro-ph;0106120	pthalos: a fast method for generating mock galaxy distributions	current models of galaxy formation applied to understanding the large-scalestructure of the universe have two parts. the first is an accurate solution ofthe equations of motion for the dark matter due to gravitational clustering.the second consists of making physically reasonable approximations to thebehavior of baryons inside dark matter halos. the first uses large,computationally intensive, $n$-body simulations. we argue that because thesecond step is, at least at present, uncertain, it is possible to obtainsimilar galaxy distributions without solving the first step exactly. wedescribe an algorithm which is several orders of magnitude faster than n-bodysimulations, but which is, nevertheless, rather accurate. the algorithmcombines perturbation theory with virialized halo models of the nonlineardensity and velocity fields. for two- and three-point statistics the resultingfields are exact on large scales, and rather accurate well into the nonlinearregime, particularly for two-point statistics in real and redshift space. wethen show how to use this algorithm to generate mock galaxy distributions fromhalo occupation numbers. as a first application, we show that it provides agood description of the clustering of galaxies in the pscz survey. we alsodiscuss applications to the estimation of non-gaussian contributions to errorbars and covariance matrix of the power spectrum, in real and redshift space,for galaxies and dark matter. the results for the latter show good agreementwith simulations, supporting the use of our method to constrain cosmologicalparameters from upcoming galaxy surveys.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0111346	how neutral is the intergalactic medium at z ~ 6?	recent observations of high redshift quasar spectra reveal long gaps withlittle flux. a small or no detectable flux does not by itself imply theintergalactic medium (igm) is neutral. inferring the average neutral fractionfrom the observed absorption requires assumptions about clustering of the igm,which the gravitational instability model supplies. our most stringentconstraint on the neutral fraction at z ~ 6 is derived from the mean lyman-betatransmission measured from the z=6.28 sdss quasar of becker et al. -- theneutral hydrogen fraction at mean density has to be larger than 4.7 times10^{-4}. this is substantially higher than the neutral fraction of ~ 3-5 times10^{-5} at z = 4.5 - 5.7, suggesting that dramatic changes take place around orjust before z ~ 6, even though current constraints are still consistent with afairly ionized igm at z ~ 6. an interesting alternative method to constrain theneutral fraction is to consider the probability of having many consecutivepixels with little flux, which is small unless the neutral fraction is high.this constraint is slightly weaker than the one obtained from the meantransmission. we show that while the derived neutral fraction at a givenredshift is sensitive to the power spectrum normalization, the size of the jumparound z ~ 6 is not. we caution that systematic uncertainties include spatialfluctuations in the ionizing background, and the continuum placement. tests areproposed. in particular, the sightline to sightline dispersion in meantransmission might provide a useful diagnostic. we express the dispersion interms of the transmission power spectrum, and develop a method to calculate thedispersion for spectra that are longer than the typical simulation box.

astro-ph;0301280	on departures from a power law in the galaxy correlation function	we measure the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) from the sloan digitalsky survey for a flux-limited sample of 118,000 galaxies and for a volumelimited subset of 22,000 galaxies with absolute magnitude m_r&lt;-21. bothcorrelation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fitpower law, in particular a change in slope at r_p~1-2 mpc/h. these departuresare stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relativelyluminous galaxies. we show that the inflection point in w_p(r_p) can benaturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according towhich it marks the transition from a large scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in separate dark matter halos to a small scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in the same dark matter halo. for example, given the dark halo populationpredicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projectedcorrelation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by amodel in which the mean number of m_r&lt;-21 galaxies in a halo of mass m&gt;m_1=4.74x 10^{13}\msun/h is &lt;n&gt;_m=(m/m_1)^{0.89}, with 75% of the galaxies residing inless massive, single-galaxy halos. this physically motivated model has the samenumber of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the w_p(r_p) data better,with a \chi^2/d.o.f.=0.93 compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom,incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). departuresfrom a power-law correlation function encode information about the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter halos. higher precision measurements of thesedepartures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias andprovide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0604505	cosmology and the bispectrum	the present spatial distribution of galaxies in the universe is non-gaussian,with 40% skewness in 50 mpc/h spheres, and remarkably little is known about theinformation encoded in it about cosmological parameters beyond the powerspectrum. in this work we present an attempt to bridge this gap by studying thebispectrum, paying particular attention to a joint analysis with the powerspectrum and their combination with cmb data. we address the covarianceproperties of the power spectrum and bispectrum including the effects of beatcoupling that lead to interesting cross-correlations, and discuss how baryonacoustic oscillations break degeneracies. we show that the bispectrum hassignificant information on cosmological parameters well beyond its power inconstraining galaxy bias, and when combined with the power spectrum is morecomplementary than combining power spectra of different samples of galaxies,since non-gaussianity provides a somewhat different direction in parameterspace. in the framework of flat cosmological models we show that most of theimprovement of adding bispectrum information corresponds to parameters relatedto the amplitude and effective spectral index of perturbations, which can beimproved by almost a factor of two. moreover, we demonstrate that the expectedstatistical uncertainties in sigma8 of a few percent are robust to relaxing thedark energy beyond a cosmological constant.

astro-ph;9612207	cosmological perturbations: entering the non-linear regime	we consider one-loop corrections to the bispectrum and skewness ofcosmological density fluctuations induced by gravitational evolution. as hasbeen established by comparison with numerical simulations, tree-levelperturbation theory (pt) describes these quantities at the largest scales.one-loop pt provides a tool to probe the transition to the non-linear regime onsmaller scales. in this work, we find that, as a function of spectral index n,the one-loop bispectrum follows a pattern analogous to that of the one-looppower spectrum, which shows a change in behavior at a critical index n_c =-1.4, where non-linear corrections vanish. for the bispectrum, for n less thann_c, one-loop corrections increase the configuration dependence of the leadingorder contribution; for n greater than n_c, one-loop corrections tend to cancelthe configuration dependence of the tree-level bispectrum, in agreement withknown results from n=-1 numerical simulations. a similar situation is shown tohold for the zel'dovich approximation (za), where n_c = -1.75. usingdimensional regularization, we obtain explicit analytic expressions for theone-loop bispectrum for n=-2 initial power spectra, for both the exact dynamicsof gravitational instability and the za. we also compute the skewness factor,including local averaging of the density field, for n=-2: s_3(r) = 4.02 + 3.83sigma^2(r) for gaussian smoothing and s_3(r) = 3.86 + 3.18 sigma^2(r) fortop-hat smoothing, where sigma^2(r) is the variance of the density fieldfluctuations smoothed over a window of radius r. comparison with fullynon-linear numerical simulations implies that, for n &lt; -1, one-loop pt canextend our understanding of nonlinear clustering down to scales where thetransition to the stable clustering regime begins.

astro-ph;9704075	non-linear evolution of the bispectrum of cosmological perturbations	the bispectrum, the three-point function of density fluctuations in fourierspace, is the lowest order statistic that carries information about the spatialcoherence of large-scale structures. for gaussian initial conditions, when thedensity fluctuation amplitude is small, tree-level (leading order) perturbationtheory predicts a characteristic dependence of the bispectrum on the shape ofthe triangle formed by the three wave vectors. this configuration dependenceprovides a signature of gravitational instability, and departures from it ingalaxy catalogs can be interpreted as due to bias, that is, non-gravitationaleffects. on the other hand, n-body simulations indicate that the reducedthree-point function becomes relatively shape-independent in the stronglynon-linear regime. in order to understand this non-linear transition and assessthe domain of reliability of shape-dependence as a probe of bias, we calculatethe one-loop (next-to-leading order) corrections to the bispectrum inperturbation theory. we compare these results with measurements in numericalsimulations with scale-free and cdm initial power spectra. we find that theone-loop corrections account very well for the departures from the tree-levelresults measured in numerical simulations on weakly non-linear scales. in thisregime, the reduced bispectrum qualitatively retains its tree-level shape, butthe amplitude can change significantly. at smaller scales, the reducedbispectrum in the simulations starts to flatten, an effect which can bepartially understood from the one-loop results. in the strong clusteringregime, where perturbation theory breaks down entirely, the simulation resultsconfirm that the reduced bispectrum has almost no dependence on triangle shape,in rough agreement with the hierarchical ansatz.

astro-ph;9711187	transients from initial conditions: a perturbative analysis	the standard procedure to generate initial conditions (ic) in numericalsimulations is to use the zel'dovich approximation (za). although the zacorrectly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocityperturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented because of the zafailure to conserve momentum. this implies that it takes time for the actualdynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density andvelocity fields. we extend perturbation theory (pt) to include transients asnon-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the ic. we focus onhigher-order statistics of the density contrast and velocity divergence,characterized by the s_p and t_p parameters. we find that the time-scale oftransients is determined, at a given order p, by the spectral index n. theskewness factor s_3 (t_3) attains 10% accuracy only after a=6 (a=15) for n=0,whereas higher (lower) n demands more (less) expansion away from the ic. theserequirements become much more stringent as p increases. an omega=0.3 modelrequires a factor of two larger expansion than an omega=1 model to reducetransients by the same amount. the predicted transients in s_p are in goodagreement with numerical simulations. more accurate ic can be achieved by using2nd order lagrangian pt (2lpt), which reproduces growing modes up to 2nd orderand thus eliminates transients in the skewness. we show that for p&gt;3 thisreduces the required expansion by more than an order of magnitude compared tothe za. setting up 2lpt ic only requires minimal, inexpensive changes to zacodes. we suggest simple steps for its implementation.

astro-ph;9805012	the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on cosmic microwave background  anisotropy	hydrogen atoms in the universe that initially formed at redshift z = 1100were reionized at 5 &lt; z &lt; 60. it is likely that this transition proceededthrough a mixed phase of partial ionization. we develop an analytic approach tocalculating the effect on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) of thomsonscattering off this inhomogeneous distribution of free electrons. we study twomodels of the reionization process, one of which associates ionized patcheswith overdense regions of the smoothed density field. we find the generatedanisotropy to have a power spectrum which peaks at angular scales correspondingto the extent of the ionized regions, and has a width that reflects thecorrelations between them. there is considerable uncertainty in the amplitude,which depends on how efficiently collapsed objects can reionize the surroundingmedium. we calculate the effect of neglecting inhomogeneous reionization in thedetermination of cosmological parameters from high resolution cmb maps and findthat it may be a significant source of systematic error.

astro-ph;9901099	power spectrum correlations induced by non-linear clustering	gravitational clustering is an intrinsically non-linear process thatgenerates significant non-gaussian signatures in the density field. we considerhow these affect power spectrum determinations from galaxy and weak-lensingsurveys. non-gaussian effects not only increase the individual error barscompared to the gaussian case but, most importantly, lead to non-trivialcross-correlations between different band-powers. we calculate thepower-spectrum covariance matrix in non-linear perturbation theory (weaklynon-linear regime), in the hierarchical model (strongly non-linear regime), andfrom numerical simulations in real and redshift space. we discuss the impact ofthese results on parameter estimation from power spectrum measurements andtheir dependence on the size of the survey and the choice of band-powers. weshow that the non-gaussian terms in the covariance matrix become dominant forscales smaller than the non-linear scale, depending somewhat on powernormalization. furthermore, we find that cross-correlations mostly deterioratethe determination of the amplitude of a rescaled power spectrum, whereas itsshape is less affected. in weak lensing surveys the projection tends to reducethe importance of non-gaussian effects. even so, for background galaxies atredshift z=1, the non-gaussian contribution rises significantly around l=1000,and could become comparable to the gaussian terms depending upon the powerspectrum normalization and cosmology. the projection has another interestingeffect: the ratio between non-gaussian and gaussian contributions saturates andcan even decrease at small enough angular scales if the power spectrum of the3d field falls faster than 1/k^2.

0809.4606	generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion by orbit crossing	we study the generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion by orbitcrossing using cosmological numerical simulations, and calculate thebackreaction of these effects on the evolution of large-scale density andvelocity divergence power spectra. we use delaunay tessellations to define thevelocity field, showing that the power spectra of velocity divergence andvorticity measured in this way are unbiased and have better noise propertiesthan for standard interpolation methods that deal with mass weightedvelocities. we show that high resolution simulations are required to recoverthe correct large-scale vorticity power spectrum, while poor resolution canspuriously amplify its amplitude by more than one order of magnitude. wemeasure the scalar and vector modes of the stress tensor induced by orbitcrossing using an adaptive technique, showing that its vector modes lead, wheninput into the vorticity evolution equation, to the same vorticity powerspectrum obtained from the delaunay method. we incorporate orbit crossingcorrections to the evolution of large scale density and velocity fields inperturbation theory by using the measured stress tensor modes. we find that atlarge scales (k~0.1 h/mpc) vector modes have very little effect in the densitypower spectrum, while scalar modes (velocity dispersion) can induce percentlevel corrections at z=0, particularly in the velocity divergence powerspectrum. in addition, we show that the velocity power spectrum is smaller thanpredicted by linear theory until well into the nonlinear regime, with littlecontribution from virial velocities.
