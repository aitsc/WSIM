0901.2486	optimization of mapping modes for heterodyne instruments	astronomic line mapping with single-pixel instruments is usually performed inan on-the-fly (otf) or a raster-mapping mode depending on the capabilities ofthe telescope and the instrument. the observing efficiency can be increased bycombining several source-point integrations with a common referencemeasurement. this is implemented at many telescopes, but a thoroughinvestigation of the optimum calibration of the modes and the best way ofperforming these observations is still lacking.  we use knowledge of the instrumental stability obtained by an allan variancemeasurement to derive a mathematical formalism for optimizing the setup ofmapping observations. special attention has to be paid to minimizing of theimpact of correlated noise introduced by the common off integrations and to thecorrection of instrumental drifts. both aspects can be covered using acalibration scheme that interpolates between two off measurements and anappropriate off integration time.  the total uncertainty of the calibrated data consisting of radiometric noiseand drift noise can be minimized by adjusting the source integration time andthe number of data points observed between two off measurements. it turns outthat otf observations are very robust. they provide a low relative noise, evenif their setup deviates considerably from the optimum. fast data readouts areoften essential to minimize the drift contributions. in particular, continuummeasurements may be easily spoiled by instrumental drifts. the main drawback ofthe described mapping modes is the limited use of the measured data atdifferent spatial or spectroscopic resolutions obtained by additionalrebinning.

1001.2453	the link between molecular cloud structure and turbulence	we aim to better understand how the spatial structure of molecular clouds isgoverned by turbulence. for that, we study the large-scale spatial distributionof low density molecular gas and search for characteristic length scales. weemploy a 35 square degrees 13co 1-0 molecular line survey of cygnus x andvisual extinction (a_v) maps of 17 galactic clouds to analyse the spatialstructure using the delta-variance method. this sample contains a large varietyof different molecular cloud types with different star forming activity. thedelta-variance spectra obtained from the a_v maps show differences betweenlow-mass star-forming (sf) clouds and massive giant molecular clouds (gmc) interms of shape of the spectrum and its power-law exponent beta. low-mass sfclouds have a double-peak structure with characteristic size scales around 1 pc(though with a large scatter around this value) and 4 pc. gmcs show nocharacteristic scale in the a_v-maps, which can partly be ascribed to adistance effect due to a larger line-of-sight (los) confusion. thedelta-variance for cygnus, determined from the 13co survey, showscharacteristic scales at 4 pc and 40 pc, either reflecting the filamentstructure and large-scale turbulence forcing or - for the 4 pc scale - thescale below which the 13co 1-0 line becomes optically thick. though there aredifferent processes that can introduce characteristic scales, i.e. geometry,decaying turbulence the transition scale from supersonic to subsonic turbulence(the sonic scale), line-of-sight effects and energy injection due to expandingsupernova shells, outflows, hii-regions, and the relative contribution of theseeffects strongly varies from cloud to cloud, it is remarkable that theresulting turbulent structure of molecular clouds shows similarcharacteristics.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1007.1235	discovery of water vapour in the carbon star v cygni from observations  with herschel/hifi	we report the discovery of water vapour toward the carbon star v cygni. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the1(11) - 0(00) para-water transition at 1113.3430 ghz in the upper sideband ofthe band 4b receiver. the observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,but with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and theintegrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \pm 0.17 k km/s. this detection ofthermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of waterin carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-richagb star, the first having been obtained by the submillimeter wave astronomysatellite toward irc+10216. for an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,the observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) e-5 earthmasses per year and a water abundance relative to h2 of ~ (2-5) e-6. this valueis a factor of at least 1e+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance ina carbon-rich environment, and - as in irc+10216 - raises the intriguingpossibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation oforbiting comets or dwarf planets. however, observations of the single lineobserved to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatialdistribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations ofadditional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of theh2o-emitting zone, and the h2o ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to placeimportant constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.

1007.1523	herschel observations in the ultracompact hii region mon r2: water in  dense photon-dominated regions (pdrs)	mon r2, at a distance of 830 pc, is the only ultracompact hii region (uc hii)where the photon-dominated region (pdr) between the ionized gas and themolecular cloud can be resolved with herschel. hifi observations of theabundant compounds 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+, cs, ch, and nh have been used toderive the physical and chemical conditions in the pdr, in particular the waterabundance. the 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+ and cs observations are welldescribed assuming that the emission is coming from a dense (n=5e6 cm-3,n(h2)&gt;1e22 cm-2) layer of molecular gas around the uc hii. based on ouro-h2-18o observations, we estimate an o-h2o abundance of ~2e-8. this is theaverage ortho-water abundance in the pdr. additional h2-18o and/or water linesare required to derive the water abundance profile. a lower density envelope(n~1e5 cm-3, n(h2)=2-5e22 cm-2) is responsible for the absorption in the nh1_1-0_2 line. the emission of the ch ground state triplet is coming from bothregions with a complex and self-absorbed profile in the main component. theradiative transfer modeling shows that the 13co and hco+ line profiles areconsistent with an expansion of the molecular gas with a velocity law, v_e =0.5x (r/rout)^{-1} km/s, although the expansion velocity is poorly constrained bythe observations presented here.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1112.3860	detection of hf emission from the orion bar	the clumpy density structure of photon-dominated regions is well established,but the physical properties of the clumps and of the surrounding interclumpmedium are only approximately known. the aim of this paper is to constrain thephysical and chemical conditions in the orion bar, a prototypical nearbyphoton-dominated region. we present observations of the hf j=1-0 line, whichappears in emission toward the orion bar, and compare the brightness of theline to non-lte radiative transfer calculations. the large width of the hf linesuggests an origin of the emission in the interclump gas, but collisionalexcitation by h2 in the interclump gas underpredicts the observed lineintensity by factors of 3-5. in contrast, an origin of the line in the denseclumps requires a density of ~10^9 cm^-3, 10-100 times higher than previousestimates, which is unlikely. however, electron impact excitation reproducesour observations for t = 100 k and n(e) = 10 cm^-3, as expected for theinterclump gas. we conclude that hf emission is a signpost of molecular gaswith a high electron density. similar conditions may apply to active galacticnuclei where hf also appears in emission.

1206.1249	herschel / hifi observations of co, h2o and nh3 in mon r2	context. mon r2 is the only ultracompact hii region (uchii) where theassociated photon-dominated region (pdr) can be resolved with herschel. due toits brightness and proximity, it is the best source to investigate thechemistry and physics of highly uv-irradiated pdrs. aims. our goal is toestimate the abundance of h2o and nh3 in this region and investigate theirorigin. methods. we present new observations obtained with hifi and theiram-30m telescope. using a large velocity gradient approach, we model the lineintensities and derive an average abundance of h2o and nh3 across the region.finally, we model the line profiles with a non-local radiative transfer modeland compare these results with the abundance predicted by the meudon pdr code.results. the variations of the line profiles and intensities indicate complexgeometrical and kinematical patterns. the h2o lines present a strong absorptionat the ambient velocity and emission in high velocity wings towards the hiiregion. the spatial distribution of the o-h2^18o line shows that the itsemission arises in the pdr surrounding the hii region. by modeling the o-h2^18oemission we derive a mean abundance of o-h2o of ~10^-8 relative to h2. theortho-h2o abundance is however larger, ~1x10^-7, in the high velocity wings.possible explanations for this larger abundance include an expanding hot pdrand/or an outflow. ammonia seems to be present only in the envelope with anaverage abundance of ~2x10^-9 relative to h2. conclusions. the meudon pdr codecan account for the measured water abundance in the high velocity gas as longas we assume that it originates from a &lt;1 mag hot expanding layer of the pdr,i.e. that the outflow has only a minor contribution to this emission. toexplain the abundances in the rest of the cloud the molecular freeze out andgrain surface chemistry would need to be included.

1211.3359	herschel/hifi observations of [cii] and [13cii] in pdrs	recently, we introduced detailed isotopic chemistry into the kosma-tau modelfor photon-dominated regions (pdrs) to give theoretical predictions for theabundance of the carbon isotopologues as a function of pdr parameters. combinedwith radiative transfer computations for specific geometries, we estimated thepossible intensity ratio of the [cii]/[13cii] lines. here, we compare thesepredictions with new observations.  we performed herschel/hifi observations of the [cii] 158micron line in anumber of pdrs. in all sources we observed at least two hyperfine components ofthe [13cii] transition allowing to determine the [cii]/[13cii] intensity ratio,after some revision of the intrinsic hyperfine ratios. comparing the intensityratios with the results from the updated kosma-tau model, we identify casesdominated by chemical fractionation and cases dominated by the optical depth ofthe main isotopic line.  an observable enhancement of the [cii]/[13cii] intensity ratio due tochemical fractionation depends mostly on geometry and velocity structure, andless on the gas density and radiation field. in our observations the[cii]/[13cii] ratio for the integrated line intensity was always dominated bythe optical depth of the main isotopic line. however, an enhanced intensityratio is found for particular velocity components in a few sources: thered-shifted material in the ultracompact hii region mon r2, the wings of theturbulent profile in the orion bar, and possibly a blue wing in ngc7023. themapping of the [13cii] lines in the orion bar allows to derive a c+ columndensity map confirming the temperature stratification of the c+ layer, inagreement with the chemical stratification of the bar. the c+ column densitiesfor all sources show that at the position of the [cii] peak emission, adominant fraction of the gas-phase carbon is in the form of c+.

1211.3546	full sed fitting with the kosma-\tau\ pdr code - i. dust modelling	we revised the treatment of interstellar dust in the kosma-\tau\ pdr modelcode to achieve a consistent description of the dust-related physics in thecode. the detailed knowledge of the dust properties is then used to compute thedust continuum emission together with the line emission of chemical species. wecoupled the kosma-\tau\ pdr code with the mcdrt (multi component dust radiativetransfer) code to solve the frequency-dependent radiative transfer equationsand the thermal balance equation in a dusty clump under the assumption ofspherical symmetry, assuming thermal equilibrium in calculating the dusttemperatures, neglecting non-equilibrium effects. we updated the calculation ofthe photoelectric heating and extended the parametrization range for thephotoelectric heating toward high densities and uv fields. we revised thecomputation of the h2 formation on grain surfaces to include the eley-ridealeffect, thus allowing for high-temperature h2 formation. we demonstrate how thedifferent optical properties, temperatures, and heating and coolingcapabilities of the grains influence the physical and chemical structure of amodel cloud. the most influential modification is the treatment of h2 formationon grain surfaces that allows for chemisorption. this increases the total h2formation significantly and the connected h2 formation heating provides aprofound heating contribution in the outer layers of the model clumps. thecontribution of pah surfaces to the photoelectric heating and h2 formationprovides a boost to the temperature of outer cloud layers, which is clearlytraced by high-j co lines. increasing the fraction of small grains in the dustsize distribution results in hotter gas in the outer cloud layers caused bymore efficient heating and cooler cloud centers, which is in turn caused by themore efficient fuv extinction.

1211.3562	carbon fractionation in pdrs	we upgraded the chemical network from the umist database for astrochemistry2006 to include isotopes such as ^{13}c and ^{18}o. this includes allcorresponding isotopologues, their chemical reactions and the properly scaledreaction rate coefficients. we study the fractionation behavior ofastrochemically relevant species over a wide range of model parameters,relevant for modelling of photo-dissociation regions (pdrs). we separatelyanalyze the fractionation of the local abundances, fractionation of the totalcolumn densities, and fractionation visible in the emission line ratios. wefind that strong c^+ fractionation is possible in cool c^+ gas. opticalthickness as well as excitation effects produce intensity ratios between 40 and400. the fractionation of co in pdrs is significantly different from thediffuse interstellar medium. pdr model results never show a fractionation ratioof the co column density larger than the elemental ratio. isotope-selectivephoto-dissociation is always dominated by the isotope-selective chemistry indense pdr gas. the fractionation of c, ch, ch^+, and hco^+ is studied indetail, showing that the fractionation of c, ch and ch^+ is dominated by thefractionation of their parental species. the light hydrides chemically derivefrom c^+, and, consequently, their fractionation state is coupled to that ofc^+. the fractionation of c is a mixed case depending on whether formation fromco or hco^+ dominates. ratios of the emission lines of [c ii], [c i], ^{13}co,and h^{13}co^+ provide individual diagnostics to the fractionation status ofc^+, c, and co.

1303.4984	spatial distribution of small hydrocarbons in the neighborhood of the  ultra compact hii region monoceros r2	we study the chemistry of small hydrocarbons in the photon-dominated regions(pdrs) associated with the ultra-compact hii region mon r2. our goal is todetermine the variations of the abundance of small hydrocarbons in a high-uvirradiated pdr and investigate their chemistry. we present an observationalstudy of ch, cch and c-c$_3$h$_2$ in mon r2 combining data obtained with theiram 30m telescope and herschel. we determine the column densities of thesespecies, and compare their spatial distributions with that of polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (pah). we compare the observational results with differentchemical models to explore the relative importance of gas-phase, grain-surfaceand time-dependent chemistry in these environments. the emission of the smallhydrocarbons show different patterns. the cch emission is extended while ch andc-c$_3$h$_2$ are concentrated towards the more illuminated layers of the pdr.the ratio of the column densities of c-c$_3$h$_2$ and cch shows spatialvariations up to a factor of a few, increasing from$n(c-c$_3$h$_2$)/n(cch)\approx0.004$ in the envelope to a maximum of$\sim0.015-0.029$ towards the 8$\mu$m emission peak. comparing these resultswith other galactic pdrs, we find that the abundance of cch is quite constantover a wide range of g$_0$, whereas the abundance of c-c$_3$h$_2$ is higher inlow-uv pdrs. in mon r2, the gas-phase steady-state chemistry can accountrelatively well for the abundances of ch and cch in the most exposed layers ofthe pdr, but falls short by a factor of 10 to reproduce c-c$_3$h$_2$.  in the molecular envelope, time-dependent effects and grain surface chemistryplay a dominant role in determining the hydrocarbons abundances. our studyshows that cch and c-c$_3$h$_2$ present a complex chemistry in which uvphotons, grain-surface chemistry and time dependent effects contribute todetermine their abundances.

1304.3131	the effects of radiative transfer on the pdfs of molecular mhd  turbulence	we study the effects of radiative transfer on the probability distributionfunctions (pdfs) of simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the widelystudied $^{13}$co 2-1 transition. we find that the integrated intensity mapsgenerally follow a log-normal distribution, with the cases that have $\tau\approx 1$ best matching the pdf of the column density. we fit a 2dvariance-sonic mach number relationship to our logarithmic pdfs of the form$\sigma_{ln(\sigma/\sigma_0)}^2=a\times ln(1+b^2{\cal m}_s^2)$ and find that,for parameter $b=1/3$, parameter $a$ depends on the radiative transferenvironment. we also explore the variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the linearpdfs finding that higher moments reflect both higher sonic mach number andlower optical depth. finally, we apply the tsallis incremental pdf function andfind that the fit parameters depend on both mach numbers, but also aresensitive to the radiative transfer parameter space, with the $\tau \approx 1$case best fitting the incremental pdf of the true column density. we concludethat, for pdfs of low optical depth cases, part of the gas is alwayssub-thermally excited so that the spread of the line intensities exceeds thespread of the underlying column densities and hence the pdfs do not reflect thetrue column density. similarly, pdfs of optically thick cases are dominated bythe velocity dispersion and therefore do not represent the true column densitypdf. thus, in the case of molecules like carbon monoxide, the dynamic range ofintensities, structures observed and consequently, the observable pdfs, areless determined by turbulence and more-often determined by radiative transfereffects.

1305.3619	the turbulence power spectrum in optically thick interstellar clouds	the fourier power spectrum is one of the most widely used statistical toolsto analyze the nature of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the interstellarmedium. lazarian &amp; pogosyan (2004) predicted that the spectral slope shouldsaturate to -3 for an optically thick medium and many observations exist insupport of their prediction. however, there have not been any numerical studiesto-date testing these results. we analyze the spatial power spectrum of mhdsimulations with a wide range of sonic and alfv\'enic mach numbers, whichinclude radiative transfer effects of the $^{13}$co transition. we confirmnumerically the predictions of lazarian &amp; pogosyan (2004) that the spectralslope of line intensity maps of an optically thick medium saturates to -3.furthermore, for very optically thin supersonic co gas, where the density or coabundance values are too low to excite emission in all but the densest shockcompressed gas, we find that the spectral slope is shallower than expected fromthe column density. finally, we find that mixed optically thin/thick co gas,which has average optical depths on order of unity, shows mixed behavior: forsuper-alfv\'enic turbulence, the integrated intensity power spectral slopesgenerally follow the same trend with sonic mach number as the true columndensity power spectrum slopes. however, for sub-alfv\'enic turbulence thespectral slopes are steeper with values near -3 which are similar to the veryoptically thick regime.

0802.1929	submillimeter line emission from lmc n159w: a dense, clumpy pdr in a low  metallicity environment	star formation at earlier cosmological times takes place in an interstellarmedium with low metallicity. the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is ideally suitedto study star formation in such an environment. the physical and chemical stateof the ism in a star forming environment can be constrained by observations ofsubmm and fir spectral lines of the main carbon carrying species, co, ci andcii, which originate in the surface layers of molecular clouds illuminated bythe uv radiation of the newly formed, young stars. we present high-angularresolution sub-millimeter observations in the n159w region in the lmc obtainedwith the nanten2 telescope of the 12co j = 4-3, j = 7-6, and 13co j = 4-3rotational and [ci] 3p1-3p0 and 3p2-3p1 fine-structure transitions. the 13co j=4-3 and [ci] 3p2-3p1 transitions are detected for the first time in the lmc.we derive the physical and chemical properties of the low-metallicity moleculargas using an escape probability code and a self-consistent solution of thechemistry and thermal balance of the gas in the framework of a clumpy cloud pdrmodel. the separate excitation analysis of the submm co lines and the carbonfine structure lines shows that the emitting gas in the n159w region hastemperatures of about 80 k and densities of about 10^4 cm^-3. the estimated cto co abundance ratio close to unity is substantially higher than in densemassive star-forming regions in the milky way. the analysis of all observedlines together, including the [cii] line intensity reported in the literature,in the context of a clumpy cloud pdr model constrains the uv intensity to about\chi ~220 and an average density of the clump ensemble of about 10^5 cm^-3,thus confirming the presence of high density material in the lmc n159w region.

1403.2996	understanding star formation in molecular clouds i. effects of  line-of-sight contamination on the column density structure	column-density maps of molecular clouds are one of the most importantobservables in the context of molecular cloud- and star-formation (sf) studies.with the herschel satellite it is now possible to determine the column densityfrom dust emission. we use observations and simulations to demonstrate how loscontamination affects the column density probability distribution function(pdf). we apply a first-order approximation (removing a constant level) to themolecular clouds of auriga, maddalena, carina and ngc3603. in perfect agreementwith the simulations, we find that the pdfs become broader, the peak shifts tolower column densities, and the power-law tail of the pdf flattens aftercorrection. all pdfs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peakat av~2, a deviation point (dp) from the lognormal at av(dp)~4-5, and apower-law tail for higher column densities. assuming a density distributionrho~r^-alpha, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to alpha(pdf)=1.8,1.75, and 2.5 for auriga, carina, and ngc3603 (alpha~1.5-2 is consistentgravitational collapse). we find that low-mass and high-mass sf clouds displaydifferences in the overall column density structure. massive clouds assemblemore gas in smaller cloud volumes than low-mass sf ones. however, for bothcloud types, the transition of the pdf from lognormal shape into power-law tailis found at the same column density (at av~4-5 mag). low-mass and high-mass sfclouds then have the same low column density distribution, most likelydominated by supersonic turbulence. at higher column densities, collapse andexternal pressure can form the power-law tail. the relative importance of thetwo processes can vary between clouds and thus lead to the observed differencesin pdf and column density structure.

1405.3903	c$_2$h observations toward the orion bar	c$_2$h is one of the first radicals to be detected in the interstellarmedium. its higher rotational transitions have recently become available withthe herschel space observatory. we aim to constrain the physical parameters ofthe c$_2$h emitting gas toward the orion bar. we analyse the c$_2$h lineintensities measured toward the orion bar co$^+$ peak and herschel/hifi maps ofc$_2$h, ch, and hco$^+$, and a nanten map of [ci]. we interpret the observedc$_2$h emission using radiative transfer and pdr models. five rotationaltransitions of c$_2$h have been detected in the hifi frequency range toward theco$^+$ peak. a single component rotational diagram gives a rotation temperatureof ~64 k and a beam-averaged c$_2$h column density of 4$\times$10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$. the measured transitions cannot be explained by any single parametermodel. according to a non-lte model, most of the c$_2$h column density producesthe lower-$n$ c$_2$h transitions and traces a warm ($t_{\rm{kin}}$ ~ 100-150 k)and dense ($n$(h$_2$)~10$^5$-10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. a small fraction of thec$_2$h column density is required to reproduce the intensity of the highest-$n$transitions ($n$=9-8 and n=10-9) originating from a high density($n$(h$_2$)~5$\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) hot ($t_{\rm{kin}}$ ~ 400 k) gas. thetotal beam-averaged c$_2$h column density in the model is 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$.both the non-lte radiative transfer model and a simple pdr model representingthe orion bar with a plane-parallel slab of gas and dust suggest, that c$_2$hcannot be described by a single pressure component, unlike the reactive ionch$^+$, which was previously analysed toward the orion bar co$^+$ peak. thephysical parameters traced by the higher rotational transitions($n$=6-5,...,10-9) of c$_2$h may be consistent with the edges of dense clumpsexposed to uv radiation near the ionization front of the orion bar.

1412.1106	herschel survey of galactic oh+, h2o+, and h3o+: probing the molecular  hydrogen fraction and cosmic-ray ionization rate	in diffuse interstellar clouds the chemistry that leads to the formation ofthe oxygen bearing ions oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ begins with the ionization ofatomic hydrogen by cosmic rays, and continues through subsequent hydrogenabstraction reactions involving h2. given these reaction pathways, the observedabundances of these molecules are useful in constraining both the totalcosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen (zeta_h) and molecular hydrogenfraction, f(h2). we present observations targeting transitions of oh+, h2o+,and h3o+ made with the herschel space observatory along 20 galactic sight linestoward bright submillimeter continuum sources. both oh+ and h2o+ are detectedin absorption in multiple velocity components along every sight line, but h3o+is only detected along 7 sight lines. from the molecular abundances we computef(h2) in multiple distinct components along each line of sight, and find agaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation 0.042+-0.018. thisconfirms previous findings that oh+ and h2o+ primarily reside in gas with lowh2 fractions. we also infer zeta_h throughout our sample, and find a log-normaldistribution with mean log(zeta_h)=-15.75, (zeta_h=1.78x10^-16 s^-1), andstandard deviation 0.29 for gas within the galactic disk, but outside of thegalactic center. this is in good agreement with the mean and distribution ofcosmic-ray ionization rates previously inferred from h3+ observations.ionization rates in the galactic center tend to be 10--100 times larger thanfound in the galactic disk, also in accord with prior studies.

1502.04195	wavelet-based cross-correlation analysis of structure scaling in  turbulent clouds	we propose a statistical tool to compare the scaling behaviour of turbulencein pairs of molecular cloud maps. using artificial maps with well definedspatial properties, we calibrate the method and test its limitations toultimately apply it to a set of observed maps. we develop the wavelet-basedweighted cross-correlation (wwcc) method to study the relative contribution ofstructures of different sizes and their degree of correlation in two maps as afunction of spatial scale, and the mutual displacement of structures in themolecular cloud maps. we test the wwcc for circular structures having a singleprominent scale and fractal structures showing a self-similar behavior withoutprominent scales. observational noise and a finite map size limit the scaleswhere the cross-correlation coefficients and displacement vectors can bereliably measured. for fractal maps containing many structures on all scales,the limitation from the observational noise is negligible for signal-to-noiseratios &gt;5. (abbrev). application of the wwcc to the observed line maps of thegiant molecular cloud g333 allows to add specific scale information to theresults obtained earlier using the principle component analysis. it confirmsthe chemical and excitation similarity of $^{13}$co and c$^{18}$o on allscales, but shows a deviation of hcn at scales of up to 7' (~7 pc). this can beinterpreted as a chemical transition scale. the largest structures also show asystematic offset along the filament, probably due to a large-scale densitygradient. the wwcc can compare correlated structures in different maps ofmolecular clouds identifying scales that represent structural changes such aschemical and phase transitions and prominent or enhanced dimensions.

0804.4649	structure analysis of interstellar clouds: i. improving the  delta-variance method	the delta-variance analysis, has proven to be an efficient and accuratemethod of characterising the power spectrum of interstellar turbulence. theimplementation presently in use, however, has several shortcomings.  we propose and test an improved delta-variance algorithm for two-dimensionaldata sets, which is applicable to maps with variable error bars and which canbe quickly computed in fourier space. we calibrate the spatial resolution ofthe delta-variance spectra.  the new delta-variance algorithm is based on an appropriate filtering of thedata in fourier space. it allows us to distinguish the influence of variablenoise from the actual small-scale structure in the maps and it helps fordealing with the boundary problem in non-periodic and/or irregularly boundedmaps. we try several wavelets and test their spatial sensitivity usingartificial maps with well known structure sizes.  it turns out that different wavelets show different strengths with respect todetecting characteristic structures and spectral indices, i.e. differentaspects of map structures. as a reasonable universal compromise for the optimumdelta-variance filter, we propose the mexican-hat filter with a ratio betweenthe diameters of the core and the annulus of 1.5.

0804.4877	structure analysis of interstellar clouds: ii. applying the  delta-variance method to interstellar turbulence	the delta-variance analysis is an efficient tool for measuring the structuralscaling behaviour of interstellar turbulence in astronomical maps. in paper iwe proposed essential improvements to the delta-variance analysis.  in this paper we apply the improved delta-variance analysis to i) ahydrodynamic turbulence simulation with prominent density and velocitystructures, ii) an observed intensity map of rho oph with irregular boundariesand variable uncertainties of the different data points, and iii) a map of theturbulent velocity structure in the polaris flare affected by the intensitydependence on the centroid velocity determination.  the tests confirm the extended capabilities of the improved delta-varianceanalysis. prominent spatial scales were accurately identified and artifactsfrom a variable reliability of the data were removed. the analysis of thehydrodynamic simulations showed that the injection of a turbulent velocitystructure creates the most prominent density structures are produced on a scalesomewhat below the injection scale. the new analysis of a rho oph continuum mapreveals an intermediate stage in the molecular cloud evolution showing bothsignatures of the typical molecular cloud scaling behaviour and the formationof condensed cores. when analysing the velocity structure of the polaris flarewe show that a universal power law connects scales from 0.03 pc to 3 pc.however, a plateau in the delta-variance spectrum around 5 pc indicates thatthe visible large-scale velocity gradient is not converted directly into aturbulent cascade.

1507.08869	detection of two power-law tails in the probability distribution  functions of massive gmcs	we report the novel detection of complex high-column density tails in theprobability distribution functions (pdfs) for three high-mass star-formingregions (cepob3, monr2, ngc6334), obtained from dust emission observed withherschel. the low column density range can be fit with a lognormaldistribution. a first power-law tail starts above an extinction (av) of ~6-14.it has a slope of alpha=1.3-2 for the rho~r^-alpha profile for an equivalentdensity distribution (spherical or cylindrical geometry), and is thusconsistent with free-fall gravitational collapse. above av~40, 60, and 140, wedetect an excess that can be fitted by a flatter power law tail with alpha&gt;2.it correlates with the central regions of the cloud (ridges/hubs) of size ~1 pcand densities above 10^4 cm^-3. this excess may be caused by physical processesthat slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass towards higher densities.possible are: 1. rotation, which introduces an angular momentum barrier, 2.increasing optical depth and weaker cooling, 3. magnetic fields, 4. geometricaleffects, and 5. protostellar feedback. the excess/second power-law tail isclosely linked to high-mass star-formation though it does not imply a universalcolumn density threshold for the formation of (high-mass) stars.

1508.03801	velocity-resolved [cii] emission and [cii]/fir mapping along orion with  herschel	we present the first 7.5'x11.5' velocity-resolved map of the [cii]158um linetoward the orion molecular cloud-1 (omc-1) taken with the herschel/hifiinstrument. in combination with far-infrared (fir) photometric images andvelocity-resolved maps of the h41alpha hydrogen recombination and co j=2-1lines, this data set provides an unprecedented view of the intricatesmall-scale kinematics of the ionized/pdr/molecular gas interfaces and of theradiative feedback from massive stars. the main contribution to the [cii]luminosity (~85%) is from the extended, fuv-illuminated face of the cloudg_0&gt;500, n_h&gt;5x10^3 cm^-3) and from dense pdrs (g_0~10^4, n_h~10^5 cm^-3) atthe interface between omc-1 and the hii region surrounding the trapeziumcluster. around 15% of the [cii] emission arises from a different gas componentwithout co counterpart. the [cii] excitation, pdr gas turbulence, line opacity(from [13cii]) and role of the geometry of the illuminating stars with respectto the cloud are investigated. we construct maps of the [cii]/fir and fir/m_gasratios and show that [cii]/fir decreases from the extended cloud component(10^-2-10^-3) to the more opaque star-forming cores (10^-3-10^-4). the lowestvalues are reminiscent of the "[cii] deficit" seen in local ultra-luminous irgalaxies hosting vigorous star formation. spatial correlation analysis showsthat the decreasing [cii]/fir ratio correlates better with the column densityof dust through the molecular cloud than with fir/m_gas. we conclude that the[cii] emitting column relative to the total dust column along each line ofsight is responsible for the observed [cii]/fir variations through the cloud.

1508.06699	disentangling the excitation conditions of the dense gas in m17 sw	we probe the chemical and energetic conditions in dense gas created byradiative feedback through observations of multiple co, hcn and hco$^+$transitions toward the dense core of m17 sw. we used the dual band receivergreat on board the sofia airborne telescope to obtain maps of the $j=16-15$,$j=12-11$, and $j=11-10$ transitions of $^{12}$co. we compare these maps withcorresponding apex and iram 30m telescope data for low- and mid-$j$ co, hcn andhco$^+$ emission lines, including maps of the hcn $j=8-7$ and hco$^+$ $j=9-8$transitions. the excitation conditions of $^{12}$co, hco$^+$ and hcn areestimated with a two-phase non-lte radiative transfer model of the linespectral energy distributions (lseds) at four selected positions. the energybalance at these positions is also studied. we obtained extensive lseds for theco, hcn and hco$^+$ molecules toward m17 sw. the lsed shape, particularly thehigh-$j$ tail of the co lines observed with sofia/great, is distinctive for theunderlying excitation conditions. the critical magnetic field criterion impliesthat the cold cloudlets at two positions are partially controlled by processesthat create and dissipate internal motions. supersonic but sub-alfv\'enicvelocities in the cold component at most selected positions indicates thatinternal motions are likely mhd waves. magnetic pressure dominates thermalpressure in both gas components at all selected positions, assuming randomorientation of the magnetic field. the magnetic pressure of a constant magneticfield throughout all the gas phases can support the total internal pressure ofthe cold components, but it cannot support the internal pressure of the warmcomponents. if the magnetic field scales as $b \propto n^{2/3}$, then theevolution of the cold cloudlets at two selected positions, and the warmcloudlets at all selected positions, will be determined by ambipolar diffusion.

1512.00904	velocity resolved [cii] spectroscopy of the center and the bclmp302  region of m33 (herm33es)	we aim to understand the contribution of the ionized, atomic and molecularphases of the ism to the [cii] emission from clouds near the dynamical centerand the bclmp302 hii region in the north of the nearby galaxy m33 at a spatialresolution of 50pc. we combine high resolution [cii] spectra taken with thehifi spectrometer onboard the herschel satellite with [cii] herschel-pacs mapsand ground-based observations of co(2-1) and hi. all data are at a commonspatial resolution of 50pc. typically, the [cii] lines have widths intermediatebetween the narrower co(2-1) and broader hi line profiles. we decomposed the[cii] spectra in terms of contribution from molecular and atomic gas detectedin co(2-1) and hi, respectively. we find that the relative contribution ofmolecular and atomic gas traced by co(2-1) and hi varies depends mostly on thelocal physical conditions and geometry. we estimate that 11-60% and 5-34% ofthe [cii] intensities in the center and in bclmp302, respectively, arise atvelocities showing no co(2-1) or hi emission and could arise in co-darkmolecular gas. the deduced strong variation in the [cii] emission notassociated with co and hi cannot be explained in terms of differences in a_v,far-ultraviolet radiation field, and metallicity between the two studiedregions. hence the relative amounts of diffuse (co-dark) and dense moleculargas possibly vary on spatial scales smaller than 50pc. based on the emissionmeasure observed at radio wavelengths we estimate the contribution of ionizedgas at a few positions to lie between 10-25%. the correlations between theintensities of tracers corresponding to the same velocity range as [cii],differ from the correlation derived from pacs data. the results in this paperemphasize the need for velocity-resolved observations to discern thecontribution of different components of the ism to [cii] emission.

0807.1988	a clumpy-cloud pdr model of the global far-infrared line emission of the  milky way	the fractal structure of the interstellar medium suggests that theinteraction of uv radiation with the ism as described in the context ofphoton-dominated regions (pdr) dominates most of the physical and chemicalconditions, and hence the far-infrared and submm emission from the ism in themilky way. we investigate to what extent the galactic fir line emission of theimportant species co, c, c+, and o, as observed by the cosmic backgroundexplorer (cobe) satellite can be modeled in the framework of a clumpy,uv-penetrated cloud scenario. the far-infrared line emission of the milky wayis modeled as the emission from an ensemble of clumps with a power law clumpmass spectrum and mass-size relation with power-law indices consistent with theobserved ism structure. the individual clump line intensities are calculatedusing the kosma-tau pdr-model for spherical clumps. the model parameters forthe cylindrically symmetric galactic distribution of the mass density andvolume filling factor are determined by the observed radial distributions. aconstant fuv intensity, in which the clumps are embedded, is assumed. we showthat this scenario can explain, without any further assumptions and within afactor of about 2, the absolute fir-line intensities and their distributionwith galactic longitude as observed by cobe.

astro-ph;0602265	interstellar cloud structure: the statistics of centroid velocities	the investigation of the statistical properties of maps of line centroids hasbeen used for almost 50 years, but there is still no general agreement on theirinterpretation. we try to quantify which properties of underlying turbulentvelocity fields can be derived from centroid velocity maps, and we testconditions under which the scaling behaviour of the centroid velocities matchesthe scaling of the three-dimensional velocity field. using fractal cloud modelswe study systematically the relation between three-dimensional density andvelocity fields and the statistical properties of the produced line centroidmaps. we put special attention to cases with large density fluctuationsresembling supersonic interstellar turbulence. starting from the delta-varianceanalysis we derive a new tool to compute the scaling behaviour of thethree-dimensional velocity field from observed intensity and centroid velocitymaps. we provide two criteria to decide whether the information from thecentroid velocities directly reflects the properties of the underlying velocityfield. applying these criteria allows to understand the different results foundso far in the literature on the interpretation of the statistics of velocitycentroids. a new iteration scheme can be used to derive the three-dimensionalvelocity scaling from centroid velocity maps for arbitrary density and velocityfields, but it requires an accurate knowledge of the average density of theconsidered interstellar cloud.
