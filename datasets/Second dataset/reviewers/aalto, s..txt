0906.5154	probing x-ray irradiation in the nucleus of ngc 1068 with observations  of high-j lines of dense gas tracers	with the incorporation of high-j molecular lines, we aim to constrain thephysical conditions of the dense gas in the central region of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and to determine signatures of the agn or the starburstcontribution.  we used the james clerk maxwell telescope to observe the j=4-3 transition ofhcn, hnc, and hco+, as well as the cn n_j=2_{5/2}-1_{3/2} andn_j=3_{5/2}-2_{5/2}, in ngc 1068.  we estimate the excitation conditions of hcn, hnc, and cn, based on the lineintensity ratios and radiative transfer models.  we find that the bulk emission of hcn, hnc, cn, and the high-j hco+ emergefrom dense gas n(h_2)&gt;=10^5 cm^-3). however, the low-j hco+ lines (dominatingthe hco+ column density) trace less dense (n(h_2)&lt;10^5 cm^-3) and colder(t_k&lt;=20 k) gas, whereas the high-j hco+ emerges from warmer (&gt;30 k) gas thanthe other molecules.  the hco+ j=4-3 line intensity, compared with the lower transition lines andwith the hcn j=4-3 line, support the influence of a local xdr environment. theestimated n(cn)/n(hcn)~1-4 column density ratios are indicative of an xdr/agnenvironment with a possible contribution of grain-surface chemistry induced byx-rays or shocks.

0909.0852	the molecular gas content of the advanced s+e merger ngc 4441 - evidence  for an extended decoupled nuclear disc?	mergers between a spiral and an elliptical (s+e mergers) are poorly studiedso far despite the importance for galaxy evolution. ngc4441 is a nearbycandidate for an advanced remnant of such a merger, showing typical tidalstructures like an optical tail and two shells as well as two hi tails. thestudy of the molecular gas content gives clues on the impact of the recentmerger event on the star formation. simulations of s+e mergers predictcontradictory scenarios concerning the strength and the extent of an inducedstarburst. thus, observations of the amount and the distribution of themolecular gas, the raw material of star formation, are needed to understand theinfluence of the merger on the star formation history. 12co and 13co (1-0) and(2-1) observations were obtained using the onsala space observatory 20m andiram 30m telescope as well as the plateau de bure interferometer. these dataallow us to carry out a basic analysis of the molecular gas properties such asestimates of the molecular gas mass, its temperature and density and the starformation efficiency. the co observations reveal an extended molecular gasreservoir out to ~4kpc, with a total molecular gas mass of ~5x10^8 m_sun.furthermore, high resolution imaging shows a central molecular gas feature,most likely a rotating disc hosting most of the molecular gas ~4x10^8 m_sun.this nuclear disc shows a different sense of rotation than the large-scale histructure, indicating a kinematically decoupled core.

1003.2903	star-formation in the central kpc of the starburst/liner galaxy ngc1614	a high angular resolution, multi-wavelength study of the liner galaxy ngc1614has been carried out. ovro co 1-0 observations are presented together withextensive multi-frequency radio continuum and hi absorption observations withthe vla and merlin. toward the center of ngc1614, we have detected a ring ofradio continuum emission with a radius of 300 pc. this ring is coincident withprevious radio and paschen-alpha observations. the dynamical mass of the ringbased on hi absorption is 3.1 x 10e9 msun. the peak of the integrated co 1-0emission is shifted by 1" to the north-west of the ring center and asignificant fraction of the co emission is associated with a crossing dustlane. an upper limit to the molecular gas mass in the ring region is 1.7 x 10e9msun. inside the ring, there is a north to south elongated 1.4ghz radiocontinuum feature with a nuclear peak. this peak is also seen in the 5ghz radiocontinuum and in the co. we suggest that the r=300 pc star forming ringrepresents the radius of a dynamical resonance - as an alternative to thescenario that the starburst is propagating outwards from the center into amolecular ring. the ring-like appearance probably part of a spiral structure.substantial amounts of molecular gas have passed the radius of the ring andreached the nuclear region. the nuclear peak seen in 5ghz radio continuum andco is likely related to previous star formation, where all molecular gas wasnot consumed. the liner-like optical spectrum observed in ngc1614 may be due tonuclear starburst activity, and not to an active galactic nucleus (agn).although the presence of an agn cannot be excluded.

1003.3141	vibrationally excited hc3n in ngc 4418	we investigate the molecular gas properties of the deeply obscured luminousinfrared galaxy ngc 4418. we address the excitation of the complex moleculehc3n to determine whether its unusually luminous emission is related to thenature of the buried nuclear source. we use iram 30m and jcmt observations ofrotational and vibrational lines of hc3n to model the excitation of themolecule by means of rotational diagrams. we report the first confirmedextragalactic detection of vibrational lines of hc3n. we detect 6 differentrotational transitions ranging from j=10-9 to j=30-29 in the ground vibrationalstate and obtain a tentative detection of the j=38-37 line. we also detect 7rotational transitions of the vibrationally excited states v6 and v7, withangular momenta ranging from j=10-9 to 28-27. the energies of the upper statesof the observed transitions range from 20 to 850 k. in the optically thinregime, we find that the rotational transitions of the vibrational ground statecan be fitted for two temperatures, 30 k and 260 k, while the vibrationallyexcited levels can be fitted for a rotational temperature of 90 k and avibrational temperature of 500 k. in the inner 300 pc of ngc 4418, we estimatea high hc3n abundance, of the order of 10^-7. the excitation of the hc3nmolecule responds strongly to the intense radiation field and the presence ofwarm, dense gas and dust at the center of ngc 4418. the intense hc3n lineemission is a result of both high abundances and excitation. the properties ofthe hc3n emitting gas are similar to those found for hot cores in sgr b2, whichimplies that the nucleus (&lt; 300 pc) of ngc 4418 is reminiscent of a hot core.the potential presence of a compact, hot component (t=500 k) is also discussed.

1005.1263	molecular gas chemistry in agn. ii. high-resolution imaging of sio  emission in ngc1068: shocks or xdr?	this paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from themolecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (cnd) of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068.single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of siliconmonoxide(sio) in the cnd of ngc1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude withrespect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in thegalaxy. we aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the sio enhancement. wehave imaged with the iram plateau de bure interferometer the emission of thesio(2-1) and cn(2--1) lines in ngc1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,respectively. we have also obtained complementary iram 30m observations of hncoand methanol (ch3oh) lines. sio is detected in a disk of 400pc size around theagn. sio abundances in the cnd of (1-5)xe-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitudeabove those measured in the starburst ring. the overall abundance of cn in thecnd is high: (0.2-1)xe-07. the abundances of sio and cn are enhanced at theextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the agn(r&lt;70pc). abundances measured for cn and sio, and the correlation of cn/co andsio/co ratios with hard x-ray irradiation, suggest that the cnd of ngc1068 hasbecome a giant x-ray dominated region (xdr). the extreme properties ofmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of ngc1068 result from theinterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.whereas xdr chemistry offers a simple explanation for cn and sio in ngc1068,the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. the inclusion of dust grainchemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of othermolecular species, like hcn, which are under-predicted by xdr models.

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1005.3422	cool gas and dust in m33: results from the herschel m33 extended survey  (herm33es)	we present an analysis of the first space-based far-ir-submm observations ofm 33, which measure the emission from the cool dust and resolve the giantmolecular cloud complexes. with roughly half-solar abundances, m33 is a firststep towards young low-metallicity galaxies where the submm may be able toprovide an alternative to co mapping to measure their h$_2$ content. in thisletter, we measure the dust emission cross-section $\sigma$ using spire andrecent co and \hi\ observations; a variation in $\sigma$ is present from anear-solar neighborhood cross-section to about half-solar with the maximumbeing south of the nucleus. calculating the total h column density from themeasured dust temperature and cross-section, and then subtracting the \hi\column, yields a morphology similar to that observed in co. the h$_2$/\hi\ massratio decreases from about unity to well below 10% and is about 15% averagedover the optical disk. the single most important observation to reduce thepotentially large systematic errors is to complete the co mapping of m 33.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

1007.0692	multi-transition study of m51's molecular gas spiral arms	two selected regions in the molecular gas spiral arms in m51 were mapped withthe owens valley radio observatory (ovro) mm-interferometer in the 12co(2-1),13co(1-0), c18o(1-0), hcn(1-0) and hco+(1-0) emission lines. the co data havebeen combined with the 12co(1-0) data from aalto et al. (1999) covering thecentral 3.5kpc to study the physical properties of the molecular gas. all codata cubes were short spacing corrected using iram 30m (12co(1-0): nro 45m)single dish data. a large velocity gradient (lvg) analysis finds that the giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) are similar to galactic gmcs when studied at 180pc(120pc) resolution with an average kinetic temperature of t_kin = 20(16)k andh_2 density of n(h_2) = 120(240)cm^(-3) when assuming virialized clouds (aconstant velocity gradient dv/dr. the associated conversion factor between h_2mass and co luminosity is close to the galactic value for most regionsanalyzed. our findings suggest that the gmc population in the spiral arms ofm51 is similar to those of the milky way and therefore the strong starformation occurring in the spiral arms has no strong impact on the moleculargas in the spiral arms. extinction inferred from the derived h_2 column densityis very high (a_v about 15 - 30 mag), about a factor of 5-10 higher than theaverage value derived toward hii regions. thus a significant fraction of theongoing star formation could be hidden inside the dust lanes of the spiralarms. a comparison of mips 24um and h_alpha data, however, suggests that thisis not the case and most of the gmcs studied here are not (yet) forming stars.we also present low (4.5") resolution ovro maps of the hcn(1-0) and hco+(1-0)emission at the location of the brightest 12co(1-0) peak.

1008.2095	13co 1-0 imaging of the medusa merger, ngc4194	studying molecular gas properties in merging galaxies gives important cluesto the onset and evolution of interaction-triggered starbursts. the co/13co 1-0line intensity ratio can be used as a tracer of how dynamics and star formationprocesses impact the gas properties. the medusa (ngc~4194) merger isparticularly interesting to study since its lfir/lco ratio rivals that ofultraluminous galaxies (ulirgs), despite the comparatively modest luminosity,indicating an exceptionally high star formation efficiency (sfe) in the medusamerger.  interferometric ovro observations of co and 13co 1-0 in the medusa show theco/13co intensity ratio increases from normal, quiescent values (7-10) in theouter parts (r&gt;2 kpc) of the galaxy to high (16 to &gt;40) values in the central(r&lt;1 kpc) starburst region. in the centre there is an east-west gradient wherethe line ratio changes by more than a factor of three over 5" (945 pc). theintegrated 13co emission peaks in the north-western starburst region while thecentral co emission is strongly associated with the prominent crossingdust-lane. we discuss the central east-west gradient in the context of gasproperties in the starburst and the central dust lane. we suggest that thecentral gradient is mainly caused by diffuse gas in the dust lane. in thisscenario, the actual molecular mass distribution is better traced by the 13co1-0 emission than the co. the possibilities of temperature and abundancegradients are also discussed. we compare the central gas properties of themedusa to those of other minor mergers and suggest that the extreme andtransient phase of the medusa star formation activity has similar traits tothose of high-redshift galaxies.

1012.3753	the submillimeter array 1.3 mm line survey of arp 220	we present the first aperture synthesis unbiased spectral line survey towardan extragalactic object. the survey covered the 40 ghz frequency range between202 and 242 ghz of the 1.3 mm atmospheric window. we find that 80% of theobserved band shows molecular emission, with 73 features identified from 15molecular species and 6 isotopologues. the 13c isotopic substitutions of hc3nand transitions from h2(18)o, 29sio, and ch2co are detected for the first timeoutside the galaxy. within the broad observed band, we estimate that 28% of thetotal measured flux is due to the molecular line contribution, with co onlycontributing 9% to the overall flux. we present maps of the co emission at aresolution of 2.9"x1.9" which, though not enough to resolve the two nuclei,recover all the single-dish flux. the 40 ghz spectral scan has been modelledassuming lte conditions and abundances are derived for all identified species.the chemical composition of arp 220 shows no clear evidence of an agn impact onthe molecular emission but seems indicative of a purely starburst-heated ism.the overabundance of h2s and the low isotopic ratios observed suggest achemically enriched environment by consecutive bursts of star formation, withan ongoing burst at an early evolutionary stage. the large abundance of water(~10^-5), derived from the isotopologue h2(18)o, as well as the vibrationallyexcited emission from hc3n and ch3cn are claimed to be evidence of massive starforming regions within arp 220. moreover, the observations put strongconstraints on the compactness of the starburst event in arp 220. we estimatethat such emission would require ~2-8x10^6 hot cores, similar to those found inthe sgr b2 region in the galactic center, concentrated within the central 700pc of arp 220.

1101.0682	h3o+ line emission from starbursts and agns	we use the h3o+ molecule to investigate the impact of starburst and agnactivity on the chemistry of the molecular interstellar medium. using the jcmt,we have observed the 3+_2 - 2-_2 364 ghz line of p-h3o+ towards the centers ofseven active galaxies. we have detected p-h3o+ towards ic342, ngc253, ngc1068,ngc4418, and ngc6240. upper limits were obtained for iras15250 and arp299. wefind large h3o+ abundances (n(h3o+)/n(h2)&gt;10^{-8}) in all detected galaxiesapart from in ic342 where it is about one order of magnitude lower. we note,however, that uncertainties in n(h3o+) may be significant due to lack ofdefinite information on source size and excitation. we furthermore compare thederived n(h3o+) with n(hco+) and find that the h3o+ to hco+ column densityratio is large in ngc1068 (24), moderate in ngc4418 and ngc253 (4-5), slightlyless than unity in ngc6240 (0.7) and lowest in ic342 (0.2-0.6). we compare ourresults with models of x-ray and photon dominated regions (xdrs and pdrs). foric342 we find that a starburst pdr chemistry can explain the observed h3o+abundance. for the other galaxies, the large h3o+ columns are generallyconsistent with xdr models. in particular for ngc1068 the elevatedn(h3o+)/n(hco+) ratio suggests a low column density xdr. for ngc4418 however,large hc3n abundances are inconsistent with the xdr interpretation. analternative possibility is that h3o+ forms through h2o evaporating off dustgrains and reacting with hco+ in warm, dense gas. this scenario could alsopotentially fit the results for ngc253. further studies of the excitation anddistribution of h3o+ - as well as herschel observations of water abundances -will help to further constrain the models.

[...] a total of 28 different species, plus 8 isotopicvariants, were detected toward the south-west absorption region, located about2 kpc from the center of the z=0.89 galaxy, which therefore has the largestnumber of detected molecular species of any extragalactic object so far. theresults of our rotation diagram analysis show that the rotation temperaturesare close to the cosmic microwave background temperature of 5.14 k that weexpect to measure at z=0.89, whereas the kinetic temperature is one order ofmagnitude higher, indicating that the gas is subthermally excited. themolecular fractional abundances are found to be in-between those in typicalgalactic diffuse and translucent clouds, and clearly deviate from thoseobserved in the dark cloud tmc 1 or in the galactic center giant molecularcloud sgr b2. the isotopic ratios of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicondeviate significantly from the solar values, which can be linked to the youngage of the z=0.89 galaxy and a release of nucleosynthesis products dominated bymassive stars. [...] we also report the discovery of several new absorptioncomponents, with velocities spanning between -300 and +170 km/s. finally, theline centroids of several species (e.g., ch3oh, nh3) are found to besignificantly offset from the average velocity. if caused by a variation in theproton-to-electron mass ratio mu with redshift, these offsets yield an upperlimit |delta_mu/mu|&lt;4e-6, which takes into account the kinematical noiseproduced by the velocity dispersion measured from a large number of molecularspecies.

1106.5464	the herschel m33 extended survey (herm33es): pacs spectroscopy of the  star forming region bclmp 302	context: the emission line of [cii] at 158 micron is one of the strongestcooling lines of the interstellar medium (ism) in galaxies. aims: disentanglingthe relative contributions of the different ism phases to [cii] emission, is amajor topic of the herm33es program, a herschel key project to study the ism inthe nearby spiral galaxy m33. methods: using pacs, we have mapped the emissionof [cii] 158 micron, [oi] 63 micron, and other fir lines in a 2'x2' region ofthe northern spiral arm of m33, centered on the hii region bclmp302. at thepeak of h-alpha emission, we have observed in addition a velocity resolved[cii] spectrum using hifi. we use scatterplots to compare these data with pacs160 micron continuum maps, and with maps of co and hi data, at a commonresolution of 12 arcsec or 50 pc. maps of h-alpha and 24 micron emissionobserved with spitzer are used to estimate the sfr. we have created maps of the[cii] and [oi] 63 micron emission and detected [nii] 122 micron and niii 57micron at individual positions. results: the [cii] line observed with hifi issignificantly broader than that of co, and slightly blue-shifted. in addition,there is little spatial correlation between [cii] observed with pacs and coover the mapped region. there is even less spatial correlation between [cii]and the atomic gas traced by hi. detailed comparison of the observedintensities towards the hii region with models of photo ionization and photondominated regions, confirms that a significant fraction, 20--30%, of theobserved [cii] emission stems from the ionized gas and not from the molecularcloud. the gas heating efficiency, using the ratio between [cii] and the tir asa proxy, varies between 0.07 and 1.5%, with the largest variations foundoutside the hii region.

1111.6762	detection of hcn, hco+ and hnc in the mrk231 molecular outflow - dense  molecular gas in the agn wind	we detect luminous emission from hcn, hco+ and hnc 1--0 in the qso ulirgmrk~231 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer at 1."55 by 1."28resolution. all three lines show broad line wings - which are particularlyprominent for hcn. velocities are found to be similar (750 km/s) to those foundfor co 1-0. this is the first time bright hcn, hco+ and hnc emission has beendetected in a large-scale galactic outflow. we find that both the blue- andred-shifted line wings are spatially extended by at least 0."75 (700 pc) in anorth-south direction. the line wings are brighter (relative to the line centerintensity) in hcn than in co 1-0 and line ratios suggest that the molecularoutflow consists of dense (n&gt;10e4 cme-3) and clumpy gas with a high hcnabundance x(hcn)&gt;10e-8. these properties are consistent with the molecular gasbeing compressed and fragmented by shocks in the outflow. alternatively, hcn isinstead pumped by mid-ir continuum, but we propose that this effect is notstrong for the spatially extended outflowing gas. in addition, we find that therotation of the main disk, in east-west direction, is also evident in the hcn,hco+ and hnc line emission. an unexpectedly bright hc3n 10-9 line is detectedinside the central 400 pc of mrk231. this hc3n emission may emerge from ashielded, dust-enshrouded region within the inner 40-50 pc where the gas isheated to high temperatures (200 - 300 k) by the agn.

1210.3263	dense gas in m33 (herm33es)	we aim to better understand the emission of molecular tracers of the diffuseand dense gas in giant molecular clouds and the influence that metallicity,optical extinction, density, far-uv field, and star formation rate have onthese tracers. using the iram 30m telescope, we detected hcn, hco+, 12co, and13co in six gmcs along the major axis of m33 at a resolution of ~ 114pc and outto a radial distance of 3.4kpc. optical, far-infrared, and submillimeter datafrom herschel and other observatories complement these observations. tointerpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of modelsof photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for m33-type subsolarmetallicity. the observed hco+/hcn line ratios range between 1.1 and 2.5.similarly high ratios have been observed in the large magellanic cloud. thehcn/co ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of m33. the 12co/13coline ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffusegas and the centers of gmcs of the milky way. stacking of all spectra allowedhnc and c2h to be detected. the resulting hco+/hnc and hcn/hnc ratios of ~ 8and 6, respectively, lie at the high end of ratios observed in a large set of(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. hcn abundances are lower in the subsolarmetallicity pdr models, while hco+ abundances are enhanced. for hcn this effectis more pronounced at low optical extinctions. the observed hco+/hcn and hcn/coline ratios are naturally explained by subsolar pdr models of low opticalextinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -3x10^4 cm^-3, while the fuv field strength only has a small effect on themodeled line ratios. the line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by thesolar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play aminor role in influencing these line ratios.

1211.6659	evidence for co shock excitation in ngc 6240 from herschel spire  spectroscopy	we present herschel spire fts spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infraredgalaxy ngc 6240. in total 20 lines are detected, including co j=4-3 throughj=13-12, 6 h2o rotational lines, and [ci] and [nii] fine-structure lines. theco to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in ngc 6240 than mrk 231.although the co ladders of ngc 6240 and mrk 231 are very similar, uv and/orx-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gasin ngc 6240. we applied both c and j shock models to the h2 v=1-0 s(1) andv=2-1 s(1) lines and the co rotational ladder. the co ladder is best reproducedby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_h=5 *10^4 cm^-3. we find that the solution best fitting the h2 lines is degenerate:the shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1and n_h=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. the h2 lines thus need a much morepowerful shock than the co lines. we deduce that most of the gas is currentlymoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction(&lt; 1 percent) of the ism is exposed to the high velocity shocks. this impliesthat the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. we argue that ahigh co line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

1211.7142	the thermal state of molecular clouds in the galactic center: evidence  for non-photon-driven heating	we used the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex) 12 m telescope to observethe j_kakc=3_03-2_02, 3_22-2_21, and 3_21-2_20 transitions of para-h_2co at 218ghz simultaneously to determine kinetic temperatures of the dense gas in thecentral molecular zone (cmz) of our galaxy. the map extends over approximately40 arcmin x 8 arcmin (~100x20 pc^2) along the galactic plane with a linearresolution of 1.2 pc. the strongest of the three lines, the h_2co (3_03-2_02)transition, is found to be widespread, and its emission shows a spatialdistribution similar to ammonia. the relative abundance of para-h_2co is0.5-1.2 10^{-9}, which is consistent with results from lower frequency h_2coabsorption lines. derived gas kinetic temperatures for individual molecularclouds range from 50 k to values in excess of 100 k. while a systematic trendtoward (decreasing) kinetic temperature versus (increasing) angular distancefrom the galactic center (gc) is not found, the clouds with highest temperature(t_kin &gt; 100 k) are all located near the nucleus. for the molecular gas outsidethe dense clouds, the average kinetic temperature is 65+/-10 k. the hightemperatures of molecular clouds on large scales in the gc region may be drivenby turbulent energy dissipation and/or cosmic-rays instead of photons. such anon-photon-driven thermal state of the molecular gas provides an excellenttemplate for the more distant vigorous starbursts found in ultraluminousinfrared galaxies (ulirgs).

1303.1012	the ngc 1614 interacting galaxy: molecular gas feeding a "ring of fire"	minor mergers frequently occur between giant and gas-rich low mass galaxiesand can provide significant amounts of interstellar matter to refuel starformation and power agn in the giant systems. major starbursts and/or agnresult when fresh gas is transported and compressed in the central regions ofthe giant galaxy. this is the situation in ngc1614, whose molecular medium weexplore at half arcsecond angular resolution through our observations of12co(2-1) emission using the sma. we compare our maps with optical and paalpha, hst and high angular resolution radio continuum images to study therelationships between dense molecular gas and the starburst region. the mostintense co emission occurs in a partial ring with ~230pc radius around thecenter, with an extension to the north-west into the dust lane that containsdiffuse molecular gas. we resolve 10 gmas in the ring which has an integratedmolecular mass of ~8x10^8m_sun. our observations filter out a large part of theco(1-0) emission mapped at shorter spacings, indicating that most of themolecular gas is diffuse and that gmas only exist near and within thecircumnuclear ring. the molecular ring is uneven with most of the mass on thewestern side, which also contains gmas extending into a pronounced tidal dustlane. the spatial and kinematic patterns suggest that the northwest extensionof the ring is a cosmic umbilical cord that is feeding molecular gas associatedwith the dust lane and tidal debris into the nuclear ring. the astrophysicalprocess for producing a ring structure is not fully understood, but thepresence of numerous gmas suggests an orbit crowding or resonance phenomenon.there is some evidence that star formation is progressing radially outwardswithin the ring, indicating that a self-triggering mechanism may also affectthese processes.

1309.0638	probing the jet base of the blazar pks1830-211 from the chromatic  variability of its lensed images. serendipitous alma observations of a strong  gamma-ray flare	the launching mechanism of the jets of active galactic nuclei isobservationally poorly constrained, due to the large distances to these objectsand the very small scales (sub-parsec) involved. in order to better constraintheoretical models, it is especially important to get information from theregion close to the physical base of the jet, where the plasma accelerationtakes place. in this paper, we report multi-epoch and multi-frequency continuumobservations of the z=2.5 blazar pks1830-211 with alma, serendipitouslycoincident with a strong $\gamma$-ray flare reported by fermi-lat. the blazaris lensed by a foreground z=0.89 galaxy, with two bright images of the compactcore separated by 1". our alma observations individually resolve these twoimages (although not any of their substructures), and we study the change oftheir relative flux ratio with time (four epochs spread over nearly three timesthe time delay between the two lensed images) and frequency (between 350 and1050 ghz, rest-frame of the blazar), during the $\gamma$-ray flare. inparticular, we detect a remarkable frequency-dependent behaviour of the fluxratio, which implies the presence of a chromatic structure in the blazar (i.e.,a core-shift effect). we rule out the possiblity of micro- and milli-lensingeffects and propose instead a simple model of plasmon ejection in the blazar'sjet to explain the time and frequency variability of the flux ratio. we suggestthat pks1830-211 is likely one of the best sources to probe the activity at thebase of a blazar's jet at submillimeter wavelengths, thanks to the peculiargeometry of the system. the implications of the core-shift in absorptionstudies of the foreground z=0.89 galaxy (e.g., constraints on the cosmologicalvariations of fundamental constants) are discussed.

1310.3074	the mrk 231 molecular outflow as seen in oh	we report on the herschel/pacs observations of oh in mrk 231, with detectionsin 9 doublets observed within the pacs range, and present radiative transfermodels for the outflowing oh. signatures of outflowing gas are found in up to 6oh doublets with different excitation requirements. at least two outflowingcomponents are identified, one with oh radiatively excited, and the other withlow excitation, presumably spatially extended. particularly prominent, the bluewing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2pi_{3/2} j=9/2-7/2 oh doubletat 65 um, with e_lower=290 k, indicates that the excited outflowing gas isgenerated in a compact and warm (circum)nuclear region. because the excited,outflowing oh gas in mrk 231 is associated with the warm, far-ir continuumsource, it is likely more compact (diameter of 200-300 pc) than that probed byco and hcn. nevertheless, its mass-outflow rate per unit of solid angle asinferred from oh is similar to that previously derived from co,&gt;~70x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1} sr^{-1}, where x_{oh} is the ohabundance relative to h nuclei. in spherical symmetry, this would correspond to&gt;~850x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1}, though significant collimation isinferred from the line profiles. the momentum flux of the excited componentattains ~15 l_{agn}/c, with an oh column density of (1.5-3)x10^{17} cm^-2 and amechanical luminosity of ~10^{11} lsun. the detection of very excited ohpeaking at central velocities indicates the presence of a nuclear reservoir ofgas rich in oh, plausibly the 130-pc scale circumnuclear torus previouslydetected in oh megamaser emission, that may be feeding the outflow. anexceptional ^{18}oh enhancement, with oh/^{18}oh&lt;~30 at both central andblueshifted velocities, is likely the result of interstellar-medium processingby recent starburst/sne activity.

1311.2595	massive molecular outflows and evidence for agn feedback from co  observations	we study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gasand investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. we present new iram pdbico(1-0) observations of local ulirgs and qso hosts: clear signature of massiveand energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in theco(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates ofseveral 100 msun/yr. we combine these new observations with data from theliterature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflowswithin an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. we find thatstarburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their sfr, oreven higher by a factor of ~ 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed beeffective in removing cold gas from galaxies. nevertheless, our results suggestthat the presence of an agn can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, whichis found to increase with the l_agn/l_bol ratio. the gas depletion time-scalesdue to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosityof an agn in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years instarburst galaxies, down to just a few million years in galaxies hostingpowerful agns. in quasar hosts the depletion time-scales due to the outflow aremuch shorter than the depletion time-scales due to star formation. we estimatethe outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful agns, itcorresponds to about 5% of the agn luminosity, as expected by models of agnfeedback. moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 l_agn/c are commonamong the agn-dominated sources in our sample. for "pure" starburst galaxiesour data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostlymomentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds.

1403.3782	the radio core structure of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 4418	the galaxy ngc 4418 contains one of the most compact obscured nuclei within aluminous infrared galaxy (lirg) in the nearby universe. this nucleus contains arich molecular gas environment and an unusually high ratio of infrared to radioluminosity (q-factor). the compact nucleus is powered by either a compactstarburst or an active galactic nucleus (agn). the aim of this study is toconstrain the nature of the nuclear region (starburst or agn) within ngc 4418via very-high-resolution radio imaging. archival data from radio observationsusing the evn and merlin interferometers are imaged. sizes and flux densitiesare obtained by fitting gaussian intensity distributions to the image. theaverage spectral index of the compact radio emission is estimated frommeasurements at 1.4 ghz and 5.0 ghz. the nuclear structure of ngc 4418 visiblewith evn and merlin consists of eight compact (&lt;49 mas i.e. &lt;8 pc) featuresspread within a region of 250 mas, i.e. 41 pc. we derive an inverted spectralindex $\alpha\ge0.7$ ($s_\nu\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) for the compact radioemission. brightness temperatures $&gt;10^{4.8}$ k indicate that these compactfeatures cannot be hii-regions. the complex morphology and inverted spectrum ofthe eight detected compact features is evidence against the hypothesis that anagn alone is powering the nucleus of ngc 4418. the compact features could besuper star clusters (sscs) with intense star formation, and their associatedfree-free absorption could then naturally explain both their inverted radiospectrum and the low radio to ir ratio of the nucleus. the required starformation area density is extreme, however, and close to the limit of what canbe observed in a well-mixed thermal/non-thermal plasma produced bystar-formation, and is also close to the limit of what can be physicallysustained.

1406.5110	modeling the h2o submillimeter emission in extragalactic sources	recent observational studies have shown that h2o emission at (rest)submillimeter wavelengths is ubiquitous in infrared galaxies, both in the localand in the early universe, suggestive of far-infrared pumping of h2o by dust inwarm regions. in this work, models are presented that show that (i) thehighest-lying h2o lines (e_{upper}&gt;400 k) are formed in very warm (t_{dust}&gt;~90k) regions and require high h2o columns (n_{h2o}&gt;~3x10^{17} cm^{-2}), whilelower lying lines can be efficiently excited with t_{dust}~45-75 k andn_{h2o}~(0.5-2)x10^{17} cm^{-2}; (ii) significant collisional excitation of thelowest lying (e_{upper}&lt;200 k) levels, which enhances the overalll_{h2o}-l_{ir} ratios, is identified in sources where the ground-state para-h2o1_{11}-0_{00} line is detected in emission; (iii) the h2o-to-infrared (8-1000um) luminosity ratio is expected to decrease with increasing t_{dust} for alllines with e_{upper}&lt;~300 k, as has recently been reported in a sample oflirgs, but increases with t_{dust} for the highest lying h2o lines(e_{upper}&gt;400 k); (iv) we find theoretical upper limits for l_{h2o}/l_{ir} inwarm environments, owing to h2o line saturation; (v) individual models arepresented for two very different prototypical galaxies, the seyfert 2 galaxyngc 1068 and the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp 220, showing thatthe excited submillimeter h2o emission is dominated by far-infrared pumping inboth cases; (vi) the l_{h2o}-l_{ir} correlation previously reported inobservational studies indicates depletion or exhaustion time scales,t_{dep}=sigma_{gas}/sigma_{sfr}, of &lt;~12 myr for star-forming sources wherelines up to e_{upper}=300 k are detected, in agreement with the valuespreviously found for (u)lirgs from hcn millimeter emission...

1407.4400	star formation relations and co sleds across the j-ladder and redshift	we present fir-co luminosity relations ($\log l_{\rm fir} = \alpha \logl'_{\rm co} + \beta$) for the full co rotational ladder from j=1-0 to j=13-12for 62 local (z &lt; 0.1) (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) using datafrom herschel spire-fts and ground-based telescopes. we extend our sample tohigh redshifts (z &gt; 1) by including 35 (sub)-millimeter selected dusty starforming galaxies from the literature with robust co observations. the additionof luminous starbursts at high redshifts enlarge the range of the fir-columinosity relations towards the high-ir-luminosity end while alsosignificantly increasing the small amount of mid-/high-j co line data availableprior to herschel. this new data-set (both in terms of ir luminosity andj-ladder) reveals linear fir-co luminosity relations ($\alpha \sim 1$) forj=1-0 up to j=5-4, with a nearly constant normalisation ($\beta \sim 2$). thisis expected from the (also) linear fir-(molecular line) relations found for thedense gas tracer lines (hcn and cs), as long as the dense gas mass fractiondoes not vary strongly within our (merger/starburst)-dominated sample. howeverfrom j=6-5 and up to j=13-12 we find an increasingly sub-linear slope andhigher normalization constant with increasing j. we argue that these are causedby a warm (~100k) and dense ($&gt;10^4{\rm cm^{-3}}$) gas component whose thermalstate is unlikely to be maintained by star formation powered far-uv radiationfields (and thus is no longer directly tied to the star formation rate). wesuggest that mechanical heating (e.g., supernova driven turbulence and shocks),and not cosmic rays, is the more likely source of energy for this component.the global co spectral line energy distributions (sleds), which remain highlyexcited from j=6-5 up to j=13-12, are found to be a generic feature of the(u)lirgs in our sample, and further support the presence of this gas component.

1407.8347	molecular tendrils feeding star formation in the eye of the medusa - the  medusa merger in high resolution 12co 2-1 maps	studying molecular gas properties in merging galaxies gives us importantclues to the onset and evolution of interaction-triggered starbursts. ngc4194is particularly interesting to study since its fir-to-co luminosity ratiorivals that of ulirgs,despite its lower luminosity compared to ulirgs, whichindicates a high star formation efficiency that is relative to even mostspirals and ulirgs.we study the molecular medium at an angular resolution of0.65"x .52" through our observations of co2-1 emission using the sma. wecompare our co2-1 maps with optical hst and high angular resolution radiocontinuum images to study the relationship between molecular gas and othercomponents of the starburst region. the molecular gas is tracing thecomplicated dust lane structure of ngc4194 with the brightest emission beinglocated in an off-nuclear ring-like structure with ~320pc radius, the eye ofthe medusa. the bulk co emission of the ring is found south of the kinematicalcenter of ngc4194. the northern tip of the ring is associated with the galaxynucleus, where the radio continuum has its peak. a prominent, secondaryemission maximum in the radio continuum is located inside the molecular ring.this suggests that the morphology of the ring is partially influenced bymassive supernova explosions. from the combined evidence, we propose that theeye of the medusa contains a shell of swept up material where we identify anumber of giant molecular associations. we propose that the eye may be the siteof an efficient starburst of 5-7m_sun/yr, but it would still constitute only afraction of the 30-50m_sun/yr sfr of ngc4194. furthermore, we find that ~50% ofthe molecular mass of ngc4194 is found in extended filamentary-like structurestracing the minor and major axis dust lanes. we suggest that molecular gas istransported along these lanes providing the central starburst region with fuel.

1411.7680	subarcsecond international lofar radio images of the m82 nucleus at 118  mhz and 154 mhz	the nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy m82 provides an excellentlaboratory for understanding the physics of star formation. this galaxy hasbeen extensively observed in the past, revealing tens of radio-bright compactobjects embedded in a diffuse free-free absorbing medium. our understanding ofthe structure and physics of this medium in m82 can be greatly improved byhigh-resolution images at low frequencies where the effects of free-freeabsorption are most prominent.  the aims of this study are, firstly, to demonstrate imaging usinginternational baselines of the low frequency array (lofar), and secondly, toconstrain low-frequency spectra of compact and diffuse emission in the centralstarburst region of m82 via high-resolution radio imaging at low frequencies.  the international lofar telescope was used to observe m82 at 110-126mhz and146-162mhz. images were obtained using standard techniques from very longbaseline interferometry. images were obtained at each frequency range: one onlyusing international baselines, and one only using the longest dutch (remote)baselines.  the 154mhz image obtained using international baselines is a new imagingrecord in terms of combined image resolution (0.3$"$) and sensitivity($\sigma$=0.15mjy/beam) at low frequencies ($&lt;327$mhz). we detected 16 objectsat 154mhz, six of these also at 118mhz. four weaker but resolved features arealso found: a linear (50pc) filament and three other resolved objects, of whichtwo show a clear shell structure. we do not detect any emission from eithersupernova 2008iz or from the radio transient source 43.78+59.3. the imagesobtained using remote baselines show diffuse emission, associated with theoutflow in m82, with reduced brightness in the region of the edge-onstar-forming disk.

1501.02985	the herschel comprehensive (u)lirg emission survey (hercules): co  ladders, fine structure lines, and neutral gas cooling	(ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ((u)lirgs) are objects characterized bytheir extreme infrared (8-1000 $\mu$m) luminosities ($l_{lirg}&gt;10^{11}$l$_\odot$ and $l_{ulirg}&gt;10^{12}$ l$_\odot$). the herschel comprehensive ulirgemission survey (hercules; pi van der werf) presents a representativeflux-limited sample of 29 (u)lirgs that spans the full luminosity range ofthese objects (10$^{11}\leq l_\odot \geq10^{13}$). with the \emph{herschelspace observatory}, we observe [cii] 157 $\mu$m, [oi] 63 $\mu$m, and [oi] 145$\mu$m line emission with pacs, co j=4-3 through j=13-12, [ci] 370 $\mu$m, and[ci] 609 $\mu$m with spire, and low-j co transitions with ground-basedtelescopes. the co ladders of the sample are separated into three classes basedon their excitation level. in 13 of the galaxies, the [oi] 63 $\mu$m emissionline is self absorbed. comparing the co excitation to the iras 60/100 $\mu$mratio and to far infrared luminosity, we find that the co excitation is morecorrelated to the far infrared colors. we present cooling budgets for thegalaxies and find fine-structure line flux deficits in the [cii], [siii], [oi],and [ci] lines in the objects with the highest far ir fluxes, but do notobserve this for co $4\leq j_{upp}\leq13$. in order to study the heating of themolecular gas, we present a combination of three diagnostic quantities to helpdetermine the dominant heating source. using the co excitation, the co j=1-0linewidth, and the agn contribution, we conclude that galaxies with large colinewidths always have high-excitation co ladders, and often low agncontributions, suggesting that mechanical heating is important.

1502.01347	measuring star formation with resolved observations: the test case of  m33	context. measuring star formation at a local scale is important to constrainstar formation laws. yet, it is not clear whether and how the measure of starformation is affected by the spatial scale at which a galaxy is observed. aims.we want to understand the impact of the resolution on the determination of thespatially resolved star formation rate (sfr) and other directly associatedphysical parameters such as the attenuation. methods. we have carried out amulti-scale, pixel-by-pixel study of the nearby galaxy m33. assembling fuv,halpha, 8, 24, 70, and 100 micron maps, we have systematically compared theemission in individual bands with various sfr estimators from a resolution of33 pc to 2084 pc. results. we have found that there are strong,scale-dependent, discrepancies up to a factor 3 between monochromatic sfrestimators and halpha+24 micron. the scaling factors between individual irbands and the sfr show a strong dependence on the spatial scale and on theintensity of star formation. finally, strong variations of the differentialreddening between the nebular emission and the stellar continuum are seen,depending on the specific sfr (ssfr) and on the resolution. at the finestspatial scales, there is little differential reddening at high ssfr. thedifferential reddening increases with decreasing ssfr. at the coarsest spatialscales the differential reddening is compatible with the canonical value foundfor starburst galaxies. conclusions. our results confirm that monochromaticestimators of the sfr are unreliable at scales smaller than 1 kpc. furthermore,the extension of local calibrations to high redshift galaxies presentsnon-trivial challenges as the properties of these systems may be poorly known.

astro-ph;0108083	gas properties in the medusa minor merger - comparing with ulirgs	high resolution observations of co and 13co 1--0 in the medusa (ngc4194)minor merger show the co/13co 1--0 intensity ratio (r) increasing from normalvalues (5-10) in the outer parts of the galaxy to high (&gt;20) values in thecentral, extended starburst region. ratios &gt;20 are otherwise typical of moreluminous mergers. the medusa l_fir/l_co ratio rivals that of ultraluminousgalaxies (ulirgs), despite the comparatively modest luminosity, indicating anexceptionally high star formation efficiency (sfe). we present models of thehigh pressure ism in a ulirg and the relatively low pressure ism of the medusa.we discuss how these models may explain large r in both types of distributions.since the hcn emission is faint towards the medusa, we suggest that the sfe isnot primarily controlled by the mass fraction of dense (n &gt; 10^4 cm-3) gas, butis probably strongly dependent on dynamics. the bright hcn emission towardsulirgs is not necessarily evidence that the ir emission there is always poweredby starbursts.

astro-ph;0111323	cn and hnc line emission in ir luminous galaxies	we have observed hnc 1-0, cn 1-0 and 2-1 line emission in a sample of 13 irluminous (lirgs, l_ir &gt; 10e11 lo) starburst and seyfert galaxies. hnc 1-0 isdetected in 9, cn 1-0 is detected in 10 and cn 2-1 in 7 of the galaxies. wealso report the first detection of hc3n (10-9) emission in arp220. theexcitation of hnc and cn emission requires densities n &gt; 10e4 cm-3. we comparetheir intensities to that of the usual high density tracer hcn. thei(hcn)/i(hnc}) and i(hcn)/i(cn) 1-0 line intensity ratios vary significantly,from 0.5 to &gt;6, among the galaxies. this implies that the actual properties ofthe dense gas is varying among galaxies who otherwise have similar i(co)/i(hcn)line intensity ratios. we suggest that the hnc emission is not a reliabletracer of cold (10 k) gas at the center of lirgs, as it often is in the disk ofthe milky way. instead, the hnc abundance may remain substantial, despite highgas temperatures, because the emission is emerging from regions where the hcnand hnc formation and destruction processes are dominated by ion-neutralreactions which are not strongly dependent on kinetic temperature. we find fivegalaxies (four agns and one starburst) where the i(hcn)/i(hnc) intensity ratiois close to unity. in other agns, however, i(hcn)/i(hnc}) is &gt;4. the cnemission is on average a factor of two fainter than hcn, but the variation islarge and there seems to be a trend of reduced relative cn luminosity withincreasing ir luminosity. one galaxy, ngc3690, has a cn luminosity twice thatof hcn and its ism is thus strongly affected by uv radiation. we discuss thei(hcn)/i(hnc) and i(hcn)/i(cn) line ratios as indicators of starburstevolution.

0808.3883	stars and gas in the medusa merger	the medusa (ngc 4194) is a well-studied nearby galaxy with the disturbedappearance of a merger and evidence for ongoing star formation. in order totest whether it could be the result of an interaction between a gas-richdisk-like galaxy and a larger elliptical, we have carried out optical and radioobservations of the stars and the gas in the medusa, and performed $n$-bodynumerical simulations of the evolution of such a system. we used the nordicoptical telescope to obtain a deep v-band image and the westerbork radiosynthesis telescope to map the large-scale distribution and kinematics ofatomic hydrogen. a single hi tail was found to the south of the medusa with aprojected length of 56 kpc (5') and a gas mass of 7* 10^8 m_sun, thusharbouring about one third of the total hi mass of the system. hi was alsodetected in absorption toward the continuum in the center. hi was detected in asmall nearby galaxy to the north-west of the medusa at a projected distance of91 kpc. it is, however, unlikely that this galaxy has had a significantinfluence on the evolution of the medusa. the simulations of the slightlyprograde infall of a gas-rich disk galaxy on an larger, four time more massiveelliptical (spherical) galaxy reproduce most of the observed features of themedusa.thus, the medusa is an ideal object to study the merger-induced starformation contribution from the small galaxy of a minor merger.

astro-ph;0508637	sub-arcsecond imaging of the radio continuum and neutral hydrogen in the  medusa merger	we present sub-arcsecond, multi-element radio linked interferometer (merlin)observations of the decimetre radio continuum structure and neutral hydrogen(hi) absorption from the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy ngc 4194 (themedusa merger). the continuum structure of the central kiloparsec of the medusahas been imaged, revealing a pair of compact radio components surrounded bymore diffuse, weak radio emission. using the constraints provided by theseobservations and those within the literature we conclude that the majority ofthis radio emission is related to the ongoing star-formation in this mergersystem.  with these observations we also trace deep hi absorption across the detectedradio continuum structure. the absorbing hi gas structure exhibits largevariations in column densities. the largest column densities are found towardthe south of the nuclear radio continuum, co-spatial with both a nuclear dustlane and peaks in $^{12}$co (1-&gt;0) emission. the dynamics of the hi absorption,which are consistent with lower resolution $^{12}$co emission observations,trace a shallow north-south velocity gradient of ~320km/s/kpc. this gradient isinterpreted as part of a rotating gas structure within the nuclear region. thehi and co velocity structure, in conjunction with the observed gas columndensities and distribution, is further discussed in the context of the fuellingand gas physics of the ongoing starburst within the centre of this merger.

astro-ph;0612122	overluminous hnc line emission in arp220, ngc4418 and mrk231 - global ir  pumping or xdrs?	we find that the hnc j=3-2 emission is brighter than the hcn 3-2 emission byfactors of 1.5 to 2.3 in the ultraluminous mergers arp220 and mrk231 and theluminous ir galaxy ngc4418. we furthermore report the detection of hnc j=4-3 inmrk231. overluminous hnc emission is unexpected in warm molecular gas inultraluminous galaxies since i(hnc)&gt;i(hcn) is usually taken as a signature ofcold (10 - 20 k) dark clouds. since the molecular gas of the studied galaxiesis warm (t_k &gt; 40 k) we present two alternative explanations to theoverluminous hnc: a) hnc excitation is affected by pumping of the rotationallevels through the mid-infrared continuum and b) xdrs (x-ray dominated regions)influence the abundances of hnc. hnc may become pumped at 21.5 micronbrightness temperatures of 50 k, suggesting that hnc-pumping could be common inwarm, ultraluminous galaxies with compact ir-nuclei.on the other hand, allthree galaxies are either suspected of having buried agn - or the presence ofagn is clear (mrk231) - indicating that x-rays may affect the ism chemistry. weconclude that both the pumping and xdr alternatives imply molecular cloudensembles distinctly different from those of typical starforming regions in thegalaxy, or the ism of less extreme starburst galaxies. the hnc molecule showsthe potential of becoming an additional important tracer of extreme nuclearenvironments.

astro-ph;9701005	variation of molecular line ratios and cloud properties in the arp 299  galaxy merger	high resolution observations of 12co (2.''3), 13co (3.''9), and hcn (5.''4)j=1--0 in the galaxy merger arp 299 (ic 694 and ngc 3690) show the line ratiosvary dramatically across the system. the 12co/13co ratio is unusually large, 60+- 15, at the ic 694 nucleus, where 12co emission is very strong, and muchsmaller, 10 +- 3, in the southern extended disk of that galaxy. elsewhere, the12co/13co line ratio is 5-20, typical of spiral galaxies. the line ratiovariation in the overlap between the two galaxies is smaller, ranging from 10+- 3 in the east to 20 +- 4 in the west.  the 12co/hcn line ratio also varies across arp 299, although to a lesserdegree. hcn emission is bright towards each galaxy nucleus and in theextranuclear region of active star formation; it was not detected in the ic 694disk, or the eastern part of the overlap region, leading to lower limits of 25and 20 respectively. by contrast, at the nuclei of ic 694 and ngc 3690 theratios are 9 +- 1 and 14 +- 3 respectively. in the western part of the overlapregion it is 11 +- 3.

astro-ph;9903409	the discovery of a gas-rich bar in ugc 2855: a galaxy in a pre-starburst  phase?	we present the first interferometric co observations of the barred late-typegalaxy ugc2855 and its companion ugc2866. ugc2855 is shown to belong to therare class of galaxies with a long (~ 8kpc) continuous molecular bar. thevelocity field along the bar is dominated by solid-body rotation and shows fewperturbations. this, together with an almost constant and low ^12co/^13co lineintensity ratio along the bar and in the center as well as only weak h alphaemission, indicate that the gas in the bar is not subjected to strong shocks,but surprisingly quiescent. in the central 3'', a high velocity featureconsisting of a number of giant molecular associations, is identified. wediscuss possible scenarios of the nature of this structure in connection withthe question of the presence of an inner lindblad resonance (ilr) in the bar.we suggest that the bar of ugc2855 is a young object, possibly has no ilr, andthat the mass concentration toward the center of the galaxy is just beginning.in contrast, the companion ugc2866 experiences a strong starburst. we comparethe properties of the gas in the bar of ugc2855 to those we find in ngc7479.despite superficial parallels, the two bars are very dissimilar objects interms of ^12co/^13co line ratio, velocity field and h alpha activity. ngc7479exhibits starburst characteristics, while we argue that ugc2855 is in apre-burst stage.

0811.0511	high-resolution hnc 3-2 sma observations of arp220	we present high resolution (0."4) observations of hnc j=3-2 with thesubmillimeter array (sma). we find luminous hnc 3-2 line emission in thewestern part of arp220, centered on the western nucleus, while the eastern sideof the merger shows relatively faint emission. a bright (36 k), narrow (60km/s) emission feature emerges from the western nucleus, superposed on abroader spectral component. a possible explanation is weak maser emissionthrough line-of-sight amplification of the background continuum source. thereis also a more extended hnc 3-2 emission feature north and south of thenucleus. this feature resembles the bipolar oh maser morphology around thewestern nucleus. substantial hnc abundances are required to explain the brightline emission from this warm environment. we discuss this briefly in thecontext of an x-ray chemistry and radiative excitation. we conclude that theluminous and possibly amplified hnc emission of the western nucleus of thearp220 merger reflects the unusual, and perhaps transient, environment of thestarburst/agn activity there. the faint hnc line emission towards arp220-eastreveals a real difference in physical conditions between the two merger nuclei.
