0902.4398	searching for pulsed emission from xte j0929-314 at high radio  frequencies	the aim of this work is to search for radio signals in the quiescent phase ofaccreting millisecond x-ray pulsars, in this way giving an ultimate proof ofthe recycling model, thereby unambiguously establishing that accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars are the progenitors of radio millisecond pulsars.  to overcome the possible free-free absorption caused by matter surroundingaccreting millisecond x-ray pulsars in their quiescence phase, we performed theobservations at high frequencies. making use of particularly precise orbitaland spin parameters obtained from x-ray observations, we carried out a deepsearch for radio-pulsed emission from the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsarxte j0929-314 in three steps, correcting for the effect of the dispersion dueto the interstellar medium, eliminating the orbital motions effects, andfinally folding the time series.  no radio pulsation is present in the analyzed data down to a limit of 68microjy at 6.4 ghz and 26 microjy at 8.5 ghz.  we discuss several mechanisms that could prevent the detection, concludingthat beaming factor and intrinsic low luminosity are the most likelyexplanations.

0906.1394	discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highly magnetic rrat  j1819-1458	we report on the discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highmagnetic field rotating radio transient j1819-1458. using a 30ks chandra acis-sobservation, we found significant evidence for extended x-ray emission with apeculiar shape: a compact region out to 5.5", and more diffuse emissionextending out to ~13" from the source. the most plausible interpretation is anebula somehow powered by the pulsar, although the small number of countsprevents a conclusive answer on the nature of this emission. rrat j1819-1458'sspin-down energy loss rate (edot~3x10^{32} erg/s) is much lower than that ofother pulsars with observed spin-down powered pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), andimplies a rather high x-ray efficiency of eta_{x} = l_(pwn; 0.5-8kev)/edot~0.2at converting spin-down power into the pwn x-ray emission. this suggests theneed of an additional source of energy rather than the spin-down power alone,such as the high magnetic energy of this source. furthermore, this chandraobservation allowed us to refine the positional accuracy of rrat j1819-1458 toa radius of ~0.3", and confirms the presence of x-ray pulsations and the ~1kevabsorption line, previously observed in the x-ray emission of this source.

0907.0054	new limits on radio emission from x-ray dim isolated neutron stars	we have carried out a search for radio emission at 820 mhz from six x-ray dimisolated neutron stars with the robert c. byrd green bank radio telescope. notransient or pulsed emission was found using fast folding, fast fouriertransform, and single-pulse searches. the corresponding flux limits are about0.01 mjy for pulsed emission, depending on the integration time for theparticular source and assuming a duty cycle of 2%, and 20 mjy for singledispersed pulses. these are the most sensitive limits to date on radio emissionfrom x-ray dim isolated neutron stars. there is no evidence for isolated radiopulses, as seen in a class of neutron stars known as rotating radio transients.our results imply that either the radio luminosities of these objects are lowerthan those of any known radio pulsars, or they could simply be long-periodnearby radio pulsars with high magnetic fields beaming away from the earth. totest the latter possibility, we would need around 40 similar sources to providea 1 sigma probability of at least one of them beaming toward us. we also give adetailed description of our implementation of the fast folding algorithm.

0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

1001.1483	observations and modelling of relativistic spin precession in psr  j1141-6545	observations of the binary pulsar psr j1141-6545 using the parkes radiotelescope over 9.3 years show clear time-variations in pulse width, shape andpolarization. we interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precessionof the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.over the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more thana factor of three. large variations have also been observed in the 1400-mhzmean flux density. the pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 aprilusing digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variationsin both linear and circular polarization. position angle variations, bothacross the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with majordifferences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. modellingof the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of thepulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 degand that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course ofour observations. at the start of our observations, the line-of-sight impactparameter was about 4 deg in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to 0deg around early 2007, consistent with the observed pulse width variations. wehave therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam, showing thatit is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis. the derivedprecessional parameters imply that the pre-supernova star had a mass of about 2msun and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small. with thereversal in the rate of change of the impact parameter, we predict that overthe next decade we will see a reversed "replay" of the variations observed inthe past decade.

1003.2085	near-infrared observations of rotating radio transients	we report on the first near-infrared observations obtained for rotating radiotransients (rrats). using adaptive optics devices mounted on the eso very largetelescope (vlt), we observed two objects of this class: rrat j1819-1458, andrrat j1317-5759. these observations have been performed in 2006 and 2008, inthe j, h and ks bands. we found no candidate infrared counterpart to rratj1317-5759, down to a limiting magnitude of ks ~ 21. on the other hand, wefound a possible candidate counterpart for rrat j1819-1458, having a magnitudeof ks=20.96+/-0.10 . in particular, this is the only source within a 1 sigmaerror circle around the source's accurate x-ray position, although given thecrowded field we cannot exclude that this is due to a chance coincidence. theinfrared flux of the putative counterpart to the highly magnetic rratj1819-1458, is higher than expected from a normal radio pulsar, but consistentwith that seen from magnetars. we also searched for the near-infraredcounterpart to the x-ray diffuse emission recently discovered around rratj1819-1458, but we did not detect this component in the near-infrared band. wediscuss the luminosity of the putative counterpart to rrat j1819-1458, incomparison with the near-infrared emission of all isolated neutron starsdetected to date in this band (5 pulsars and 7 magnetars).

1006.4260	search for pulsations at high radio frequencies from accreting  millisecond x-ray pulsars in quiescence	it is commonly believed that millisecond radio pulsars have been spun up bytransfer of matter and angular momentum from a low-mass companion during anx-ray active mass transfer phase. a subclass of low-mass x-ray binaries is thatof the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars, transient systems that show periodsof x-ray quiescence during which radio emission could switch on. the aim ofthis work is to search for millisecond pulsations from three accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars, xte j1751-305, xte j1814-338, and sax j1808.4-3658,observed during their quiescent x-ray phases at high radio frequencies (5 - 8ghz) in order to overcome the problem of the free-free absorption due to thematter engulfing the system. a positive result would provide definite proof ofthe recycling model, providing the direct link between the progenitors andtheir evolutionary products. the data analysis methodology has been chosen onthe basis of the precise knowledge of orbital and spin parameters from x-rayobservations. it is subdivided in three steps: we corrected the time series forthe effects of (i) the dispersion due to interstellar medium and (ii) of theorbital motions, and finally (iii) folded modulo the spin period to increasethe signal-to-noise ratio. no radio signal with spin and orbitalcharacteristics matching those of the x-ray sources has been found in oursearch, down to very low flux density upper limits. we analysed severalmechanisms that could have prevented the detection of the signal, concludingthat the low luminosity of the sources and the geometric factor are the mostlikely reasons for this negative result.

1009.0021	agile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58	we present the results of new agile observations of psr b1509-58 performedover a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset ofthe present data. the modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 mev isat a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those foundearlier by comptel up to 30 mev: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching itsmaximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94+/- 0.03. the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed fluxdetected by comptel and agile is well described by a power-law (photon indexalpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at e_c=81 +/- 20 mev, representingthe softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. the pulsarluminosity at e &gt; 1 mev is $l_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiencyto gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. the unusual soft break in the spectrum of psrb1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as asignature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic fieldof this pulsar. in this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magneticaltitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggestedbecause pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of themagnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photonsplitting. in the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from theradio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the modelsto reproduce agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

1009.0209	discovery of 59ms pulsations from 1rxs j141256.0+792204 (calvera)	we report on a multi-wavelength study of the compact object candidate 1rxsj141256.0+792204 (calvera). calvera was observed in the x-rays with xmm/epictwice for a total exposure time of ~50 ks. the source spectrum is thermal andwell reproduced by a two component model composed of either two hydrogenatmosphere models, or two blackbodies (kt_1~ 55/150 ev, kt_2~ 80/250 ev,respectively, as measured at infinity). evidence was found for an absorptionfeature at ~0.65 kev; no power-law high-energy tail is statistically required.using pn and mos data we discovered pulsations in the x-ray emission at aperiod p=59.2 ms. the detection is highly significant (&gt; 11 sigma), andunambiguously confirms the neutron star nature of calvera. the pulse profile isnearly sinusoidal, with a pulsed fraction of ~18%. we looked for the timingsignature of calvera in the fermi large area telescope (lat) database and founda significant (~5 sigma) pulsed signal at a period coincident with the x-rayvalue. the gamma-ray timing analysis yielded a tight upper limit on the periodderivative, dp/dt &lt; 5e-18 s/s (de_rot/dt &lt;1e33 erg/s, b&lt;5e10 g for magneto-dipolar spin-down). radio searches at 1.36 ghz with the 100-m effelsberg radiotelescope yielded negative results, with a deep upper limit on the pulsed fluxof 0.05 mjy. diffuse, soft (&lt; 1 kev) x-ray emission about 13' west of thecalvera position is present both in our pointed observations and in archiverosat all-sky survey images, but is unlikely associated with the x-ray pulsar.its spectrum is compatible with an old supernova remnant (snr); no evidence fordiffuse emission in the radio and optical bands was found. the most likelyinterpretations are that calvera is either a central compact object escapedfrom a snr or a mildly recycled pulsar; in both cases the source would be thefirst ever member of the class detected at gamma-ray energies.

1009.5873	a 6.5-ghz multibeam pulsar survey	a survey of the galactic plane in the region $-60\degree \leq l \leq30\degree$, $|b| \leq 0.25\degree$ was carried out using the seven-beam parkesmethanol multibeam (mmb) receiver, which operates at a frequency of 6.5 ghz.three pulsars were discovered, and 16 previously known pulsars detected. inthis paper we present two previously-unpublished discoveries, both withextremely high dispersion measures, one of which is very close, in angulardistance, to the galactic centre. the survey data also contain the first knowndetection, at radio frequencies, of the radio magnetar psr j1550-5418. oursurvey observation was made 46 days prior to that previously published andplaces constraints on the beginning of pulsed radio emission from the source.  the detection of only three previously undiscovered pulsars argues that thereare few pulsars in the direction of the inner galaxy whose flux densityspectrum is governed by a flat power law. however, these pulsars would belikely to remain undetected at lower frequencies due to the large amount ofscatter broadening which affects pulsars with high values of dispersionmeasure. surveys with future telescopes at high observing frequencies will,therefore, play an important role in the discovery of pulsars at the galacticcentre. by simulating pulsar surveys of the galaxy with phase 1 ska atfrequencies of 1.4 ghz and 10 ghz, we find that high-frequency observations arethe only way to discover and observe the galactic-centre pulsar population.

1101.4778	the high time resolution universe survey ii: discovery of 5 millisecond  pulsars	we present the discovery of 5 millisecond pulsars found in the mid-galacticlatitude portion of the high time resolution universe (htru) survey. thepulsars have rotational periods from ~2.3 to ~7.5 ms, and all are in binarysystems with orbital periods ranging from ~0.3 to ~150 d. in four of thesesystems, the most likely companion is a white dwarf, with minimum masses of~0.2 solar masses. the other pulsar, j1731-1847, has a very low mass companionand exhibits eclipses, and is thus a member of the "black widow" class ofpulsar binaries. these eclipses have been observed in bands centred nearfrequencies of 700, 1400 and 3000 mhz, from which measurements have been madeof the electron density in the eclipse region. these measurements have beenused to examine some possible eclipse mechanisms. the eclipse and otherproperties of this source are used to perform a comparison with the other knowneclipsing and "black widow" pulsars.  these new discoveries occupy a short-period and high-dispersion measure (dm)region of parameter space, which we demonstrate is a direct consequence of thehigh time and frequency resolution of the htru survey. the large implieddistances to our new discoveries makes observation of their companions unlikelywith both current optical telescopes and the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.the extremely circular orbits make any advance of periastron measurementshighly unlikely. no relativistic shapiro delays are obvious in any of thesystems, although the low flux densities would make their detection difficultunless the orbits were fortuitously edge-on.

1203.6068	the high time resolution universe survey - v: single-pulse energetics  and modulation properties of 315 pulsars	we report on the pulse-to-pulse energy distributions and phase-resolvedmodulation properties for catalogued pulsars in the southern high timeresolution universe intermediate-latitude survey. we selected the 315 pulsarsdetected in a single-pulse search of this survey, allowing a large sampleunbiased regarding any rotational parameters of neutron stars. we found thatthe energy distribution of many pulsars is well-described by a log-normaldistribution, with few deviating from a small range in log-normal scale andlocation parameters. some pulsars exhibited multiple energy statescorresponding to mode changes, and implying that some observed "nulling" mayactually be a mode-change effect. psrj1900-2600 was found to emit weakly in itspreviously-identified "null" state. we found evidence for another state-changeeffect in two pulsars, which show bimodality in their nulling time scales; thatis, they switch between a continuous-emission state and a single-pulse-emittingstate. large modulation occurs in many pulsars across the full integratedprofile, with increased sporadic bursts at leading and trailing sub-beam edges.some of these high-energy outbursts may indicate the presence of "giant pulse"phenomena. we found no correlation with modulation and pulsar period, age, orother parameters. finally, the deviation of integrated pulse energy from itsaverage value was generally quite small, despite the significant phase-resolvedmodulation in some pulsars; we interpret this as tenuous evidence of energyregulation between distinct pulsar sub-beams.

1203.6449	a new low magnetic field magnetar: the 2011 outburst of swift  j1822.3-1606	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring with swift, rxte, suzaku, chandraand xmm-newton of the outburst of the newly discovered magnetar swiftj1822.3-1606 (sgr 1822-1606), from the first observations soon after thedetection of the short x-ray bursts which led to its discovery, through thefirst stages of its outburst decay (covering the time-span from july 2011,until end of april 2012). we also report on archival rosat observations whichwitnessed the source during its likely quiescent state, and on upper limits onswift j1822.3-1606's radio-pulsed and optical emission during outburst, withthe green bank telescope (gbt) and the gran telescopio canarias (gtc),respectively. our x-ray timing analysis finds the source rotating with a periodof p=8.43772016(2) s and a period derivative \dot{p}=8.3(2)x10^{-14} s s^{-1} ,which entails an inferred dipolar surface magnetic field of b~2.7x10^{13} g atthe equator. this measurement makes swift j1822.3-1606 the second lowestmagnetic field magnetar (after sgr 0418+5729; rea et al. 2010). following theflux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst, we find thatthe flux decreased by about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening ofthe spectrum, both typical of the outburst decay of magnetars. by modeling thesecular thermal evolution of swift j1822.3-1606, we find that the observedtiming properties of the source, as well as its quiescent x-ray luminosity, canbe reproduced if it was born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields ofb_{p}~1.5x10^{14} g and b_{tor}~7x10^{14} g, respectively, and if its currentage is ~550 kyr.

1206.6515	the identification of the optical companion to the binary millisecond  pulsar j0610-2100 in the galactic field	we have used deep v and r images acquired at the eso very large telescope toidentify the optical companion to the binary pulsar psr j0610-2100, one of theblack-widow millisecond pulsars recently detected by the fermi gamma-raytelescope in the galactic plane. we found a faint star (v~26.7) nearlycoincident (\delta r ~0".28) with the pulsar nominal position. this star isvisible only in half of the available images, while it disappears in thedeepest ones (those acquired under the best seeing conditions), thus indicatingthat it is variable. although our observations do not sample the entire orbitalperiod (p=0.28 d) of the pulsar, we found that the optical modulation of thevariable star nicely correlates with the pulsar orbital period and describes awell defined peak (r~25.6) at \phi=0.75, suggesting a modulation due to thepulsar heating. we tentatively conclude that the companion to psr j0610-2100 isa heavily ablated very low mass star (~ 0.02msun) that completely filled itsroche lobe.

1211.7347	a new low-b magnetar: swift j1822.3-1606	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring with swift, rxte, suzaku,chandra, and xmm-newton of the outburst of the newly discovered magnetar swiftj1822.3-1606 (sgr 182-1606), from the first observations soon after thedetection of the short x-ray bursts which led to its discovery (july 2011),through the first stages of its outburst decay (april 2012). our x-ray timinganalysis finds the source rotating with a period of p = 8.43772016(2) s and aperiod derivative pdot = 8.3(2) x 10e-14 s s-1, which entails an inferreddipolar surface magnetic field of 2.7 x 10e13 g at the equator. thismeasurement makes swift j1822.3-1606 the second lowest magnetic field magnetar(after sgr 0418+5729; rea et al. 2010). following the flux and spectralevolution from the beginning of the outburst, we find that the flux decreasedby about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening of the spectrum, bothtypical of the outburst decay of magnetars. by modeling the secular thermalevolution of swift j1822.3+1606, we find that the observed timing properties ofthe source, as well as its quiescent x-ray luminosity, can be reproduced if itwas born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields of bp ~ 1.5 x 10e14 g andbtor ~ 7 x 10e14 g, respectively, and if its current age is ~550 kyr (moredetails in rea et al. 2012).

1303.5579	the outburst decay of the low magnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring of the outburst decay of the lowmagnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729, using all the available x-ray dataobtained with rxte, swift, chandra, and xmm-newton observations, from thediscovery of the source in june 2009, up to august 2012. the timing analysisallowed us to obtain the first measurement of the period derivative of sgr0418+5729: \dot{p}=4(1)x10^{-15} s/s, significant at ~3.5 sigma confidencelevel. this leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of b_dip ~6x 10^{12} g.this measurement confirms sgr 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.following the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst upto ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsiblefor the x-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 kev. simultaneously,the x-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 . deep radio, millimeter, optical andgamma-ray observations did not detect the source counterpart, implyingstringent limits on its multi-band emission, as well as constraints on thepresence of a fossil disk. by modeling the magneto-thermal secular evolution ofsgr 0418+5729, we infer a realistic age of ~550 kyr, and a dipolar magneticfield at birth of ~10^{14} g. the outburst characteristics suggest the presenceof a thin twisted bundle with a small heated spot at its base. the bundleuntwisted in the first few months following the outburst, while the hot spotdecreases in temperature and size. we estimate the outburst rate of lowmagnetic field magnetars to be about one per year per galaxy, and we brieflydiscuss the consequences of such result in several other astrophysicalcontexts.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1306.4190	the high time resolution universe pulsar survey viii: the galactic  millisecond pulsar population	we have used millisecond pulsars (msps) from the southern high timeresolution universe (htru) intermediate latitude survey area to simulate thedistribution and total population of msps in the galaxy. our model makes use ofthe scale factor method, which estimates the ratio of the total number of mspsin the galaxy to the known sample. using our best fit value for the z-height,z=500 pc, we find an underlying population of msps of 8.3(\pm 4.2)*10^4 sourcesdown to a limiting luminosity of l_min=0.1 mjy kpc^2 and a luminositydistribution with a steep slope of d\log n/d\log l = -1.45(\pm 0.14). however,at the low end of the luminosity distribution, the uncertainties introduced bysmall number statistics are large. by omitting very low luminosity pulsars, wefind a galactic population above l_min=0.2 mjy kpc^2 of only 3.0(\pm 0.7)*10^4msps. we have also simulated pulsars with periods shorter than any known msp,and estimate the maximum number of sub-msps in the galaxy to be 7.8(\pm5.0)*10^4 pulsars at l=0.1 mjy kpc^2. in addition, we estimate that the highand low latitude parts of the southern htru survey will detect 68 and 42 mspsrespectively, including 78 new discoveries. pulsar luminosity, and hence fluxdensity, is an important input parameter in the model. some of the publishedflux densities for the pulsars in our sample do not agree with the observedflux densities from our data set, and we have instead calculated averageluminosities from archival data from the parkes telescope. we found manyluminosities to be very different than their catalogue values, leading to verydifferent population estimates. large variations in flux density highlight theimportance of including scintillation effects in msp population studies.

1307.6331	a strongly magnetized pulsar within grasp of the milky way's  supermassive black hole	the center of our galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole, sagittarius (sgr)a*. young, massive stars within 0.5 pc of sgra* are evidence of an episode ofintense star formation near the black hole a few myr ago, which might have leftbehind a young neutron star traveling deep into sgra*'s gravitationalpotential. on 2013 april 25, a short x-ray burst was observed from thedirection of the galactic center. thanks to a series of observations with thechandra and the swift satellites, we pinpoint the associated magnetar at anangular distance of 2.4+/-0.3 arcsec from sgra*, and refine the source spinperiod and its derivative (p=3.7635537(2) s and \dot{p} = 6.61(4)x10^{-12}s/s), confirmed by quasi simultaneous radio observations performed with thegreen bank (gbt) and parkes antennas, which also constrain a dispersion measureof dm=1750+/-50 pc cm^{-3}, the highest ever observed for a radio pulsar. wehave found that this x-ray source is a young magnetar at ~0.07-2 pc from sgra*.simulations of its possible motion around sgra* show that it is likely (~90%probability) in a bound orbit around the black hole. the radiation frontproduced by the past activity from the magnetar passing through the molecularclouds surrounding the galactic center region, might be responsible for a largefraction of the light echoes observed in the fe fluorescence features.

1307.7629	the high time resolution universe pulsar survey - vii: discovery of five  millisecond pulsars and the different luminosity properties of binary and  isolated recycled pulsars	this paper presents the discovery and timing parameters for five millisecondpulsars (msps), four in binary systems with probable white dwarf companions andone isolated, found in ongoing processing of the high time resolution universepulsar survey (htru). we also present high quality polarimetric data on four ofthem. these further discoveries confirm the high potential of our survey infinding pulsars with very short spin periods. at least two of these five mspsare excellent candidates to be included in the pulsar timing array projects.thanks to the wealth of msp discoveries in the htru survey, we revisit thequestion of whether the luminosity distributions of isolated and binary mspsare different. using the cordes and lazio distance model and our new andcatalogue flux density measurements, we find that 41 of the 42 most luminousmsps in the galactic disk are in binaries and a statistical analysis suggeststhat the luminosity functions differ with 99.9% significance. we conclude thatthe formation process that leads to solitary msps affects their luminosities,despite their period and period derivatives being similar to those of pulsarsin binary systems.

1405.5945	an absence of fast radio bursts at intermediate galactic latitudes	fast radio bursts (frbs) are an emerging class of bright, highly dispersedradio pulses. recent work by thornton et al.

1412.4252	x-ray coherent pulsations during a sub-luminous accretion disk state of  the transitional millisecond pulsar xss j12270-4859	we present the first detection of x-ray coherent pulsations from thetransitional millisecond pulsar xss j12270-4859, while it was in a sub-luminousaccretion disk state characterized by a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 5e33 erg/s(assuming a distance of 1.4 kpc). pulsations were observed by xmm-newton at anrms amplitude of (7.7 +/- 0.5)% with a second harmonic stronger than the thefundamental frequency, and were detected when the source is neither flaring nordipping. the most likely interpretation of this detection is that matter fromthe accretion disk was channelled by the neutron star magnetosphere andaccreted onto its polar caps. according to standard disk accretion theory, forpulsations to be observed the mass in-flow rate in the disk was likely largerthan the amount of plasma actually reaching the neutron star surface; anoutflow launched by the fast rotating magnetosphere then probably took place,in agreement with the observed broad-band spectral energy distribution. we alsoreport about the non-detection of x-ray pulsations during a recent observationperformed while the source behaved as a rotationally-powered radio pulsar.

1501.00056	a cosmic census of radio pulsars with the ska	the square kilometre array (ska) will make ground breaking discoveries inpulsar science. in this chapter we outline the ska surveys for new pulsars, aswell as how we will perform the necessary follow-up timing observations. theska's wide field-of-view, high sensitivity, multi-beaming and sub-arrayingcapabilities, coupled with advanced pulsar search backends, will result in thediscovery of a large population of pulsars. these will enable the ska's pulsarscience goals (tests of general relativity with pulsar binary systems,investigating black hole theorems with pulsar-black hole binaries, and directdetection of gravitational waves in a pulsar timing array). using ska1-mid andska1-low we will survey the milky way to unprecedented depth, increasing thenumber of known pulsars by more than an order of magnitude. ska2 willpotentially find all the galactic radio-emitting pulsars in the ska sky whichare beamed in our direction. this will give a clear picture of the birthproperties of pulsars and of the gravitational potential, magnetic fieldstructure and interstellar matter content of the galaxy. targeted searches willenable detection of exotic systems, such as the ~1000 pulsars we infer to beclosely orbiting sgr a*, the supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. inaddition, the ska's sensitivity will be sufficient to detect pulsars in localgroup galaxies. to derive the spin characteristics of the discoveries we willperform live searches, and use sub-arraying and dynamic scheduling to timepulsars as soon as they are discovered, while simultaneously continuing surveyobservations. the large projected number of discoveries suggests that we willuncover currently unknown rare systems that can be exploited to push theboundaries of our understanding of astrophysics and provide tools for testingphysics, as has been done by the pulsar community in the past.

1511.07746	five new fast radio bursts from the htru high latitude survey: first  evidence for two-component bursts	the detection of five new fast radio bursts (frbs) found in the high timeresolution universe high latitude survey is presented. the rate implied is6$^{+4}_{-3}\times~10^3$ (95%) frbs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a fluence ofbetween 0.13 and 5.9 jy ms for frbs between 0.128 and 262 ms in duration. oneof these frbs has a clear two-component profile, each component is similar tothe known population of single component frbs and are separated by 2.4(4) ms.all the frb components appear to be unresolved following deconvolution with ascattering tail and accounting for intra-channel smearing. the two-componentfrb also has the highest dispersion measure (1629 pc cm$^{-3}$) of any frbto-date. many of the proposed models to explain frbs use a single high energyevent involving compact objects (such as neutron star mergers) and thereforecannot easily explain a two-component frb. models that are based on extremeversions of flaring, pulsing or orbital events however could produce multiplecomponent profiles. the compatibility of these models and the frb rate impliedby these detections is discussed.

1512.03241	long term study of the double pulsar j0737-3039 with xmm-newton: pulsar  timing	the relativistic double neutron star binary psr j0737-3039 shows clearevidence of orbital phase-dependent wind-companion interaction, both in radioand x-rays. in this paper we present the results of timing analysis of psrj0737-3039 performed during 2006 and 2011 xmm-newton large programs thatcollected ~20,000 x-ray counts from the system. we detected pulsations from psrj0737-3039a (psr a) through the most accurate timing measurement obtained byxmm-newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. psr a's pulseprofile in x-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spinprecession that occurred within the time span of observations. this yields aconstraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentumaxis delta_a ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radiodata. we confirmed pulsed emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) in x-rays evenafter its disappearance in radio. the unusual phenomenology of psr b's x-rayemission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a lossof pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. we hypothesize that this isdue to the interaction of psr a's wind with psr b's magnetosphere andorbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto psr b closed field lines.finally, the analysis of the full xmm-newton dataset provided evidences oforbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shockscenario between psr a's wind and psr b's magnetosphere.

0705.3269	age constraints in the double pulsar system j0737-3039	we investigate the age constraints that can be placed on the double pulsarsystem using models for the spin-down of the first-born 22.7-ms pulsar a andthe 2.77-s pulsar b with characteristic ages of 210 and 50 myr respectively.standard models assuming dipolar spin-down of both pulsars suggest that thetime since the formation of b is ~50 myr, i.e. close to b's characteristic age.however, adopting models which account for the impact of a's relativistic windon b's spin-down we find that the formation of b took place either 80 or 180myr ago, depending the interaction mechanism. formation 80 myr ago, closer tob's characteristic age, would result in the contribution from j0737-3039 to theinferred coalescence rates for double neutron star binaries increasing by 40%.the 180 myr age is closer to a's characteristic age and would be consistentwith the most recent estimates of the coalescence rate. the new age constraintsdo not significantly impact recent estimates of the kick velocity, tilt anglebetween pre and post-supernova orbital planes or pre-supernova mass of b'sprogenitor.

astro-ph;0104170	where have all the submillisecond pulsars gone?	the existence of pulsars with spin period below one millisecond is expected,though they have not been detected up to now. their formation depends on thequantity of matter accreted from the companion which, in turn, is limited bythe mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. mass ejection must beefficient, at least in some cases, in order to produce the observed populationof moderately fast spinning millisecond pulsars. first we demonstrate, in theframework of the widely accepted recycling scenario, using a populationsynthesis approach, that a significant number of pulsars with spin period belowone millisecond is expected. then we propose that significant variations in themass-transfer rate may cause, in systems with orbital periods larger than 1 hr,the switch-on of a radio pulsar whose radiation pressure is capable of ejectingout of the system most of the matter transferred by the companion and preventany further accretion. we show how this mechanism could dramatically alter thebinary evolution since the mechanism that drives mass overflow from the innerlagrangian point is still active while the accretion is inhibited. moreover wedemonstrate that the persistency of this ``radio ejection'' phase depends onthe binary orbital period, demonstrating that close systems (orbital periodslower than 1 hr) are the only possible hosts for ultra fast spinning neutronstars. this could explain why submillisecond pulsars have not been detected sofar, as current radio surveys are hampered by computational limitations withrespect to the detection of very short spin period pulsars in short orbitalperiod binaries.

astro-ph;0312071	an increased estimate of the merger rate of double neutron stars from  observations of a highly relativistic system	the merger of close binary systems containing two neutron stars shouldproduce a burst of gravitational waves, as predicted by the theory of generalrelativity. a reliable estimate of the double-neutron-star merger rate in thegalaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectorswill be successful in detecting such bursts. present estimates of this rate arerather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries withmerger times less than the age of the universe. here we report the discovery ofa 22-ms pulsar, psr j0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativisticdouble-neutron-star binary with an orbital period of 2.4 hours. this systemwill merge in about 85 myr, a time much shorter than for any other knownneutron-star binary. together with the relatively low radio luminosity of psrj0737-3039, this timescale implies an order-of-magnitude increase in thepredicted merger rate for double-neutron-star systems in our galaxy (and in therest of the universe).

astro-ph;0609417	tests of general relativity from timing the double pulsar	the double pulsar system, psr j0737-3039a/b, is unique in that both neutronstars are detectable as radio pulsars. this, combined with significantly highermean orbital velocities and accelerations when compared to other binarypulsars, suggested that the system would become the best available testbed forgeneral relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-fieldregime. here we report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests ofgeneral relativity. use of the theory-independent mass ratio of the two starsmakes these tests uniquely different from earlier studies. by measuringrelativistic corrections to the keplerian description of the orbital motion, wefind that the ``post-keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted byeinstein's theory of general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, themost precise test yet obtained. we also show that the transverse velocity ofthe system's center of mass is extremely small. combined with the system'slocation near the sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitationaltheories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar-systemtests. it also implies that the second-born pulsar may have formed differentlyto the usually assumed core-collapse of a helium star.

0810.1516	high-resolution timing observations of spin-powered pulsars with the  agile gamma-ray telescope	agile is a small gamma-ray astronomy satellite mission of the italian spaceagency dedicated to high-energy astrophysics launched in 2007 april. its 1microsecond absolute time tagging capability coupled with a good sensitivity inthe 30 mev-30 gev range, with simultaneous x-ray monitoring in the 18-60 kevband, makes it perfectly suited for the study of gamma-ray pulsars following upon the cgro/egret heritage. in this paper we present the first agile timingresults on the known gamma-ray pulsars vela, crab, geminga and b 1706-44. thedata were collected from 2007 july to 2008 april, exploiting the missionscience verification phase, the instrument timing calibration and the earlyobserving pointing program. thanks to its large field of view, agile collecteda large number of gamma-ray photons from these pulsars (about 10,000 pulsedcounts for vela) in only few months of observations. the coupling of agiletiming capabilities, simultaneous radio/x-ray monitoring and new tools aimed atprecise photon phasing, exploiting also timing noise correction, unveiled newinteresting features at sub-millisecond level in the pulsars' high-energylight-curves.
