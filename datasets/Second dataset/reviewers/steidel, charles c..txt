0901.2930	the kiloparsec-scale kinematics of high-redshift star-forming galaxies	we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the kinematic structureof star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 3 using keck/osiris integral fieldspectroscopy. our sample is comprised of 12 galaxies between redshifts z ~ 2.0and 2.5 and one galaxy at z ~ 3.3 which are well detected in either halpha or[o iii] emission. these observations were obtained in conjunction with the kecklaser guide star adaptive optics system, with a typical angular resolutionafter spatial smoothing ~ 0.15" (approximately 1 kpc at the redshift of thetarget sample). at most five of these 13 galaxies have spatially resolvedvelocity gradients consistent with rotation while the remaining galaxies haverelatively featureless or irregular velocity fields. all of our galaxies showlocal velocity dispersions ~ 60 - 100 km/s, suggesting that (particularly forthose galaxies with featureless velocity fields) rotation about a preferredaxis may not be the dominant mechanism of physical support. while some galaxiesshow evidence for major mergers such evidence is unrelated to the kinematics ofindividual components (one of our strongest merger candidates also exhibitsunambiguous rotational structure), refuting a simple bimodal disk/mergerclassification scheme. we discuss these data in light of complementary surveysand extant uv-ir spectroscopy and photometry, concluding that the dynamicalimportance of cold gas may be the primary factor governing the observedkinematics of z ~ 2 galaxies. we conclude by speculating on the importance ofmechanisms for accreting low angular-momentum gas and the early formation ofquasi-spheroidal systems in the young universe.(abridged)

0902.4704	the sins survey: broad emission lines in high-redshift star-forming  galaxies	high signal-to-noise, representative spectra of star-forming galaxies at z~2,obtained via stacking, reveal a high-velocity component underneath the narrowh-alpha and [nii] emission lines. when modeled as a single gaussian, this broadcomponent has fwhm &gt; 1500 km/s; when modeled as broad wings on the h-alpha and[nii] features, it has fwhm &gt; 500 km/s. this feature is preferentially found inthe more massive and more rapidly star-forming systems, which also tend to beolder and larger galaxies. we interpret this emission as evidence of eitherpowerful starburst-driven galactic winds or active supermassive black holes. ifgalactic winds are responsible for the broad emission, the observed luminosityand velocity of this gas imply mass outflow rates comparable to the starformation rate. on the other hand, if the broad line regions of active blackholes account for the broad feature, the corresponding black holes masses areestimated to be an order of magnitude lower than those predicted by localscaling relations, suggesting a delayed assembly of supermassive black holeswith respect to their host bulges.

0706.2865	morphologies of galaxies in and around a protocluster at z=2.300	we present results from the first robust investigation of galaxy morphologyas a function of environment at z&gt;1.5. our study is motivated by the fact thatstar-forming galaxies contained within a protocluster at z=2.3 in the hs1700+64field have significantly older ages and larger stellar masses on average thanthose at similar redshifts but more typical environmental densities. in theanalysis of hst/acs images, we apply non-parametric statistics to characterizethe rest-frame uv morphologies of a sample of 85 uv-selected star-forminggalaxies at z=1.7-2.9, 22 of which are contained in the protocluster. theremaining 63 control-sample galaxies are not in the protocluster but have asimilar mean redshift of &lt;z&gt;~2.3. we find no environmental dependence for thedistributions of morphological properties. combining the measured morphologieswith the results of population synthesis modeling, we find only weakcorrelations, if any, between morphological and stellar population propertiessuch as stellar mass, age, extinction and star-formation rate. given theincomplete census of the protocluster galaxy population, and the lack ofcorrelation between rest-frame uv morphology and star-formation history at z~2within our sample, the absence of environmental trends in the distribution ofmorphological properties is not surprising. additionally, using a larger sampleof photometric candidates, we compare morphological distributions for 282uv-selected and 43 near-ir-selected galaxies. while the difference in thedegree of nebulosity between the two samples appears to be a byproduct of thefainter average rest-frame uv surface brightness of the near-ir-selectedgalaxies, we find that, among the lowest surface brightness galaxies, thenear-ir-selected objects have significantly smaller angular sizes (abridged).

0706.4091	multi-wavelength constraints on the cosmic star formation history from  spectroscopy: the rest-frame uv, h-alpha, and infrared luminosity functions  at redshifts 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4	we use a sample of rest-frame uv selected and spectroscopically observedgalaxies at redshifts 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4, combined with ground-based spectroscopich-alpha and spitzer mips 24 micron data, to derive the most robust measurementsof the rest-frame uv, h-alpha, and infrared (ir) luminosity functions (lfs) atthese redshifts. our sample is by far the largest of its kind, with over 2000spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4 and ~15000 photometriccandidates in 29 independent fields covering a total area of almost a squaredegree. our method for computing the lfs takes into account a number ofsystematic effects, including photometric scatter, ly-alpha perturbations tooptical colors, and contaminants. taking into account the latter, we find noevidence for an excess of uv-bright galaxies over what was inferred in earlyz~3 lbg studies. the uv lf appears to undergo little evolution between z~4 andz~2. corrected for extinction, the uv luminosity density (ld) at z~2 is atleast as large as the value at z~3 and a factor of ~9 larger than the value atz~6, primarily reflecting an increase in the number density of bright galaxiesbetween z~6 and z~2. our analysis yields the first constraints anchored byextensive spectroscopy on the ir and bolometric lfs for faint and moderatelyluminous (l[bol]&lt;10^12 l_sun) galaxies. adding the ir to the emergent uvluminosity, incorporating independent measurements of the ld from ulirgs, andassuming realistic dust attenuation values for uv-faint galaxies, indicatesthat galaxies with l[bol]&lt;10^12 l_sun account for ~80% of the bolometric ld andsfrd at z~2-3. our multi-wavelength constraints on the global sfrd indicatethat approximately one-third of the present-day stellar mass density was formedin sub-ultraluminous galaxies between redshifts z=1.9-3.4.

0906.2412	the ultraviolet spectrum of the gravitationally lensed galaxy `the  cosmic horseshoe': a close-up of a star-forming galaxy at z = 2	taking advantage of strong gravitational lensing, we have recorded therest-frame uv spectrum of the z = 2.38115 galaxy `the cosmic horseshoe'(j1148+1930) at higher resolution and s/n than is currently feasible forunlensed galaxies at z = 2 -3. from the analysis of stellar spectral features,we conclude that a continuous mode of star formation with a salpeter slopegives a good representation of the uv spectrum, ruling out significantdepartures from a `standard' imf. generally, we find good agreement between thevalues of metallicity deduced from stellar and nebular tracers. interstellarabsorption is present over a velocity range of 1000 km/s, from -800$ to +250km/s relative to the stars and their h ii regions, and there is evidence thatthe outflowing interstellar gas may be patchy, covering only 60% of the uvstellar continuum. the lya line shares many of the characteristics of theso-called lya emitters. its double-peaked profile can be reproduced by modelsof lya photons resonantly scattered by an expanding shell of gas and dust, with10-15% of the photons escaping the galaxy. many of the physical properties ofthe cosmic horseshoe are similar to those of the only other galaxy at z = 2-3studied in comparable detail up to now: ms 1512-cb58. the fact that these twogalaxies have drastically different lya lines may be due simply to orientationeffects, or differences in the covering factor of outflowing gas, and cautionsagainst classifying high-z galaxies only on the basis of spectral features,such as lya, whose appearance can be affected by a variety of differentparameters.

0910.0840	a study of interstellar gas and stars in the gravitationally lensed  galaxy `the cosmic eye' from rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopy	we report the results of a study of the rest-frame uv spectrum of the cosmiceye, a luminous lyman break galaxy at z=3.07331 gravitationally lensed by afactor of 25. the spectrum, recorded with the esi spectrograph on the keck iitelescope, is rich in absorption features from the gas and massive stars inthis galaxy. the interstellar absorption lines are resolved into two componentsof approximately equal strength and each spanning several hundred km/s invelocity. one component has a net blueshift of -70 km/s relative to the starsand h ii regions and presumably arises in a galaxy-scale outflow similar tothose seen in most star-forming galaxies at z = 2-3. the other is more unusualin showing a mean redshift of +350 km/s relative to the systemic redshift;possible interpretations include a merging clump, or material ejected by aprevious star formation episode and now falling back onto the galaxy, or moresimply a chance alignment with a foreground galaxy. in the metal absorptionlines, both components only partially cover the ob stars against which they arebeing viewed. we tentatively associate the redshifted component with the strongdamped lyman alpha line, indicative of a column density n(h i) = (3.0 +/- 0.8)x 10(21) atoms/cm2, and propose that it provides the dust `foreground screen'responsible for the low ratio of far-infrared to uv luminosities of the cosmiceye. compared to other well-studied examples of strongly lensed galaxies, wefind that the young stellar population of the cosmic eye is essentiallyindistinguishable from those of the cosmic horseshoe and ms 1512-cb58, whilethe interstellar spectra of all three galaxies are markedly different,attesting to the real complexity of the interplay between starbursts andambient interstellar matter in young galaxies (abridged).

0911.2000	the relationship between stellar populations and lyman alpha emission in  lyman break galaxies	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 321 lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3 to investigate systematically the relationshipbetween lya emission and stellar populations. lya equivalent widths (ew) werecalculated from rest-frame uv spectroscopy and optical/near-infrared/spitzerphotometry was used in population synthesis modeling to derive the keyproperties of age, dust extinction, star formation rate (sfr), and stellarmass. we directly compare the stellar populations of lbgs with and withoutstrong lya emission, where we designate the former group (ew &gt; 20 aa) as lyaemitters (laes) and the latter group (ew &lt; 20 aa) as non-laes. this controlledmethod of comparing objects from the same uv luminosity distribution representsan improvement over previous studies in which the stellar populations of lbgsand narrowband-selected laes were contrasted, where the latter were oftenintrinsically fainter in broadband filters by an order of magnitude simply dueto different selection criteria. using a variety of statistical tests, we findthat lya equivalent width and age, sfr, and dust extinction, respectively, aresignificantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong lya emissionalso tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty thanobjects with weak lya emission, or the line in absorption. we accordinglyconclude that, within the lbg sample, objects with strong lya emissionrepresent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-inducedoutflows have reduced the dust covering fraction. we also examined thehypothesis that the attenuation of lya photons is lower than that of thecontinuum, as proposed by some, but found no evidence to support this picture.

0707.3634	integral field spectroscopy of high-redshift star forming galaxies with  laser guided adaptive optics: evidence for dispersion-dominated kinematics	we present early results from an ongoing study of the kinematic structure ofstar-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 3 using integral-field spectroscopyof rest-frame optical nebular emission lines in combination with keck laserguide star adaptive optics (lgsao). we show kinematic maps of 3 target galaxiesq1623-bx453, q0449-bx93, and dsf2237a-c2 located at redshifts z = 2.1820,2.0067, and 3.3172 respectively, each of which is well-resolved with a psfmeasuring approximately 0.11 - 0.15 arcsec (~ 900 - 1200 pc at z ~ 2-3) aftercosmetic smoothing. neither galaxy at z ~ 2 exhibits substantial kinematicstructure on scales &gt;~ 30 km/s; both are instead consistent with largelydispersion-dominated velocity fields with sigma ~ 80 km/s along any given lineof sight into the galaxy. in contrast, dsf2237a-c2 presents a well-resolvedgradient in velocity over a distance of ~ 4 kpc with peak-to-peak amplitude of140 km/s. it is unlikely that dsf2237a-c2 represents a dynamically coldrotating disk of ionized gas as the local velocity dispersion of the galaxy(sigma = 79 km/s) is comparable to the observed shear. using extantmulti-wavelength spectroscopy and photometry we relate these kinematic data tophysical properties such as stellar mass, gas fraction, star formation rate,and outflow kinematics and consider the applicability of current galaxyformation models.[abridged]

1002.0837	dust obscuration and metallicity at high redshift: new inferences from  uv, h-alpha, and 8 micron observations of z~2 star-forming galaxies	we use a sample of 90 spectroscopically-confirmed lyman break galaxies withh-alpha and 24 micron observations to constrain the relationship betweenrest-frame 8 micron luminosity, l(8), and star formation rate (sfr) for l*galaxies at z~2. we find a tight correlation with 0.24 dex scatter between l8and l(ha)/sfr for z~2 galaxies with l(ir)~10^10 - 10^12 lsun. employing thisrelationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts,we find that the uv slope can be used to recover the dust attenuation of thevast majority of l* galaxies at z~2 to within 0.4 dex scatter using the localcorrelation. separately, young galaxies with ages &lt;100 myr appear to follow anextinction curve that is steeper than the one found for local starburstgalaxies. therefore, such young galaxies may be significantly less dusty thaninferred previously. our results provide the first direct evidence, independentof the uv slope, for a correlation between uv and bolometric luminosity at highredshift, in the sense that uv-faint galaxies are also on average less infraredand less bolometrically-luminous than their uv-bright counterparts. further, asthe sfr increases, the uv luminosity reaches a maximum value corresponding tol* at z~2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible formodulating the bright-end of the uv luminosity function. l* galaxies at z~2,while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically-luminous, exhibitratios of metals-to-dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. thisresult is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a lessmetal-rich environment compared to local galaxies of the same luminosity, thusnaturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the luminosity-metallicityand luminosity-obscuration relations.

0708.0007	the sightline to q2343-bx415: clues to galaxy formation in a quasar  environment	(abridged) we have discovered a strong dla coincident in redshift with thefaint qso q2343-bx415 (r = 20.2, z_em = 2.57393). follow-up observations atintermediate spectral resolution reveal that the metal lines associated withthis 'proximate' dla consist of two sets of absorption components. one set ismoving towards the quasar with velocities of ~ 150-600 km/s; this gas is highlyionized and does not fully cover the continuum source, suggesting that it isphysically close to the active nucleus. the other, which accounts for most ofthe neutral gas, is blueshifted relative to the qso, with the strongestcomponent at ~ -160 km/s. we consider the possibility that the pdla arises inthe outflowing interstellar medium of the host galaxy of q2343-bx415, aninterpretation supported by strong c iv and n v absorption at nearbyvelocities, and by the intense radiation field longward of the lyman limitimplied by the high c ii*/h i ratio. if q2343-bx415 is the main source of theseuv photons, then the pdla is located at either ~ 8 or ~ 37 kpc from the activenucleus. alternatively, the absorber may be a foreground star-forming galaxyunrelated to the quasar and coincidentally at the same redshift, but our deepimaging and follow-up spectroscopy of the field of q2343-bx415 has not yetproduced a likely candidate. we measure the abundances of 14 elements in thepdla, finding an overall metallicity of ~ 1/5 solar and a normal pattern ofrelative element abundances for this metallicity. thus, in this pdla there isno evidence for the super-solar metallicities that have been claimed for someproximate, high ionization, systems.

1006.5456	physical conditions in a young, unreddened, low metallicity galaxy at  high redshift	increasingly large samples of galaxies are now being discovered at redshiftsz~5-6 and higher. many of these objects are inferred to be young, low in mass,and relatively unreddened, but detailed analysis of their high quality spectrawill not be possible until the advent of future facilities. in this paper weshed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low mass galaxy bypresenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and uv spectra ofq2343-bx418, an l* galaxy at z=2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio andunusual properties: bx418 is young (&lt;100 myr), low mass (m_star ~ 10^9 msun),low in metallicity (z ~ 1/6 zsun), and unreddened (e(b-v)~0.02, uv continuumslope beta=-2.1). we infer a metallicity 12+log(o/h)=7.9 +/- 0.2 from therest-frame optical emission lines. we also determine the metallicity via thedirect, electron temperature method, using the ratio o iii] 1661, 1666/[o iii]5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12+ log(o/h)=7.8 +/-0.1. these measurements place bx418 among the most metal-poor galaxies observedin emission at high redshift. the rest-frame uv spectrum contains strongemission from lya (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 a), he ii 1640 (bothstellar and nebular), c iii] 1907, 1909 and o iii] 1661, 1666. the c iv/c iii]ratio indicates that the source of ionization is unlikely to be an agn.analysis of the he ii, o iii] and c iii] line strengths indicates a very highionization parameter log u ~ -1, while lya and the interstellar absorptionlines indicate that outflowing gas is highly ionized over a wide range ofvelocities. it remains to be determined how many of bx418's unique spectralfeatures are due to its global properties, such as low metallicity and dustextinction, and how many are indicative of a short-lived phase in the earlyevolution of an otherwise normal star-forming galaxy.

1007.1409	a newly discovered dla and associated ly-alpha emission in the spectra  of the gravitationally lensed quasar um 673a,b	the sightline to the brighter member of the gravitationally lensed quasarpair um 673a,b intersects a damped lyman-alpha system (dla) at z = 1.62650which, because of its low redshift, has not been recognised before. our highquality echelle spectra of the pair, obtained with hires on the keck itelescope, show a drop in neutral hydrogen column density n(h i) by a factor ofat least 400 between um 673a and b, indicating that the dla's extent in thisdirection is much less than the 2.7 kpc separation between the two sightlinesat z = 1.62650. by reassessing this new case together with published data onother quasar pairs, we conclude that the typical size (radius) of dlas at theseredshifts is r ~ (5 +/- 3) kpc, smaller than previously realised. highlyionized gas associated with the dla is more extended, as we find only smalldifferences in the c iv absorption profiles between the two sightlines.  coincident with um 673b, we detect a weak and narrow ly-alpha emission linewhich we attribute to star formation activity at a rate sfr &gt;~ 0.2 m_solar/yr.the dla in um 673a is metal-poor, with an overall metallicity z_dla ~ 1/30z_solar, and has a very low internal velocity dispersion. it exhibits someapparent peculiarities in its detailed chemical composition, with the elementsti, ni, and zn being deficient relative to fe by factors of 2-3. the [zn/fe]ratio is lower than those measured in any other dla or galactic halo star,presumably reflecting somewhat unusual previous enrichment by stellarnucleosynthesis. we discuss the implications of these results for the nature ofthe galaxy hosting the dla.

1011.1282	calibrating galaxy redshifts using absorption by the surrounding  intergalactic medium	rest-frame uv spectral lines of star-forming galaxies are systematicallyoffset from the galaxies' systemic redshifts, probably because of large-scaleoutflows. we calibrate galaxy redshifts measured from rest-frame uv lines byutilizing the fact that the mean hi ly-alpha absorption profiles around thegalaxies, as seen in spectra of background objects, must be symmetric withrespect to the true galaxy redshifts if the galaxies are oriented randomly withrespect to the lines of sight to the background objects. we use 15 qsos atz~2.5-3 and more than 600 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts atz~1.9-2.5. all galaxies are within 2 mpc proper from the lines of sight to thebackground qsos. we find that lya emission and ism absorption redshifts requiresystematic shifts of v_lya=-295(+35)(-35) km/s and v_ism=145(+70)(-35) km/s.assuming a gaussian distribution, we put 1-sigma upper limits on possiblerandom redshift offsets of &lt;220 km/s for lya and &lt;420 km/s for ism redshifts.for the small subset (&lt;10%) of galaxies for which near-ir spectra have beenobtained, we can compare our results to direct measurements based on nebularemission lines which we confirm to mark the systemic redshifts. while our v_ismagrees with the direct measurements, our v_lya is significantly smaller.however, when we apply our method to the near-ir subsample which ischaracterized by slightly different selection effects, the best-fit velocityoffset comes into agreement with the direct measurement. this confirms thevalidity of our approach, and implies that no single number appropriatelydescribes the whole population of galaxies, in line with the observation thatthe line offset depends on galaxy spectral morphology. this method providesaccurate redshift calibrations and will enable studies of circumgalactic matteraround galaxies for which rest-frame optical observations are not available.

1107.4367	the kinematics of multiple-peaked ly-alpha emission in star-forming  galaxies at z~2-3	we present new results on the ly-alpha emission-line kinematics of 18 z~2-3star-forming galaxies with multiple-peaked ly-alpha profiles. with our largespectroscopic database of uv-selected star-forming galaxies at these redshifts,we have determined that ~30% of such objects with detectable ly-alpha emissiondisplay multiple-peaked emission profiles. these profiles provide additionalconstraints on the escape of ly-alpha photons due to the rich velocitystructure in the emergent line. despite recent advances in modeling the escapeof ly-alpha from star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, comparisons betweenmodels and data are often missing crucial observational information. using keckii nirspec spectra of h-alpha (z~2) and [oiii] 5007 (z~3), we have measuredaccurate systemic redshifts, rest-frame optical nebular velocity dispersionsand emission-line fluxes for the objects in the sample. accurate systemicredshifts allow us to translate the multiple-peaked ly-alpha profiles intovelocity space, revealing that the majority (11/18) display double-peakedemission straddling the velocity-field zeropoint with stronger red-sideemission. we compare our data with the predictions of simple models foroutflowing and infalling gas distributions around high-redshift galaxies. whilepopular "shell" models provide a qualitative match with many of theobservations of ly-alpha emission, we find that in detail there are importantdiscrepancies between the models and data, as well as problems with applyingthe framework of an expanding thin shell of gas to explain high-redshift galaxyspectra. our data highlight these inconsistencies, as well as illuminatingcritical elements for success in future models of outflow and infall inhigh-redshift galaxies.

1108.6060	first results from the 3d-hst survey: the striking diversity of massive  galaxies at z&gt;1	we present first results from the 3d-hst program, a near-ir spectroscopicsurvey performed with the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope. wehave used 3d-hst spectra to measure redshifts and halpha equivalent widths fora stellar mass-limited sample of 34 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 with m(stellar)&gt;10^11m(sun) in the cosmos, goods, and aegis fields. we find that a substantialfraction of massive galaxies at this epoch are forming stars at a high rate:the fraction of galaxies with halpha equivalent widths &gt;10 a is 59%, comparedto 10% among sdss galaxies of similar masses at z=0.1. galaxies with weakhalpha emission show absorption lines typical of 2-4 gyr old stellarpopulations. the structural parameters of the galaxies, derived from theassociated wfc3 f140w imaging data, correlate with the presence of halpha:quiescent galaxies are compact with high sersic index and high inferredvelocity dispersion, whereas star-forming galaxies are typically largetwo-armed spiral galaxies, with low sersic index. some of these star forminggalaxies might be progenitors of the most massive s0 and sa galaxies. ourresults challenge the idea that galaxies at fixed mass form a homogeneouspopulation with small scatter in their properties. instead we find that massivegalaxies form a highly diverse population at z&gt;1, in marked contrast to thelocal universe.

1204.3636	the halo masses and galaxy environments of hyperluminous qsos at z~2.7  in the keck baryonic structure survey	we present an analysis of the galaxy distribution surrounding 15 of the mostluminous (&gt;10^{14} l_sun; m_1450 ~ -30) qsos in the sky with z~2.7. our dataare drawn from the keck baryonic structure survey (kbss). in this work, we usethe positions and spectroscopic redshifts of 1558 galaxies that lie within ~3',(4.2 h^{-1} comoving mpc; cmpc) of the hyperluminous qso (hlqso) sightline inone of 15 independent survey fields, together with new measurements of thehlqso systemic redshifts. we measure the galaxy-hlqso cross-correlationfunction, the galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation function, and the characteristicscale of galaxy overdensities surrounding the sites of exceedingly rare,extremely rapid, black hole accretion. on average, the hlqsos lie withinsignificant galaxy overdensities, characterized by a velocity dispersionsigma_v ~ 200 km s^{-1} and a transverse angular scale of ~25", (~200 physicalkpc). we argue that such scales are expected for small groups withlog(m_h/m_sun)~13. the galaxy-hlqso cross-correlation function has a best-fitcorrelation length r_0_gq = (7.3 \pm 1.3) h^{-1} cmpc, while the galaxyautocorrelation measured from the spectroscopic galaxy sample in the samefields has r_0_gg = (6.0 \pm 0.5) h^{-1} cmpc. based on a comparison withsimulations evaluated at z ~ 2.6, these values imply that a typical galaxylives in a host halo with log(m_h/m_sun) = 11.9\pm0.1, while hlqsos inhabithost halos of log(m_h/m_sun) = 12.3\pm0.5. in spite of the extremely largeblack hole masses implied by their observed luminosities [log(m_bh/m_sun) &gt;9.7], it appears that hlqsos do not require environments very different fromtheir much less luminous qso counterparts. evidently, the exceedingly low spacedensity of hlqsos (&lt; 10^{-9} cmpc^{-3}) results from a one-in-a-million eventon scales &lt;&lt; 1 mpc, and not from being hosted by rare dark matter halos.

1205.0555	the characteristic star formation histories of galaxies at redshifts  z~2-7	a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;3.7, withcomplementary imaging in the near- and mid-ir from the ground and from hubbleand spitzer, is used to infer the average star formation histories (sfhs) oftypical galaxies from z~7 to 2. for a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6, weperform a comparison of star formation rates (sfrs) determined from sedmodeling (sfrs[sed]) and those calculated from deep keck uv and spitzer/mips 24micron imaging (sfrs[ir+uv]). exponentially declining sfhs yield sfrs[sed] thatare 5-10x lower on average than sfrs[ir+uv], indicating that declining sfhs maynot be accurate for typical galaxies at z&gt;2. the sfrs of z~2-3 galaxies aredirectly proportional to their stellar masses m*, with unity slope---a resultthat is confirmed with spitzer/irac stacks of 1179 uv-faint (r&gt;25.5)galaxies---for m*&gt;5e8 msun and sfrs &gt;2 msun/yr. we interpret this result in thecontext of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of thesfr-m* relation. the average specific sfrs at z~2-3 are similar within a factorof two to those measured at z&gt;4, implying an average sfh where sfrs increasewith time. a consequence of these rising sfhs is that (a) a substantialfraction of uv-bright z~2-3 galaxies had faint sub-l* progenitors at z&gt;4; and(b) gas masses must increase with time from z=7 to 2, over which time the netcold gas accretion rate---as inferred from the specific sfr and thekennicutt-schmidt relation---is ~2-3x larger than the sfr . however, if weevolve to higher redshift the sfhs and masses of the halos that are expected tohost l* galaxies at z~2, we find that &lt;10% of the baryons accreted onto typicalhalos at z&gt;4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. theseresults highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at earlycosmic times when galaxies were first assembling.

1205.0595	quenched cold accretion of a large scale metal-poor filament due to  virial shocking in the halo of a massive z=0.7 galaxy	using hst/cos/stis and hires/keck high-resolution spectra, we have studied aremarkable hi absorbing complex at z=0.672 toward the quasar q1317+277. the hiabsorption has a velocity spread of 1600 km/s, comprises 21 voigt profilecomponents, and resides at an impact parameter of d=58 kpc from a bright, highmass [log(m_vir/m_sun) ~ 13.7] elliptical galaxy that is deduced to have a 6gyr old, solar metallicity stellar population. ionization models suggest themajority of the structure is cold gas surrounding a shock heated cloud that iskinematically adjacent to a multi-phase group of clouds with detected ciii, civand ovi absorption, suggestive of a conductive interface near the shock. thededuced metallicities are consistent with the moderate in situ enrichmentrelative to the levels observed in the z ~ 3 ly-alpha forest. we interpret thehi complex as a metal-poor filamentary structure being shock heated as itaccretes into the halo of the galaxy. the data support the scenario of an earlyformation period (z &gt; 4) in which the galaxy was presumably fed by cold-modegas accretion that was later quenched via virial shocking by the hot halo suchthat, by intermediate redshift, the cold filamentary accreting gas iscontinuing to be disrupted by shock heating. thus, continued filamentaryaccretion is being mixed into the hot halo, indicating that the star formationof the galaxy will likely remain quenched. to date, the galaxy and the hiabsorption complex provide some of the most compelling observational datasupporting the theoretical picture in which accretion is virial shocked in thehot coronal halos of high mass galaxies.

1206.3308	stellar populations of uv-selected active galactic nuclei host galaxies  at z ~ 2 - 3	we use stellar population synthesis modeling to analyze the host galaxyproperties of a sample of 33 uv-selected, narrow-lined active galactic nuclei(agns) at z ~ 2 - 3. in order to quantify the contribution of agn emission tohost galaxy broadband spectral energy distributions (seds), we use thesubsample of 11 agns with photometric coverage spanning from rest-frame uvthrough near-ir wavelengths. modeling the seds of these objects with a linearcombination of stellar population and agn templates, we infer the effect of theagn on derived stellar population parameters. we also estimate the typical biasin derived stellar populations for agns lacking rest-frame near-ir wavelengthcoverage, and develop a method for inferring the true host galaxy properties.we compare agn host galaxy properties to those of a sample of uv-selected,star-forming non-agns in the same redshift range, including a subsamplecarefully matched in stellar mass. although the agns have higher masses andsfrs than the full non-active sample, their stellar population properties areconsistent with those of the mass-selected sample, suggesting that the presenceof an agn is not connected with the cessation of star-formation activity instar-forming galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3. we suggest that a correlation between m_bhand galaxy stellar mass is already in place at this epoch. assuming a roughlyconstant eddington ratio for agns at all stellar masses, we are unable todetect the agns in low-mass galaxies because they are simply too faint.

1206.6889	an hst/wfc3-ir morphological survey of galaxies at z = 1.5-3.6: ii. the  relation between morphology and gas-phase kinematics	we analyze rest-frame optical morphologies and gas-phase kinematics as tracedby rest-frame far-uv and optical spectra for a sample of 204 star forminggalaxies in the redshift range z ~ 2-3 drawn from the keck baryonic structuresurvey (kbss). we find that spectroscopic properties and gas-phase kinematicsare closely linked to morphology: compact galaxies with semi-major axis radii r&lt;~ 2 kpc are substantially more likely than their larger counterparts toexhibit lya in emission. although lya emission strength varies widely withingalaxies of a given morphological type, all but one of 19 galaxies with lyaequivalent width w_lya &gt; 20 angstroms have compact and/or multiple-componentmorphologies with r &lt;= 2.5 kpc. the velocity structure of absorption lines inthe galactic continuum spectra also varies as a function of morphology.galaxies of all morphological types drive similarly strong outflows (as tracedby the blue wing of interstellar absorption line features), but the outflows oflarger galaxies are less highly ionized and exhibit larger optical depth at thesystemic redshift that may correspond to a decreasing efficiency of feedback inevacuating gas from the galaxy. this v ~ 0 km/s gas is responsible both forshifting the mean absorption line redshift and attenuating w_lya (via a longerresonant scattering path) in galaxies with larger rest-optical half lightradii. in contrast to galaxies at lower redshifts, there is no evidence for acorrelation between outflow velocity and inclination, suggesting that outflowsfrom these puffy and irregular systems may be poorly collimated.

1207.4196	high velocity dispersion in a rare grand design spiral galaxy at  redshift z=2.18	although relatively common in the local universe, only one grand-designspiral galaxy has been spectroscopically confirmed to lie at z&gt;2 (hdfx 28;z=2.011), and may prove to be a major merger that simply resembles a spiral inprojection. the rarity of spirals has been explained as a result of disks beingdynamically 'hot' at z&gt;2 which may instead favor the formation ofcommonly-observed clumpy structures. alternatively, current instrumentation maysimply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to thosein the modern universe. at redshifts &lt;2, the velocity dispersion of disksdecreases, and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z~1. here we reportobservations of the grand design spiral galaxy q2343-bx442 at z=2.18.spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying anuncertain origin for the spiral structure. the kinematics of the galaxy areconsistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive theformation of short-lived spiral structure. a duty cycle of &lt; 100 myr for suchtidally-induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with theirrarity.

1208.4098	discovery of multi-phase cold accretion in a massive galaxy at z=0.7	we present detailed photo+collisional ionization models and kinematic modelsof the multi-phase absorbing gas, detected within the hst/cos, hst/stis, andkeck/hires spectra of the background quasar ton 153, at 104 kpc along theprojected minor axis of a star-forming spiral galaxy (z=0.6610). complementaryg'r'i'ks photometry and stellar population models indicate that the host galaxyis dominated by a 4 gyr stellar population with slightly greater than solarmetallicity and has an estimated log(m*)=11 and a log(mvir)=13. photoionizationmodels of the low ionization absorption, (mgi, siii, mgii and ciii) which tracethe bulk of the hydrogen, constrain the multi-component gas to be cold(logt=3.8-5.2) and metal poor (-1.68&lt;[x/h]&lt;-1.64). a lagging halo modelreproduces the low ionization absorption kinematics, suggesting gas coupled tothe disk angular momentum, consistent with cold accretion mode material insimulations. the civ and ovi absorption is best modeled in a separatecollisionally ionized metal-poor (-2.50&lt;[x/h]&lt;-1.93) warm phase with logt=5.3.although their kinematics are consistent with a wind model, given the 2-2.5dexdifference between the galaxy stellar metallicity and the absorptionmetallicity indicates the gas cannot arise from galactic winds. we discuss andconclude that although the quasar sight-line passes along the galaxy minor axisat projected distance of 0.3 virial radii, well inside its virial shock radius,the combination of the relative kinematics, temperatures, and relativemetallicities indicated that the multi-phase absorbing gas arises from coldaccretion around this massive galaxy. our results appear to contradict recentinterpretations that absorption probing the projected minor axis of a galaxy issampling winds.

1209.0005	the temperature-density relation in the intergalactic medium at redshift  &lt;z&gt;=2.4	we present new measurements of the temperature-density (t-rho) relation forneutral hydrogen in the 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 intergalactic medium (igm) using a sampleof ~6000 individual hi absorbers fitted with voigt profiles constrained in allcases by multiple lyman series transitions. we find model independent evidencefor a positive correlation between the column density of hi (nhi) and theminimum observed velocity width of absorbers (bmin). with minimalinterpretation, this implies that the temperature-density relation in the igmis not "inverted", contrary to many recent studies. fitting bmin as a functionof nhi results in line width - column density dependence of the form bdmin =b_0 [nhi/n_(hi,0)]^(gamma-1) with a minimum line width at mean density rhobar[n_(hi, 0) = 10^13.6 cm^-2] of b_0 = 17.9 +- 0.2 km/s and a power-law index of(gamma-1) = 0.15 +- 0.02. using analytic arguments, these measurements imply an"equation of state" for the igm at &lt;z&gt;= 2.4 of the form t = t_0(rho/rhobar)^(gamma-1) with a temperature at mean density of t_0 = (1.94 +-0.05) x 10^4 k and a power-law index (gamma -1) = 0.46 +- 0.05.

1210.2393	a refined estimate of the ionizing emissivity from galaxies at z~3:  spectroscopic follow-up in the ssa22a field	we investigate the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the ionizingbackground at z~3, building on previous work based on narrowband (nb3640)imaging in the ssa22a field. we use new keck/lris spectra of lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) and narrowband-selected lya emitters (laes) to measureredshifts for 16 lbgs and 87 laes at z&gt;3.055, such that our nb3640 imagingprobes the lyman-continuum (lyc) region. when we include the existing set ofspectroscopically-confirmed lbgs, our total sample with z&gt;3.055 consists of 41lbgs and 91 laes, of which nine lbgs and 20 laes are detected in our nb3640image. with our combined imaging and spectroscopic data sets, we criticallyinvestigate the origin of nb3640 emission for detected lbgs and laes. we removefrom our samples 3 lbgs and 3 laes with spectroscopic evidence of contaminationof their nb3640 flux by foreground galaxies, and statistically model theeffects of additional, unidentified foreground contaminants. the resultingcontamination and lyc-detection rates, respectively, are 62 +/-13% and 8 +/-3%for our lbg sample, and 47 +/-10% and 12 +/-2% for our lae sample. thecorresponding ratios of non-ionizing uv to lyc flux-density, corrected forintergalactic medium (igm) attenuation, are 18.0 +34.8/-7.4 for lbgs, and 3.7+2.5/-1.1 for laes. we use these ratios to estimate the total contribution ofstar-forming galaxies to the ionizing background and the hydrogenphotoionization rate in the igm, finding values larger than, but consistentwith, those measured in the lya forest. finally, the measured uv to lycflux-density ratios imply model-dependent lyc escape fractions of f_{esc}^{lyc}~ 5-7% for our lbg sample and f_{esc}^{lyc} ~ 10-30% for our fainter laesample.

1211.2805	the explosion energy of early stellar populations: the fe-peak element  ratios in low metallicity damped lyman-alpha systems	the relative abundances of the fe-peak elements (ti-zn) at the lowestmetallicities are intimately linked to the physics of core-collapse supernovaexplosions. with a sample of 25 very metal-poor damped lyman-alpha systems, weinvestigate the trends of the fe-peak element ratios with metallicity. for nineof the 25 dlas, a direct measurement (or useful upper limit) of one or more ofthe ti,cr,co,ni,zn/fe abundance ratios could be determined from detectedabsorption lines. for the remaining systems (without detections), we devised anew form of spectral stacking to estimate the typical fe-peak element ratios ofthe dla population in this metallicity regime. we compare these data toanalogous measurements in metal-poor stars of the galactic halo and to detailedcalculations of explosive nucleosynthesis in metal-free stars. we conclude thatmost of the dlas in our sample were enriched by stars that released an energyof &lt; 1.2 x 10^51 erg when they exploded as core-collapse supernovae. finally,we discuss the exciting prospect of measuring fe-peak element ratios in dampedlyman-alpha systems with fe/h &lt; 1/1000 of solar when 30-m class telescopesbecome available. only then will we be able to pin down the energy that wasreleased by the supernovae of the first stars.

0712.1829	c, n, o abundances in the most metal-poor damped lyman alpha systems	this study focuses on some of the most metal-poor damped lyman alphaabsorbers known in the spectra of high redshift qsos, using new and archivalobservations obtained with uv-sensitive echelle spectrographs on the keck andvlt telescopes. the weakness and simple velocity structure of the absorptionlines in these systems allows us to measure the abundances of several elements,and in particular those of c, n, and o, a group that is difficult to study indlas of more typical metallicities. we find that when the oxygen abundance isless than about 1/100 of solar, the c/o ratio in high redshift dlas andsub-dlas matches that of halo stars of similar metallicity and shows highervalues than expected from galactic chemical evolution models based onconventional stellar yields. furthermore, there are indications that at theselow metallicities the n/o ratio may also be above simple expectations and mayexhibit a minimum value, as proposed by centurion and her collaborators in2003. both results can be interpreted as evidence for enhanced production of cand n by massive stars in the first few episodes of star formation, in ourgalaxy and in the distant proto-galaxies seen as qso absorbers. the higherstellar yields implied may have an origin in stellar rotation which promotesmixing in the stars' interiors, as considered in some recent modelcalculations. we briefly discuss the relevance of these results to currentideas on the origin of metals in the intergalactic medium and the universalityof the stellar initial mass function.

(2012), wefind that there are fractionally more high-nhi absorbers than low-nhi absorbersin the cgm compared to the igm, leading to a shallower power law fit to the cgmfrequency distribution. we use these new measurements to calculate the totalopacity of the igm and cgm to hydrogen-ionizing photons, finding significantlyhigher opacity than most previous studies, especially from absorbers withlog(nhi) &lt; 17.2. reproducing the opacity measured in our data as well as theincidence of absorbers with log(nhi) &gt; 17.2 requires a broken power lawparameterization of the frequency distribution with a break near log(nhi) ~ 15.we compute new estimates of the mean free path (mfp) to hydrogen-ionizingphotons at z=2.4, finding mfp = 147 +- 15 mpc when considering only igmopacity. if instead, we consider photons emanating from a high-z star-forminggalaxy and account for the local excess opacity due to the surrounding cgm ofthe galaxy itself, the mean free path is reduced to mfp = 121 +- 15 mpc. thesemfp measurements are smaller than recent estimates and should inform futurestudies of the metagalactic uv background and of ionizing sources at z~2-3.

1306.1563	a measurement of galaxy halo mass from the surrounding hi ly{\alpha}  absorption	we measure the dark matter halo masses of z~2.36 uv color-selectedstar-forming galaxies by matching the observed median hi ly{\alpha} absorptionaround them, as observed in the spectra of background qsos, to the absorptionaround haloes above a given mass in cosmological simulations. focusing ontransverse separations 0-2 pmpc and line of sight separations 154-616 km/s, wefind a minimum halo mass of log10(mmin/msun)=11.6(+0.2)(-0.2), which is in goodagreement with published halo mass estimates from clustering analyses. weverified that the measured halo mass is insensitive to a change in thecosmological parameters (wmap1 vs. wmap3) and to the inclusion of strong agnfeedback. one unique strength of this method is that it can be used in narrowfield galaxy-qso surveys, i.e. ~30 x 30 arcseconds. in addition, we find thatthe observed anisotropy in the 2-d hi ly{\alpha} absorption distribution onscales of 1.5-2 pmpc is consistent with being a consequence of large-scale gasinfall into the potential wells occupied by galaxies.

1306.6334	the mass-metallicity relation of a z~2 protocluster with mosfire	we present keck/mosfire observations of the role of environment in theformation of galaxies at z~2. using k-band spectroscopy of h-alpha and [n ii]emission lines, we have analyzed the metallicities of galaxies within andaround a z=2.3 protocluster discovered in the hs1700+643 field. our main sampleconsists of 23 protocluster and 20 field galaxies with estimates of stellarmasses and gas-phase metallicities based on the n2 strong-line metallicityindicator. with these data we have examined the mass-metallicity relation (mzr)with respect to environment at z~2. we find that field galaxies follow thewell-established trend between stellar mass and metallicity, such that moremassive galaxies have larger metallicities. the protocluster galaxies, however,do not exhibit a dependence of metallicity on mass, with the low-massprotocluster galaxies showing an enhancement in metallicity compared to fieldgalaxies spanning the same mass range. a comparison with galaxy formationmodels suggests that the mass-dependent environmental trend we observed can bequalitatively explained in the context of the recycling of "momentum-driven"galaxy wind material. accordingly, winds are recycled on a shorter timescale indenser environments, leading to an enhancement in metallicity at fixed mass forall but the most massive galaxies. future hydrodynamical simulations of z~2overdensities matching the one in the hs1700 field will be crucial forunderstanding the origin of the observed environmental trend in detail.

1308.3240	precision measures of the primordial abundance of deuterium	we report the discovery of deuterium absorption in the very metal-poor([fe/h] = -2.88) damped lyman-alpha system at z_abs = 3.06726 toward the qsosdss j1358+6522. on the basis of 13 resolved d i absorption lines and thedamping wings of the h i lyman alpha transition, we have obtained a new,precise measure of the primordial abundance of deuterium. furthermore, tobolster the present statistics of precision d/h measures, we have reanalyzedall of the known deuterium absorption-line systems that satisfy a set of strictcriteria. we have adopted a blind analysis strategy (to remove human bias), anddeveloped a software package that is specifically designed for precision d/habundance measurements. for this reanalyzed sample of systems, we obtain aweighted mean of (d/h)_p = (2.53 +/- 0.04) x 10^-5, corresponding to auniversal baryon density100 omega_b h^2 = 2.202 +/- 0.046 for the standardmodel of big bang nucleosynthesis. by combining our measure of (d/h)_p withobservations of the cosmic microwave background, we derive the effective numberof light fermion species, n_eff = 3.28 +/- 0.28. we therefore rule out theexistence of an additional (sterile) neutrino (i.e. n_eff = 4.046) at 99.3percent confidence (2.7 sigma), provided that n_eff and the baryon-to-photonratio (eta_10) did not change between bbn and recombination. we also place astrong bound on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, xi_d = +0.05 +/- 0.13 basedonly on the cmb+(d/h)_p observations. combining xi_d with the current bestliterature measure of y_p, we find |xi| &lt;= +0.062. in future, improvedmeasurements of several key reaction rates, in particular d(p,gamma)3he, andfurther measures of (d/h)_p with a precision comparable to those consideredhere, should allow even more stringent limits to be placed on new physicsbeyond the standard model.

1311.5092	testing metallicity indicators at z~1.4 with the gravitationally lensed  galaxy cassowary 20	we present x-shooter observations of cassowary 20 (cswa 20), a star-forming(sfr ~6 msol/yr) galaxy at z=1.433, magnified by a factor of 11.5 by thegravitational lensing produced by a massive foreground galaxy at z=0.741. weanalysed the integrated physical properties of the hii regions of cswa 20 usingtemperature- and density-sensitive emission lines. we find the abundance ofoxygen to be ~1/7 of solar, while carbon is ~50 times less abundant than in thesun. the unusually low c/o ratio may be an indication of a particularly rapidtimescale of chemical enrichment. the wide wavelength coverage of x-shootergives us access to five different methods for determining the metallicity ofcswa 20, three based on emission lines from hii regions and two on absorptionfeatures formed in the atmospheres of massive stars. all five estimates are inagreement, within the factor of ~2 uncertainty of each method. the interstellarmedium of cswa 20 only partially covers the star-forming region as viewed fromour direction; in particular, absorption lines from neutrals and first ions areexceptionally weak. we find evidence for large-scale outflows of theinterstellar medium (ism) with speeds of up 750 km/s, similar to the valuesmeasured in other high-z galaxies sustaining much higher rates of starformation.

1402.4809	igm emission observations with the cosmic web imager: ii. discovery of  extended, kinematically-linked emission around ssa22 lyman-alpha blob 2	the intergalactic medium (igm) is the dominant reservoir of baryons,delineates the large scale structure at low to moderate overdensities, andprovides gas from which galaxies form and evolve. simulations of a cold darkmatter (cdm) dominated universe predict that the igm is distributed in a cosmicweb of filaments, and that galaxies should form along and at the intersectionsof these filaments (bond et al. 1994; miralda-escude et al. 1996). whileobservations of qso absorption lines and the large scale distribution ofgalaxies have confirmed the cdm paradigm, the cosmic web has never beenconfirmed by direct imaging. here we report the lyman-alpha blob 2 (lab2) inssa22, with the cosmic web imager. this is an integral field spectrographoptimized for low surface brightness, extended emission. with 22 hours of totalsource exposure, cwi has revealed that lab2 has extended lyman-alpha emissionwhich is consistent with filaments. we perform tests to secure the robustnessof this result, which relies on data with modest signal-to-noise ratio. we havedeveloped a smoothing algorithm that permits visualization of data cube slicesalong image or spectral-image planes. with both raw and smoothed data cubes wedemonstrate that the filaments are kinematically associated with lab2 anddisplay double-peaked profiles of optically thick lyman-alpha emission. theflux is 10 to 20x brighter than expected for the emission from the igm but isconsistent with boosted fluorescence from a buried qso or gravitation coolingradiation. using emission models we infer a baryon mass in the filaments of atleast 1-4x10e11 solar mass, and the dark halo mass is at least 2x10e12 solarmass. the spatial kinematic morphology is more consistent with inflow from thecosmic web than outflow. lab2 and the surrounding gas have significant andcoaligned angular momentum, strengthening the case for their association.

1402.4816	igm emission observations with the cosmic web imager: i. the circum-qso  medium of qso 1549+19, and evidence for a filamentary gas inflow	the palomar cosmic web imager (pcwi), an integral field spectrograph designedto detect and map low surface brightness emission, has obtained imagingspectroscopic maps of ly-alpha from the circum-qso medium (cqm) of qsohs1549+19 at redshift of 2.843. extensive extended emission is detected fromthe cqm, consistent with fluorescent and pumped ly-alpha produced by theionizing and ly-alpha continuum of the qso. many features present in pcwispectral images match those detected in narrow-band images. filamentarystructures with narrow line profiles are detected in several cases as long as250-400 kpc. one of these is centered at a velocity redshifted with respect tothe systemic velocity, and displays a spatially collimated and kinematicallycold line profile increasing in velocity width approaching the qso. thissuggests that the filament gas is infalling onto the qso, perhaps in a coldaccretion flow. because of the strong ionizing flux, the neutral column densityis low, typically n(hi) is roughly 10e12-10e15/square-cm, and the line centeroptical depth is also low (typically tau0 is less than 10), insufficient todisplay well-separated double peak emission characteristic of higher lineoptical depths. with a simple ionization and cloud model we can very roughlyestimate the total gas mass (log m(gas) equal to 12.5 +/- 0.5) and the totalmass (log m(tot) equal to 13.3+/- 0.5). we can also calculate a kinematic massfrom the total line profile (2x10e13 m(sun)), which agrees with the massestimated from the gas emission. the intensity-binned spectrum of the cqm showsa progression in kinematic properties consistent with heirarchical structureformation.

1403.0942	metal-line absorption around $z\approx$2.4 star-forming galaxies in the  keck baryonic structure survey	(abridged) we study metal absorption around 854 $z\approx$2.4 star-forminggalaxies taken from the keck baryonic structure survey (kbss). the galaxiesexamined in this work lie in the fields of 15 hyper-luminous background qsos,with galaxy impact parameters ranging from 35 proper kpc (pkpc) to 2 proper mpc(pmpc). using the pixel optical depth technique, we present the firstgalaxy-centred 2-d maps of the median absorption by ovi, nv, civ, ciii, andsiv, as well as updated results for hi. at small galactocentric radii we detecta strong enhancement of the absorption relative to randomly located regionsthat extend out to at least 180 pkpc in the transverse direction, and $\pm$240km/s along the line-of-sight (los, ~1 pmpc in the case of pure hubble flow) forall ions except nv. for civ (and hi) we detect a significant enhancement of theabsorption signal out to 2 pmpc in the transverse direction, corresponding tothe maximum impact parameter in our sample. after normalising the medianabsorption profiles to account for variations in line strengths and detectionlimits, in the transverse direction we find no evidence for a sharp drop-off inmetals distinct from that of hi. we argue instead that non-detection of somemetal line species in the extended circumgalactic medium is consistent withdifferences in the detection sensitivity. we also present measurements ofcovering fractions and equivalent widths as a function of projected galaxydistance. limiting the sample to the 340 galaxies with redshifts measured fromnebular emission lines does not decrease the extent of the enhancement alongthe los compared to that in the transverse direction. this rules out redshifterrors as the source of the observed redshift-space anisotropy and thus impliesthat we have detected the signature of gas peculiar velocities from infall,outflows, or virial motions for hi, ovi, civ, ciii, and civ.

1410.8214	detection of hot, metal-enriched outflowing gas around $z\approx\,$2.3  star-forming galaxies in the keck baryonic structure survey	we use quasar absorption lines to study the physical conditions in thecircumgalactic medium of redshift $z\approx 2.3$ star-forming galaxies takenfrom the keck baryonic structure survey (kbss). in turner et al. 2014 we usedthe pixel optical depth technique to show that absorption by hi and the metalions ovi, nv, civ, ciii and siiv is strongly enhanced within $|\deltav|\lesssim170$ km/s and projected distances $|d|\lesssim180$ proper kpc fromsightlines to the background quasars. here we demonstrate that the oviabsorption is also strongly enhanced at fixed hi, civ, and siiv optical depths,and that this enhancement extends out to $\sim350$ km/s. at fixed hi theincrease in the median ovi optical depth near galaxies is 0.3-0.7 dex and isdetected at 2--3-$\sigma$ confidence for all seven hi bins that have$\log_{10}\tau_{\rm hi}\ge-1.5$. we use ionization models to show that theobserved strength of ovi as a function of hi is consistent with enriched,photoionized gas for pixels with $\tau_{\rm hi}\gtrsim10$. however, for pixelswith $\tau_{\rm hi} \lesssim 1$ this would lead to implausibly highmetallicities at low densities if the gas were photoionized by the backgroundradiation. this indicates that the galaxies are surrounded by gas that issufficiently hot to be collisionally ionized ($t &gt; 10^5\,$k) and that asubstantial fraction of the hot gas has a metallicity $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ ofsolar. given the high metallicity and large velocity extent (out to$\sim1.5\times v_{\rm circ}$) of this gas, we conclude that we have detectedhot, metal enriched outflows arising from star-forming galaxies.

1411.1408	correlation between star formation activity and electron density of  ionized gas at z=2.5	in the redshift interval of $2&lt;z&lt;3$, the physical conditions of theinter-stellar medium (ism) in star-forming galaxies are likely to be differentfrom those in the local universe because of lower gaseous metallicities, highergas fractions, and higher star formation activities. in fact, observationssuggest that higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, andharder uv radiation fields are common. in this paper, based on the spectra ofh$\alpha$-selected star-forming galaxies at $z=2.5$ taken with multi-objectspectrometer for infrared exploration (mosfire) on keck-1 telescope, we measureelectron densities ($n_e$) using the oxygen line ratio ([oii]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between theelectron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. as a result, wefind that the specific star formation rate (ssfr) and the surface density ofsfr ($\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}$) are correlated with the electron density at $z=2.5$for the first time. the $\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}-n_e$ relation is likely to belinked to the star formation law in hii regions (where star formation activityis regulated by interstellar pressure). moreover, we discuss the mode of starformation in those galaxies. the correlation between ssfr and$\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}$ suggests that highly star-forming galaxies (with highssfr) tend to be characterized by higher surface densities of star formation($\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}$) and thus higher $n_e$ values as well.

1502.06978	a deep hubble and keck search for definitive identification of lyman  continuum emitters at z~3.1	narrow-band imaging of the rest-frame lyman continuum (lyc) of galaxies atz~3.1 has produced a large number of candidate lyc-emitting galaxies. thesesamples are contaminated by galaxies at lower redshift. to better understandlyc escape, we need an uncontaminated sample of galaxies that emit strongly inthe lyc. here we present deep hubble imaging of five bright galaxies at z~3.1that had previously been identified as candidate lyc-emitters with ground-basedimages. the wfc3 f336w images probe the lyc of galaxies at z&gt;3.06 and providean order-of-magnitude increase in spatial resolution over ground-based imaging.the non-ionizing uv images often show multiple galaxies (or components) within~1'' of the candidate lyc emission seen from the ground. in each case, only oneof the components is emitting light in the f336w filter, which would indicatelyc escape if that component is at z&gt;3.06. we use keck/nirspec near-irspectroscopy to measure redshifts of these components to distinguishlyc-emitters from foreground contamination. we find that two candidates are lowredshift contaminants, one candidate had a previously misidentified redshift,and the other two cannot be confirmed as lyc-emitters. the level ofcontamination is consistent with previous estimates. for the galaxies withz&gt;3.06, we derive strong 1 sigma limits on the relative escape fraction between0.07 and 0.09. we still do not have a sample of definitive lyc-emitters, and amuch larger study of low luminosity galaxies is required. the combination ofhigh resolution imaging and deep spectroscopy is critical for distinguishinglyc-emitters from foreground contaminants.

astro-ph;0102456	the rest frame optical spectra of lyman break galaxies: star formation,  extinction, abundances, and kinematics	we present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of lyman breakgalaxies in the near-infrared aimed at detecting the emission lines of [o ii],[o iii], and hbeta from the h ii regions of star forming galaxies at z = 3.  from observations of 19 objects with the keck and vlt telescopes, we reachthe following main conclusions. contrary to expectations, the star formationrates deduced from the hbeta luminosity are on average no larger than thoseimplied by the stellar continuum at 1500 a; presumably any differentialextinction between rest-frame optical and uv is small compared with therelative uncertainties in the calibrations of these two star formation tracers.for the galaxies in our sample, the abundance of o can only be determined towithin one order of magnitude. even so, it seems well established that lbgs arethe most metal-enriched structures at z = 3, apart from qsos, with abundancesgreater than about 1/10 solar. they are also significantly overluminous fortheir metallicities; this is probably an indication that their mass-to-lightratios are small compared with present-day galaxies. at face value theirvelocity dispersions, sigma = 50 - 115 km/s imply virial masses of about10^{10} solar masses within half-light radii of 2.5 kpc. however, we are unableto establish if the widths of the emission lines do reflect the motions of theh ii regions within the gravitational potential of the galaxies, even though intwo cases we see hints of rotation curves. all 19 lbgs observed show evidencefor galactic-scale superwinds; such outflows are important for regulating starformation, distributing metals over large volumes, and allowing lyman continuumphotons to escape and ionize the igm.

astro-ph;0104455	the farthest known supernova: support for an accelerating universe and a  glimpse of the epoch of deceleration	we present photometric observations of an apparent type ia supernova (sn ia)at a redshift of ~1.7, the farthest sn observed to date. sn 1997ff, wasdiscovered in a repeat observation by the hst of the hdf-), and serendipitouslymonitored with nicmos on hst throughout the gto campaign. the sn type can bedetermined from the host galaxy type:an evolved, red elliptical lacking enoughrecent star formation to provide a significant population of core-collapse sne.the class- ification is further supported by diagnostics available from theobserved colors and temporal behavior of the sn, both of which match a typicalsn ia. the photo- metric record of the sn includes a dozen flux measurements inthe i, j, and h bands spanning 35 days in the observed frame. the redshiftderived from the sn photometry, z=1.7+/-0.1, is in excellent agreement with theredshift estimate of z=1.65+/-0.15 derived from theu_300,b_450,v_606,i_814,j_110,j_125,h_160, h_165,k_s photometry of the galaxy.optical and near-infrared spectra of the host provide a very tentativespectroscopic redshift of 1.755. fits to observations of the sn provideconstraints for the redshift-distance relation of sne~ia and a powerful test ofthe current accelerating universe hypothesis. the apparent sn brightness isconsistent with that expected in the decelerating phase of the preferredcosmological model, omega_m~1/3, omega_lambda~2/3. it is inconsistent with greydust or simple luminosity evolution, candidate astro- physical effects whichcould mimic past evidence for an accelerating universe from sne ia at z~0.5.weconsider several sources of possible systematic error including lensing, snmisclassification, selection bias, and calibration errors. currently, none ofthese effects appears likely to challenge our conclusions.

astro-ph;0110637	new observations of the interstellar medium in the lyman break galaxy ms  1512-cb58	we present the results of a detailed study of the interstellar medium of ms1512-cb58, an l* lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276, based on new spectralobservations obtained with the echelle spectrograph and imager on the keck iitelescope at 58 km/s resolution. we focus in particular on the chemicalabundances and kinematics of the interstellar gas and our main findings are asfollows. even at this relatively early epoch, the ism of this galaxy is alreadyhighly enriched in elements released by type ii supernovae; the abundances ofo, mg, si, p, and s are all about 2/5 of their solar values. in contrast, n andthe fe-peak elements mn, fe, and ni are underabundant by a factor of about 3.based on current ideas of stellar nucleosynthesis, these results can beunderstood if most of the metal enrichment in cb58 has taken place within thelast 300 million years, the timescale for the release of n from intermediatemass stars. cb58 appears to be an example of a galaxy in the process ofconverting its gas into stars on a few dynamical timescales; quite possibly weare witnessing the formation of a galactic bulge or an elliptical galaxy. theenergetic star formation activity has stirred the interstellar medium to highvelocities of up to 1000 km/s. the net effect is a bulk outflow of the ism at aspeed of 255 km/s and at a rate which exceeds the star formation rate. it isunclear whether this gas will be lost or retained by the galaxy. we point outthat the chemical and kinematic properties of cb58 are markedly different fromthose of most damped lyman alpha systems at the same redshift.

astro-ph;0404235	the kinematics of morphologically selected z~2 galaxies in the goods-n  field	we present near-ir spectra of h-alpha emission from 13 galaxies at z~2 in thegoods-n field. the galaxies were selected primarily because they appear to haveelongated morphologies, and slits were aligned with the major axes (asdetermined from the rest-frame uv emission) of 11 of the 13. if the galaxiesare elongated because they are highly inclined, alignment of the slit and majoraxis should maximize the observed velocity and reveal velocity shear, ifpresent. in spite of this alignment, we see spatially resolved velocity shearin only two galaxies. we show that the seeing makes a large difference in theobserved velocity spread of a tilted emission line, and use this information toplace limits on the velocity spread of the ionized gas of the galaxies in thesample: we find that all 13 have v_{0.5} &lt; 110 km/s, where v_{0.5} is thevelocity shear (half of the velocity range of a tilted emission line) thatwould be observed under our best seeing conditions of ~0.5". when combined withprevious work, our data also indicate that aligning the slit along the majoraxis does not increase the probability of observing a tilted emission line. wethen focus on the one-dimensional velocity dispersion \sigma, which is muchless affected by the seeing, and see that the elongated subsample exhibits asignificantly lower velocity dispersion than galaxies selected at random fromour total h-alpha sample, not higher as one might have expected. we also seesome evidence that the elongated galaxies are less reddened than those randomlyselected using only uv colors. both of these results are counter to what wouldbe expected if the elongated galaxies were highly inclined disks. it is atleast as likely that the galaxies' elongated morphologies are due to mergingsubunits.

astro-ph;0407296	spectral modelling of star-forming regions in the ultraviolet: stellar  metallicity diagnostics for high redshift galaxies	the chemical composition of high redshift galaxies is an important propertywhich gives clues to their past history and future evolution and yet isdifficult to measure with current techniques. in this paper we investigate newmetallicity indicators, based upon the strengths of stellar photosphericfeatures at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths. by combining the evolutionaryspectral synthesis code starburst99 with the output from the non-lte modelatmosphere code wm-basic, we have developed a code that can model theintegrated ultraviolet stellar spectra of star-forming regions at metallicitiesbetween 1/20 and twice solar. we use our models to explore a number of spectralregions that are sensitive to metallicity and clean of other spectral features.the most promising metallicity indicator is an absorption feature between 1935a and 2020 a, which arises from the blending of numerous fe iii transitions. wecompare our model spectra to observations of two well studied high redshiftstar-forming galaxies, ms1512-cb58 (a lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276), andq1307-bm1163 (a uv-bright galaxy at z = 1.411). the profiles of thephotospheric absorption features observed in these galaxies are well reproducedby the models. in addition, the metallicities inferred from their equivalentwidths are in good agreement with previous determinations based on interstellarabsorption and nebular emission lines. our new technique appears to be apromising alternative, or complement, to established methods which have only alimited applicability at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0602473	the mass-metallicity relation at z~2	we use a sample of 87 rest-frame uv-selected star-forming galaxies with meanspectroscopic redshift z=2.26 to study the correlation between metallicity andstellar mass at high redshift. using stellar masses determined from sed fittingto 0.3-8 micron photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in stellar mass,and construct six composite h-alpha+[nii] spectra from all of the objects ineach bin. we estimate the mean oxygen abundance in each bin from the[nii]/h-alpha ratio, and find a monotonic increase in metallicity withincreasing stellar mass, from 12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.2 for galaxies with &lt;m_star&gt; =2.7e9 msun to 12+log(o/h) = 8.6 for galaxies with &lt;m_star&gt; = 1e11 msun. we usethe empirical relation between star formation rate density and gas density toestimate the gas fractions of the galaxies, finding an increase in gas fractionwith decreasing stellar mass. these gas fractions combined with the observedmetallicities allow the estimation of the effective yield y_eff as a functionof stellar mass; in constrast to observations in the local universe which showa decrease in y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.such a variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit by a model withsupersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times higher than the star formationrate. we conclude that the mass-metallicity relation at high redshift is drivenby the increase in metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through starformation, and is likely modulated by metal loss from strong outflows ingalaxies of all masses. there is no evidence for preferential loss of metalsfrom low mass galaxies as has been suggested in the local universe.

astro-ph;0610693	the physical nature of rest-uv galaxy morphology during the peak epoch  of galaxy formation	motivated by the irregular and little-understood morphologies of z ~ 2 - 3galaxies, we use non-parametric coefficents to quantify the morphologies of 216galaxies which have been spectroscopically confirmed to lie at redshifts z =1.8 - 3.4 in the goods-n field. using measurements of ultraviolet (uv) andoptical spectral lines, multi-band photometric data, and stellar populationmodels we statistically assess possible correlations between galaxy morphologyand physical observables such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and thestrength of galaxy-scale outflows. we find evidence that dustier galaxies havemore nebulous uv morphologies and that larger, more luminous galaxies may drivestronger outflows, but otherwise conclude that uv morphology is eitherstatistically decoupled from the majority of physical observables or determinedby too complex a combination of physical processes to provide characterizationswith predictive power. given the absence of strong correlations between uvmorphology and physical parameters such as star formation rates, we aretherefore unable to support the hypothesis that morphologically irregulargalaxies predominantly represent major galaxy mergers. comparing galaxysamples, we find that ir-selected bzk galaxies and radio-selected submillimetergalaxies (smgs) have uv morphologies similar to the optically selected sample,while distant red galaxies (drgs) are more nebulous.

(2) a single systematickinematic model apparently cannot describe the observed velocity spreads in theabsorbing gas. it is more that a heterogeneous population of sub-galaxy scalestructures are giving rise to the observed cloud velocities. (3) the absorbinggas spatial distribution and kinematics may depend upon gas producing eventsand mechanisms that are recent to the epoch at which the absorption isobserved. these distributions likely change over a few gyr timescale. basedupon these inferences, we note that any evolution in the absorption gasproperties over a larger redshift range should be directly quantifiable from alarger dataset of high-resolution absorption profiles.

astro-ph;9808017	metal abundances at z &lt; 1.5: fresh clues to the chemical enrichment  history of damped lyman alpha systems	we explore the redshift evolution of the metal content of damped lyman alphasystems (dlas) with new observations of four absorbers at z &lt; 1.5 . the mainconclusion is that the column density--weighted mean metallicity, [&lt;zn/h&gt;] =-1.03 +/- 0.23 (on a logarithmic scale), is not significantly higher at z &lt; 1.5than at earlier epochs, despite the fact that the comoving star formation ratedensity of the universe was near its maximum value at this redshift. for threeof the four dlas our observations include absorption lines of si, mn, cr, fe,and ni, as well as zn. we argue that the relative abundances of these elementsare consistent with a moderate degree of dust depletion which, once accountedfor, leaves no room for the enhancement of the alpha-elements over iron seen inmetal poor stars in the milky way. this is contrary to previous assertions thatdlas have been enriched solely by type ii supernovae, but can be understood ifthe rate of star formation in the systems studied proceeded more slowly than inthe early history of our galaxy. these results add to a growing body of dataall pointing to the conclusion that known dlas do not trace the galaxypopulation responsible for the bulk of star formation. possible reasons arethat sight-lines through metal rich gas are systematically underrepresentedbecause the background qsos are reddened, and that the most actively starforming galaxies are also the most compact, presenting too small across-section to have been probed yet with the limited statistics of currentsamples.

astro-ph;9908007	the ultraviolet spectrum of ms 1512-cb58: an insight into lyman break  galaxies	we present an intermediate resolution, high s/n spectrum of the z = 2.7268galaxy ms 1512-cb58, obtained with lris on the keck i telescope and coveringthe rest frame far-uv from 1150 to 1930 a. gravitational lensing by aforeground cluster boosts the flux from cb58 by a factor of about 30 andprovides the opportunity for a first quantitative study of the physicalproperties of star forming galaxies at high redshift. our main results are asfollows. the ultraviolet spectral properties of cb58 are remarkably similar tothose of nearby star forming galaxies. the p-cygni profiles of civ and nv arebest matched by continuous star formation with a salpeter imf extending beyond50 solar masses---we find no evidence for either a flatter imf (at the highmass end), or an imf deficient in the most massive stars. there are clues inour data that the metallicity of both the stars and the gas is a few timesbelow solar. our best estimate, approximately equal to 1/4 solar, is 3 timeshigher than the typical metallicity of damped lyman alpha systems at the sameredshift, consistent with the proposal that the galaxies which dominate the h iabsorption cross-section are generally forming stars at a slower rate than l*lyman break galaxies like cb58. the relative velocities of the stellar lines,interstellar absorption, and h ii emission indicate the existence oflarge-scale outflows in the interstellar medium of cb58, with a bulk outwardmotion of 200 km/s and a mass loss rate of approximately 60 solar masses peryear, roughly comparable to the star formation rate. such galactic winds maywell be the mechanism which self-regulates star formation, distributes metalsover large volumes and allows the escape of ionizing photons into the igm.

astro-ph;9908083	the unusual infrared object hdf-n j123656.3+621322	we describe an object in the hubble deep field north with very unusualnear-infrared properties. it is readily visible in hubble space telescopenicmos images at 1.6um and from the ground at 2.2um, but is undetected (withsignal-to-noise &lt;~ 2) in very deep wfpc2 and nicmos data from 0.3 to 1.1um. thef_nu flux density drops by a factor &gt;~ 8.3 (97.7% confidence) from 1.6 to1.1um. the object is compact but may be slightly resolved in the nicmos 1.6umimage. in a low-resolution, near-infrared spectrogram, we find a possibleemission line at 1.643um, but a reobservation at higher spectral resolutionfailed to confirm the line, leaving its reality in doubt. we consider varioushypotheses for the nature of this object. its colors are unlike those of knowngalactic stars, except perhaps the most extreme carbon stars or mira variableswith thick circumstellar dust shells. it does not appear to be possible toexplain its spectral energy distribution as that of a normal galaxy at anyredshift without additional opacity from either dust or intergalactic neutralhydrogen. the colors can be matched by those of a dusty galaxy at z &gt;~ 2, by amaximally old elliptical galaxy at z &gt;~ 3 (perhaps with some additionalreddening), or by an object at z &gt;~ 10 whose optical and 1.1um light have beensuppressed by the intergalactic medium. under the latter hypothesis, if theluminosity results from stars and not an agn, the object would resemble aclassical, unobscured protogalaxy, with a star formation rate &gt;~ 100 m_sun/yr.such uv-bright objects are evidently rare at 2 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, however, with aspace density several hundred times lower than that of present-day l* galaxies.

astro-ph;9909092	a search for the submillimetre counterparts to lyman break galaxies	we have carried out targetted sub-mm observations as part of a programme toexplore the connection between the rest-frame uv and far-ir properties ofstar-forming galaxies at high redshift, which is currently poorly understood.on the one hand the lyman break technique is very effective at selecting z~3galaxies. on the other hand `blank field' imaging in the sub-mm seems to turnup sources routinely, amongst which some are star forming galaxies at similarredshifts. already much work has been done searching for opticalidentifications of objects detected using the scuba instrument. here we havetaken the opposite approach, performing sub-mm photometry for a sample of lymanbreak galaxies whose uv properties imply high star formation rates.  the total signal from our lyman break sample is undetected in the sub-mm, atan rms level of 0.5 mjy, which implies that the population of lyman breakgalaxies does not constitute a large part of the recently detected blank-fieldsub-mm sources. however, our one detection suggests that with reasonable scubaintegrations we might expect to detect those few lbgs that are far-irbrightest.

astro-ph;9910131	si and mn abundances in damped lya systems with low dust content	we have measured the abundances of zn, si, mn, cr, fe, and ni in three dampedlyman alpha systems at redshifts z &lt; 1 from high resolution echelle spectra ofqsos recorded with the keck i telescope. in all three cases the abundances ofcr, fe, and ni relative to zn indicate low levels of dust depletions. wepropose that when the proportion of refractory elements locked up in dustgrains is less than about 50 percent, it is plausible to assume anapproximately uniform level of depletion for all grain constituents and, byapplying a small dust correction, recover the intrisic abundances of si and mn.we use this approach on a small sample of damped systems for which it isappropriate, with the aim of comparing the metallicity dependence of the ratios[si/fe] and [mn/fe] with analogous measurements in milky way stars. the mainconclusion is that the relative abundances of both elements in distant galaxiesare broadly in line with expectations based on galactic data. si displays amild enhancement at low metallicities, as expected for an alpha-captureelement, but there are also examples of near-solar [si/fe] at [fe/h] &lt; -1. theunderabundance of mn at low metallicities is possibly even more pronounced thanthat in metal-poor stars, and no absorption system has yet been found where[mn/fe] is solar. the heterogeneous chemical properties of damped lyman alphasystems, evident even from this limited set of measurements, provide furthersupport for the conclusion from imaging studies that a varied population ofgalaxies gives rise to this class of qso absorbers.

0810.2788	a steep faint-end slope of the uv luminosity function at z~2-3:  implications for the global stellar mass density and star formation in low  mass halos	we use the deep ground-based optical photometry of the lyman break galaxy(lbg) survey to derive robust measurements of the faint-end slope (alpha) ofthe uv lf at redshifts 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4. our sample includes &gt;2000 spectroscopicredshifts and ~31000 lbgs in 31 spatially-independent fields over a total areaof 3261 arcmin^2. these data allow us to select galaxies to 0.07l* and 0.10l*at z~2 and z~3, respectively. a maximum likelihood analysis indicates steepvalues of alpha(z=2)=-1.73+/-0.07 and alpha(z=3)=-1.73+/-0.13. this result isrobust to luminosity dependent systematics in the ly-alpha equivalent width andreddening distributions, is similar to the steep values advocated at z&gt;4, andimplies that ~93% of the unobscured uv luminosity density at z~2-3 arises fromsub-l* galaxies. with a realistic luminosity dependent reddening distribution,faint to moderately luminous galaxies account for &gt;70% and &gt;25% of thebolometric luminosity density and present-day stellar mass density,respectively, when integrated over 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4. we find a factor of 8-9 increasein the star formation rate density between z~6 and z~2, due to both abrightening of l* and an increasing dust correction proceeding to lowerredshifts. the previously observed discrepancy between the integral of the starformation history and stellar mass density measurements at z~2 may bereconciled by invoking a luminosity dependent reddening correction to the starformation history combined with an accounting for the stellar mass contributedby uv-faint galaxies. the steep and relatively constant alpha of the uv lf atz&gt;2 contrasts with the shallower value inferred locally, suggesting that theevolution in the faint-end slope may be dictated simply by the availability oflow mass halos capable of supporting star formation at z&lt;2.

0810.5599	dynamics of galactic disks and mergers at z~1.6: spatially resolved  spectroscopy with keck laser guide star adaptive optics	we present 0.2" resolution near-infrared integral field spectroscopy ofh-alpha emission from six star forming galaxies at z~1.6 (look-back time of~9.6 gyr). these observations were obtained with osiris using the keck laserguide star adaptive optics system. all sources have a compact spatial extent of~1", with an average half light radius of r=2.9 kpc and average dereddened starformation rate of 22 msolar per year. based on h-alpha kinematics we find thatthese six galaxies are dynamically distinguishable, and we classify them aseither merger or disk candidate systems. we find three merger systems(hdf-bx1287, hdf-bx1315, and q1623-bx491) with varying geometries and dynamicalproperties. three galaxies (hdf-bmz1299, q2343-bx344, and q2343-bm145) arewell-fit by an inclined-disk model with low velocity residuals (20 to 46km/sec). an average plateau velocity of v_p=185 km/sec is achieved within 1.0kpc. the majority of observed velocity dispersions (~88 km/sec) can beexplained by the residual seeing halo, and are not intrinsic to our sources.however, one merger and one disk candidate have high velocity dispersions (&gt;200 km/sec) that cannot be solely explained by beam smearing. for two diskcandidates, we detect [nii] emission and are able to map the [nii]/h-alpharatio on kiloparsec scales. in both cases, [nii] emission is more concentratedthan h-alpha emission (&lt; 0.2"), and peak ratios are best explained by thepresence of an agn. these are among the weakest known agn at high redshift,however their emission is strong enough to impact high redshift metallicitystudies that use nebular ratios. all disk candidates have likely completed onlya few orbital periods, and if left unperturbed are excellent candidates tobecome present-day spiral galaxies.
