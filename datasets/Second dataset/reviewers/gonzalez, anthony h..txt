0901.1109	the cosmic evolution of agn in galaxy clusters	we present the surface density of luminous active galactic nuclei (agn)associated with a uniformly selected galaxy cluster sample identified in the8.5 square degree bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. the clustersare distributed over a large range of redshift (0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5) and we identifyagn using three different selection criteria: mid-ir color, radio luminosity,and x-ray luminosity. relative to the field, we note a clear overdensity of thenumber of agn within 0.5 mpc of the cluster centers at z &gt; 0.5. the amplitudeof this agn overdensity increases with redshift. although there are significantdifferences between the agn populations probed by each selection technique, therise in cluster agn surface density generally increases more steeply than thatof field quasars. in particular, x-ray selected agn are at least three timesmore prevalent in clusters at 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 compared to clusters at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.this effect is stronger than can be explained by the evolving median richnessof our cluster sample. we thus confirm the existence of a butcher-oemler typeeffect for agn in galaxy clusters, with the number of agn in clustersincreasing with redshift.

0909.4079	a spectroscopically confirmed excess of 24 micron sources in a super  galaxy group at z=0.37: enhanced dusty star formation relative to the cluster  and field environment	to trace how dust-obscured star formation varies with environment, we comparethe fraction of 24 micron sources in a super galaxy group to the field and arich galaxy cluster at z~0.35. we draw on multi-wavelength observations thatcombine hubble, chandra, and spitzer imaging with extensive opticalspectroscopy (&gt;1800 redshifts) to isolate galaxies in each environment and thusensure a uniform analysis. we focus on the four galaxy groups in supergroup1120-12 that will merge to form a galaxy cluster comparable in mass to coma. wefind that 1) the fraction of supergroup galaxies with sfr(ir)&gt;3 msun/yr is fourtimes higher than in the cluster (32% vs. 7%); 2) the supergroup's infraredluminosity function confirms that it has a higher density of ir memberscompared to the cluster and includes bright ir sources not found in galaxyclusters at z&lt;0.35; and 3) there is a strong trend of decreasing ir fractionwith increasing galaxy density, i.e. an ir-density relation, not observed inthe cluster. these dramatic differences are surprising because the early-typefraction in the supergroup is already as high as in clusters, i.e. thetimescales for morphological transformation cannot be strongly coupled to whenthe star formation is completely quenched. the supergroup has a significantfraction (~17%) of luminous, low-mass, ir members that are outside the groupcores (r&gt;0.5 mpc); once their star formation is quenched, most will evolve intofaint red galaxies. our analysis indicates that the supergroup's 24 micronpopulation also differs from that in the field: 1) despite the supergrouphaving twice the fraction of e/s0s as the field, the fraction of ir galaxies iscomparable in both environments, and 2) the supergroup's ir luminosity functionhas a higher l(ir)* than that previously measured for the field.

1004.1436	ultracool field brown dwarf candidates selected at 4.5 microns	we have identified a sample of cool field brown dwarf candidates using iracdata from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs). the candidates wereselected from 400,000 sdwfs sources with [4.5] &lt;= 18.5 mag and required to have[3.6]-[4.5] &gt;= 1.5 and [4.5] - [8.0] &lt;= 2.0 on the vega system. the first colorrequirement selects objects redder than all but a handful of presently knownbrown dwarfs with spectral classes later than t7, while the second eliminates14 probable reddened agn. optical detection of 4 of the remaining 18 sourcesimplies they are likely also agn, leaving 14 brown dwarf candidates. for two ofthe brightest candidates (sdwfs j143524.44+335334.6 and sdwfsj143222.82+323746.5), the spectral energy distributions including near-infrareddetections suggest a spectral class of ~ t8. the proper motion is &lt; 0.25 "/yr,consistent with expectations for a luminosity inferred distance of &gt;70 pc. thereddest brown dwarf candidate (sdwfs j143356.62+351849.2) has [3.6] -[4.5]=2.24 and h - [4.5] &gt; 5.7, redder than any published brown dwarf in thesecolors, and may be the first example of the elusive y-dwarf spectral class.models from burrows et al. (2003) predict larger numbers of cool brown dwarfsshould be found for a chabrier (2003) mass function. suppressing the model[4.5] flux by a factor of two, as indicated by previous work, brings theburrows models and observations into reasonable agreement. the recentlylaunched wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) will probe a volume ~40xlarger and should find hundreds of brown dwarfs cooler than t7.

1005.3817	spectroscopic confirmation of a z=2.79 multiply imaged luminous infrared  galaxy behind the bullet cluster	we report spectroscopic confirmation and high-resolution infrared imaging ofa z=2.79 triply-imaged galaxy behind the bullet cluster. this source, aspitzer-selected luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), is confirmed via polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (pah) features using the spitzer infrared spectrograph(irs) and resolved with hst wfc3 imaging. in this galaxy, which with a stellarmass of m*=4e9 msun is one of the two least massive ones studied with irs atz&gt;2, we also detect h_2 s(4) and h_2 s(5) pure rotational lines (at 3.1 sigmaand 2.1 sigma) - the first detection of these molecular hydrogen lines in ahigh-redshift galaxy. from the molecular hydrogen lines we infer an excitationtemperature t=377+68-84 k. the detection of these lines indicates that the warmmolecular gas mass is 6(+36-4)% of the stellar mass and implies the likelyexistence of a substantial reservoir of cold molecular gas in the galaxy.future spectral observations at longer wavelengths with facilities like theherschel space observatory, the large millimeter telescope, and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) thus hold the promise of precisely determining thetotal molecular gas mass. given the redshift, and using refined astrometricpositions from the high resolution imaging, we also update the magnificationestimate and derived fundamental physical properties of this system. thepreviously published values for total infrared luminosity, star formation rate,and dust temperature are confirmed modulo the revised magnification; however wefind that pah emission is roughly a factor of five stronger than would bepredicted by the relations between the total infrared and pah luminosityreported for smgs and starbursts in pope et al. (2008).

1005.3847	star formation in the bullet cluster i: the infrared luminosity function  and star formation rate	the bullet cluster is a massive galaxy cluster at z=0.297 undergoing a majorsupersonic (mach 3) merger event. using spitzer 24um images, irac data, opticalimaging, and optical spectroscopy, we present the global star formation rate(sfr) of this unique cluster. using a 90% spectroscopically complete sample of37 non-agn mips confirmed cluster members out to r&lt;1.7 mpc, and the rieke etal. (2009) relation to convert from 24um flux to sfr, we calculate anintegrated obscured sfr of 267 msolar/yr and a specific star formation rate of28 msolar/yr per 10^14 msolar. the cluster mass normalized integrated sfr ofthe bullet cluster is among the highest in a sample of eight other clusters andcluster mergers from the literature. five lirgs and one ulirg contribute 30%and 40% of the total sfr of the cluster, respectively. to investigate theorigin of the elevated specific sfr, we compare the infrared luminosityfunction (ir lf) of the bullet cluster to those of coma (evolved to z=0.297)and cl1358+62. the bullet cluster ir lf exhibits an excess of sources comparedto the ir lfs of the other massive clusters. a schechter function fit of thebullet cluster ir lf yields l*=44.68+/-0.11 ergs/s, which is ~0.25 and 0.35 dexbrighter than l* of evolved coma and cl1358+62, respectively. the elevated irlf of the bullet cluster relative to other clusters can be explained if weattribute the "excess" star-forming ir galaxies to a population associated withthe infalling group that have not yet been transformed into quiescent galaxies.in this case, the timescale required for quenching star formation in thecluster environment must be longer than the timescale since the group'saccretion -- a few hundred million years. we suggest that "strangulation" islikely to be an important process in the evolution of star formation inclusters.

0704.0261	constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter from  numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1e 0657-5	(abridged) we compare recent results from x-ray, strong lensing, weaklensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merginggalaxy cluster 1e0657-56. x-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subclusterwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions ofthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionlessgalaxies (and inconsistent with the x-ray brightness peaks). previous studies,based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on theself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, usingsimplified analytic techniques. in this work, we take advantage of new,higher-quality observational datasets by running n-body simulations of1e0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, andcomparing the results with observations. furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m &lt; 1.25 cm^2/g. ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m &lt; 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

1007.1454	the formation of massive cluster galaxies	we present composite 3.6 and 4.5 micron luminosity functions for clustergalaxies measured from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) for 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.we compare the evolution of m* for these luminosity functions to models forpassively evolving stellar populations to constrain the primary epoch of starformation in massive cluster galaxies. at low redshifts (z &lt; 1.3) our resultsagree well with models with no mass assembly and passively evolving stellarpopulations with a luminosity-weighted mean formation redshift zf=2.4 assuminga kroupa initial mass function (imf). we conduct a thorough investigation ofsystematic biases that might influence our results, and estimate systematicuncertainites of delta zf=(+0.16-0.18) (model normalization), deltazf=(+0.40-0.05) (alpha), and delta zf=(+0.30-0.45) (choice of stellarpopulation model). for a salpeter type imf, the typical formation epoch is thusstrongly constrained to be z ~2-3. higher formation redshifts can only be madeconsistent with the data if one permits an evolving imf that is bottom-light athigh redshift, as suggested by van dokkum et al 2008. at high redshift (z &gt;1.3) we also witness a statistically significant (&gt;5sigma) disagreement betweenthe measured luminosity function and the continuation of the passive evolutionmodel from lower redshifts. after considering potential systematic biases thatmight influence our highest redshift data points, we interpret the observeddeviation as potential evidence for ongoing mass assembly at this epoch.

1009.3022	the average physical properties and star formation histories of the  uv-brightest star-forming galaxies at z~3.7	[abridged] we investigate the average physical properties and star formationhistories of the most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies at z~3.7. our resultsare derived from analyses of the average spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed from stacked optical to infrared photometry, of a sample of the1,902 most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies found in 5.3 square degrees of thenoao deep wide-field survey. we bin the sample according to uv luminosity, andfind that the shape of the average sed in the rest-frame optical and infraredis fairly constant with uv luminosity: i.e., more uv luminous galaxies are, onaverage, also more luminous at longer wavelengths. in the rest-uv, however, thespectral slope (measured at 0.13-0.28 um) rises steeply with the median uvluminosity from -1.8 at l l* to -1.2 in the brightest bin (l~4-5l*). we usepopulation synthesis analyses to derive the average physical properties ofthese galaxies and find that: (1) l_uv, and thus star formation rates (sfrs),scale closely with stellar mass such that more uv-luminous galaxies are alsomore massive; (2) the median ages indicate that the stellar populations arerelatively young (200-400 myr) and show little correlation with uv luminosity;and (3) more uv-luminous galaxies are dustier than their less-luminouscounterparts, such that l~4-5l* galaxies are extincted up to a(1600)=2 magwhile l l* galaxies have a(1600)=0.7-1.5 mag. based on these observations, weargue that the average star formation histories of uv-luminous galaxies arebetter described by models in which sfr increases with time in order tosimultaneously reproduce the tight correlation between the observed sfr andstellar mass, and the universally young ages of these galaxies. we demonstratethe potential of measurements of the sfr-m* relation at multiple redshifts todiscriminate between simple models of star formation histories.

1011.4945	star clusters, galaxies, and the fundamental manifold	we explore whether global observed properties, specifically half-light radii,mean surface brightness, and integrated stellar kinematics, suffice tounambiguously differentiate galaxies from star clusters, which presumablyformed differently and lack dark matter halos. we find that star clusters lieon the galaxy scaling relationship referred to as the fundamental manifold(fm), on the extension of a sequence of compact galaxies, and so conclude thatthere is no simple way to differentiate star clusters from ultra-compactgalaxies. by extending the validity of the fm over a larger range of parameterspace and a wider set of objects, we demonstrate that the physics thatconstrains the resulting baryon and dark matter distributions in stellarsystems is more general than previously appreciated. the generality of the fmimplies 1) that the stellar spatial distribution and kinematics of one type ofstellar system do not arise solely from a process particular to that set ofsystems, such as violent relaxation for elliptical galaxies, but are insteadthe result of an interplay of all processes responsible for the genericsettling of baryons in gravitational potential wells, 2) that the physics ofhow baryons settle is independent of whether the system is embedded within adark matter halo, and 3) that peculiar initial conditions at formation orstochastic events during evolution do not ultimately disturb the overallregularity of baryonic settling. we also utilize the relatively simple natureof star clusters to relate deviations from the fm to the age of the stellarpopulation and find that stellar population models systematically andsignificantly over predict the mass-to-light ratios of old, metal-richclusters.

1107.3838	a search for young stars in the s0 galaxies of a super-group at z=0.37	we analyze galex uv data for a system of four gravitationally-bound groups atz=0.37, sg1120, which is destined to merge into a coma-mass cluster by z=0, tostudy how galaxy properties may change during cluster assembly. of the 38visually-classified s0 galaxies, with masses ranging from log(m_*)~10-11, wedetect only one in the nuv channel, a strongly star-forming s0 that is thebrightest uv source with a measured redshift placing it in sg1120. stacking theundetected s0 galaxies (which generally lie on or near the optical red-sequenceof sg1120) still results in no nuv/fuv detection (&lt;2 sigma). using our limit inthe nuv band, we conclude that for a rapidly truncating star formation rate,star formation ceased *at least* ~0.1 to 0.7 gyr ago, depending on the strengthof the starburst prior to truncation. with an exponentially decliningstar-formation history over a range of time-scales, we rule out recentstar-formation over a wide range of ages. we conclude that if s0 formationinvolves significant star formation, it occurred well before the groups were inthis current pre-assembly phase. as such, it seems that s0 formation is evenmore likely to be predominantly occurring outside of the cluster environment.

1201.2720	testing distance estimators with the fundamental manifold	we demonstrate how the fundamental manifold (fm) can be used tocross-calibrate distance estimators even when those "standard candles" are notfound in the same galaxy. such an approach greatly increases the number ofdistance measurements that can be utilized to check for systematic distanceerrors and the types of estimators that can be compared. here we comparedistances obtained using sn ia, cepheids, surface brightness fluctuations, theluminosity of the tip of the red giant branch, circumnuclear masers, eclipsingbinaries, rr lyrae stars, and the planetary nebulae luminosity functions. wefind no significant discrepancies (differences are &lt; 2 sigma) between distancemethods, although differences at the ~10% level cannot yet be ruled out. thepotential exists for significant refinement because the data used here areheterogeneous b-band magnitudes that will soon be supplanted by homogeneous,near-ir magnitudes. we illustrate the use of fm distances to 1) revisit thequestion of the metallicity sensitivity of various estimators, confirming thedependence of sn ia distances on host galaxy metallicity, and 2) provide analternative calibration of h_0 that replaces the classical ladder approach inthe use of extragalactic distance estimators with one that utilizes data over awide range of distances simultaneously.

0711.2071	toward equations of galactic structure	we find that all classes of galaxies, ranging from disks to spheroids andfrom dwarf spheroidals to brightest cluster galaxies, lie on a two dimensionalsurface within the space defined by the logarithms of the half-light radius,r_e, mean surface brightness within r_e, i_e, and internal velocity, v^2 =(1/2)v_c^2 + sigma^2, where v_c is the rotational velocity and sigma is thevelocity dispersion. if these quantities are expressed in terms of kpc,l_solar/pc^2, and km/s, then log r_e - log v^2 + log i_e + log upsilon_e + 0.8= 0, where we provide a fitting function for upsilon_e, the mass-to-light ratiowithin r_e in units of m_solar/l_solar, that depends only on v and i_e. thescatter about this surface for our heterogeneous sample of 1925 galaxies issmall (&lt; 0.1 dex) and could be as low as ~ 0.05 dex, or 10%. this small scatterhas three possible implications for how gross galactic structure is affected byinternal factors, such as stellar orbital structure, and by external factors,such as environment. these factors either 1) play no role beyond generatingsome of the observed scatter, 2) move galaxies along the surface, or 3) balanceeach other to maintain this surface as the locus of galactic structureequilibria. we cast the behavior of upsilon_e in terms of the fraction ofbaryons converted to stars, eta, and the concentration of those stars withinthe dark matter halo, xi = r_{200}/r_e. we derive eta = 1.9 x 10^{-5} (l/l^*)upsilon_* v^{-3} and xi = 1.4 v/r_e. finally, we present and discuss thedistributions of eta and xi for the full range of galaxies. for systems withinternal velocities comparable to that of the milky way (149 &lt; v &lt; 163 km/s),eta = 0.14 +- 0.05, and xi is, on average, ~ 5 times greater for spheroids thanfor disks.

1210.6031	a measurement of the intrahalo light fraction with near-infrared  background anisotropies	unresolved near-infrared background anisotropies are expected to havecontributions from the earliest galaxies during reionization and faint, dwarfgalaxies at intermediate redshifts. previous measurements were unable toconclusively pinpoint the dominant origin because they did not sample spatialscales that were sufficiently large to distinguish between these twopossibilities. here we report a measurement of the anisotropy power spectrumfrom sub-arcminute to one degree angular scales and find the clusteringamplitude to be larger than the model predictions involving the two existingexplanations. as the shot-noise level of the power spectrum is consistent withthat expected from faint galaxies, a new source population on the sky is notnecessary to explain the observations. a physical mechanism that increases theclustering amplitude, however, is needed. motivated by recent results relatedto the extended stellar light profile in dark matter halos, we consider thepossibility that the fluctuations originate from diffuse intrahalo stars of allgalaxies. we find that the measured power spectrum can be explained by anintrahalo light fraction of 0.07 to 0.2 % relative to the total luminosity indark matter halos of masses log(m/m_sun) ~ 9 to 12 at redshifts of ~ 1 to 4.

1212.1613	the baryon budget on the galaxy group/cluster boundary	we present a study of the hot gas and stellar content of 5 optically-selectedpoor galaxy clusters, including a full accounting of the contribution fromintracluster light (icl) and a combined hot gas and hydrostatic x-ray massanalysis with xmm observations. we find weighted mean stellar (including icl),gas and total baryon mass fractions within r500 of 0.026+/-0.003, 0.070+/-0.005and 0.096+/-0.006, respectively, at a corresponding weighted mean m500 of(1.08_{-0.18}^{+0.21}) x 10^14 msun. even when accounting for the intraclusterstars, 4 out of 5 clusters show evidence for a substantial baryon deficitwithin r500, with baryon fractions (f_bary) between 50+/-6 to 59+/-8 per centof the universal mean level (i.e. omega_b / omega_m); the remaining clusterhaving f_bary = 75+/-11 per cent. for the 3 clusters where we can trace the hothalo to r500 we find no evidence for a steepening of the gas density profile inthe outskirts with respect to a power law, as seen in more massive clusters. wefind that in all cases, the x-ray mass measurements are larger than thoseoriginally published on the basis of the galaxy velocity dispersion (sigma) andan assumed sigma-m500 relation, by a factor of 1.7-5.7. despite these increasedmasses, the stellar fractions (in the range 0.016-0.034, within r500) remainconsistent with the trend with mass published by gonzalez, zaritsky &amp; zabludoff(2007), from which our sample is drawn.

1302.6253	the cluster and field galaxy agn fraction at z = 1 to 1.5: evidence for  a reversal of the local anticorrelation between environment and agn fraction	the fraction of cluster galaxies that host luminous agn is an important probeof agn fueling processes, the cold ism at the centers of galaxies, and howtightly black holes and galaxies co-evolve. we present a new measurement of theagn fraction in a sample of 13 clusters of galaxies (m &gt;= 10^{14} msun) at1&lt;z&lt;1.5 selected from the spitzer/irac shallow cluster survey, as well as thefield fraction in the immediate vicinity of these clusters, and combine thesedata with measurements from the literature to quantify the relative evolutionof cluster and field agn from the present to z~3. we estimate that the clusteragn fraction at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 is f_a = 3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.4}% for agn with a rest-frame,hard x-ray luminosity greater than l_{x,h} &gt;= 10^{44} erg/s. this fraction ismeasured relative to all cluster galaxies more luminous than m*_{3.6}(z)+1,where m*_{3.6}(z) is the absolute magnitude of the break in the galaxyluminosity function at the cluster redshift in the irac 3.6um bandpass. thecluster agn fraction is 30 times greater than the 3sigma upper limit on thevalue for agn of similar luminosity at z~0.25, as well as more than an order ofmagnitude greater than the agn fraction at z~0.75. agn with l_{x,h} &gt;= 10^{43}erg/s exhibit similarly pronounced evolution with redshift. in contrast withthe local universe, where the luminous agn fraction is higher in the field thanin clusters, the x-ray and mir-selected agn fractions in the field and clustersare consistent at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5. this is evidence that the cluster agn population hasevolved more rapidly than the field population from z~1.5 to the present. thisenvironment-dependent agn evolution mimics the more rapid evolution ofstar-forming galaxies in clusters relative to the field.

1304.3127	a new approach to identifying the most powerful gravitational lensing  telescopes	the best gravitational lenses for detecting distant galaxies are those withthe largest mass concentrations and the most advantageous configurations ofthat mass along the line of sight. our new method for finding suchgravitational telescopes uses optical data to identify projected concentrationsof luminous red galaxies (lrgs). lrgs are biased tracers of the underlying massdistribution, so lines of sight with the highest total luminosity in lrgs arelikely to contain the largest total mass. we apply this selection technique tothe sloan digital sky survey and identify the 200 fields with the highest totallrg luminosities projected within a 3.5' radius over the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z&lt; 0.7. the redshift and angular distributions of lrgs in these fields trace theconcentrations of non-lrg galaxies. these fields are diverse; 22.5% contain oneknown galaxy cluster and 56.0% contain multiple known clusters previouslyidentified in the literature. thus, our results confirm that these lrgs tracemassive structures and that our selection technique identifies fields withlarge total masses. these fields contain 2-3 times higher total lrgluminosities than most known strong-lensing clusters and will be among the bestgravitational lensing fields for the purpose of detecting the highest redshiftgalaxies.

1305.5254	the stellar mass growth of brightest cluster galaxies in the irac  shallow cluster survey	the details of the stellar mass assembly of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs)remain an unresolved problem in galaxy formation. we have developed a novelapproach that allows us to construct a sample of clusters that form anevolutionary sequence, and have applied it to the spitzer irac shallow clustersurvey (iscs) to examine the evolution of bcgs in progenitors of present-dayclusters with mass of (2.5-4.5)x10^{14}msun. we follow the cluster mass growthhistory extracted from a high resolution cosmological simulation, and then usean empirical method that infers the cluster mass based on the ranking ofcluster luminosity to select high-z clusters of appropriate mass from iscs tobe progenitors of the given set of z=0 clusters. we find that, between z=1.5and 0.5, the bcgs have grown in stellar mass by a factor of 2.3, which iswell-matched by the predictions from a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model.below z=0.5 we see hints of differences in behavior between the model andobservation.

1309.3565	galaxy cluster baryon fractions revisited	we measure the baryons contained in both the stellar and hot gas componentsfor twelve galaxy clusters and groups at z~0.1 with m=1-5e14 msun. this paperimproves upon our previous work through the addition of xmm data, enablingmeasurements of the total mass and masses of each major baryonic component ---icm, intracluster stars, and stars in galaxies --- for each system. we recovera relation for the stellar mass versus halo mass consistent with our previousresult. we confirm that the partitioning of baryons between the stellar and hotgas components is a strong function of m500; the fractions of total mass instars and x-ray gas within r500 scale as m500^-0.45 and m500^0.26,respectively. we also confirm that the combination of the bcg and intraclusterstars is an increasingly important contributor to the stellar baryon budget inlower halo masses. we find a weak, but statistically significant, dependence ofthe total baryon fraction upon halo mass, scaling as m500^0.16. for m500&gt;2e14,the total baryon fractions within r500 are on average 18% (7%) below theuniversal value from the wmap7 (planck) analysis. for planck, the differencebetween the universal value and cluster baryon fractions is less than thesystematic uncertainties associated with m500. the total baryon fractionsexhibit significant scatter, particularly at m500&lt;2e14 msun where they rangefrom 60-90% (65-100%) of the universal value for wmap7 (planck). the ratio ofthe stellar-to-gas mass within r500, a measure of star formation efficiency,strongly decreases with m500. the fact that this relation remains tight at lowmass implies that the larger scatter in the total baryon fractions at thesemasses arises from either true scatter in the total baryon content orobservational scatter in m500, rather than late-time physical processes such asredistribution of gas to beyond r500.

1310.6039	the era of star formation in galaxy clusters	we analyze the star formation properties of 16 infrared-selected,spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters at $1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$ from thespitzer/irac shallow cluster survey (iscs). we present new spectroscopicconfirmation for six of these high-redshift clusters, five of which are at$z&gt;1.35$. using infrared luminosities measured with deep spitzer/mipsobservations at 24 $\mu$m, along with robust optical+irac photometric redshiftsand sed-fitted stellar masses, we present the dust-obscured star-formingfractions, star formation rates and specific star formation rates in theseclusters as functions of redshift and projected clustercentric radius. we findthat $z\sim 1.4$ represents a transition redshift for the iscs sample, withclear evidence of an unquenched era of cluster star formation at earlier times.beyond this redshift the fraction of star-forming cluster members increasesmonotonically toward the cluster centers. indeed, the specific star formationrate in the cores of these distant clusters is consistent with field values atsimilar redshifts, indicating that at $z&gt;1.4$ environment-dependent quenchinghad not yet been established in iscs clusters. combining these observationswith complementary studies showing a rapid increase in the agn fraction, astochastic star formation history, and a major merging episode at the sameepoch in this cluster sample, we suggest that the starburst activity is likelymerger-driven and that the subsequent quenching is due to feedback frommerger-fueled agn. the totality of the evidence suggests we are witnessing thefinal quenching period that brings an end to the era of star formation ingalaxy clusters and initiates the era of passive evolution.

1310.6040	the evolution of dust-obscured star formation activity in galaxy  clusters relative to the field over the last 9 billion years	we compare the star formation (sf) activity in cluster galaxies to the fieldfrom z=0.3-1.5 using $herschel$ spire 250$\mu$m imaging. we utilize 274clusters from the irac shallow cluster survey (iscs) selected as rest-framenear-infrared overdensities over the 9 square degree bootes field . thisanalysis allows us to quantify the evolution of sf in clusters over a longredshift baseline without bias against active cluster systems. using a stackinganalysis, we determine the average star formation rates (sfrs) andspecific-sfrs (ssfr=sfr/m$_{\star}$) of stellar mass-limited (m&gt;1.3x10$^{10}$m$_{\odot}$), statistical samples of cluster and field galaxies, probing boththe star forming and quiescent populations. we find a clear indication that theaverage sf in cluster galaxies is evolving more rapidly than in the field, withfield sf levels at z&gt;1.2 in the cluster cores (r&lt;0.5 mpc), in good agreementwith previous iscs studies. by quantifying the sf in cluster and field galaxiesas an exponential function of cosmic time, we determine that cluster galaxiesare evolving ~2 times faster than the field. additionally, we see enhanced sfabove the field level at z~1.4 in the cluster outskirts (r&gt;0.5 mpc). thesegeneral trends in the cluster cores and outskirts are driven by the lower massgalaxies in our sample. blue cluster galaxies have systematically lower ssfrsthan blue field galaxies, but otherwise show no strong differential evolutionwith respect to the field over our redshift range. this suggests that thecluster environment is both suppressing the star formation in blue galaxies onlong time-scales and rapidly transitioning some fraction of blue galaxies tothe quiescent galaxy population on short time-scales. we argue that our resultsare consistent with both strangulation and ram pressure stripping acting inthese clusters, with merger activity occurring in the cluster outskirts.

1401.3405	evidence for a constant imf in early-type galaxies based on their x-ray  binary populations	a number of recent studies have proposed that the stellar initial massfunction (imf) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function ofgalaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom heavy imfs. these bottomheavy imfs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars,and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars and blackholes. in this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number ofblack holes and neutron stars based on the power-law imf variation required toreproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. we thentest whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass x-raybinary populations (lmxbs) of nearby early-type galaxies. in these binaries, aneutron star or black hole accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. theirnumber is therefore expected to scale with the number of black holes andneutron stars present in a galaxy. we find that the number of lmxbs per k-bandlight is similar among the galaxies in our sample. these data thereforedemonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the imf from massive stars down tothose now dominating the k-band light, and are consistent with an invariantimf. our results are inconsistent with an imf which varies from akroupa/chabrier like imf for low mass galaxies to a steep power-law imf (withslope $x$=2.8) for high mass galaxies. we discuss how these observationsconstrain the possible forms of the imf variations and how future chandraobservations can enable sharper tests of the imf.

1405.2620	discovery of a very large structure at z=3.78	we report the discovery of a large-scale structure containing multipleprotoclusters at z=3.78 in the bo\"otes field. the spectroscopic discovery offive galaxies at z=3.783+/-0.002 lying within 1 mpc of one another led us toundertake a deep narrow- and broad-band imaging survey of the surroundingfield. within a comoving volume of 72x72x25 mpc^3, we have identified 65 lymanalpha emitter (lae) candidates at z=3.795+/-0.015, and four additional galaxiesat z_spec=3.730,3.753,3.780,3.835. the galaxy distribution within the field ishighly non-uniform, exhibiting three large (~3-5x) overdensities separated by8-14 mpc (physical) and possibly connected by filamentary structures traced bylaes. the observed number of laes in the entire field is nearly twice theaverage expected in field environments, based on estimates of the lyaluminosity function at these redshifts. we estimate that by z=0 the largestoverdensity will grow into a cluster of mass 10^15 msun; the two smalleroverdensities will grow into clusters of mass (2-6)x10^14 msun. the highestconcentration of galaxies is located at the southern end of the image,suggesting that the current imaging may not map the true extent of the largescale structure. finding three large protocluster candidates within a single0.3 deg^2 field is highly unusual; expectations from theory suggest that suchalignments should occur less than 2% of the time. searching for andcharacterizing such structures and accurately measuring their volume spacedensity can therefore place constraints on the theory of structure formation.such regions can also serve as laboratories for the study of galaxy formationin dense environments.

0705.1726	a census of baryons in galaxy clusters and groups	we determine the contribution of stars in galaxies, intracluster stars, andthe intracluster medium to the total baryon budget in nearby galaxy clustersand groups. we find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constantfor systems with m500 between 6e13 and 1e15 msun. although f_b is lower thanthe wmap value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observationalsystematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that ispredicted by simulations. the data therefore provide no compelling evidence forundetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance withcluster mass. a unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion ofthe contribution of intracluster light (icl) in the baryon budget. the increasein x-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted forby a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument thatthe behavior of both the stellar and x-ray gas components is dominated by adecrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. within justthe stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the bcgand icl decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the bcg+iclcomponent, and in particular the dominant icl component, grows less efficientlyin higher mass environments. the degree to which this behavior arises from oursample selection, which favored systems with central, giant ellipticalgalaxies, remains unclear. a more robust result is the identification of lowmass groups with large bcg+icl components, demonstrating that the creation ofintracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. within r500and r200, the bcg+icl contributes on average 40% and 33% of the total stellarlight, respectively.

0804.4798	clusters of galaxies in the first half of the universe from the irac  shallow survey	we have identified 335 galaxy cluster and group candidates, 106 of which areat z &gt; 1, using a 4.5 um selected sample of objects from a 7.25 deg^2 region inthe spitzer infrared array camera (irac) shallow survey. clusters wereidentified as 3-dimensional overdensities using a wavelet algorithm, based onphotometric redshift probability distributions derived from irac and noao deepwide-field survey data. we estimate only ~10% of the detections are spurious.to date 12 of the z &gt; 1 candidates have been confirmed spectroscopically, atredshifts from 1.06 to 1.41. velocity dispersions of ~750 km/s for two of theseargue for total cluster masses well above 10^14 m_sun, as does the massestimated from the rest frame near infrared stellar luminosity. although notselected to contain a red sequence, some evidence for red sequences is presentin the spectroscopically confirmed clusters, and brighter galaxies aresystematically redder than the mean galaxy color in clusters at all redshifts.the mean i - [3.6] color for cluster galaxies up to z ~ 1 is well matched by apassively evolving model in which stars are formed in a 0.1 gyr burst startingat redshift z_f = 3. at z &gt; 1, a wider range of formation histories is needed,but higher formation redshifts (i.e. z_f &gt; 3) are favored for most clusters.

1504.01397	idcs j1426.5+3508: the most massive galaxy cluster at $z &gt; 1.5$	we present a deep (100 ks) chandra observation of idcs j1426.5+3508, aspectroscopically confirmed, infrared-selected galaxy cluster at $z = 1.75$.this cluster is the most massive galaxy cluster currently known at $z &gt; 1.5$,based on existing sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) and gravitational lensing detections.we confirm this high mass via a variety of x-ray scaling relations, including$t_x$-m, $f_g$-m, $y_x$-m and $l_x$-m, finding a tight distribution of massesfrom these different methods, spanning m$_{500}$ = 2.3-3.3 $\times 10^{14}$m$_{\odot}$, with the low-scatter $y_x$-based mass $m_{500,y_x} =2.6^{+1.5}_{-0.5} \times 10^{14}$ m$_\odot$. idcs j1426.5+3508 is currently theonly cluster at $z &gt; 1.5$ for which x-ray, sz and gravitational lensing massestimates exist, and these are in remarkably good agreement. we find arelatively tight distribution of the gas-to-total mass ratio, employing totalmasses from all of the aforementioned indicators, with values ranging from$f_{gas,500}$ = 0.087-0.12. we do not detect metals in the intracluster medium(icm) of this system, placing a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of $z(r &lt; r_{500}) &lt; 0.18z_{\odot}$. this upper limit on the metallicity suggests that this system maystill be in the process of enriching its icm. the cluster has a dense,low-entropy core, offset by $\sim$30 kpc from the x-ray centroid, which makesit one of the few "cool core" clusters discovered at $z &gt; 1$, and the firstknown cool core cluster at $z &gt; 1.2$. the offset of this core from thelarge-scale centroid suggests that this cluster has had a relatively recent($\lesssim$500 myr) merger/interaction with another massive system.

1507.07340	the mass distribution in an assembling super galaxy group at $z=0.37$	we present a weak gravitational lensing analysis of supergroup sg1120$-$1202,consisting of four distinct x-ray-luminous groups, that will merge to form acluster comparable in mass to coma at $z=0$. these groups lie within aprojected separation of 1 to 4 mpc and within $\delta v=550$ km s$^{-1}$ andform a unique protocluster to study the matter distribution in a coalescingsystem.  using high-resolution {\em hst}/acs imaging, combined with an extensivespectroscopic and imaging data set, we study the weak gravitational distortionof background galaxy images by the matter distribution in the supergroup. wecompare the reconstructed projected density field with the distribution ofgalaxies and hot x-ray emitting gas in the system and derive halo parametersfor the individual density peaks.  we show that the projected mass distribution closely follows the locations ofthe x-ray peaks and associated brightest group galaxies. one of the groups thatlies at slightly lower redshift ($z\approx 0.35$) than the other three groups($z\approx 0.37$) is x-ray luminous, but is barely detected in thegravitational lensing signal. the other three groups show a significantdetection (up to $5 \sigma$ in mass), with velocity dispersions between$355^{+55}_{-70}$ and $530^{+45}_{-55}$ km s$^{-1}$ and masses between$0.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{14}$ and $1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}\times 10^{14} h^{-1}m_{\odot}$, consistent with independent measurements. these groups areassociated with peaks in the galaxy and gas density in a relativelystraightforward manner. since the groups show no visible signs of interaction,this supports the picture that we are catching the groups before they mergeinto a cluster.

1509.02835	stellar masses and star formation rates of lensed dusty star-forming  galaxies from the spt survey	to understand cosmic mass assembly in the universe at early epochs, weprimarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate ofdistant galaxies. in this paper, we present stellar masses and star formationrates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. thesesources were first discovered by the south pole telescope (spt) at millimeterwavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derivedfrom alma observations. we have conducted follow-up observations, obtainingmulti-wavelength imaging data, using {\it hst}, {\it spitzer}, {\it herschel}and the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex). we use the high-resolution {\ithst}/wfc3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lensin {\it spitzer}/irac data. the detections and upper limits provide importantconstraints on the spectral energy distributions (seds) for these dsfgs,yielding stellar masses, ir luminosities, and star formation rates (sfrs). thesed fits of six spt sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a rangemore than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times10^{10}m_{\sun}$. the intrinsic ir luminosities range from 4$\times10^{12}l_{\sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}l_{\sun}$. they all have prodigiousintrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $m_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.compared to the star-forming main sequence (ms), these six dsfgs have specificsfrs that all lie above the ms, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10higher than the ms. our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoingstrong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

0806.4387	the late stellar assembly of massive cluster galaxies via major merging	we present multi-wavelength observations of the brightest galaxies in fourx-ray luminous groups at z~0.37 that will merge to form a cluster comparable inmass to coma. ordered by increasing stellar mass, the four brightest groupgalaxies (bggs) present a time sequence where bgg-1, 2, and 3 are in mergingsystems and bgg-4 is a massive remnant [m(stars)=6.7x10^(11) msun]. bgg-1 and 2have bright, gravitationally bound companions and bgg-3 has two nucleiseparated by only 2.5 kpc, thus merging at z&lt;0.5 increases the bgg mass by &gt;40%(merging timescale&lt;2 gyr) and v-band luminosity by ~0.4 mag. the bggs'rest-frame (b-v) colors correspond to stellar ages of &gt;3 gyr, and their tightscatter in (b-v) color [sigma(bv)=0.032] confirms they formed the bulk of theirstars at z&gt;0.9. optical spectroscopy shows no signs of recent (&lt;1.5 gyr) orongoing star formation. only two bggs are weakly detected at 24 microns, andx-ray and optical data indicate the emission in bgg-2 is due to an agn. allfour bggs and their companions are early-type (bulge-dominated) galaxies, andthey are embedded in diffuse stellar envelopes up to ~140 kpc across. the fourbgg systems must evolve into the massive, red, early-type galaxies dominatinglocal clusters. our results show that: 1) massive galaxies in groups andclusters form via dissipationless merging; and 2) the group environment iscritical for this process.

astro-ph;0001415	measuring the diffuse optical light in abell 1651	using drift scan data, a new approach to determining surface brightnessprofiles, and techniques for detecting low surface brightness signals, we fitthe light profile of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in the rich clusterabell 1651 out to 670 h^{-1} kpc. this radius is a significant fraction of thevirial radius of the cluster (2 h^{-1} mpc; girardi et al. 1998), indicatingthat the sizes of the bcg and the cluster are comparable. we find that theprofile is consistent with a de vaucouleurs profile over the radial rangeprobed. we also find that the integrated light profile of the bcg in abell 1651contributes 36% of the total cluster light within 500 h^{-1} kpc. including allluminous components, we obtain m/l_i~160 h for the cluster, which would beoverestimated by ~20% without the bcg halo. furthermore, the relatively redcolor of the bcg at large radii suggests that recent disruption and tidalstripping of spirals and dwarf ellipticals do not contribute significantly tothe halo luminosity. the color and the form of the profile are consistent witha scenario in which the bcg forms from filamentary collapse during the epoch ofcluster formation, with relatively little evolution in the past 5 gyrs(dubinski 1998). we remove the bcg and other detected galaxies from the imageand construct a two dimensional surface brightness map of the cluster core.several knots of excess emission are found, but the total diffuse component isconstrained to contribute less than 5% of the cluster light.

astro-ph;0108152	brightest cluster galaxies and the las campanas distant cluster survey	we present our study of the evolution of brightest cluster galaxies based ondata from the las campanas distant cluster survey (gonzalez et al. 2001) andhst optical and ir imaging. we briefly discuss the technique that enabled us touse short (~ 3 min) exposures and a small (1m) telescope to efficiently surveyabout 130 sq. deg. of sky for high-z galaxy clusters. follow-up imaging is usedto construct a sample of several tens of bcgs at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 with which toexplore their evolution. in particular, we examine the luminosity and colorevolution of these galaxies. we confirm the previous results that 1) bcgs indifferent environments evolve differently (eg. burke et al 2000), 2) bcgs,particularly those in low-mass clusters, must be accreting significantly sincez ~ 1 (aragon-salamanca et al. 1998). from measurments of the colors vs.redshift, we conclude that this accretion must consist of old stellarpopulations. using hst nicmos and wfpc2 images, we find preliminary evidencefor evolution in the sizes of bcgs that is consistent with the accretion modelpresented in standard hierarchical models (aragon-salamanca et al. 1998), butpuzzling differences between nicmos and wfpc2 scale lengths precludes adefinitive conclusion.

astro-ph;0108279	cluster galaxy evolution from a new sample of galaxy clusters at 0.3 &lt; z  &lt; 0.9	(abridged) we analyze photometry and spectroscopy of a sample of 63 clustersat 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9 drawn from the las campanas distant cluster survey to empiricallyconstrain models of cluster galaxy evolution. specifically, by combining dataon our clusters with those from the literature we parametrize the redshiftdependence of 1) m*_i in the observed frame; 2) the v-i color of the e/s0 redsequence in the observed frames; and 3) the i-k' color of the e/s0 red sequencein the observed frame. using the peak surface brightness of the clusterdetection, s, as a proxy for cluster mass, we find no correlation between s andm* or the location of the red envelope in v-i. we suggest that theseobservations can be explained with a model in which luminous early typegalaxies (or more precisely, the progenitors of current day luminous early typegalaxies) form the bulk of their stellar populations at high redshift (&gt;~ 5)and in which many of these galaxies, if not all, accrete mass either in theform of evolved stellar populations or gas that causes only a short termepisode of star formation at lower redshifts (1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2). our data are toocrude to reach conclusions regarding the evolutionary state of any particularcluster or to investigate whether the morphological evolution of galaxiesmatches the simple scenario we discuss, but the statistical nature of thisstudy suggests that the observed evolutionary trends are universal in massiveclusters.

astro-ph;0110310	revisiting brightest cluster galaxy evolution with the las campanas  distant cluster survey	we investigate the influence of environment on brightest cluster galaxy (bcg)evolution using a sample of 63 clusters at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 drawn primarily fromthe las campanas distant cluster survey and follow-up v, i, and k' photometry.the luminosity evolution of the entire bcg sample is not adequately describedby a single evolutionary model. using the integrated light from the clusterdetection as a proxy for cluster lx and the suggestion by burke, collins, &amp;mann, we set lx = 2 x 10^{44} ergs/s to be the division between high and lowluminosity clusters. at high redshift (z&gt;0.6) bcgs from low-lx clusters arefainter, on average, than those from high-lx clusters and are best modeled ashaving constant luminosity with redshift. the bcgs from high-lx cluster arebest modeled as having a stellar population that formed at large redshift(z_form &gt; 5) and is passively evolving. however, for the entire bcg population,the observed v-i and i-k' colors are well described by a single evolutionarymodel in which the stellar populations have z_form &gt; 5 and subsequentlypassively evolve. we conclude that accretion is proportionally more significantfor bcgs in lower mass clusters at these redshifts (factor of 2 to 4 increasein mass since z ~ 1 for the low lx systems) and that the accreted matter is inthe form of systems with evolved stellar populations.

astro-ph;0110582	constraints on the size evolution of brightest cluster galaxies	we measure the luminosity profiles of 16 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) at$0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$ using high resolution f160w nicmos and f814w wfpc2 hst imaging.the heterogeneous sample is drawn from a variety of surveys: seven fromclusters in the einstein medium sensitivity survey, five from the las campanasdistant cluster survey and its northern hemisphere precursor, and the remainingfour from traditional optical surveys. we find that the surface brightnessprofiles of all but three of these bcgs are well described by a standard devaucouleurs ($r^{1/4}$) profile out to at least $\sim2r_{e}$ and that thebiweight-estimated nicmos effective radius of our high redshift bcgs ($r_{e} =8.3\pm 1.4$ kpc for $h_{0} = 80$ km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$, $\omega_{m} = 0.2,\omega_\lambda = 0.0$) is $\sim 2$ times smaller than that measured for a localbcg sample. if high redshift bcgs are in dynamical equilibrium and satisfy thesame scaling relations as low redshift ones, this change in size wouldcorrespond to a mass growth of a factor of 2 since $z \sim 0.5$. however, thebiweight-estimated wfpc2 effective radius of our sample is 18 $\pm $ 5.1 kpc,which is fully consistent with the local sample. while we can rule out massaccretion rates higher than a factor of 2 in our sample, the discrepancybetween our nicmos and wfpc2 results, which after various tests we describeappears to be physical, does not yet allow us to place strong constraints onaccretion rates below that level.

astro-ph;0206056	a test of photometric redshifts for x-ray selected sources	we test the effectiveness of photometric redshifts based upon galaxy spectraltemplate fitting for x-ray luminous objects, using a sample of 65 sourcesdetected by chandra in the field of the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey(cfgrs). we find that sources with quasar-dominated spectra (for which galaxyspectral templates are not appropriate) are easily identified, and thatphotometric redshifts are robust for the rest of the sources in our sample.specifically, for the 59 sources that are not quasar-dominated at opticalwavelengths, we find that the photometric redshift estimates have scattercomparable to the field galaxy population in this region. there is no evidencefor a trend of increasing dispersion with x-ray luminosity over the range l_x =10^39 - 5x10^43 erg/s, nor is there a trend with the ratio of x-ray to opticalflux, f_x/f_r. the practical implication of this work is that photometricredshifts should be robust for the majority (~90%) of the x-ray sources down tof_x ~ 10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 that have optical counterparts brighter than r ~ 24.furthermore, the same photometry can be easily used to identify the sources forwhich the photometric redshifts are likely to fail. photometric redshiftestimation can thus be utilized as an efficient tool in analyzing thestatistical properties of upcoming large chandra and xmm-newton data sets andidentifying interesting subsamples for further study.

astro-ph;0210352	on the incidence of strong gravitational lensing by clusters in the las  campanas distant cluster survey	the observed incidence of strongly lensing clusters exceeds the predictionsof a lambda-cdm model by about a factor of 10. we revisit the observationalside of this discrepancy by measuring the incidence of strong lensing in asubsample of clusters drawn from the las campanas distant cluster survey(lcdcs). among clusters with 0.5&lt;= z &lt;= 0.7, the redshift range in which wefocus our search, we find two strongly lensed systems within an effectivesearch area of 69 sq. deg. there is at least one other strongly lensed systemin the lcdcs outside of this redshift range, where we are less complete. overall redshifts, the lambda-cdm model produces one large arc every 146 sq.degrees. assuming poisson statistics, the probability of finding 3 or morestrongly lensing clusters in 69 sq. degrees is 0.012. the lensing incidencewithin the lcdcs is in agreement with that derived from an x-ray selectedsample and what has been preliminarily presented from an independent opticalcluster survey. the origin of the disagreement between theory and observations,which remains at least at the order of magnitude scale for the lambda-cdmmodel, lies either in the concordance cosmological model, in thecharacteristics of the resulting cluster potentials, or in the adopted sourcepopulation.

astro-ph;0406291	intracluster stars and the chemical enrichment of the intracluster  medium	we explore the contribution of intracluster stars (ics) to the chemicalenrichment history of the intracluster medium (icm). in contrast to scenariosin which all the metals originate in cluster galaxies and are then transportedinto the icm, intracluster stars enrich the icm in situ, thereby contributing100% of their supernovae ejecta directly into the icm. modeling the ics as anancient, single burst stellar population with a normal initial mass function,we generate icm iron abundances in the range of the observed values of severaltenths solar. large observational and theoretical uncertainties preclude usfrom concluding that the intracluster stars are the primary contributor ofmetals to the icm in general. however, for the two clusters in our sample, andone from the literature, for which all of the required observationalconstraints exist, we are able to reproduce between half and all of the icmiron. due to the ubiquity of intracluster stars in clusters and their directconnection with the icm, we conclude that all models of the chemical enrichmenthistory and energy budget of the icm should account for the impact of the ics.

astro-ph;0510221	the fundamental manifold of spheroids	we present a unifying empirical description of the structural and kinematicproperties of all spheroids embedded in dark matter halos. we find that thestellar spheroidal components of galaxy clusters, which we call clusterspheroids (csphs) and which are typically one hundred times the size of normalelliptical galaxies, lie on a "fundamental plane" as tight as that defined byellipticals (rms in effective radius of ~0.07), but that has a different slope.the slope, as measured by the coefficient of the log(sigma) term, declinessignificantly and systematically between the fundamental planes of ellipticals,brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs), and csphs.we attribute this declineprimarily to a continuous change in m_e/l_e, the mass-to-light ratio within theeffective radius r_e, with spheroid scale. the magnitude of the slope changerequires that it arises principally from differences in the relativedistributions of luminous and dark matter, rather than from stellar populationdifferences such as in age and metallicity. by expressing the m_e/l_e term as afunction of sigma in the simple derivation of the fundamental plane andrequiring the behavior of that term to mimic the observed nonlinearrelationship between log(m_e/l_e) and log(sigma), we simultaneously fit a 2-dmanifold to the measured properties of dwarf ellipticals, ellipticals, bcgs,and csphs. the combined data have an rms scatter in log(r_e) of 0.114 (0.099for the combination of es, bcgs, and csphs), which is modestly larger than eachfundamental plane has alone, but which includes the scatter introduced bymerging different studies done in different filters by different investigators.this ``fundamental manifold'' fits the structural and kinematic properties ofspheroids that span a factor of 100 in sigma and 1000 in r_e.

astro-ph;9704192	malmquist bias and the distance to the virgo cluster	this paper investigates the impact of malmquist bias on the distance to thevirgo cluster determined by the h_0 key project using m100, and consequently onthe derived value of h_0. malmquist bias is a volume-induced statistical effectwhich causes the most probable distance to be different from the raw distancemeasured. consideration of the bias in the distance to the virgo cluster raisesthis distance and lowers the calculated value of h_0. monte carlo simulationsof the cluster have been run for several possible distributions of spiralswithin the cluster and of clusters in the local universe. simulationsconsistent with known information regarding the cluster and the errors ofmeasurement result in a bias of about 6.5%-8.5%. this corresponds to anunbiased distance of 17.2-17.4 mpc and a value of h_0 in the range 80-82km/s/mpc.  the problem of determining the bias to virgo illustrates several key pointsregarding malmquist bias. essentially all conventional astronomical distancemeasurements are subject to this bias. in addition, the bias accumulates whenan attempt is made to construct "distance ladders" from measurements which areindividually biased. as will be shown in the case of virgo, the magnitude anddirection of the bias are sensitive to the spatial distribution of the parentpoputation from which the observed object is drawn - a distribution which isoften poorly known. this leads to uncertainty in the magnitude of the bias, andadds to the importance of minimizing the number of steps in "distance ladders".

astro-ph;9908075	the velocity function of galaxies	we present a galaxy circular velocity function, psi(log v), derived fromexisting luminosity functions and luminosity-velocity relations. such avelocity function is desirable for several reasons. first, it enables anobjective comparison of luminosity functions obtained in different bands andfor different galaxy morphologies, with a statistical correction for dustextinction. in addition, the velocity function simplifies comparison ofobservations with predictions from high-resolution cosmological n-bodysimulations.  we derive velocity functions from five different data sets and find roughagreement among them, but about a factor of 2 variation in amplitude. thesevelocity functions are then compared with n-body simulations of a lcdm model(corrected for baryonic infall) in order to demonstrate both the utility andcurrent limitations of this approach. the number density of dark matter halosand the slope of the velocity function near v_*, the circular velocitycorresponding to an ~l_* spiral galaxy, are found to be comparable to that ofobserved galaxies. the primary sources of uncertainty in construction ofpsi(log v) from observations and n-body simulations are discussed andexplanations are suggected to account for these discrepancies.

0810.1272	the enrichment of the intracluster medium	to determine the relative contributions of galactic and intracluster stars tothe enrichment of the intracluster medium (icm), we present x-ray surfacebrightness, temperature, and fe abundance profiles for a set of twelve galaxyclusters for which we have extensive optical photometry. assuming a standardimf and simple chemical evolution model scaled to match the present-day clusterearly-type sn ia rate, the stars in the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) plus theintracluster stars (ics) generate 31^{+11}_{-9}%, on average, of the observedicm fe within r_{500} (~ 0.6 times r_{200}, the virial radius). an alternate,two-component sn ia model (including both prompt and delayed detonations)produces a similar bcg+ics contribution of 22^{+9}_{-9}%. because the icstypically contribute 80% of the bcg+ics fe, we conclude that the ics aresignificant, yet often neglected, contributors to the icm fe within r_{500}.however, the bcg+ics fall short of producing all the fe, so metal loss fromstars in other cluster galaxies must also contribute. by combining theenrichment from intracluster and galactic stars, we can account for all theobserved fe. these models require a galactic metal loss fraction(0.84^{+0.11}_{-0.14}) that, while large, is consistent with the metal mass notretained by galactic stars. the sn ia rates, especially as a function of galaxyenvironment and redshift, remain a significant source of uncertainty in furtherconstraining the metal loss fraction. for example, increasing the sn ia rate bya factor of 1.8 -- to just within the 2 sigma uncertainty for present-daycluster early-type galaxies -- allows the combined bcg + ics + cluster galaxymodel to generate all the icm fe with a much lower galactic metal loss fraction(~ 0.35).
