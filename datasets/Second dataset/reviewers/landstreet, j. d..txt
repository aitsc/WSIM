0901.0347	magnetism of herbig ae/be stars	observations of magnetic fields of stars at the pre-main sequence phase canprovide important new insights into the complex physics of the late stages ofstar formation. this is especially true at intermediate stellar masses, wheremagnetic fields are strong and globally organised, and therefore most amenableto direct study. recent circularly-polarised spectroscopic observations ofpre-main sequence herbig ae/be stars have revealed the presence of organisedmagnetic fields in the photospheres of a small fraction of these objects. todate, 9 magnetic haebe stars have been detected, and those detections confirmedby repeated observations. the morphology and variability of their stokes vsignatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipolecomponents of kg strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofatleast years. these magnetic stars exhibit a large range of stellar mass, fromabout 2-13 solar masses, and diverse rotational properties, with vsini from afew km/s to 200 km/s. most magnetic haebe stars show approximately solarabundances; they clearly do not generally exhibit the strong and systematicpeculiarities of the magnetic main sequence a and b type stars (the ap/bpstars). the observed fractional bulk incidence of magnetic haebe stars is about7%, a value compatible with the incidence of magnetic intermediate-mass starson the main sequence. this low incidence is at odds with formation scenariosgenerally involving magnetically-mediated accretion. the similarily between themagnetic properties of the pre-main sequence and main sequenceintermediate-mass stars appears compatible with the hypothesis of a fossilorigin of magnetism in these objects.

0906.3824	atmospheric velocity fields in tepid main sequence stars	the line profiles of the stars with v sin i below a few km/s can revealdirect signatures of local velocity fields (e.g. convection) in stellaratmospheres. this effect is well established in cool main sequence stars, andhas been detected and studied in three a stars. this paper reports observationsof main sequence b, a and f stars with two goals: (1) to identify additionalstars having sufficiently low values of v sin i to search for spectral lineprofile signatures of local velocity fields, and (2) to explore how thesignatures of the local velocity fields in the atmosphere depend on stellarparameters such as effective temperature t_eff and peculiarity type.  for stars having t_eff below about 10000 k, we always detect localatmospheric velocity fields indirectly through a non-zero microturbulenceparameter, but not for hotter stars. among the a and f stars in our samplehaving the sharpest lines, direct tracers of atmospheric velocity fields arefound in six new stars. the velocity field signatures identified includeasymmetric excess line wing absorption, deeper in the blue line wing than inthe red; line profiles of strong lines that are poorly fit by computedprofiles; and strong lines that are broader than they should be for the v sin ivalues deduced from weak lines. these effects are found in both normal and amstars, but seem stronger in am stars.  these data still have not been satisfactorily explained by models ofatmospheric convection, including numerical simulations.

0907.5113	magnetism and binarity of the herbig ae star v380 ori	in this paper we report the results of high-resolution circularspectropolarimetric monitoring of the herbig ae star v380 ori, in which wediscovered a magnetic field in 2005. a careful study of the intensity spectrumreveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. by modelling the binaryspectrum we infer the effective temperature of both stars: $10500\pm 500$ k forthe primary, and $5500\pm500$ k for the secondary, and we argue that the highmetallicity ($[m/h] = 0.5$), required to fit the lines may imply that theprimary is a chemically peculiar star. we observe that the radial velocity ofthe secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the the primary does not.by fitting these variations we derive the orbital parameters of the system. wefind an orbital period of $104\pm5$ d, and a mass ratio ($m_{\rm p}/m_{\rm s}$)larger than 2.9. the intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong,broad and variable emission. a simple analysis of these lines reveals that adisk might surround the binary, and that a wind occurs in the environment ofthe system. finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the least-squaresdeconvolved (lsd) profiles of the stokes $v$ spectra of both stars, andadopting the oblique rotator model. from rotational modulation of the primary'sstokes $v$ signatures, we infer its rotation period $p=4.31276\pm0.00042$ d,and find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength$2.12\pm0.15$ kg, with a magnetic obliquity $\beta = 66\pm5^{\circ}$, and arotation axis inclination $i=32\pm5^{\circ}$. however, no magnetic field isdetected in the secondary, and if it hosts a dipolar magnetic field, itsstrength must be below about 500 g, to be consistent with our observations.

1002.4091	cp and related phenomena in the context of stellar evolution	we review the interaction in intermediate and high mass stars between theirevolution and magnetic and chemical properties. we describe the theory ofap-star `fossil' fields, before touching on the expected secular diffusiveprocesses which give rise to evolution of the field. we then present recentresults from a spectropolarimetric survey of herbig ae/be stars, showing thatmagnetic fields of the kind seen on the main-sequence already exist during thepre-main sequence phase, in agreement with fossil field theory, and that theorigin of the slow rotation of ap/bp stars also lies early in the pre-mainsequence evolution; we also present results confirming a lack of stars withfields below a few hundred gauss. we then seek which macroscopic motionscompete with atomic diffusion in determining the surface abundances of amfmstars. while turbulent transport and mass loss, in competition with atomicdiffusion, are both able to explain observed surface abundances, the interiorabundance distribution is different enough to potentially lead to a test usingasterosismology. finally we review progress on the turbulence-driving andmixing processes in stellar radiative zones.

1008.3086	no detection of large-scale magnetic fields at the surfaces of am and  hgmn stars	we investigate the magnetic dichotomy between ap/bp and other a-type stars bycarrying out a deep spectropolarimetric study of am and hgmn stars. using thenarval spectropolarimeter at the telescope bernard lyot (observatoire du pic dumidi, france), we obtained high-resolution circular polarisation spectroscopyof 12 am stars and 3 hgmn stars. using least squares deconvolution (lsd), nomagnetic field is detected in any of the 15 observed stars. uncertaintiies aslow as 0.3 g (respectively 1 g) have been reached for surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field measurements for am (respectively hgmn) stars.associated with the results obtained previously for ap/bp stars, our studyconfirms the existence of a magnetic dichotomy among a-type stars. our datademonstrate that there is at least one order of magnitude difference in fieldstrength between zeeman detected stars (ap/bp stars) and non zeeman detectedstars (am and hgmn stars). this result confirms that thespectroscopically-defined ap/bp stars are the only a-type stars harbouringdetectable large-scale surface magnetic fields.

0710.1554	weak magnetic fields in ap/bp stars: evidence for a dipole field lower  limit and a tentative interpretation of the magnetic dichotomy	we have investigated a sample of 28 well-known spectroscopically-identifiedmagnetic ap/bp stars, with weak, poorly-determined or previously undetectedmagnetic fields, with the aim of exploring the weak part of the magnetic fielddistribution of ap/bp stars. using the musicos and narval spectropolarimeterswe have obtained 282 lsd stokes v signatures of our 28 sample stars. all starswere detected, showing clearly that when observed with sufficient precision,all firmly classified ap/bp stars show detectable surface magnetic fields. tobetter characterise the surface magnetic field intensities and geometries ofthe sample, we have inferred the dipolar field intensity and the magneticobliquity. the distribution of derived dipole strengths for these starsexhibits a plateau at about 1 kg, falling off to larger and smaller fieldstrengths. remarkably, in this sample of stars selected for their presumablyweak magnetic fields, we find only 2 stars for which the derived dipolestrength is weaker than 300 g. we interpret this "magnetic threshold" as acritical value necessary for the stability of large-scale magnetic fields, anddevelop a simple quantitative model that is able to approximately reproduce theobserved threshold characteristics. this scenario leads to a naturalexplanation of the small fraction of intermediate-mass magnetic stars. it mayalso explain the near-absence of magnetic fields in more massive b and o-typestars.

0710.1780	magnetism and rotation in herbig ae/be stars	among the main sequence intermediate mass a and b stars, around 5% hostlarge-scale organized magnetic fields. most of these stars are very slowrotators compared to their non-magnetic counterparts, and show photosphericabundance anomalies. they are referred to as the ap/bp stars. one of thegreatest challenges, today is to understand the origin of their magnetic fieldand their slow rotation. the favoured hypothesis is a fossil origin of themagnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of ap/bp stars are relics of thosewhich existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. thisimplies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of thestellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. this isconsistent with the general belief that magnetic braking occurs during the pmsphase, which sheds angular momentum and slows the rotation of these stars. inthis context, we proceeded with a survey of a sample of around 50 pms herbigae/be stars, using the new spectropolarimeter espadons at the cfht, in order tostudy the magnetic field and the rotation velocity of these stars. this talkreviews the results of our survey, as well as their consequences for the originof the magnetic fields and the evolution of the rotation of intermediate massstars during the pms phase.

1109.5043	stellar magnetism through the polarized eyes of the fors1 instrument	during the last decade, the fors1 instrument of the eso very large telescopehas been used to obtain low resolution circular polarized spectra for about 500stars, with the aim of measuring their mean longitudinal magnetic fields.magnetic field estimates were obtained by different authors, using differentsoftware tools. several interesting detections were obtained at a 3 sigmalevel; some of them were eventually confirmed by follow-up investigations, someof them were not. this raises issues about the reliability of the stateduncertainties of some of the published field values. to investigate theseproblems, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure for magnetic fielddetermination, which includes self-consistent checks for field detectionreliability. we have applied our procedure to the full content of single star("fast mode") circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the fors1 archive,and explored the details and interagreement of various methods for datareduction. we have finally produced a catalogue of fors1 longitudinal fieldmeasurements which includes about 1000 entries. here we critically review thepreviously published fors1 measurements, and, based on our results, we suggestthat the incidence of the magnetic field in various classes of stars should berevised.

1112.3969	magnetic field measurements and their uncertainties: the fors1 legacy	during the last decade, the fors1 instrument of the eso vlt has beenextensively used to study stellar magnetism. a number of interestingdiscoveries of magnetic fields in several classes of stars have been announced,many of which obtained at a ~3 sigma level; some of the discoveries areconfirmed by measurements obtained with other instruments, some are not. herewe investigate the reasons for the discrepancies between the results obtainedwith fors1 and those obtained with other instruments.  using the eso fors pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure formagnetic field determination. we have applied this procedure to the fullcontent of circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the fors1 archive. wehave devised and applied a number of consistency checks to our fielddeterminations, and we have compared our results to those previously publishedin the literature.  we find that for high signal-to-noise ratio measurements, photon noise doesnot account for the full error bars. we discuss how field measurements dependon the specific algorithm adopted for data reduction, and we show that verysmall instrument flexures, negligible in most of the instrument applications,may be responsible for some spurious field detections in the null profiles.finally, we find that we are unable to reproduce some results previouslypublished in the literature. consequently, we do not confirm some importantdiscoveries of magnetic fields obtained with fors1 and reported in previouspublications.  our revised field measurements show that there is no contradiction betweenthe results obtained with the low-resolution spectropolarimeter fors1 and thoseobtained with high-resolution spectropolarimeters. fors1 is an instrumentcapable of performing reliable magnetic field measurements, provided that thevarious source of uncertainties are properly taken into account.

1202.1845	chemical abundances of magnetic and non-magnetic herbig ae/be stars	the photospheres of about 10-20% of main sequence a- and b-type stars exhibita wide range of chemical peculiarities, often associated with the presence of amagnetic field. it is not exactly known at which stage of stellar evolutionthese chemical peculiarities develop. to investigate this issue, in this paperwe study the photospheric compositions of a sample of herbig ae and be stars,which are considered to be the pre-main sequence progenitors of a and b stars.we have performed a detailed abundance analysis of 20 herbig stars (three ofwhich have confirmed magnetic fields), and one dusty young star. we have foundthat half the stars in our sample show lambda boo chemical peculiarities tovarying degrees, only one star shows weak ap/bp peculiarities, and all theremaining stars are chemically normal. the incidence of lambda boo chemicalpeculiarities we find in herbig stars is much higher than what is seen on themain sequence. we argue that a selective accretion model for lambda boo starformation is a natural explanation for the remarkably large number of lambdaboo stars in our sample. we also find that the magnetic herbig stars do notexhibit a range of chemical compositions remarkably different from the normalstars: one magnetic star displays lambda boo chemical peculiarities (hd101412), one displays weak ap/bp peculiarities (v380 ori a), and one (hd190073) is chemically normal. this is completely different from what is seen onthe main sequence, where all magnetic a and cool b stars show ap/bp chemicalpeculiarities, and this is consistent with the idea that the magnetic fieldprecedes the formation of the chemical peculiarities typical of ap and bpstars.

1202.2384	critical evaluation of magnetic field detections reported for pulsating  b-type stars in the light of espadons, narval and reanalyzed fors1/2  observations	recent spectropolarimetric studies of 7 spb and $\beta$ cep stars havesuggested that photospheric magnetic fields are more common in b-type pulsatorsthan in the general population of b stars, suggesting a significant connectionbetween magnetic and pulsational phenomena. we present an analysis of new andpreviously published spectropolarimetric observations of these stars. newstokes $v$ observations obtained with the high-resolution espadons and narvalinstruments confirm the presence of a magnetic field in one of the stars($\epsilon$ lup), but find no evidence of magnetism in 5 others. a re-analysisof the published longitudinal field measurements obtained with thelow-resolution fors1/2 spectropolarimeters finds that the measurements of allstars show more scatter from zero than can be attributed to gaussian noise,suggesting the presence of a signal and/or systematic under-estimation of errorbars. re-reduction and re-measurement of the fors1/2 spectra from the esoarchive demonstrates that small changes in reduction procedure lead tosubstantial changes in the inferred longitudinal field, and substantiallyreduces the number of field detections at the 3$\sigma$ level. furthermore, wefind that the published periods are not unique solutions to the time series ofeither the original or the revised fors1/2 data. we conclude that the reportedfield detections, proposed periods and field geometry models for $\alpha$ pyx,15 cma, 33 eri and v1449 aql are artefacts of the data analysis and reductionprocedures, and that magnetic fields at the reported strength are no morecommon in spb/$\beta$ cep stars than in the general population of b stars.

1203.5277	an analysis of the rapidly rotating bp star hd 133880	hd 133880 is a rapidly rotating bp star and host to one of the strongestmagnetic fields of any bp star. a member of the upper centaurus lupusassociation, it is a star with a well-determined age of 16 myr. twelve newspectra obtained from the feros, espadons, and harps instruments, providesufficient material from which to re-evaluate the magnetic field and obtain afirst approximation to the atmospheric abundance distributions of variouselements. using the new magnetic field measurements and optical photometrytogether with previously published data, we refine the period of hd 133880 to p= 0.877476 \pm 0.000009 days. the magnetic field structure was characterised bya colinear multipole expansion from the observed variations of the longitudinaland surface fields with rotational phase. this simple axisymmetric magneticfield model is based on a predominantly quadrupolar component that roughlydescribes the field variations. using spectrum synthesis, we derived meanabundances for o, mg, si, ti, cr, fe, nd and pr. all elements, except mg (whichhas a uniform distribution), are overabundant compared to the sun and are moreabundant in the negative than in the positive magnetic hemisphere. in contrastto most bp stars the abundance of o in hd 133880 is overabundant compared tothe solar abundance ratio. in studying the halpha and paschen lines in theoptical spectra we could not unambiguously detect information about themagnetosphere of hd 133880. however, radio emission data at both 3 and 6 cmsuggests that the magnetospheric plasma is held in rigid rotation with the starby the magnetic field and further supported against collapse by the rapidrotation. subtle differences in the shapes of the optically thick radio lightcurves at 3 and 6 cm suggest that the large-scale magnetic field is not fullyaxisymmetric at large distances from the star.

1208.4627	discovery of a magnetic field in the early b-type star sigma lupi	magnetic early b-type stars are rare. to identify them, we use the strongestindirect indicator of a magnetic field in b stars, which is periodicvariability of uv stellar wind lines occurring symmetric about the approximaterest wavelength. probable magnetic candidates are targets for follow-upspectropolarimetry to search for a magnetic field. from the uv wind linevariability the b1/b2v star sigma lupi emerged as a new magnetic candidatestar. aat spectropolarimetric measurements with sempol were obtained. thelongitudinal component of the magnetic field integrated over the visiblesurface of the star was determined with the least-squares deconvolution method.the uv line variations of sigma lupi are similar to what is known in magnetic bstars, but no periodicity could be determined. we detected a varyinglongitudinal magnetic field with amplitude of about 100 g with error bars oftypically 20 g, which supports an oblique magnetic-rotator configuration. theew variations of the uv lines, the magnetic and the optical-line variations areconsistent with the photometric period of 3.02 d, which we identify with therotation period of the star. additional observations with espadons attached tothe cfht confirmed this discovery, and allowed the determination of a precisemagnetic period. analysis revealed that sigma lupi is a he-strong star, with anenhanced n abundance and an underabundance of c, and has a chemically spottedsurface. like in other magnetic b stars the uv wind emission appears tooriginate close to the magnetic equatorial plane, with maximum emission when amagnetic pole points towards the earth. the 3.01972(43) d magnetic rotationperiod is consistent with the photometric period, with maximum lightcorresponding to maximum magnetic field.

1209.2643	partial paschen-back splitting of siii and siiii lines in magnetic cp  stars	modelling of the spectra of magnetic a and b main sequence stars is generallydone assuming that all the lines are split by the magnetic field according tothe zeeman effect. however, a number of prominent spectral lines are producedby closely spaced doublets or triplets. such lines should be treated using thetheory of the partial paschen-back (ppb) effect. depending on the strength andorientation of magnetic field, the ppb effect can result in the stokes ivprofiles of a spectral line that differ significantly from those predicted bythe zeeman effect theory. it is important to understand the size and types oferrors that are introduced into magnetic spectrum synthesis by treating suchlines with the usual zeeman splitting theory rather than using the correcttheoretical treatment of line splitting. to estimate the error introduced bythe use of the zeeman approximation, numerical simulations have been performedfor spectral lines of the element silicon, for which a number of importantlines are actually in the ppb regime, assuming an oblique rotator model, forvarious silicon abundances and vsini values. a comparative analysis of thestokes iv profiles calculated assuming the ppb and zeeman splitting has beencarried out for a number of both strong and weak siii and siiii lines. theanalysis indicates that for high precision studies of some spectral lines theppb approach should be used if the field strength at the magnetic poles isbp&gt;10kg. in the case of the siii line 5041a, the difference between the twosimulated profiles is caused by a significant contribution from a so called"ghost" line.

0712.0199	magnetism in pre-ms intermediate-mass stars and the fossil field  hypothesis	today, one of the greatest challenges concerning the ap/bp stars is tounderstand the origin of their slow rotation and their magnetic fields. thefavoured hypothesis for the latter is the fossil field, which implies that themagnetic fields subsist throughout the different evolutionary phases, and inparticular during the pre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fieldsat the pre-main sequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation ofap/bp stars. however, until recently, essentially no information was availableabout the magnetic properties of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, theso-called herbig ae/be stars. the new high-resolution spectropolarimeterespadons, installed in 2005 at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, provided thecapability necessary to perform surveys of the herbig ae/be stars in order toinvestigate their magnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted inthe detection and/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars,ranging in mass from 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this contribution i willpresent the results of our survey, as well as their implications for the originand evolution of the magnetic fields and rotation.

0712.1742	magnetic doppler imaging of ap stars	historically, the magnetic field geometries of the chemically peculiar apstars were modelled in the context of a simple dipole field. however, with theacquisition of increasingly sophisticated diagnostic data, it has become clearthat the large-scale field topologies exhibit important departures from thissimple model. recently, new high-resolution circular and linear polarisationspectroscopy has even hinted at the presence of strong, small-scale fieldstructures, which were completely unexpected based on earlier modelling. thisproject investigates the detailed structure of these strong fossil magneticfields, in particular the large-scale field geometry, as well as small scalemagnetic structures, by mapping the magnetic and chemical surface structure ofa selected sample of ap stars. these maps will be used to investigate therelationship between the local field vector and local surface chemistry,looking for the influence the field may have on the various chemical transportmechanisms (i.e., diffusion, convection and mass loss). this will lead tobetter constraints on the origin and evolution, as well as refining themagnetic field model for ap stars. mapping will be performed using highresolution and signal-to-noise ratio time-series of spectra in both circularand linear polarisation obtained using the new-generation espadons and narvalspectropolarimeters at the cfht and pic du midi observatory. with these data wewill perform tomographic inversion of doppler-broadened stokes iquv zeemanprofiles of a large variety of spectral lines using the invers10 magneticdoppler imaging code, simultaneously recovering the detailed surface maps ofthe vector magnetic field and chemical abundances.

0712.1746	characterisation of the magnetic field of the herbig be star hd 200775	after our recent discovery of four magnetic herbig stars, we have decided tostudy in detail one of them, hd 200775, to determine if its magnetic topologyis similar to that of the main sequence magnetic stars. with this aim, wemonitored this star in stokes i and v over more than two years, using the newspectropolarimeters espadons at cfht, and narval at tbl. using our data, wefind that hd 200775 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, whosesecondary seems similar, in temperature, to the primary. we determine theluminosity ratio of the system, and using the luminosity of the system found inliterature, we derive the luminosity of both stars. from our measurements ofthe radial velocities of both stars we determine the ephemeris and the orbitalparameters of the system. we have fitted 30 stokes v profiles simultaneously,using a chi2 minimisation method, with a decentered-dipole model. the best-fitmodel provides a rotation period of 4.3281 d an inclination angle of 60degrees, and a magnetic obliquity angle of 125 degrees. the polar strength ofthe magnetic dipole field is 1000 g, which is decentered by 0.05 r* from thecenter of the star. the derived magnetic field model is qualitatively identicalto those commonly observed in the ap/bp stars, which bring strong argument infavour of the fossil field hypothesis, to explain the origin of the magneticfields in the main sequence ap/bp stars. our determination of the inclinationof the rotation axis leads to a radius of the primary which is smaller thanthat derived from the hr diagram position. this can be explained by a largerintrinsic luminosity of the secondary relative to the primary, due to a largercircumstellar extinction of the secondary relative to the primary.

1311.1552	chemical peculiarities in magnetic and non-magnetic pre-main sequence a  and b stars	in a- and late b-type stars, strong magnetic fields are always associatedwith ap and bp chemical peculiarities. however, it is not clear at what pointin a star's evolution those peculiarities develop. strong magnetic fields havebeen observed in pre-main sequence a and b stars (herbig ae and be stars), andthese objects have been proposed to be the progenitors of ap and bp stars.however, the photospheric chemical abundances of these magnetic herbig starshave not been studied carefully, and furthermore the chemical abundances of'normal' non-magnetic herbig stars remain poorly characterized. to investigatethis issue, we have studied the photospheric compositions of 23 herbig stars,four of which have confirmed magnetic fields. surprisingly, we found that halfthe non-magnetic stars in our sample show lambda bootis chemical peculiaritiesto varying degrees. for the stars with detected magnetic fields, we find onechemically normal star, one star with lambda boo peculiarities, one stardisplaying weak ap/bp peculiarities, and one somewhat more evolved star withsomewhat stronger ap/bp peculiarities. these results suggests that ap/bppeculiarities are preceded by magnetic fields, and that these peculiaritiesdevelop over the pre-main sequence lives of a and b stars. the incidence oflambda boo stars we find is much higher than that seen on the main sequence. weargue that a selective accretion model for the formation of lambda boopeculiarities is a natural explanation for this remarkably large incidence.

1312.0511	discovery of secular variations in the atmospheric abundances of  magnetic ap stars	the stars of the middle main sequence have relatively quiescent outer layers,and unusual chemical abundance patterns may develop in their atmospheres. thepresence of chemical peculiarities reveal the action of such subsurfacephenomena as gravitational settling and radiatively driven levitation of traceelements, and their competition with mixing processes such as turbulentdiffusion.  we want to establish whether abundance peculiarities change as stars evolveon the main sequence, and provide observational constraints to diffusiontheory.  we have performed spectral analysis of 15 magnetic bp stars that are membersof open clusters (and thus have well-known ages), with masses between about 3and 4 m_sun. for each star, we measured the abundances of he, o, mg, si, ti,cr, fe, pr and nd.  we have discovered the systematic time evolution of trace elements throughthe main-sequence lifetime of magnetic chemically peculiar stars as theiratmospheres cool and evolve toward lower gravity. during the main sequencelifetime, we observe clear and systematic variations in the atmosphericabundances of he, ti, cr, fe, pr and nd. for all these elements, except he, theatmospheric abundances decrease with age. the abundances of fe-peak elementsconverge toward solar values, while the rare-earth elements converge towardvalues at least 100 times more abundant than in the sun. helium is alwaysunderabundant compared to the sun, evolving from about 1% up to 10% of thesolar he abundance. we have attempted to interpret the observed abundancevariations in the context of radiatively driven diffusion theory, which appearsto provide a framework to understand some, but not all, of the observedanomalous abundance levels and variations.

0804.3140	the pecular magnetic field morphology of the white dwarf wd 1953-011:  evidence for a large-scale magnetic flux tube?	we present and interpret new spectropolarimetric observations of the magneticwhite dwarf wd 1953-011. circular polarization and intensity spectra of theh$\alpha$ spectral line demonstrate the presence of two-component magneticfield in the photosphere of this star. the geometry consists of a weak, largescale component, and a strong, localized component. analyzing the rotationallymodulated low-field component, we establish a rotation period $p_{rot} = 1.4480\pm 0.0001$ days. modeling the measured magnetic observables, we find that thelow-field component can be described by the superposition of a dipole andquadrupole. according to the best-fit model, the inclination of the stellarrotation axis with respect to the line of sight is $i \approx 20^\circ$, andthe angle between the rotation axis and the dipolar axis is $\beta \approx10^\circ$. the dipole strength at the pole is about 180 kg, and the quadrupolarstrength is about 230 kg. these data suggest a fossil origin of the low-fieldcomponent. in contrast, the strong-field component exhibits a peculiar,localized structure (``magnetic spot'') that confirms the conclusions of maxtedand co-workers. the mean field modulus of the spot ($|b_{spot}| = 520 \pm 7$kg) together with its variable longitudinal magnetic field having a maximum ofabout +400 kg make it difficult to describe it naturally as a high-ordercomponent of the star's global poloidal field. instead, we suggest that theobserved strong-field region has a geometry similar to a magnetic flux tube.

astro-ph;0601623	the magnetic field and confined wind of the o star $\theta^1$~orionis~c	in this paper we confirm the presence of a globally-ordered, kg-strengthmagnetic field in the photosphere of the young o star $\theta^1$~orionis~c, andexamine the properties of its optical line profile variations. a new series ofhigh-resolution musicos stokes $v$ and $i$ spectra has been acquired whichsamples approximately uniformly the rotational cycle of $\theta^1$~orionis~c.using the least-squares deconvolution (lsd) multiline technique, we havesucceeded in detecting variable stokes $v$ zeeman signatures associated withthe lsd mean line profile. these signatures have been modeled to determine themagnetic field geometry. we have furthermore examined the profi le variationsof lines formed in both the wind and photosphere using dynamic spectra. basedon spectrum synthesis fitting of the lsd profiles, we determine that the polarstrength of the magnetic dipole component is $1150 \la b_{\rm d}\la 1800$~g andthat the magnetic obliquity is $27\degr \la \beta \la 68\degr$, assuming$i=45\pm 20\degr$. the best-fit values for $i=45\degr$ are $b_{\rm d} = 1300\pm 150 (1\sigma)$~g and $\beta = 50\degr \pm 6\degr (1\sigma)$. our dataconfirm the previous detection of a magnetic field in this star, andfurthermore demonstrate the sinusoidal variability of the longitudinal fieldand accurately determine the phases and intensities of the magnetic extrema.the analysis of ``photospheric'' and ``wind'' line profile variations supportsprevious reports of the optical spectroscopic characteristics, and providesevidence for infall of material within the magnetic equatorial plane.

astro-ph;0601624	investigation of the magnetic field characteristics of herbig ae/be  stars: discovery of the pre-main sequence progenitors of the magnetic ap/bp  stars	we are investigating the magnetic characteristics of pre-main sequence herbigae/be stars, with the aim of (1) understanding the origin and evolution ofmagnetism in intermediate-mass stars, and (2) exploring the influence ofmagnetic fields on accretion, rotation and mass-loss at the early stages ofevolution of a, b and o stars. we have begun by conducting 2 large surveys ofherbig ae/be stars, searching for direct evidence of photospheric magneticfields via the longitudinal zeeman effect. from observations obtained usingfors1 at the eso-vlt and espadons at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, wereport the confirmed detection of magnetic fields in 4 pre-main sequence a- andb-type stars, and the apparent (but as yet unconfirmed) detection of fields in2 other such stars. we do not confirm the detection of magnetic fields inseveral stars reported by other authors to be magnetic: hd 139614, hd 144432 orhd 31649. one of the most evolved stars in the detected sample, hd 72106a,shows clear evidence of strong photospheric chemical peculiarity, whereas manyof the other (less evolved) stars do not. the magnetic fields that we detectappear to have surface intensities of order 1 kg, seem to be structured onglobal scales, and appear in about 10% of the stars studied. based on theseproperties, these magnetic stars appear to be pre-main sequence progenitors ofthe magnetic ap/bp stars.

astro-ph;0610499	the magnetic field of the pre-main sequence herbig ae star hd 190073	the general context of this paper is the study of magnetic fields in thepre-main sequence intermediate mass herbig ae/be stars. magnetic fields arelikely to play an important role in pre-main sequence evolution at thesemasses, in particular in controlling the gains and losses of stellar angularmomentum. the particular aim of this paper is to announce the detection of astructured magnetic field in the herbig ae star hd 190073, and to discussvarious scenarii for the geometry of the star, its environment and its magneticfield. we have used the espadons spectropolarimeter at cfht in 2005 and 2006 toobtain high-resolution and signal-to-noise circular polarization spectra whichdemonstrate unambiguously the presence of a magnetic field in the photosphereof this star. nine circular polarization spectra were obtained, each oneshowing a clear zeeman signature. this signature is suggestive of a magneticfield structured on large scales. the signature, which corresponds to alongitudinal magnetic field of 74+- 10 g, does not vary detectably on aone-year timeframe, indicating either an azimuthally symmetric field, a zeroinclination angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight, or a verylong rotation period. the optical spectrum of hd 190073 exhibits a large numberof emission lines. we discuss the formation of these emission lines in theframework of a model involving a turbulent heated region at the base of thestellar wind, possibly powered by magnetic accretion. this magnetic detectionbrings an important element for our understanding of stellar magnetism atintermediate masses.

astro-ph;0612284	rotation and chemical abundances of ap/bp stars in the open cluster ngc  6475	the connection between age, rotation and chemical abundance of magnetic apstars is poorly understood. using open clusters, we are able to study samplesof stars that are both co-eval and co-environmental. by determining rotationand chemical abundance for ap star members of clusters with various ages, thevariations of these properties as a function of age and environment can bederived. all four probable ap star members of the open cluster ngc 6475, aswell as one normal late b star, were studied using detailed spectrum synthesisof high resolution uves-pop spectra. probable cluster membership was confirmedfor all five stars, however chemical abundance anomalies only appear to bepresent in spectra of three. projected rotational velocity and chemicalabundances for 21 elements ranging from c to eu are presented for the 5 stars.in the three peculiar stars we find overabundances of si, cr, mn, fe and rareearths such as nd, characteristic of ap stars. the set of chemically peculiarstars show fairly homogeneous abundance tables, however notable differencesexist for a few elements. there also exist appreciable differences in the v sini and main sequence evolutionary stage of the chemically peculiar stars. thismay hint at the underlying processes giving rise to the observed abundanceanomalies. with this first detailed study of chemical abundances of a completesample of magnetic ap/bp stars in an open cluster, we have initiated anexploration of the environmental and evolutionary influence on chemicalpeculiarity.

astro-ph;0612761	line profile variations in rapidly oscillating ap stars: resolution of  the enigma	we have carried out the first survey of the pulsational line profilevariability in rapidly oscillating ap (roap) stars. we analysed highsignal-to-noise time-series observations of ten sharp-lined roap stars obtainedwith the high-resolution spectrographs attached to the vlt and cfht telescopes.we investigated in detail the variations of pr iii, nd ii, nd iii and tb iiilines and discovered a prominent change of the profile variability pattern withheight in the atmospheres of all studied roap stars. in every investigated starprofile variability of at least one rare-earth ion is characterized by unusualblue-to-red moving features - a behaviour inexplicable in the framework of thestandard oblique pulsator model of slowly rotating roap stars. using analysisof the line profile moments and spectrum synthesis calculations, we demonstratethat unusual oscillations in spectral lines of roap stars arise from thepulsational modulation of line widths. this variation occurs approximately inquadrature with the radial velocity changes, and its amplitude rapidlyincreases with height in stellar atmosphere. we propose that the line widthmodulation is a consequence of the periodic expansion and compression ofturbulent layers in the upper atmospheres of roap stars. thus, the line profilechanges observed in slowly rotating magnetic pulsators should be interpreted asa superposition of two types of variability: the usual time-dependent velocityfield due to an oblique low-order pulsation mode and an additional line widthmodulation, synchronized with the changes of stellar radius. our explanation ofthe line profile variations of roap stars solves the long-standingobservational puzzle and opens new possibilities for constraining geometric andphysical properties of the stellar magnetoacoustic pulsations.

astro-ph;0701387	a search for strong, ordered magnetic fields in herbig ae/be stars	the origin of magnetic fields in intermediate-mass and high-mass stars isfundamentally a mystery. clues toward solving this basic astrophysical problemcan likely be found at the pre-main sequence (pms) evolutionary stage. withthis work, we perform the largest and most sensitive search for magnetic fieldsin pre-main sequence herbig ae/be (haebe) stars. sixty-eight observations of 50haebe stars have been obtained in circularly polarised light using the fors1spectropolarimeter at the eso vlt. an analysis of both balmer and metalliclines reveals the possible presence of weak longitudinal magnetic fields inphotospheric lines of two haebe stars, hd 101412 and bf ori. the intensity ofthe longitudinal fields detected in hd 101412 and bf ori suggest that theycorrespond to globally-ordered magnetic fields with surface intensities oforder 1 kg. monte carlo simulations of the longitudinal field measurements ofthe undetected stars allow us to place an upper limits of about 300 g on thegeneral presence of aligned magnetic dipole magnetic fields, and of about 500 gon perpendicular dipole fields. we find that the observed bulk incidence ofmagnetic haebe stars in our sample is 8-12%, in good agreement with that ofmagnetic main sequence stars of similar masses. we also find that the rmslongitudinal field intensity of magnetically-detected haebe stars is similar tothat of ap stars and consistent with magnetic flux conservation during stellarevolution. these results are all in agreement with the hypothesis that themagnetic fields of main sequence ap/bp stars are fossils, which already existwithin the stars at the pre-main sequence stage. finally, we explore theability of our new magnetic data to constrain magnetospheric accretion inherbig ae/be stars.

0809.2039	magnetic fields and chemical peculiarities of the very young  intermediate-mass binary system hd 72106	the recently discovered magnetic herbig ae and be stars may providequalitatively new information about the formation and evolution of magnetic apand bp stars. we have performed a detailed investigation of one particularlyinteresting binary system with a herbig ae secondary and a late b-type primarypossessing a strong, globally ordered magnetic field. twenty high-resolutionstokes v spectra of the system were obtained with the espadons instrumentmounted on the cfht. in these observations we see clear evidence for a magneticfield in the primary, but no evidence for a magnetic field in the secondary. adetailed abundance analysis was performed for both stars, revealing strongchemical peculiarities in the primary and normal chemical abundances in thesecondary. the primary is strongly overabundant in si, cr, and other iron-peakelements, as well as nd, and underabundant in he. the primary therefore appearsto be a very young bp star. in this context, line profile variations of theprimary suggest non-uniform lateral distributions of surface abundances.interpreting the 0.63995 +/- 0.00009 day variation period of the stokes i and vprofiles as the rotational period of the star, we have modeled the magneticfield geometry and the surface abundance distributions of si, ti, cr and feusing magnetic doppler imaging. we derive a dipolar geometry of the surfacemagnetic field, with a polar strength of 1230 g and an obliquity of 57 degrees.the distributions ti, cr and fe are all qualitatively similar, with anelongated patch of enhanced abundance situated near the positive magnetic pole.the si distribution is somewhat different, and its relationship to the magneticfield geometry less clear.

astro-ph;9805191	spectrum synthesis of sharp-lined a and b stars	i have carried out spectrum synthesis of r = 120,000 spectra of several a andb stars having v sin i less than about 6 km/s. the following conclusionsemerge: (1) as t_e descends from 12,000 to 8,000 k, microturbulent velocity xideduced from abundance analysis rises steadily from 0 to about 5 km/s. (2)stars with xi &gt;= 1 km/s show direct evidence in their line profiles of thepresence of macroscopic gas motions in the form of line asymmetry (bisectorcurvature) which grows with increasing xi. (3) above t_e ~ 9000 k, both weakand strong spectral lines can be modelled with reasonable accuracy byconventional lte spectrum synthesis with a single assumed model atmosphere,abundance table, v sin i, and an appropriate (constant) value of xi. (4) incontrast, at t_e ~ 8,000 k the weak spectral lines are much narrower than thestrong lines. if the synthesis model is constrained in v sin i and xi by theweak lines, no satisfactory model can be found for the strong spectral lines.consequently, chemical abundances for such stars based only on strong lines maybe significantly in error.

0706.0330	searching for links between magnetic fields and stellar evolution. ii.  the evolution of magnetic fields as revealed by observations of ap stars in  open clusters and associations	the evolution of magnetic fields in ap stars during the main sequence phaseis presently mostly unconstrained by observation because of the difficulty ofassigning accurate ages to known field ap stars.  we are carrying out a large survey of magnetic fields in cluster ap starswith the goal of obtaining a sample of these stars with well-determined ages.in this paper we analyse the information available from the survey as itcurrently stands.  we select from the available observational sample the stars that are probably(1) cluster or association members and (2) magnetic ap stars. for the stars inthis subsample we determine the fundamental parameters t_eff, log(l/l_o), andm/m_o. with these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age andfractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). for thispurpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for ap stars.  magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of ap stars from the zams to thetams. statistically for the stars with m &gt; 3 m_o the fields decline withadvancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together withincreased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a timescale of about 3 10^7 yr. in contrast, lower mass stars show no compellingevidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.  study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtainingconstraints on evolution of ap stars through the main sequence. enlarging thesample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise rms fields,will help to clarify the results obtained so far. further field observationsare in progress.
