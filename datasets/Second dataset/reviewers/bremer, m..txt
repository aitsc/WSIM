0812.4211	towards millimeter vlbi	we discuss the present performance and the future perspectives of vlbi in the3 mm to 0.85 mm observing bands (so called mm-vlbi). the availability of newtelescopes and the recent technical development towards larger observingbandwidth and higher data-rates now allow to image with 3mm-vlbi hundreds ofsources with high dynamic range. as an example we show new images of the jetsof cygnus a. at 1.3 mm, pilot vlbi studies have proven detectability of thebrightest agn, and the existence of ultra-compact regions therein. in the nextfew years global vlbi imaging will be established also at 1.3 mm and 0.85 mmwavelength. with an angular resolution in the 10-20 micro-arcsecond range,future 1.3 mm- and 0.8 mm vlbi will be an extraordinarily powerful astronomicalobserving method, allowing to image the enigmatic `central engines' and thefoot-points of agn-jets in greater detail than ever possible before. asufficiently large number of telescopes is a prerequisite for global aperturesynthesis imaging. therefore a strong effort is needed to make more telescopesavailable for vlbi at short millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. in thiscontext, the further vlbi upgrade of both iram telescopes and the outfit of theapex telescope in chile, in preparation for later mm-/sub-mm vlbi with alma, isof high scientific importance. with a sufficiently large mm-vlbi network, themicro-arcsecond scale imaging of the post-newtonian emission zone around theevent horizon/ergosphere of nearby super-massive black holes (such as e.g. sgra*, m87, ...) should become possible within the next few years.

0904.1797	multi-wavelength observations of afterglow of grb 080319b and the  modeling constraints	we present observations of the afterglow of grb 080319b at optical, mm andradio frequencies from a few hours to 67 days after the burst. presentobservations along with other published multi-wavelength data have been used tostudy the light-curves and spectral energy distributions of the burstafterglow. the nature of this brightest cosmic explosion has been exploredbased on the observed properties and it's comparison with the afterglow models.our results show that the observed features of the afterglow fits equally goodwith the inter stellar matter and the stellar wind density profiles of thecircum-burst medium. in case of both density profiles, location of the maximumsynchrotron frequency $\nu_m$ is below optical and the value of cooling breakfrequency $\nu_c$ is below $x-$rays, $\sim 10^{4}$s after the burst. also, thederived value of the lorentz factor at the time of naked eye brightness is$\sim 300$ with the corresponding blast wave size of $\sim 10^{18}$ cm. thenumerical fit to the multi-wavelength afterglow data constraints the values ofphysical parameters and the emission mechanism of the burst.

1003.3205	the first iram/pdbi polarimetric millimeter survey of active galactic  nuclei. i. global properties of the sample	we have studied the linear polarization of 86 active galactic nuclei (agn) inthe observed frequency range 80-267 ghz (3.7-1.1mm in wavelength),corresponding to rest-frame frequencies 82-738 ghz, with the iram plateau debure interferometer (pdbi). the large number of measurements, 441, makes ouranalysis the largest polarimetric agn survey in this frequency range to date.we extracted polarization parameters via earth rotation polarimetry withunprecedented median precisions of ~0.1% in polarization fractions and ~1.2degrees in polarization angles. for 73 of 86 sources we detect polarization atleast once. the degrees of polarization are as high as ~19%, with the medianover all sources being ~4%. source fluxes and polarizations are typicallyhighly variable, with fractional variabilities up to ~60%. we find that bllacsources have on average the highest level of polarization. there appears to beno correlation between degree of polarization and redshift, indicating thatthere has been no substantial change of polarization properties since z~2.4.our polarization and spectral index distributions are in good agreement withresults found from various samples observed at cm/radio wavelengths; thus ourfrequency range is likely tracing the signature of synchrotron radiationwithout noticeable contributions from other emission mechanisms. the"millimeter-break" located at frequencies &gt;1 thz appears to be not detectablein the frequency range covered by our survey.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1009.4361	grb 090313 and the origin of optical peaks in grb light curves:  implications for lorentz factors and radio flares	we use a sample of 19 gamma ray bursts (grbs) that exhibit single-peakedoptical light curves to test the standard fireball model by investigating therelationship between the time of the onset of the afterglow and the temporalrising index. our sample includes grbs and x-ray flashes for which we derive awide range of initial lorentz factors ($40 &lt; \gamma &lt; 450$). using plausiblemodel parameters the typical frequency of the forward shock is expected to lieclose to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we usethe optical data to constrain $\epsilon_e$ and show that values derived fromthe early time light curve properties are consistent with published typicalvalues derived from other afterglow studies. we produce expected radio lightcurves by predicting the temporal evolution of the expected radio emission fromforward and reverse shock components, including synchrotron self-absorptioneffects at early time. although a number of the grbs in this sample do not havepublished radio measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodin the case of {\it swift} grb 090313, for which millimetric and centrimetricobservations were available, and conclude that future detections ofreverse-shock radio flares with new radio facilities such as the evla and almawill test the low frequency model and provide constraints on magnetic models.

1208.3375	classifying radio emitters from the sloan digital sky survey:  spectroscopy and diagnostics	a cross-correlation of the sdss dr7 with the first radio survey makes itpossible to conduct a joined multiwavelength statistical study of radio-opticalgalaxy properties on a very large number of sources. our goal is to improve thestudy of the combined radio-optical data by investigating if there is acorrelation between the radio luminosity at 20 cm over the luminosity of theoptical h\alpha line (l[20 cm]/l[h\alpha]) and line excitation ratios, wherethe latter provide the spectroscopic classification in seyferts, low-ionizationnuclear emission-line regions (liners) and star-forming galaxies. we found thatthe percentage of detected agns (seyferts and liners) or composites is muchhigher in the optical-radio sample than in the optical sample alone. there is aprogressive shift of the sources towards the agn region of the diagram withincreasing l[20 cm]/l[h\alpha], with an indication for a different behavior forliners and seyferts. the classification appears to slightly depend on theredshift. a comparison with photoionization and shock models shows that thelarge fraction of liners identified in our study have emission lines that maybe explained by shocks. the [nii]/h\alpha vs. equivalent width of the h\alphaline (whan) diagram confirms the liner classification for most of those thathave been identified with the traditional diagnostic diagrams. the correlationbetween l[20 cm]/l[h\alpha] and optical emission line ratios suggests thenuclear origin of the emission from the most powerful radio-galaxies.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1305.3273	are narrow line seyfert 1s a special class of active galactic nuclei?	no. due to their apparently extreme optical to x-ray properties, narrow lineseyfert 1s (nlsy1s) have been considered a special class of active galacticnuclei (agn). here, we summarize observational results from different groups toconclude that none of the characteristics that are typically used to define thenlsy1s as a distinct group - from the, nowadays called, broad line seyfert 1s(blsy1s) - is unique, nor ubiquitous of these particular sources, but shared bythe whole type 1 agn. historically, the nlsy1s have been distinguished from theblsy1s by the narrow width of the broad hbeta emission line. the upper limit onthe full width at half maximum of this line is 2000 km/s for nlsy1s, while inblsy1s it can be of several thousands of km/s. however, this border has beenarbitrarily set and does not correspond to the change of any physical property.all observed parameters in type 1 agn cover continues ranges of values, whichdoes not allow to infer the existence of two different kind of populations withfwhm(hbeta,broad) = 2000 km/s as dividing point. we argue that the usage ofthis velocity limit to define samples of nlsy1s galaxies - as it is usuallydone in comparative studies -, together with the well known observationalbiases, naturally favors the selection of sources with low black hole massesand high eddington ratios that are hosted by blue spiral galaxies. thereforeselection biases might be responsible for the reported differences betweennlsy1 and blsy1 sources.

1311.2743	the galactic center as a paradigm for low luminosity nuclei? the k-band  identification of the dso/g2 source from vlt and keck data	the super-massive 4 million solar mass black hole (smbh) sgra* shows flareemission from the millimeter to the x-ray domain. the nucleus of the milky wayhas properties (stellar cluster, young stars, molecular gas and an accretingsmbh) that resemble those of currently higher luminous low luminosity activegalactic nuclei. a detailed analysis of the infrared light curves shows thatthe flares are probably generated in a single-state process forming a power-lawdistribution of the flux density. near-infrared polarimetry shows signatures ofstrong gravity that are statistically significant against randomly polarizedred noise. details of the emission mechanism are discussed in asynchrotron/self-compton model. sgra* also allows to study the interaction ofthe smbh with the immediate interstellar and gaseous environment of the centralstellar cluster. through infrared imaging of the central few arcseconds it ispossible to study both inflow and outflow phenomena linked to the sgra* blackhole. in this context we also discuss the newly found dusty object thatapproaches sgra* and present a comparison between recent keck and vlt k-banddata that clearly supports its detection as a about 19m k'-band continuumsource.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

(2011) suggests that the central source is leaking ly-alphaphotons preferentially in the plane of the sky, which undergo scattering in hiclouds at large galactocentric radius. the ly-alpha morphology around thesubmillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow, and the averagely-alpha line profiles of the two `lobes' are dominated by a red peak, expectedfor a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient thatis outflowing relative to the line center. taken together, these observationsprovide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy (or galaxies) isresponsible for a large fraction of the extended ly-alpha emission andmorphology. less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalacticmedium being traced by ly-alpha: is it mainly pristine material accreting intothe halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium (ism),now being blown back as it encounters an outflow, or does it mainly comprisegas that has been swept-up within the ism and expelled from the galaxy?

astro-ph;0006201	the bright gamma-ray burst 991208 - tight constraints on afterglow  models from observations of the early-time radio evolution	the millimeter wavelength emission from grb 991208 is the second brightestever detected, yielding a unique data set. we present here well-sampled spectraand light curves over more than two decades in frequency for a two-week period.this data set has allowed us for the first time to trace the evolution of thecharacteristic synchrotron self-absorption frequency nu_a and peak frequencynu_m, and the peak flux density f_m: we obtain nu_a \propto t^{-0.15 +- 0.12},nu_m \propto t^{-1.7 +- 0.4}, and $_m \propto t^{-0.47 +- 0.11}. from the radiodata we find that models of homogeneous or wind-generated ambient media with aspherically symmetric outflow can be ruled out. a model in which therelativistic outflow is collimated (a jet) can account for the observedevolution of the synchrotron parameters, the rapid decay at opticalwavelengths, and the observed radio to optical spectral flux distributions thatwe present here, provided that the jet transition has not been fully completedin the first two weeks after the event. these observations provide additionalevidence that rapidly decaying optical/x-ray afterglows are due to jets andthat such transitions either develop very slowly or perhaps never reach thepredicted asymptotic decay f(t) \propto t^{-p}.

astro-ph;0102177	the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow of grb 991208 and its host  galaxy	observations of the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow (oa) of grb991208 started 2.1 d after the event. the flux decay constant of the oa in ther-band is -2.30 +/- 0.07 up to 5 d, which is very likely due to the jet effect,and after that it is followed by a much steeper decay with constant -3.2 +/-0.2, the fastest one ever seen in a grb oa. a negative detection in severalall-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previousadditional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the grb (as expected fromthe jet effect). the existence of a second break might indicate a steepening inthe electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. once the afterglowemission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying sn is found, but thelight curve is not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echoexplanation. our determination of z = 0.706 indicates that grb 991208 is at 3.7gpc, implying an isotropic energy release of 1.15 x 10e53 erg which may berelaxed by beaming by a factor &gt; 100. precise astrometry indicates that the grbcoincides within 0.2" with the host galaxy, thus given support to a massivestar origin. the absolute magnitude is m_b = -18.2, well below the knee of thegalaxy luminosity function and we derive a star-forming rate of 11.5 +/- 7.1mo/yr. the quasi-simultaneous broad-band photometric spectral energydistribution of the afterglow is determined 3.5 day after the burst (dec 12.0)implying a cooling frequency below the optical band, i.e. supporting a jetmodel with p = -2.30 as the index of the power-law electron distribution.

astro-ph;0511746	weak lensing mass reconstructions of the eso distant cluster survey	we present weak lensing mass reconstructions for the 20 high-redshiftclusters i n the eso distant cluster survey. the weak lensing analysis wasperformed on deep, 3-color optical images taken with vlt/fors2, using acomposite galaxy catalog with separate shape estimators measured in eachpassband. we find that the ediscs sample is composed primarily of clusters thatare less massive than t hose in current x-ray selected samples at similarredshifts, but that all of the fields are likely to contain massive clustersrather than superpositions of low mass groups. we find that 7 of the 20 fieldshave additional massive structures which are not associated with the clustersand which can affect the weak lensing mass determination. we compare the massmeasurements of the remaining 13 clusters with luminosity measurements fromcluster galaxies selected using photometric redshifts and find evidence of adependence of the cluster mass-to-light ratio with redshift. finally wedetermine the noise level in the shear measurements for the fields as afunction of exposure time and seeing and demonstrate that future ground-basedsurveys which plan to perform deep optical imaging for use in weak lensingmeasurements must achieve point-spread functions smaller than a median of 0.6"fwhm.

astro-ph;0603282	the faint afterglow and host galaxy of the short-hard grb 060121	we present optical and x-ray observations of the afterglow and host galaxy ofthe short-hard grb 060121. the faint r-band afterglow is seen to decline ast^(-0.66) while the x-ray falls as t^-1.18, indicating the presence of thecooling break between the two frequencies. however, the r-band afterglow isvery faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the x-ray afterglow tothe optical regime (specifically, beta_ox ~ 0.2), while the k-band isconsistent with this extrapolation (beta_kx ~ 0.6), demonstrating suppressionof the optical flux. late time {\it hst} observations place stringent limits onthe afterglow r-band flux implying a break in the r-band lightcurve. they alsoshow that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy which mostlikely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous opticallyidentified short-duration bursts. several neighboring galaxies also have veryred colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. we considerpossible explanations for the faintness and color of the burst. our preferredmodel is that the burst occurred at moderately high redshift and wassignificantly obscured; however, it is also possible that the burst lies at z &gt;4.5 in which case the faintness of the r-band afterglow could be attributed tothe lyman-break. we discuss the implications that either scenario would havefor the nature of the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;9811167	b2045+265: a new four-image gravitational lens from class	we have discovered a new gravitational lens in the cosmic lens all-sky survey(class). b2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9arcsec. a fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and itspositional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy stronglysuggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. this implies that theb2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed byanother flat-spectrum radio source. infrared images detect the lensed images ofthe background source and the lensing galaxy. the lensed images have relativepositions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radiowavelengths. spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and asource redshift of z_s=1.28. the image splitting and system redshifts implythat the projected mass inside the einstein radius of the lensing galaxy ism_e=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun. an estimate of the light emitted inside theeinstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame b band of(m/l_b)_e = 20 h (m/l_b)_sun. both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higherthan what is seen in nearby sa galaxies. in fact, the implied rotation velocityfor the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearbyspirals. the large projected mass inside the einstein ring radius may be theresult of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from acompact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentificationof the source redshift. a simple model of the gravitational potential of thelens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required tosatisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. with furtherobservations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of h_0.

0810.4333	simultaneous polarization monitoring of supernovae sn2008d/xt080109 and  sn2007uy: isolating geometry from dust	the possible existence of a continuum encompassing the diversity of explosivestellar deaths,ranging from ordinary sne to relativistic hypernovae associatedwith long duration grbs, is under intense debate. in this context, sn2008dassociated with xt080109 could represent a paradigmatic case, since it mightexemplify a potential borderline event. the main aim is to infer geometricinformation of sn2008d through the evolution of its linear opticalpolarization. we also report the polarization evolution of sn2007uy, anddiscuss the properties of the host ism towards the xt. the final goal is tocompare the polarization properties, and hence the geometries of both sne,which shone contemporaneously in ngc2770. this fortunate coincidence brought usthe opportunity to observe both sne simultaneously, and most importantly, withidentical instrumental setups. the observations span 74.9 days, starting 3.6days after the xt and are distributed in 11 visits. in addition we performedobservations in the mm range in order to identify the dominant polarization. wereport positive linear polarization detections at several epochs for sn2008d ata level of ~1% and at ~1.5% for sn2007uy. sn2007uy shows constant polarization,which could be described by the host interstellar polarization plus a constanteccentricity expansion on the sky plane. a statistical analysis of thedistribution of the sn2008d stokes parametres suggests that it could show anintrinsic variable polarization component. assuming the sn2007uy polarizationis constant, we find that the evolution of the intrinsic sn2008d polarizationcould be explained by an aspherical axisymmetric expansion with variableeccentricity. we come to the same result even if we make no assumption onsn2007uy, although at a lower significance level. we suggest that at least theprojected, if not the intrinsic, geometries of both sne could differ.
