0901.2458	formation of massive galaxies at high redshift: cold streams, clumpy  disks and compact spheroids	we present a simple theoretical framework for massive galaxies at highredshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report onthe first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with ouranalysis. the evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpycold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. intense, relatively smoothstreams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. instability with highturbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, isself-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. the clumpsmigrate into a bulge in ~10 dynamical times, or ~0.5gyr. the cosmologicalstreams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to severalgigayears in a steady state, with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and darkmatter within the disk radius. the clumps form stars in dense subclumpsfollowing the overall accretion rate, ~100 msun/yr, and each clump convertsinto stars in ~0.5 gyr. while the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compactbulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep theouter disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentumtransport. passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are moreclumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up diskturbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and starformation. we predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z~3, involving giant-clumpstar-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed starformation. after z~1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellardisks and bulges. most of the high-z massive disks are likely to end up astoday's early-type galaxies.

0903.2557	klein-nishina effects on optically thin synchrotron and synchrotron  self-compton spectrum	we present analytic approximations to the optically thin synchrotron andsynchrotron self-compton (ssc) spectra when klein-nishina (kn) effects areimportant and pair production and external radiation fields can be neglected.this theory is useful for analytical treatment of radiation from astrophysicalsources, such as gamma-ray bursts (grbs), active galactic nuclei and pulsarwind nebula, where kn effects may be important. we consider a source with acontinuous injection of relativistic electrons with a power-law energydistribution above some typical injection energy. we find that thesynchrotron-ssc spectra can be described by a broken power-law, and provideanalytic estimates for the break frequencies and power-law indices. in general,we show that the dependence of the kn cross-section on the energy of theupscattering electron results in a hardening of the energy distribution of fastcooling electrons and therefore in a hardening of the observed synchrotronspectrum. as a result the synchrotron spectrum of fast cooling electrons, belowthe typical injection energy, can be as hard as $f_\nu \propto \nu^0$, insteadof the classical $\nu^{-1/2}$ when kn effects are neglected. the synchrotronenergy output can be dominated by electrons with energy above the typicalinjection energy. we solve self-consistently for the cooling frequency and findthat the transition between synchrotron and ssc cooling can result in adiscontinuous variations of the cooling frequency and the synchrotron and sscspectra. we demonstrate the application of our results to theory by applyingthem to prompt and afterglow emission models of grbs.

0906.3893	the creation of haumea's collisional family	recently, the first collisional family was discovered in the kuiper belt. theparent body of this family, haumea, is one of the largest objects in the kuiperbelt and is orbited by two satellites. it has been proposed that the haumeafamily was created from dispersed fragments that resulted from a giant impact.this proposed origin of the haumea family is however in conflict with theobserved velocity dispersion between the family members (\sim 140 m/s) which issignificantly less than the escape velocity from haumea's surface (\sim 900m/s). in this paper we propose a different formation scenario for haumea'scollisional family. in our scenario the family members are ejected while inorbit around haumea. this scenario, therefore, gives naturally rise to a lowervelocity dispersion among the family members than expected from direct ejectionfrom haumea's surface. in our scenario haumea's giant impact forms a singlemoon that tidally evolves outward until it suffers a destructive collision fromwhich the family is created. we show that this formation scenario yields avelocity dispersion of \sim 190m/s among the family members which is in goodagreement with the observations. the probability for haumea's initial giantimpact in todays kuiper belt is less than 10^{-3}. in our scenario, however,haumea's giant impact can occur before the excitation of the kuiper belt andthe ejection of the family members afterwards. this has the advantage that onecan preserve the dynamical coherence of the family and explain haumea'soriginal giant impact, which is several orders of magnitude more likely to haveoccurred in the primordial dynamically cold kuiper belt compared to thedynamically excited kuiper belt today. abridged

0911.1136	hyper velocity stars and the restricted parabolic 3-body problem	motivated by detections of hypervelocity stars that may originate from thegalactic center, we revist the problem of a binary disruption by a passage neara much more massive point mass. the six order of magnitude mass ratio betweenthe galactic center black hole and the binary stars allows us to formulate theproblem in the restricted parabolic three-body approximation. in thisframework, results can be simply rescaled in terms of binary masses, itsinitial separation and binary-to-black hole mass ratio. consequently, anadvantage over the full three-body calculation is that a much smaller set ofsimulations is needed to explore the relevant parameter space. contrary toprevious claims, we show that, upon binary disruption, the lighter star doesnot remain preferentially bound to the black hole. in fact, it is ejectedexactly in 50% of the cases. nonetheless, lighter objects have higher ejectionvelocities, since the energy distribution is independent of mass. focusing onthe planar case, we provide the probability distributions for disruption ofcircular binaries and for the ejection energy. we show that even binaries thatpenetrate deeply into the tidal sphere of the black hole are not doomed todisruption, but survive in 20% of the cases. nor do these deep encountersproduce the highest ejection energies, which are instead obtained for binariesarriving to 0.1-0.5 of the tidal radius in a prograde orbit. interestingly,such deep-reaching binaries separate widely after penetrating the tidal radius,but always approach each other again on their way out from the blackhole.[shortened]

1004.2496	early supernovae light-curves following the shock-breakout	the first light from a supernova (sn) emerges once the sn shock breaks out ofthe stellar surface. the first light, typically a uv or x-ray flash, isfollowed by a broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiationthat leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. motivated by recent detection ofemission from very early stages of several sne, we revisit the theory of shockbreakout and the following emission. we derive analytic light curves, payingspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermalequilibrium. we then consider the breakout from several sne progenitors. wefind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, wolf-rayet stars (wrs)and possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiationis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,before the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early sphericalphase. therefore, during these phases we predict significantly highertemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. when thermalequilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and itstemporal evolution. our results are useful for interpretation of early sn lightcurves. some examples are: (i) red supergiant sne have an early bright peak inoptical and uv flux, less than an hour after breakout. it is followed by aminimum at the end of the planar phase (about 10 hr), before it peaks againonce the temperature drops to the observed frequency range. in contrast wrsshow only the latter peak in optical and uv. (ii) bright x-ray flares areexpected from all core-collapse sne types. (iii) the light curve and spectrumof the initial breakout pulse holds information on the explosion geometry andprogenitor wind opacity. its spectrum in compact progenitors shows a(non-thermal) power-law.

1006.5455	equilibrium configurations of synchronous binaries: numerical solutions  and application to kuiper-belt binary 2001 qg298	we present numerical computations of the equilibrium configurations oftidally-locked homogeneous binaries, rotating in circular orbits. unlike theclassical roche approximations, we self-consistently account for the tidal androtational deformations of both components, and relax the assumptions ofellipsoidal configurations and keplerian rotation. we find numerical solutionsfor mass ratios q between 1e-3 and 1, starting at a small angular velocity forwhich tidal and rotational deformations are small, and following a sequence ofincreasing angular velocities. each series terminates at an appropriate ``rochelimit'', above which no equilibrium solution can be found. even though theroche limit is crossed before the ``roche lobe'' is filled, any furtherincrease in the angular velocity will result in mass-loss. for close,comparable-mass binaries, we find that local deviations from ellipsoidal formsmay be as large as 10-20%, and departures from keplerian rotation aresignificant. we compute the light curves that arise from our equilibriumconfigurations, assuming their distance is &gt;&gt;1 au (e.g. in the kuiper belt). weconsider both backscatter (proportional to the projected area) and diffuse(lambert) reflections. backscatter reflection always yields two minima of equaldepths. diffuse reflection, which is sensitive to the surface curvature,generally gives rise to unequal minima. we find detectable intensitydifferences of up to 10% between our light curves and those arising from theroche approximations. finally, we apply our models to kuiper belt binary 2001qg298, and find a nearly edge-on binary with a mass ratio q = 0.93^{+0.07}_{-0.03}, angular velocity omega^2/g rho = 0.333+/-0.001 (statisticalerrors only), and pure diffuse reflection. for the observed period of 2001qg298, these parameters imply a bulk density, rho = 0.72 +/- 0.04 g cm^-3.

1008.0643	transits of transparent planets - atmospheric lensing effects	light refracted by the planet's atmosphere is usually ignored in analysis ofplanetary transits. here we show that refraction can add shoulders to thetransit light curve, i.e., an increase in the observed flux, mostly just beforeand after transit. during transit, light may be refracted away from theobserver. therefore, even completely transparent planets will display a verysimilar signal to that of a standard transit, i.e., that of an opaque planet.we provide analytical expression for the amount of additional light deflectedtowards the observer before the transit, and show that the effect may be aslarge as $10^{-4}$ of the stellar light and therefore measurable by currentinstruments. by observing this effect we can directly measure the scale heightof the planet's atmosphere. we also consider the attenuation of starlight inthe planetary atmosphere due to rayleigh scattering and discuss the conditionsunder which the atmospheric lensing effect is most prominent. we show that, forplanets on orbital periods larger than about 70 days, the size of the transitis determined by refraction effects, and not by absorption within the planet.

1010.0477	a unified theory for the effects of stellar perturbations and galactic  tides on oort cloud comets	we examine the effects of passing field stars on the angular momentum of anearly radial orbit of an oort cloud comet bound to the sun. we derive theprobability density function (pdf) of the change in angular momentum from onestellar encounter, assuming a uniform and isotropic field of perturbers. weshow that the total angular momentum follows a levy flight, and determine itsdistribution function. if there is an asymmetry in the directional distributionof perturber velocities, the marginal probability distribution of eachcomponent of the angular momentum vector can be different. the constant torqueattributed to galactic tides arises from a non-cancellation of perturbationswith an impact parameter of order the semimajor axis of the comet. when theclose encounters are rare, the angular momentum is best modeled by thestochastic growth of stellar encounters. if trajectories passing between thecomet and sun occur frequently, the angular momentum exhibits the coherentgrowth attributed to the galactic tides.

1010.2676	binary yorp and evolution of binary asteroids	the rotation states of kilometer sized near earth asteroids are known to beaffected by the yorp effect. in a related effect, binary yorp (byorp) theorbital properties of a binary asteroid evolves under a radiation effect mostlyacting on a tidally locked secondary. the byorp effect can alter the orbitalelements in $\sim 10^{4-5}$ years for a $d_{p}=2\;km$ primary with a$d_{s}=0.4\; km$ secondary at $1\; au$. it can either separate the binarycomponents or cause them to collide. in this paper we devise a simple approachto calculate the yorp effect on asteroids and byorp effect on binariesincluding $j_2$ effects due to primary oblateness and the sun. we apply this toasteroids with known shapes as well as a set of randomly generated bodies withvarious degrees of smoothness. we find a strong correlation between thestrengths of an asteroid's yorp and byorp effects. therefore, a statisticalknowledge on one, could be used to estimate the effect of the other. we showthat the action of byorp preferentially shrinks rather than expands the binaryorbit and that yorp preferentially slows down asteroids. this conclusion holdsfor the two extremes of thermal conductivities studied in this work andassuming the asteroid reaches a stable point, but may break down for moderatethermal conductivity. the yorp and byorp effects are shown to be smaller thanwhat could be naively expected due to near cancellation of the effects on smallscales. taking this near cancellation into account, a simple order of magnitudeestimate of the yorp and byorp effects as function of the sizes and smoothnessof the bodies is calculated. finally, we provide a simple proof showing thatthere is no secular effect due to absorption of radiation in byorp.

0709.3107	formation of kuiper belt binaries	the discovery that a substantial fraction of kuiper belt objects (kbos)exists in binaries with wide separations and roughly equal masses, hasmotivated a variety of new theories explaining their formation. goldreich etal. (2002) proposed two formation scenarios: in the first, a transient binaryis formed, which becomes bound with the aid of dynamical friction from the seaof small bodies (l^2s mechanism); in the second, a binary is formed by threebody gravitational deflection (l^3 mechanism). here, we accurately calculatethe l^2s and l^3 formation rates for sub-hill velocities. while the l^2sformation rate is close to previous order of magnitude estimates, the l^3formation rate is about a factor of 4 smaller. for sub-hill kbo velocities (v&lt;&lt; v_h) the ratio of the l^3 to the l^2s formation rate is 0.05 (v/v_h)independent of the small bodies' velocity dispersion, their surface density ortheir mutual collisions. for super-hill velocities (v &gt;&gt; v_h) the l^3 mechanismdominates over the l^2s mechanism. binary formation via the l^3 mechanismcompetes with binary destruction by passing bodies. given sufficient time, astatistical equilibrium abundance of binaries forms. we show that the frequencyof long-lived transient binaries drops exponentially with the system's lifetimeand that such transient binaries are not important for binary formation via thel^3 mechanism, contrary to lee et al. (2007). for the l^2s mechanism we findthat the typical time, transient binaries must last, to form kuiper beltbinaries (kbbs) for a given strength of dynamical friction, d, increases onlylogarithmically with d. longevity of transient binaries only becomes importantfor very weak dynamical friction (i.e. d \lesssim 0.002) and is most likely notcrucial for kbb formation.

1106.2556	relativistic shock breakouts - a variety of gamma-ray flares: from low  luminosity gamma-ray bursts to type ia supernovae	a large variety of explosions result in mildly or ultra relativistic shockbreakouts. here we calculate the luminosity and spectrum that these breakoutsproduce. in order to do so we improve an analytic description of relativisticradiation mediated shocks and follow the system from the breakout itself,through the planar phase and into the spherical phase. we limit our calculationto cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planarphase. (i.e., the final gas lorentz factor &lt;~30). we find that sphericalrelativistic breakouts produce a flash of gamma-rays with energy, temperature,and duration that always satisfy a specific relation between them as well asproviding the breakout radius and lorentz factor. the breakout flare istypically followed, on longer time scales, by x-rays that carry a comparableenergy. we apply our model to a variety of explosions, including ia and .iasupernovae (sne), aic, energetic sne and gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we find thatall these events produce detectable gamma-ray signals, some of which may havealready been seen. some particular examples are: (i) relativistic shockbreakouts provide a natural explanation to the energy, temperature and timescales, as well as many other observed features, of all low luminosity grbs.(ii) nearby broad-line ib/c (like sn 2002ap) may produce a detectable gamma-raysignal. (iii) galactic ia sne produce detectable gamma-ray flares, if theirprogenitors are single degenerate. we conclude that relativistic shock breakoutis a generic process for the production of gamma-ray flares, which opens a newwindow for the study and detection of a variety of stellar explosions.

1107.1326	the propagation of relativistic jets in external media	relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems that containcompact objects. they transport large amounts of energy to large distances fromthe source, and their interaction with the ambient medium has a crucial effecton the evolution of the system. the propagation of the jet is characterized bythe formation of a shocked "head" at the front of the jet which dissipates thejet's energy and a cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates it.we present here a self consistent, analytic model that follows the evolution ofthe jet and its cocoon, and describes their interaction. we show that thecritical parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon system isthe dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy density and the rest-massenergy density of the ambient medium. this parameter, together with the jet'sinjection angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon ornot. the model is applicable to relativistic, unmagnetized, jets on all scalesand may be used to determine the conditions in agns jets as well as in grbs ormicroquasars. it shows that agn and microquasar jets are hydrodynamicallycollimated due to the interaction with the ambient medium, while grb jets canbe collimated only inside a star and become uncollimated once they breakout.

1111.2990	an observational imprint of the collapsar model of long gamma ray bursts	the collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the well knownassociation between long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and collapsing massive stars.a bipolar relativistic jet, launched at the core of a collapsing star, drillsits way through the stellar envelope and breaks out of the surface beforeproducing the observed gamma-rays. while a wealth of observations associategrbs with the death of massive stars, as yet there is no direct evidence forthe collapsar model itself. here we show that a distinct signature of thecollapsar model is the appearance of a plateau in the duration distribution ofthe prompt grb emission at times much shorter than the typical breakout time ofthe jet. this plateau is evident in the data of all three major satellites.these findings provide an evidence that directly supports the collapsar model.additionally, it suggests the existence of a large population of choked(failed) grbs and that the 2 s duration commonly used to separate collapsarsand non-collapasars is inconsistent with the duration distributions of {\itswift} and fermi grbs and only holds for batse grbs.

1201.4794	ejection and capture dynamics in restricted three-body encounters	we study the tidal disruption of binaries by a massive point mass (e.g. theblack hole at the galactic center), and we discuss how the ejection and capturepreference between unequal-mass binary members depends on which orbit theyapproach the massive object. we show that the restricted three-bodyapproximation provides a simple and clear description of the dynamics. theorbit of a binary with mass m around a massive object m should be almostparabolic with an eccentricity |1-e| &lt; (m/m)^{1/3} &lt;&lt; 1 for a member to becaptured, while the other is ejected. indeed, the energy change of the membersobtained for a parabolic orbit can be used to describe non-parabolic cases. ifa binary has an encounter velocity much larger than (m/m)^{1/3} times thebinary rotation velocity, it would be abruptly disrupted, and the energy changeat the encounter can be evaluated in a simple disruption model. we evaluate theprobability distributions for the ejection and capture of circular binarymembers and for the final energies. in principle, for any hyperbolic (elliptic)orbit, the heavier member has more chance to be ejected (captured), because itcarries a larger fraction of the orbital energy. however, if the orbital energyis close to zero, the difference between the two members becomes small, andthere is practically no ejection and capture preference. the preference becomessignificant when the orbital energy is comparable to the typical energy changeat the encounter. we discuss its implications to hypervelocity stars andirregular satellites around giant planets.

1202.3437	optical to x-rays supernovae light curves following shock breakout  through a thick wind	recent supernovae (sne) observations have motivated renewed interest in snshock breakouts from stars surrounded by thick winds. in such events theinteraction with the wind powers the observed luminosity, and predictionsinclude observable hard x-rays. wind breakouts on timescales of a day or longerare currently the most probable for detection. here we study the signal thatfollows such events. we start from the breakout of the radiation mediatedshock, finding that the breakout temperature can vary significantly from oneevent to another ($10^4 - 5 \times 10^6$ k) due to possible deviation fromthermal equilibrium. in general, events with longer breakout pulse duration,$t_{bo}$, are softer. we follow the observed radiation through the evolution ofthe collisionless shock which forms after the breakout of the radiationmediated shock. we restrict the study of the collisionless shock evolution tocases where the breakout itself is in thermal equilibrium, peaking inoptical/uv. in these cases the post-breakout emission contains two spectralcomponents - soft (optical/uv) and hard (x-rays and possibly soft$\gamma$-rays). right after the breakout pulse x-rays are strongly suppressed,and they carry only a small fraction of the total luminosity. the hardcomponent becomes harder and its luminosity rises quickly afterwards, gainingdominance at $\sim 10-50 \,t_{bo}$. the ratio of the peak optical/uv to thepeak x-ray luminosity depends mostly on the breakout time. in terms ofprospects for x-ray and soft gamma-ray detections, it is best to observe100-500 days after explosions with breakout timescales between a week and amonth.

1206.0700	the long, the short and the weak - the origin of grbs	the origin of gamma-ray bursts is one of the most interesting puzzles inrecent astronomy. during the last decade a consensus formed that long grbs(lgrbs) arise from the collapse of massive stars and that short grbs (sgrbs)have a different origin, most likely neutron star mergers. a key ingredient ofthe collapsar model that explains how the collapse of massive stars produces agrb is the emergence of a relativistic jet that penetrates the stellarenvelope. the condition that the emerging jet penetrates the envelope posesstrong constraints on the system. using these constraints we show that: (i) lowluminosity grbs (llgrbs), a sub population of grbs with a very low luminosities(and other peculiar properties: single peaked, smooth and soft) cannot beformed by collapsars. llgrbs must have a different origin (most likely a shockbreakout). (ii) on the other hand regular lgrbs must be formed by collapsars.(iii) while for batse the dividing duration between collapsars andnon-collapsar is indeed at $\sim 2$ sec, the dividing duration is different forother grbs detectors. in particular most swift bursts longer than 0.8 sec areof a collapsar origin. this last results requires a revision of manyconclusions concerning the origin of swift sgrbs which were based on thecommonly used 2 sec limit.

1210.0068	short vs long and collapsars vs. non-collapsar: a quantitative  classification of grbs	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are traditionally divided to long and short accordingto their durations (&gt;/&lt; 2 sec). it was generally believed that this reflects adifferent physical origin: collapsars (long) and non-collapsars (short). wehave recently shown that the duration distribution of collapsars is flat,namely independent of the duration, at short durations. using this model forthe distribution of collapsars we determine the duration distribution ofnon-collapsars and estimate the probability that a burst with a given duration(and hardness) is a collapsar or not. we find that this probability dependsstrongly on the spectral window of the observing detector. while the commonlyused limit of 2 sec is conservative and suitable for batse bursts, 40% ofswift's bursts shorter than 2 sec are collapsars and division &gt;/&lt;0.8 sec ismore suitable for swift. we find that the duration overlap of the twopopulations is very large. on the one hand there is a non-negligible fractionof non-collapsars longer than 10 sec, while on the other hand even burstsshorter than 0.5 sec in the swift sample have a non-negligible probability tobe collapsars. our results enable the construction of non-collapsar sampleswhile controlling the collapsar contamination. they also highlight that no firmconclusions can be drawn based on a single burst and they have numerousimplications concerning previous studies of non-collapsar properties that werebased on the current significantly contaminated swift samples of localizedshort grbs. specifically: (i) all known short bursts with z&gt;1 are most likelycollapsars, (ii) the only short burst with a clear jet break is most likely acollapsar, indicating our lack of knowledge concerning non-collapsar beaming(iii) the existence of non-collapsars with durations up to 10 sec impose newchallenges to non-collapsar models.

1210.3374	consequences of strong compression in tidal disruption events	the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole (smbh) is ahighly energetic event with consequences dependent on the degree to which thestar plunges inside the smbh's tidal sphere. we introduce a new analytic modelfor tidal disruption events (tdes) to analyze the dependence of these events onbeta, the ratio of the tidal radius to the orbital pericenter. we find,contrary to most previous work, that the spread in debris energy for a tde islargely constant for all beta. this result has important consequences foroptical transient searches targeting tdes, which we discuss. we quantifyleading-order general relativistic corrections to this spread in energy andfind that they are small. we also examine the role of stellar spin, and findthat a combination of spin-orbit misalignment, rapid rotation, and high betamay increase the spread in debris energy. finally, we quantify for the firsttime the gravitational wave emission due to the strong compression of a star ina high-beta tde. although this signal is unlikely to be detectable fordisruptions of main sequence stars, the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by anintermediate mass black hole can produce a strong signal visible to advancedligo at tens of megaparsecs.

0712.0446	tidal evolution of rubble piles	many small bodies in the solar system are believed to be rubble piles, acollection of smaller elements separated by voids. we propose a model for thestructure of a self-gravitating rubble pile. static friction prevents itselements from sliding relative to each other. stresses are concentrated aroundpoints of contact between individual elements. the effective dimensionlessrigidity, $\tilde\mu_{rubble}$, is related to that of a monolithic body ofsimilar composition and size, $\tilde\mu$ by $\tilde \mu_{rubble} \sim \tilde\mu^{1/2} \epsilon_y^{-1/2}$, where $\epsilon_y \sim 10^{-2}$ is the yieldstrain. this represents a reduction in effective rigidity below the maximumradius, $r_{max}\sim [\mu\epsilon_y/(g\rho^2)]^{1/2}\sim 10^3\km$, at which arubble pile can exist. densities derived for binary near-earth asteroids implythat they are rubble piles. as a consequence, their tidal evolution proceeds$10^3$ to $10^4$ times faster than it would if they were monoliths. thisaccounts for both the sizes of their semimajor axes and their small orbitaleccentricities. we show that our model for the rigidity of rubble piles iscompatible with laboratory experiment in sand.

1307.1134	the velocity distribution of hypervelocity stars	we consider the process of stellar binaries tidally disrupted by asupermassive black hole. for highly eccentric orbits, as one star is ejectedfrom the three-body system, the companion remains bound to the black hole.hypervelocity stars (hvss) observed in the galactic halo and s-stars observedorbiting the central black hole may originate from such mechanism. in thispaper, we predict the velocity distribution of the ejected stars of a givenmass, after they have travelled out of the galactic potential. we use bothanalytical methods and monte carlo simulations. we find that each part of thevelocity distribution encodes different information. at low velocities &lt; 800km/s, the galactic potential shapes universally the observed distribution,which rises towards a peak, related to the galactic escape velocity. beyond thepeak, the velocity distribution depends on binary mass and separationdistributions. finally, the finite star life introduces a break related totheir mass. a qualitative comparison of our models with current observationsshows the great potential of hvss to constrain bulge and galactic properties.standard choices for parameter distributions predict velocities below and above~800 km/s with equal probability, while none are observed beyond ~700 km/s andthe current detections are more clustered at low velocities 300-400 km/s. thesefeatures may indicate that the separation distribution of binaries that reachthe tidal sphere is not flat in logarithmic space, as observed in more localmassive binaries, but has more power towards larger separations, enhancingsmaller velocities. in addition, the binary formation/evolution process or theinjection mechanism might also induce a cut-off at ~ 10 solar radii in theseparation distribution.

1404.6313	recombination effects on supernovae light-curves	supernovae of type iip are marked by the long plateau seen in their opticallight curves. the plateau is believed to be the result of a recombination wavethat propagates through the outflowing massive hydrogen envelope. here, weanalytically investigate the transition from a fully ionized envelope to apartially recombined one and its effects on the sn light curve. the motivationis to establish the underlying processes which dominate the evolution at latetimes when recombination takes place in the envelope, yet early enough so that$^{56}$ni decay is a negligible source of energy. we assume a simple, yetadequate, hydrodynamic profile of the envelope and study the mechanisms whichdominate the energy emission and the observed temperature. we consider thediffusion of photons through the envelope while analyzing the ionizationfraction and the coupling between radiation and gas. we find that oncerecombination starts, the observed temperature decreases slowly in time.however, in a typical red supergiant (rsg) explosion, the recombination wavedoes not affect the bolometric luminosity immediately. only at later times, thecooling wave may reach layers that are deep enough to affect the luminosity. wefind that the plateau is not a generic result of a recombination process inexpanding gas. instead it depends on the density profile of the parts of theenvelope which undergo recombination. our results are useful to investigate thelight curves of rsg explosions. we show the resulting light curves of twoexamples of rsg explosions according to our model and discuss theircompatibility with observations. in addition, we improve the analyticalrelations between the plateau luminosity and plateau duration to the propertiesof the pre-explosion progenitor (arnett 1980; popov 1993).

0803.0329	the ratio of retrograde to prograde orbits: a test for kuiper belt  binary formation theories	with the discovery of kuiper belt binaries that have wide separations androughly equal masses new theories were proposed to explain their formation. twoformation scenarios were suggested by goldreich and collaborators: in thefirst, dynamical friction that is generated by a sea of small bodies enables atransient binary to become bound ($l^2s$ mechanism); in the second, a transientbinary gets bound by an encounter with a third body ($l^3$ mechanism).  we show that these different binary formation scenarios leave their ownunique signatures in the relative abundance of prograde to retrograde binaryorbits. this signature is due to stable retrograde orbits that exist muchfurther out in the hill sphere than prograde orbits. it provides an excellentopportunity to distinguish between the different binary formation scenariosobservationally.  we predict that if binary formation proceeded while sub-hill velocitiesprevailed, the vast majority of all comparable mass ratio binaries haveretrograde orbits. this dominance of retrograde binary orbits is a result ofbinary formation via the $l^2s$ mechanism, or any other mechanism thatdissipates energy in a smooth and gradual manner. for super-hill velocitiesbinary formation proceeds via the $l^3$ mechanism which produces a roughlyequal number of prograde and retrograde binaries. these predictions assume thatsubsequent orbital evolution due to dynamical friction and dynamical stirringof the kuiper belt did not alter the sense of the binary orbit after formation.

1406.5730	spins of large asteroids: hint on a primordial distribution of their  spin rates	the asteroid belt and the kuiper belt are relics from the formation of oursolar system. understanding the size and spin distribution of the two belts iscrucial for a deeper understanding of the formation of our solar system and thedynamical process that govern it. in this paper, we investigate the effect ofcollisions on the evolution of the spin distribution of asteroids and kbo's.  we find that the power law nature of the impactors' size distribution leadsto a l\'evy distribution of the spin rates. this results in a power law tail ofthe spin distribution, in stark contrast to the usually quoted maxwelliandistribution. we show that for bodies larger than 10 km, collisions alone leadto spin rates peaking at 0.15-0.5 revolutions per day. comparing that to theobserved spin rates of large asteroids ($r&gt;50$ km), we find that the spins oflarge asteroids, peaking at $\sim1-2$ revolutions per day, are dominated by aprimordial component that reflects the formation mechanism of the asteroids.similarly, the kuiper belt has undergone virtually no collisional spinevolution, assuming current day density. collisions contribute a spin rate of$\sim0.01$ revolutions per day, thus the observed fast spin rates of kbos arealso primordial in nature.

1406.6435	atmospheric mass loss during planet formation: the importance of  planetesimal impacts	we quantify the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation by examiningthe contributions to atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimalaccretion. giant impacts cause global motion of the ground. using analyticself-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for isothermalatmospheres with adiabatic index ($\gamma=5/3$) that the local atmospheric massloss fraction for ground velocities $v_g &lt; 0.25 v_{esc}$ is given by$\chi_{loss}=(1.71 v_g/v_{esc})^{4.9}$, where $v_{esc}$ is the escape velocityfrom the target. yet, the global atmospheric mass loss is a weaker function ofthe impactor velocity $v_{imp}$ and mass $m_{imp}$ and given by $x_{loss} ~0.4x+1.4x^2-0.8x^3$ (isothermal atmosphere) and $x_{loss} ~ 0.4x+1.8x^2-1.2x^3$(adiabatic atmosphere), where $x=(v_{imp}m/v_{esc}m)$. atmospheric mass lossdue to planetesimal impacts proceeds in two different regimes: 1) large enoughimpactors $m &gt; \sqrt{2} \rho_0 (\pi h r)^{3/2}$ (25~km for the current earth),are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impactsite, which is $h/2r$ of the whole atmosphere, where $h$, $r$ and $\rho_0$ arethe atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric densityat the ground. 2) smaller impactors, but above $m&gt;4 \pi \rho_0 h^3$ (1~km forthe current earth) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric massabove the tangent plane. we find that the most efficient impactors (per unitimpactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lowerlimit and that the current atmosphere of the earth could have resulted from anequilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmospherefrom planetesimals. we conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to haveplayed a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of theterrestrial planets.

1407.4475	the afterglow of a relativistic shock breakout and low-luminosity grbs	the prompt emission of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (llgrbs) indicatesthat these events originate from a relativistic shock breakout. in this case wecan estimate, based on the properties of the prompt emission, the energydistribution of the ejecta. we develop a general formalism to estimate theafterglow produced by synchrotron emission from the forward shock resultingfrom the interaction of this ejecta with the circum-burst matter. we assesswhether this emission can produce the observed radio and x-ray afterglows ofthe available sample of 4 llgrbs. all 4 radio afterglows can be explainedwithin this model, providing further support for shock breakouts being theorigin of llgrbs. we find that in one of the llgrbs (grb 031203) the predictedx-ray emission, using the same parameters that fit the radio, can explain theobserved one. in another one (grb 980425) the observed x-rays can be explainedif we allow for a slight modification of the simplest model. for the last twocases (grbs 060218 and 100316d), we find that, as is the case for previousattempts to model these afterglows, the simplest model that fits the radioemission underpredicts the observed x-ray afterglows. using general arguments,we show that the most natural location of the x-ray source is, like the radiosource, within the ejecta-external medium interaction layer but that emissionis due to a different population of electrons or to a different emissionprocess.

1501.02087	hot-jupiter inflation due to deep energy deposition	some extrasolar giant planets in close orbits---"hot jupiters"---exhibitlarger radii than that of a passively cooling planet. the extreme irradiation$l_{\rm eq}$ these hot jupiters receive from their close in stars creates athick isothermal layer in their envelopes, which slows down their convectivecooling, allowing them to retain their inflated size for longer. this is yetinsufficient to explain the observed sizes of the most inflated planets. somemodels invoke an additional power source, deposited deep in the planet'senvelope. here we present an analytical model for the cooling of suchirradiated, and internally heated gas giants. we show that a power source$l_{\rm dep}$, deposited at an optical depth $\tau_{\rm dep}$, creates anexterior convective region, between optical depths $l_{\rm eq}/l_{\rm dep}$ and$\tau_{\rm dep}$, beyond which a thicker isothermal layer exists, which inextreme cases may extend to the center of the planet. this convective layer,which occurs only for $l_{\rm dep}\tau_{\rm dep}&gt;l_{\rm eq}$, further delaysthe cooling of the planet. such a planet is equivalent to a planet irradiatedwith $l_{\rm eq}\left(1+l_{\rm dep}\tau_{\rm dep}/l_{\rm eq}\right)^\beta$,where $\beta\approx 0.35$ is an effective power-law index describing theradiative energy density as function of the optical depth for a convectiveplanet $u\propto\tau^\beta$. our simple analytical model reproduces the maintrends found in previous numerical works, and provides an intuitiveunderstanding. we derive scaling laws for the cooling rate of the planet, itscentral temperature, and radius. these scaling laws can be used to estimate theeffects of tidal or ohmic dissipation, wind shocks, or any other mechanisminvolving energy deposition, on sizes of hot jupiters.

1504.03702	energy injection in gamma-ray burst afterglows	we present multi-wavelength observations and modeling of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) that exhibit a simultaneous re-brightening in their x-ray and opticallight curves, and are also detected at radio wavelengths. we show that there-brightening episodes can be modeled by injection of energy into theblastwave and that in all cases the energy injection rate falls within thetheoretical bounds expected for a distribution of energy with ejecta lorentzfactor. our measured values of the circumburst density, jet opening angle, andbeaming corrected kinetic energy are consistent with the distribution of theseparameters for long-duration grbs at both z~1 and z&gt;6, suggesting that the jetlaunching mechanism and environment of these events are similar to that of grbsthat do not have bumps in their light curves. however, events exhibitingre-brightening episodes have lower radiative efficiencies than average,suggesting that a majority of the kinetic energy of the outflow is carried byslow-moving ejecta, which is further supported by steep measured distributionsof the ejecta energy as a function of lorentz factor. we do not find evidencefor reverse shocks over the energy injection period, implying that the onset ofenergy injection is a gentle process. we further show that grbs exhibitingsimultaneous x-ray and optical re-brightenings are likely the tail of adistribution of events with varying rates of energy injection, forming the mostextreme events in their class. future x-ray observations of grb afterglows withswift and its successors will thus likely discover several more such events,while radio follow-up and multi-wavelength modeling of similar events willunveil the role of energy injection in grb afterglows.

1507.05589	the sharpness of gamma-ray burst prompt emission spectra	we aim to obtain a measure of the curvature of time-resolved spectra that canbe compared directly to theory. this tests the ability of models such assynchrotron emission to explain the peaks or breaks of gbm prompt emissionspectra. we take the burst sample from the official fermi gbm grb time-resolvedspectral catalog. we re-fit all spectra with a measured peak or break energy inthe catalog best-fit models in various energy ranges, which cover the curvaturearound the spectral peak or break, resulting in a total of 1,113 spectra beinganalysed. we compute the sharpness angles under the peak or break of thetriangle constructed under the model fit curves and compare to the valuesobtained from various representative emission models: blackbody,single-electron synchrotron, synchrotron emission from a maxwellian orpower-law electron distribution. we find that 35% of the time-resolved spectraare inconsistent with the single-electron synchrotron function, and 91% areinconsistent with the maxwellian synchrotron function. the single temperature,single emission time and location blackbody function is found to be sharperthan all the spectra. no general evolutionary trend of the sharpness angle isobserved, neither per burst nor for the whole population. it is found that thelimiting case, a single temperature maxwellian synchrotron function, can onlycontribute up to $58^{+23}_{-18}$% of the peak flux. our results show that eventhe sharpest but non-realistic case, the single-electron synchrotron function,cannot explain a large fraction of the observed grb prompt spectra. because ofthe fact that any combination of physically possible synchrotron spectra addedtogether will always further broaden the spectrum, emission mechanisms otherthan optically thin synchrotron radiation are likely required in a fullexplanation of the spectral peaks or breaks of the grb prompt emission phase.

astro-ph;0001160	the synchrotron spectrum of fast cooling electrons revisited	we discuss the spectrum arising from synchrotron emission by fast cooling(fc) electrons, when fresh electrons are continually accelerated by a strongblast wave, into a power law distribution of energies. the fc spectrum was sofar described by four power law segments divided by three break frequencies$\nu_{sa} &lt; \nu_{c} &lt; \nu_{m}$. this is valid for a homogeneous electrondistribution. however, hot electrons are located right after the shock, whilemost electrons are farther down stream and have cooled. this spatialdistribution changes the optically thick part of the spectrum, introducing anew break frequency, $\nu_{ac} &lt; \nu_{sa}$, and a new spectral slope, $f_{\nu}\propto \nu^{11/8}$ for $\nu_{ac} &lt; \nu &lt; \nu_{sa}$. the familiar $f_{\nu}\propto \nu ^{2}$ holds only for $\nu &lt; \nu_{ac}$. this ordering of the breakfrequencies is relevant for typical gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows in an ismenvironment. other possibilities arise for internal shocks or afterglows indense circumstellar winds. we discuss possible implications of this spectrumfor grbs and their afterglows, in the context of the internal-external shockmodel. observations of $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{11/8}$ would enable us to probescales much smaller than the typical size of the system, and constrain theamount of turbulent mixing behind the shock.

astro-ph;0003406	impulsive and varying injection in grb afterglows	the standard model of gamma-ray bursts afterglows is based on synchrotronradiation from a blast wave produced when the relativistic ejecta encountersthe surrounding medium. we reanalyze the refreshed shock scenario, in whichslower material catches up with the decelerating ejecta and reenergizes it.this energization can be done either continuously or in discrete episodes. weshow that such scenario has two important implications. first there is anadditional component coming from the reverse shock that goes into theenergizing ejecta. this persists for as long as the re-energization itself,which could extend for up to days or longer. we find that during this time theoverall spectral peak is found at the characteristic frequency of the reverseshock. second, if the injection is continuous, the dynamics will be differentfrom that in constant energy evolution, and will cause a slower decline of theobserved fluxes. a simple test of the continuously refreshed scenario is thatit predicts a spectral maximum in the far ir or mm range after a few days.

astro-ph;0005253	on the synchrotron self-compton emission from relativistic shocks and  its implications for gamma-ray burst afterglows	we consider the effects of inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photonsfrom relativistic electrons in grb afterglows. we compute the spectrum of theinverse compton emission and find that it can dominate the total cooling rateof the afterglow for several months or even years after the initial explosion.we demonstrate that the presence of strong inverse compton cooling can bededuced from the effect it has on the time-evolution of the cooling break inthe synchrotron spectral component, and therefore on the optical and x-rayafterglow lightcurves. we then show how the physical interpretation of theobserved characteristics of the synchrotron spectrum must be modified to takeinto consideration this extra source of cooling, and give a revisedprescription for computing physical parameters characterizing the expandingshock wave from the observed quantities. we find that for a given set ofobservables (synchrotron break frequencies and fluxes) there is either noconsistent physical interpretation or two of them. finally we discuss theprospects of directly detecting the inverse compton emission with chandra. weargue that such a detection is possible for grbs exploding in a reasonablydense (n&gt;1 cm^-3) medium.

astro-ph;0108027	the shape of spectral breaks in grb afterglows	gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows are well described by synchrotron emissionfrom relativistic blast waves expanding into an external medium. the blast waveis believed to amplify the magnetic field and accelerate the electrons into apower law distribution of energies promptly behind the shock. these electronsthen cool both adiabatically and by emitting synchrotron and inverse comptonradiation. the resulting spectra is known to consist several power lawsegments, which smoothly join at certain break frequencies. here, we give acomplete description of all possible spectra under those assumptions, and findthat there are 5 possible regimes, depending on the ordering of the breakfrequencies. the flux density is calculated by integrating over thecontributions from all the shocked region, using the blandford mckee solution.this allows us to calculate more accurate expressions for the value of thesebreak frequencies, and describe the shape of the spectral breaks around them.this also provides the shape of breaks in the light curves caused by thepassage of a break frequency through the observed band. these new, more exact,estimates are different from more simple calculations by up to a factor ofabout 70, and describe some new regimes which where previously ignored.

astro-ph;0202462	eccentricity evolution for planets in gaseous disks	we investigate the hypothesis that interactions between a giant planet andthe disk from which it forms promote eccentricity growth. these interactionsare concentrated at discrete lindblad and corotation resonances. interactionsat principal lindblad resonances cause the planet's orbit to migrate and open agap in the disk if the planet is sufficiently massive. those at first orderlindblad and corotation resonances change the planet's orbital eccentricity.eccentricity is excited by interactions at external lindblad resonances whichare located on the opposite side of corotation from the planet, and damped byco-orbital lindblad resonances which overlap the planet's orbit. if the planetclears a gap in the disk, the rate of eccentricity damping by co-orbitallindblad resonances is reduced. density gradients associated with the gapactivate eccentricity damping by corotation resonances at a rate whichinitially marginally exceeds that of eccentricity excitation by externallindblad resonances. but the corotation torque drives a mass flux which reducesthe density gradient near the resonance. sufficient partial saturation ofcorotation resonances can tip the balance in favor of eccentricity excitation.a minimal initial eccentricity of a few percent is required to overcome viscousdiffusion which acts to unsaturate corotation resonances by reestablishing thelarge scale density gradient. thus eccentricity growth is a finite amplitudeinstability. formally, interactions at the apsidal resonance, which is aspecial kind of co-orbital lindblad resonance, appears to damp eccentricityfaster than external lindblad resonances can excite it. however, apsidal waveshave such long wavelengths that they do not propagate in protoplanetary disks.this reduces eccentricity damping by the apsidal resonance to a modest level.

astro-ph;0208490	formation of kuiper belt binaries	it appears that at least several percent of large kuiper belt objects aremembers of wide binaries. physical collisions are too infrequent to account fortheir formation. collisionless gravitational interactions are more promising.these provide two channels for binary formation. in each, the initial step isthe formation of a transient binary when two large bodies penetrate eachother's hill spheres. stabilization of a transient binary requires that it loseenergy. either dynamical friction due to small bodies or the scattering of athird large body can be responsible. our estimates favor the former, albeit bya small margin. we predict that most objects of size comparable to thosecurrently observed in the kuiper belt are members of multiple systems. morespecifically, we derive the probability that a large body is a member of abinary with semi-major axis of order a. the probability depends upon sigma, thetotal surface density, sigma, the surface density of large bodies having radiusr, and theta=10^-4, the angle subtended by the solar radius as seen from thekuiper belt. for (sigma/sigma)r&lt;a&lt; r/theta, the probability is just (sigma/rhor)theta^-2, the optical depth of the large bodies divided by the solid anglesubtended by the sun. for r&lt;a&lt;r_u=(sigma/sigma)r, it varies inversely withsemimajor axis and reaches (sigma/rho r)theta^-2 at a=r. based on currentsurveys of the kuiper belt, we estimate sigma/rho=3 10^-4cm and r=100km. weobtain sigma/rho=0.3cm by extrapolating the surface density deduced for theminimum mass solar nebula. rough predictions are: outside of the criticalseparation r_u/a_odot=3'', the binary probability is 0.3%; at separations of0.2'', comparable to current resolving capabilities, it reaches 5%, inagreement with results from the hst binary survey by brown.

astro-ph;0307107	planet - disk symbiosis	planets form in disks around young stars. interactions with these disks causethem to migrate and thus affect their final orbital periods. we suggest thatthe connection between planets and disks may be deeper and involve a symbioticevolution. by contributing to the outward transport of angular momentum,planets promote disk accretion. here we demonstrate that planets sufficientlymassive to open gaps could be the primary agents driving disk accretion. thosehaving masses below the gap opening threshold drift inward more rapidly thanthe disk material and can only play a minor role in its accretion. eccentricitygrowth during gap formation may involve an even more intimate symbiosis. givena small initial eccentricity, just a fraction of a percent, the orbitaleccentricity of a massive planet may grow rapidly once a mass in excess of theplanet's mass has been repelled to form a gap around the planet's orbit. then,as the planet's radial excursions approach the gap's width, subsequenteccentricity growth slows so that the planet's orbit continues to be confinedwithin the gap.

astro-ph;0402138	shaping the kuiper belt size spectrum by shattering large but  strengthless bodies	the observed size distribution of kuiper belt objects (kbos)--small icy androcky solar system bodies orbiting beyond neptune--is well described by a powerlaw at large kbo sizes. however, recent work by bernstein et al. (2003)indicates that the size spectrum breaks and becomes shallower for kbos smallerthan about 70 km in size. here we show that we expect such a break at kboradius ~40 km since destructive collisions are frequent for smaller kbos.specifically, we assume that kbos are rubble piles with low material strengthrather than solid monoliths. this gives a power-law slope q~3 where the numbern(r) of kbos larger than a size r is given by $n(r) \propto r^{1-q}$; the breaklocation follows from this slope through a self-consistent calculation. theexistence of this break, the break's location, and the power-law slope weexpect below the break are consistent with the findings of bernstein et al.(2003). the agreement with observations indicates that kbos are effectivelystrengthless rubble piles.

astro-ph;0404240	final stages of planet formation	we address three questions regarding solar system planets. what determinedtheir number? why are their orbits nearly circular and coplanar? how long didthey take to form? runaway accretion in a disk of small bodies resulted in atiny fraction of the bodies growing much larger than all the others. this wasfollowed by oligarchic growth during which the big bodies maintained similarmasses and uniformly spaced semi-major axes. we depart from standard treatmentsof planet formation by assuming that as the big bodies got bigger, the smallones got smaller as the result of undergoing a collisional fragmentationcascade. it follows that oligarchy was a brief stage in solar system evolution.when the oligarchs' surface mass density matched that of the small bodies,dynamical friction was no longer able to balance viscous stirring, so theirvelocity dispersion increased to the extent that their orbits crossed. thismarked the end of oligarchy. what happened next differed in the inner and outerparts of the planetary system. in the inner part, where the ratios of theescape velocities from the surfaces of the planets to the escape velocitiesfrom their orbits are smaller than unity, big bodies collided and coalescedafter their random velocities became comparable to their escape velocities. inthe outer part, where these ratios are larger than unity, the random velocitiesof some of the big bodies continued to rise until they were ejected. in bothparts, the number density of the big bodies eventually decreased to the extentthat gravitational interactions among them no longer produced large scalechaos. after that their orbital eccentricities and inclinations were damped bydynamical friction from the remaining small bodies. the last and longest stagein planet formation was the clean up of small bodies.

astro-ph;0405215	planet formation by coagulation: a focus on uranus and neptune	planets form in the circumstellar disks of young stars. we review the basicphysical processes by which solid bodies accrete each other and alter eachothers' random velocities, and we provide order-of-magnitude derivations forthe rates of these processes. we discuss and exercise the two-groupsapproximation, a simple yet powerful technique for solving the evolutionequations for protoplanet growth. we describe orderly, runaway, neutral, andoligarchic growth. we also delineate the conditions under which each occurs. werefute a popular misconception by showing that the outer planets formed quicklyby accreting small bodies. then we address the final stages of planetformation. oligarchy ends when the surface density of the oligarchs becomescomparable to that of the small bodies. dynamical friction is no longer able tobalance viscous stirring and the oligarchs' random velocities increase. in theinner-planet system, oligarchs collide and coalesce. in the outer-planetsystem, some of the oligarchs are ejected. in both the inner- and outer-planetsystems, this stage ends once the number of big bodies has been reduced to thepoint that their mutual interactions no longer produce large-scale chaos.subsequently, dynamical friction by the residual small bodies circularizes andflattens their orbits. the final stage of planet formation involves the cleanup of the residual small bodies. clean up has been poorly explored.

astro-ph;0502052	pure and loaded fireballs in sgr giant flares	on december 27, 2004, a giant flare from sgr 1806$-$20 was detected on earth.its thermal spectrum and temperature suggest that the flare resulted from anenergy release of about $10^{47}$ erg/sec close to the surface of a neutronstar in the form of radiation and/or pairs. this plasma expanded under its ownpressure producing a fireball and the observed gamma-rays escaped once thefireball became optically thin. the giant flare was followed by a bright radioafterglow, with an observable extended size, implying an energetic relativisticoutflow. we revisit here the evolution of relativistic fireballs and wecalculate the lorentz factor and energy remaining in relativistic outflow oncethe radiation escapes. we show that pairs that arise naturally in a purepairs-radiation fireball do not carry enough energy to account for the observedafterglow. we consider various alternatives and we show that if therelativistic outflow that causes the afterglow is related directly to theprompt flare, then the initial fireball must be loaded by baryons or poyntingflux. while we focus on parameters applicable to the giant flare and the radioafterglow of sgr 1806$-$20 the calculations presented here might be alsoapplicable to grbs.

astro-ph;0505174	first and second-type self-similar solutions of implosions and  explosions containing ultra-relativistic shocks	we derive self similar solutions for ultra-relativistic shock wavespropagating into cold material of powerlaw density profile in radius rho ~r^-k. we treat both implosions and explosions in three geometries: planar,cylindrical and spherical. for spherical explosions these are the first typesolutions of blandford and mckee for k&lt;4 and the second type solutions found bybest and sari for k&gt;5-sqrt(3/4). in addition we find new, hollow (withevacuated interior), first type solutions that may be applicable for 4&lt;k&lt;17/4.this ``sequence'' with increasing k of first type solutions, hollow first typesolutions, and then second type solutions is reminiscent of thenon-relativistic sequence. however, while in the non relativistic case there isa range of k which corresponds to a ``gap'' - a range in $k$ with neither firstnor second type solutions which separates the hollow first type solutions andthe second type solutions, here there is an ``overlap'': a range of k for whichcurrent considerations allow for both hollow first and second type solutions.further understanding is needed to determine which of the two solutions applyin this overlap regime. we provide similar exploration for the other geometriesand for imploding configurations. interestingly, we find a gap for implodingspherical shocks and exploding planar shocks and an overlap for implodingplanar solutions. cylindrical configurations have no hollow solutions andexhibit direct transition from first type to second type solutions, without agap or an overlap region.

astro-ph;0505176	self-similar solutions for relativistic shocks emerging from stars with  polytropic envelopes	we consider a strong ultrarelativistic shock moving through a star whoseenvelope has a polytrope-like density profile. when the shock is close to thestar's outer boundary, its behavior follows the self-similar solution given bysari (2005) for implosions in planar geometry. here we outline this solutionand find the asymptotic solution as the shock reaches the star's edge. we thenshow that the motion after the shock breaks out of the star is described by aself-similar solution remarkably like the solution for the motion inside thestar. in particular, the characteristic lorentz factor, pressure, and densityvary with time according to the same power laws both before and after the shockbreaks out of the star. after emergence from the star, however, theself-similar solution's characteristic position corresponds to a point behindthe leading edge of the flow rather than at the shock front, and the relevantrange of values for the similarity variable changes. our numerical integrationsagree well with the analytic results both before and after the shock reachesthe star's edge.

astro-ph;0610093	the effect of semi-collisional accretion on planetary spins	planetesimal accretion during planet formation is usually treated ascollisionless. such accretion from a uniform and dynamically cold disk predictsprotoplanets with slow retrograde rotation. however, if the building blocks ofprotoplanets, planetesimals, are small, of order of a meter in size, then theyare likely to collide within the protoplanet's sphere of gravitationalinfluence, creating a prograde accretion disk around the protoplanet. theaccretion of such a disk results in the formation of protoplanets spinning inthe prograde sense with the maximal spin rate allowed before centrifugal forcesbreak them apart. as a result of semi-collisional accretion, the final spin ofa planet after giant impacts is not completely random but is biased towardprograde rotation. the eventual accretion of the remaining planetesimals in thepost giant-impact phase might again be in the semi-collisional regime anddelivers a significant amount of additional prograde angular momentum to theterrestrial planets. we suggest that in our solar system, semi-collisionalaccretion gave rise to the preference for prograde rotation observed in theterrestrial planets and perhaps the largest asteroids.

astro-ph;9605005	cooling time scales and temporal structure of gamma-ray bursts	a leading mechanism for producing cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is viaultra-relativistic particles in an expanding fireball. the kinetic energy ofthe particles is converted into thermal energy in a forward shock and a reverseshock, when the outward flowing particles encounter the interstellar medium.the thermal energy is radiated via synchrotron emission and comptonization. weestimate the synchrotron cooling time scale of the shocked regions forelectrons of various lorentz factors, focusing in particular on those electronswhose radiation falls within the energy detection range of the batse detectors.we find that in order to produce the rapid variability observed in most burststhe magnetic energy density in the shocked material must be greater than about1\% of the thermal energy density. additionally, the electrons must be nearlyin equipartition with the protons, otherwise the radiative efficiency is low.inverse compton scattering can increase the cooling rate of the relevantelectrons but the comptonized emission itself is never within the batse range.these arguments allow us to pinpoint the conditions within the radiatingregions in grbs and to determine the important radiation processes. inaddition, the model predicts that the duty cycle of intensity variations in grblight curves should be nearly independent of burst duration, and should scaleinversely as the square root of the observed photon energy. both correlationsare in agreement with observations. the model also provides a plausibleexplanation for the bimodal distribution of burst durations. there is noexplanation, however, for the characteristic break energy in grb spectra.

astro-ph;9706078	hydrodynamics of grb after-glow	the detection of delayed emission at x-ray optical and radio wavelengths,``after-glow'', suggests that the relativistic shell which emitted the initialgrb due to internal shocks decelerates on encountering an external medium,giving rise to the after-glow. at a very early stage (few seconds), theobserved bolometric luminosity increases as t^2. on longer time scales (morethan about 10s), the luminosity drops as t^{-1}. if the main burst is longenough, an intermediate stage of constant luminosity will form. in this case,the after-glow overlaps the main burst, otherwise there is a time separationbetween the two. on the long time scale, the flow decelerate in a self similarway, reaching non relativistic velocities after about 30days. due to thedeceleration and the accumulation of ism material, the relation between theobserved time, the shock radius, and its lorentz factor, is given byt=r/16\gamma^2c which is a factor of 8 different from the usual expression. themajority of particles are those of the original ejecta (and not the ism) up toabout 900s. these particles reach sub-relativistic velocities on a time scaleof about 2hours, well before the flow becomes sub-relativistic. therefore theejecta particles are probably unimportant for most of the after-glow radiation.we show that even though only a small fraction of the energy is given to theelectrons, most of the energy can be radiated over time. if this fraction isgreater than 10% radiation losses will significantly influence thehydrodynamical evolution at early times (less than 1day).

astro-ph;9803258	fluid dynamics of partially radiative blast waves	we derive a self similar solution for the propagation of an extremerelativistic (or newtonian) radiative spherical blast wave into a surroundingcold medium. the solution is obtained under the assumption that the radiationprocess is fast, it takes place only in the vicinity of the shock and that itradiates away a fixed fraction of the energy generated by the shock. in thenewtonian regime these solutions generalize the sedov-taylor adiabatic solutionand the pressure-driven fully radiative solution. in the extreme relativisticcase these solutions generalize the blandford-mckee adiabatic solution. theyprovide a new fully radiative extreme relativistic solution which is differentfrom the blandford-mckee fully radiative relativistic solution. this newsolution develops a hot interior which causes it to cool faster than previousestimates. we find that the energy of the blast wave behaves as a power law ofthe location of the shock. the power law index depends on the fraction of theenergy emitted by the shock. we obtain an analytic solution for the interior ofthe blast wave. these new solutions might be applicable to the study of grbafterglow or snrs.

astro-ph;9806192	images and spectra from the interior of a relativistic fireball	the detection of an afterglow, following a gamma-ray burst (grb), can bedescribed reasonably well by synchrotron emission from a relativistic sphericalexpanding blast wave, driven by an expanding fireball. we perform detailedcalculations considering the emission from the whole region behind the shockfront. we use the blandford mckee self similar adiabatic solution to describethe fluid behind the shock. using this detailed model, we derive expressionsfor the peak flux, and the peak frequency at a given observed time. theseexpressions provide important numerical corrections to previous, moresimplified models. we calculate the observed light curve and spectra forseveral magnetic field models. we show that both the light curve and thespectra are flat near the peak. this rules out the interpretation of theoptical peak of grb970508 as the peak of the light curve, predicted by theexisting fireball models. we calculate the observed image of a grb afterglow.the observed image is bright near the edge and dimmer at the center, thuscreating a ring. the contrast between the edge and the center is larger at highfrequencies and the width of the ring is smaller.

astro-ph;9808007	synchrotron self absorption in grb afterglow	grb afterglow is reasonably described by synchrotron emission fromrelativistic blast waves at cosmological distances. we perform detailedcalculations taking into account the effect of synchrotron self absorption. weconsider emission from the whole region behind the shock front, and use theblandford mckee self similar solution to describe the fluid behind the shock.we calculate the spectra and the observed image of a grb afterglow near theself absorption frequency $\nu_a$ and derive an accurate expression for$\nu_a$. we show that the image is rather homogeneous for $\nu&lt;\nu_a$, asopposed to the bright ring at the outer edge and dim center, which appear athigher frequencies. we compare the spectra we obtain to radio observations ofgrb970508. we combine the calculations of the spectra near the self absorptionfrequency with other parts of the spectra and obtain revised estimates for thephysical parameters of the burst: $e_{52}=0.53$, $\epsilon_e=0.57$,$\epsilon_b=0.0082$, $n_1=5.3$. these estimates are different by up to twoorders of magnitude than the estimates based on an approximate spectrum.

astro-ph;9901338	predictions for the very early afterglow and the optical flash	according to the internal-external shocks model for $\gamma $-ray bursts(grbs), the grb is produced by internal shocks within a relativistic flow whilethe afterglow is produced by external shocks with the ism. we explore the earlyafterglow emission. for short grbs the peak of the afterglow will be delayed,typically, by few dozens of seconds after the burst. for long grbs the earlyafterglow emission will overlap the grb signal. we calculate the expectedspectrum and the light curves of the early afterglow in the optical, x-ray and$\gamma $-ray bands. these characteristics provide a way to discriminatebetween late internal shocks emission (part of the grb) and the early afterglowsignal. if such a delayed emission, with the characteristics of the earlyafterglow, will be detected it can be used both to prove the internal shockscenario as producing the grb, as well as to measure the initial lorentz factorof the relativistic flow. the reverse shock, at its peak, contains energy whichis comparable to that of the grb itself, but has a much lower temperature thanthat of the forward shock so it radiates at considerably lower frequencies. thereverse shock dominates the early optical emission, and an optical flashbrighter than 15th magnitude, is expected together with the forward shock peakat x-rays or $\gamma$-rays. if this optical flash is not observed, stronglimitations can be put on the baryonic contents of the relativistic shellderiving the grbs, leading to a magnetically dominated energy density.

astro-ph;9906503	linear polarization and proper motion in the afterglow of beamed grbs	we investigate the polarization and proper motion expected in a beamedgamma-ray burst's ejecta. we find that even if the magnetic field has welldefined orientation relative to the direction of motion of the shock, thepolarization is not likely to exceed 20%. taking into account the dynamics ofbeamed ejecta we find that the polarization rises and decays with peak aroundthe jet break time (when the lorentz factor of the flow is comparable to theinitial opening angle of the jet). interestingly, we find that when the offsetof the observer from the center of the beam is large enough, the polarizationas function of time has three peaks, and the polarization direction of themiddle peak is rotated by 90 degrees relative to the two other peaks. we alsoshow that some proper motion is expected, peaking around the jet break time.detection of both proper motion and the direction of polarization can determinewhich component of the magnetic field is the dominant.

astro-ph;9910241	optical flashes and radio flares in grbs afterglow: numerical study	the strong optical flash observed by rotse, as well as the radio flareassociated with grb 990123 can be attributed to the emission of the fireballejecta, initially heated by the reverse shock. we numerically study theevolution of an adiabatic relativistic fireball interacting with an ambientuniform medium, both in the initial energy transfer stage and in its lateevolution. it is shown that the blandford-mckee solution adequately describesthe evolution of the shocked shell quite early on and for as long as thefireball material has relativistic temperatures. in the case where the reverseshock is only mildly relativistic the shocked shell becomes cold almostimmediately and the evolution deviates from the blandford-mckee solution. wederive analytical expressions for the ejecta evolution in its cold regime. thissolution gives a good approximation to the numerical results. we estimate theradiation from the fireball ejecta using the numerical hydrodynamic evolutionin both cases: cold and hot shells. surprisingly, we find that both evolutionsgive rather similar light curves, decaying approximately as $t^{-2}$ in theoptical and peaking at about one day in the radio, even though thehydrodynamics is different.

0810.1525	levy flights of binary orbits due to impulsive encounters	we examine the evolution of an almost circular keplerian orbit interactingwith unbound perturbers. we calculate the change in eccentricity and angularmomentum that results from a single encounter, assuming the timescale for theinteraction is shorter than the orbital period. the orbital perturbations areincorporated into a boltzmann equation that allows for eccentricitydissipation. we present an analytic solution to the boltzmann equation thatdescribes the distribution of orbital eccentricity and relative inclination asa function of time. the eccentricity and inclination of the binary do notevolve according to a normal random walk but perform a levy flight. the slopeof the mass spectrum of perturbers dictates whether close gravitationalscatterings are more important than distant tidal ones. when close scatteringsare important, the mass spectrum sets the slope of the eccentricity andinclination distribution functions. we use this general framework to understandthe eccentricities of several kuiper belt systems: pluto, 2003 el 61, and eris.we use the model of tholen et al (2007) to separate the non-kepleriancomponents of the orbits of pluto's outer moons nix and hydra from the motionexcited by interactions with other kuiper belt objects. our distribution isconsistent with the observations of nix, hydra, and the satellites of 2003 el61 and eris. we address applications of this work to objects outside of thesolar system, such as extrasolar planets around their stars and millisecondpulsars.

0706.1079	co-orbital oligarchy	we present a systematic examination of the changes in semi-major axis causedby the mutual interactions of a group of massive bodies orbiting a central starin the presence of eccentricity dissipation. for parameters relevant to theoligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typicaleccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. interactions at impactparameters greater than several hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel eachother; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the hill radius, theprotoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwiseunperturbed. if the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by lessthan a hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing betweentheir neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. in theshear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feedingzones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. growth of the protoplanetsin the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration thatdepends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\sigma/\sigma$.early in the oligarchic phase, when $\sigma/\sigma$ is low, the spacing betweenrows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 hill radii wide, rather than the 10hill radii cited in the literature. it is likely that at the end of oligarchythe average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. in the outersolar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. in theinner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requiresmore giant impacts than previously estimated. this result provides additionalevidence that mars is not an untouched leftover from the oligarchic phase, butmust be composed of several oligarchs assembled through giant impacts.
