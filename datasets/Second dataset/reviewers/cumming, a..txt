0901.0314	the new intermediate long bursting source xte j1701-407	xte j1701-407 is a newly discovered x-ray transient source. in this work weinvestigate its flux variability and study the intermediate long and shortbursts discovered by swift on july 17, and 27, 2008, respectively. so far, onlyone intermediate long burst, with a duration of ~18 minutes and ten days latera short burst, have been recorded from xte j1701-407. we analyzed the publicavailable data from swift and rxte, and compared the observed properties of theintermediate long burst with theoretical ignition condition and light curves toinvestigate the possible nuclear burning processes. the intermediate long burstmay have exhibited a photospheric radius expansion, allowing us to derive thesource distance at 6.2 kpc assuming the empirically derived eddingtonluminosity for pure helium. the intermediate long burst decay was best fit byusing two exponential functions with e-folding times of \tau_1=40(3) s and\tau_2=221(9) s. the bursts occurred at a persistent luminosity ofl_{per}=8.3x10e36 erg/s. for the intermediate long burst the mass accretionrate per unit area onto the ns was \dot{m}=4x10e3 g/cm2/s, and the total energyreleased was e_{burst}=3.5x10e40 erg. this corresponds to an ignition columndepth of y_{ign}=1.8x10e9 g/cm2, for a pure helium burning. we find that theenergetics of this burst can be modeled in different ways, as (i) pure heliumignition, as the result of either pure helium accretion or depletion ofhydrogen by steady burning during accumulation, or (ii) as ignition of a thicklayer of hydrogen-rich material in a source with low metallicity. however,comparison of the burst duration with model light curves suggests that hydrogenburning plays a role during the burst, and therefore this source is a lowaccretion rate burster with a low metallicity in the accreted material.

0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

0909.3391	what ignites on the neutron star of 4u 0614+091?	[abridged] the lmxb 4u 0614+091 is a source of sporadic thermonuclear (typei) x-ray bursts. we find bursts with a wide variety of characteristics inserendipitous wide-field x-ray observations by eureca/watch, rxte/asm,bepposax/wfc, hete-2/fregate, integral/ibis/isgri, and swift/bat, as well aspointed observations by rxte/pca and hexte. most of them reach a peak flux of~15 crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a crab. one of the burstsshows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. this allows us toevaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. the burst durations are between10 sec to 5 min. however, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, afaint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. onevery long burst lasted for several hours. this superburst candidate wasfollowed by a normal type-i burst only 19 days later. this is, to ourknowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. a superburstin this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% l_edd. theintermediate-duration bursts occurred when 4u 0614+091's persistent emissionwas lowest and calm, and when bursts were infrequent (on average one everymonth to 3 months). the average burst rate increased significantly after thisperiod. the maximum average burst recurrence rate is once every week to 2weeks. the burst behaviour may be partly understood if there is at least anappreciable amount of helium present in the accreted material from the donorstar. if the system is an ultra-compact x-ray binary with a co white-dwarfdonor, as has been suggested, this is unexpected. if the bursts are powered byhelium, we find that the energy production per accumulated mass is about 2.5times less than expected for pure helium matter.

1003.2480	predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors	we present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types ofcompact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advancedversions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors ligo and virgo.astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a numberof assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. the mostconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binaryneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars inour galaxy. these yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per myr per milky wayequivalent galaxy (mweg), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 permyr per mweg to 1000 per myr per mweg. we convert coalescence rates intodetection rates based on data from the ligo s5 and virgo vsr2 science runs andprojected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. using the detectorsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02per year for initial ligo-virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between0.0002 and 0.2 per year. the likely binary neutron-star detection rate for theadvanced ligo-virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a rangebetween 0.4 and 400 per year.

1104.2712	beating the spin-down limit on gravitational wave emission from the vela  pulsar	we present direct upper limits on continuous gravitational wave emission fromthe vela pulsar using data from the virgo detector's second science run. theseupper limits have been obtained using three independent methods that assume thegravitational wave emission follows the radio timing. two of the methodsproduce frequentist upper limits for an assumed known orientation of the star'sspin axis and value of the wave polarization angle of, respectively,$1.9\ee{-24}$ and $2.2\ee{-24}$, with 95% confidence. the third method, underthe same hypothesis, produces a bayesian upper limit of $2.1\ee{-24}$, with 95%degree of belief. these limits are below the indirect {\it spin-down limit} of$3.3\ee{-24}$ for the vela pulsar, defined by the energy loss rate inferredfrom observed decrease in vela's spin frequency, and correspond to a limit onthe star ellipticity of $\sim 10^{-3}$. slightly less stringent results, butstill well below the spin-down limit, are obtained assuming the star's spinaxis inclination and the wave polarization angles are unknown.

1111.3978	millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations and thermonuclear bursts from  terzan 5: a showcase of burning regimes	we present a comprehensive study of the thermonuclear bursts and millihertzquasi-periodic oscillations (mhz qpos) from the neutron star (ns) transient and11 hz x-ray pulsar igr j17480-2446, located in the globular cluster terzan 5.the increase in burst rate that we found during its 2010 outburst, whenpersistent luminosity rose from 0.1 to 0.5 times the eddington limit, is inqualitative agreement with thermonuclear burning theory yet opposite to allprevious observations of thermonuclear bursts. thermonuclear bursts graduallyevolved into a mhz qpo when the accretion rate increased, and vice versa. themhz qpos from igr j17480-2446 resemble those previously observed in otheraccreting nss, yet they feature lower frequencies (by a factor ~3) and occurwhen the persistent luminosity is higher (by a factor 4-25). we find fourdistinct bursting regimes and a steep (close to inverse cubic) decrease of theburst recurrence time with increasing persistent luminosity. we compare thesefindings to nuclear burning models and find evidence for a transition betweenthe pure helium and mixed hydrogen/helium ignition regimes when the persistentluminosity was about 0.3 times the eddington limit. we also point out importantdiscrepancies between the observed bursts and theory, which predicts brighterand less frequent bursts, and suggest that an additional source of heat in thens envelope is required to reconcile the observed and expected burstproperties. we discuss the impact of ns magnetic field and spin on the expectednuclear burning regimes, in the context of this particular pulsar.

1304.1775	parameter estimation for compact binary coalescence signals with the  first generation gravitational-wave detector network	compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the mostpromising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. gravitationalradiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameterestimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detectioncandidate events. detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inferenceon several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location anddistance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.however, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of modelsdescribing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals addedeither in hardware or software to the data collected by the two ligoinstruments and the virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed tothe collaboration. we exemplify the ability to extract information about thesource physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameterspace over the individual mass range 1 msun - 25 msun and the full range ofspin parameters. the cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of thestatus of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanceddetectors.

1306.1776	a change in the quiescent x-ray spectrum of the neutron star low-mass  x-ray binary mxb 1659-29	the quasi-persistent neutron star low-mass x-ray binary mxb 1659-29 went intoquiescence in 2001, and we have followed its quiescent x-ray evolution since.observations over the first 4 years showed a rapid drop in flux and temperatureof the neutron star atmosphere, interpreted as cooling of the neutron starcrust which had been heated during the 2.5 year outburst. however, observationstaken approximately 1400 and 2400 days into quiescence were consistent witheach other, suggesting the crust had reached thermal equilibrium with the core.here we present a new chandra observation of mxb 1659-29 taken 11 years intoquiescence and 4 years since the last chandra observation. this new observationshows an unexpected factor of ~3 drop in count rate and change in spectralshape since the last observation, which cannot be explained simply by continuedcooling. two possible scenarios are that either the neutron star temperaturehas remained unchanged and there has been an increase in the column density,or, alternatively the neutron star temperature has dropped precipitously andthe spectrum is now dominated by a power-law component. the first scenario maybe possible given that mxb 1659-29 is a near edge-on system, and an increase incolumn density could be due to build-up of material in, and a thickening of, atruncated accretion disk during quiescence. but, a large change in disk heightmay not be plausible if standard accretion disk theory holds during quiescence.alternatively, the disk may be precessing, leading to a higher column densityduring this latest observation.

1308.3859	characterization of the gaseous companion {\kappa} andromedae b: new  keck and lbti high-contrast observations	we previously reported the direct detection of a low mass companion at aprojected separation of 55+-2 au around the b9 type star {\kappa} andromedae.the properties of the system (mass ratio, separation) make it a benchmark forthe understanding of the formation and evolution of gas giant planets and browndwarfs on wide-orbits. we present new angular differential imaging (adi) imagesof the kappa andromedae system at 2.146 (ks), 3.776 (l'), 4.052 (nb 4.05) and4.78 {\mu}m (m') obtained with keck/nirc2 and lbti/lmircam, as well as moreaccurate near-infrared photometry of the star with the mimir instrument. wederive a more accurate j = 15.86 +- 0.21, h = 14.95 +- 0.13, ks = 14.32 +- 0.09mag for {\kappa} and b. we redetect the companion in all our high contrastobservations. we confirm previous contrasts obtained at ks and l' band. wederive nb 4.05 = 13.0 +- 0.2 and m' = 13.3 +- 0.3 mag and estimatelog10(l/lsun) = -3.76 +- 0.06. we build the 1-5 microns spectral energydistribution of the companion and compare it to seven phoenix-based atmosphericmodels in order to derive teff = 1900+100-200 k. models do not set constrainson the surface gravity. ``hot-start" evolutionary models predict masses of14+25-2 mjup based on the luminosity and temperature estimates, and consideringa conservative age range for the system (30+120-10 myr). ``warm-start"evolutionary tracks constrain the mass to m &gt;= 11 mjup. therefore, the mass of{\kappa} andromedae b mostly falls in the brown-dwarf regime, due to remaininguncertainties in age and mass-luminosity models. according to the formationmodels, disk instability in a primordial disk could account for the positionand a wide range of plausible masses of {\kappa} and b.

1311.7004	hall effect in neutron star crusts: evolution, endpoint and dependence  on initial conditions	we present new simulations of the evolution of axially symmetric magneticfields in neutron star crusts under the influence of the hall effect andsubdominant ohmic dissipation. in the hall effect, differential rotation of theelectron fluid generates toroidal field by winding of the poloidal field. forthis reason, we focus on the influence of the initial choice of the electronangular velocity profile on the subsequent and long term magnetic evolution.whereas previous simulations have generally chosen angular velocitiesincreasing outwards, corresponding to the lowest order ohmic mode in the crust,a more realistic choice is an angular velocity decreasing outwards,corresponding to the mhd equilibrium field that is likely present at the timeof crust formation. we find that the evolution passes through three basicphases. the early evolution is a response to the initial conditions. during thesecond phase the field consists of poloidal and toroidal components whicheventually relax to an isorotation state in which the angular velocity of theelectrons becomes constant along poloidal magnetic field lines, causing hallevolution to saturate. in the third phase the field dissipates slowly whilemaintaining isorotation. we discuss the implications for the long term fieldstructure and observable properties of isolated neutron stars.

1312.5234	the cooling rate of neutron stars after thermonuclear shell flashes	thermonuclear shell flashes on neutron stars are detected as bright x-raybursts. traditionally, their decay is modeled with an exponential function.however, this is not what theory predicts. the expected functional form forluminosities below the eddington limit, at times when there is no significantnuclear burning, is a power law. we tested the exponential and power-lawfunctional forms against the best data available: bursts measured with thehigh-throughput proportional counter array (pca) on board the rossi x-raytiming explorer. we selected a sample of 35 'clean' and ordinary (i.e., shorterthan a few minutes) bursts from 14 different neutron stars that 1) show a largedynamic range in luminosity, 2) are the least affected by disturbances by theaccretion disk and 3) lack prolonged nuclear burning through the rp-process. wefind indeed that for every burst a power law is a better description than anexponential function. we also find that the decay index is steep, 1.8 onaverage, and different for every burst. this may be explained by contributionsfrom degenerate electrons and photons to the specific heat capacity of theignited layer and by deviations from the stefan-boltzmann law due to changes inthe opacity with density and temperature. detailed verification of thisexplanation yields inconclusive results. while the values for the decay indexare consistent, changes of it with the burst time scale, as a proxy of ignitiondepth, and with time are not supported by model calculations.

1403.2385	probing the crust of the neutron star in exo 0748-676	x-ray observations of quiescent x-ray binaries have the potential to provideinsight into the structure and the composition of neutron stars. exo 0748-676had been actively accreting for over 24 yr before its outburst ceased in late2008. subsequent x-ray monitoring revealed a gradual decay of the quiescentthermal emission that can be attributed to cooling of the accretion-heatedneutron star crust. in this work, we report on new chandra and swiftobservations that extend the quiescent monitoring to ~5 yr post-outburst. wefind that the neutron star temperature remained at ~117 ev between 2009 and2011, but had decreased to ~110 ev in 2013. this suggests that the crust hasnot fully cooled yet, which is supported by the lower temperature of ~95 evthat was measured ~4 yr prior to the accretion phase in 1980. comparing thedata to thermal evolution simulations reveals that the apparent lack of coolingbetween 2009 and 2011 could possibly be a signature of convection driven byphase separation of light and heavy nuclei in the outer layers of the neutronstar.

1406.3640	hall drift and the braking indices of young pulsars	braking index measurements of young radio pulsars are all smaller than thevalue expected for spin down by magnetic dipole braking. we investigatemagnetic field evolution in the neutron star crust due to hall drift as anexplanation for observed braking indices. using numerical simulations and asemi-analytic model, we show that a $\approx 10^{14}\ {\rm g}$ quadrupolartoroidal field in the neutron star crust at birth leads to growth of the dipolemoment at a rate large enough to agree with measured braking indices. a keyfactor is the density at which the crust yields to magnetic stresses that buildup during the evolution, which sets a characteristic minimum hall timescale.the observed braking indices of pulsars with inferred dipole fields of$\lesssim 10^{13}\ {\rm g}$ can be explained in this picture, although with asignificant octupole component needed in some cases. for the stronger fieldpulsars, those with $b_d\gtrsim 10^{13}\ {\rm g}$, we find that the magneticstresses in the crust exceed the maximum shear stress before the pulsar reachesits current age, likely quenching the hall effect. this may have implicationsfor the magnetar activity seen in the high magnetic field radio pulsarpsr~j1846-0258. observations of braking indices may therefore be a new piece ofevidence that neutron stars contain subsurface toroidal fields that aresignificantly stronger than the dipole field, and may indicate that the halleffect is important in a wider range of neutron stars than previously thought.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1412.0605	a directed search for gravitational waves from scorpius x-1 with initial  ligo	we present results of a search for continuously-emitted gravitationalradiation, directed at the brightest low-mass x-ray binary, scorpius x-1. oursemi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of ligo s5 data ranging from 50-550 hz,and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\mathcal{f}$-statistic powerdistributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. all candidates notremoved at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% falsealarm rate. we present bayesian 95% confidence upper limits ongravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: astandard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of scorpiusx-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagneticobservations. median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at150 hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. this proofof principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknowneffects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, butimproves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.

1505.01862	neutron star crust cooling in the terzan 5 x-ray transient swift  j174805.3-244637	when neutron stars reside in transient x-ray binaries, their crustal layersbecome heated during accretion outbursts and subsequently cool in quiescence.observing and modeling this thermal response has yielded valuable insight intothe physics of neutron star crusts. however, one unresolved problem is theevidence in several neutron stars for an extra energy source, located atshallow depth in the crust, that is not accounted for by standard heatingmodels. its origin remains puzzling, and it is currently unclear whether thisadditional heating occurs in all neutron stars, and if the magnitude is alwaysthe same. here, we report on chandra observations that cover two years afterthe 2012 outburst of the transient neutron star x-ray binary swiftj174805.3-244637 in the globular cluster terzan 5. the temperature of theneutron star was elevated during the first two months following its ~8 weekaccretion episode, but had decayed to the pre-outburst level within ~100 days.interpreting this as rapid cooling of the accretion-heated crust, we model theobserved temperature curve with a thermal evolution code. we find that there isno need to invoke shallow heating for this neutron star, although an extraenergy release up to ~1.4 mev/nucleon is allowed by the current data (2-sigmaconfidence). we also present two new data points on the crust cooling curve ofthe 11-hz x-ray pulsar igr j17480-2446 in terzan 5, which was active in 2010.the temperature of this neutron star remained significantly above itspre-outburst level, but we detect no temperature change since the previousmeasurements of 2013 february. this is consistent with the slower coolingexpected several years post-outburst.

1508.06629	the imprint of carbon combustion on a superburst from the accreting  neutron star 4u 1636-536	superbursts are hours-long x-ray flares attributed to the thermonuclearrunaway burning of carbon-rich material in the envelope of accreting neutronstars. by studying the details of the x-ray light curve, properties of carboncombustion can be determined. in particular, we show that the shape of the riseof the light curve is set by the the slope of the temperature profile leftbehind by the carbon flame. we analyse rxte/pca observations of 4u 1636-536 andseparate the direct neutron star emission from evolving photoionized reflectionand persistent spectral components. this procedure results in the highestquality light curve ever produced for the superburst rise and peak, andinteresting behaviour is found in the tail. the rising light curve between 100and 1000 seconds is inconsistent with the idea that the fuel burned locally andinstantaneously everywhere, as assumed in some previous models. by fittingimproved cooling models, we measure for the first time the radial temperatureprofile of the superbursting layer. we find $d\ln t/d\ln p=1/4$. furthermore,20% of the fuel may be left unburned. this gives a new constraint on models ofcarbon burning and propagation in superbursts.

1510.03474	a search of the orion spur for continuous gravitational waves using a  "loosely coherent" algorithm on data from ligo interferometers	we report results of a wideband search for periodic gravitational waves fromisolated neutron stars within the orion spur towards both the inner and outerregions of our galaxy. as gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter,the search is unimpeded by dust and concentrations of stars. one search disk(a) is $6.87^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$20^\textrm{h}10^\textrm{m}54.71^\textrm{s}+33^\circ33'25.29"$, and the other(b) is $7.45^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$8^\textrm{h}35^\textrm{m}20.61^\textrm{s}-46^\circ49'25.151"$. we explored thefrequency range of 50-1500 hz and frequency derivative from $0$ to $-5\times10^{-9}$ hz/s. a multi-stage, loosely coherent search program allowed probingmore deeply than before in these two regions, while increasing coherence lengthwith every stage.  rigorous followup parameters have winnowed initial coincidence set to only 70candidates, to be examined manually. none of those 70 candidates proved to beconsistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 95% confidencelevel upper limits were placed on continuous-wave strain amplitudes. near $169$hz we achieve our lowest 95% cl upper limit on worst-case linearly polarizedstrain amplitude $h_0$ of $6.3\times 10^{-25}$, while at the high end of ourfrequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of $3.4\times 10^{-24}$ forall polarizations and sky locations.

1510.03621	first low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals	in this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on virgo vsr2 andvsr4 data. the search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 hz and128 hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. the startingpoint was a set of short fast fourier transforms (fft), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. on each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the frequencyhough transform inan incoherent step. only coincident candidates among vsr2 and vsr4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. the criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer ffts followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. no evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint vsr2-vsr4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 hz and 128 hz. this is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 hz. we setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{hz}$.

astro-ph;0307425	models for type i x-ray bursts with improved nuclear physics	multi-zone models of type i x-ray bursts are presented that use an adaptivenuclear reaction network of unprecedented size, up to 1300 isotopes. sequencesof up to 15 bursts are followed for two choices of accretion rate andmetallicity. at 0.1 eddington (and 0.02 eddington for low metallicity),combined hydrogen-helium flashes occur. the rise times, shapes, and tails ofthese light curves are sensitive to the efficiency of nuclear burning atvarious waiting points along the rp-process path and these sensitivities areexplored. the bursts show "compositional inertia", in that their propertiesdepend on the fact that accretion occurs onto the ashes of previous burstswhich contain left-over hydrogen, helium and cno nuclei. this acts to reducethe sensitivity of burst properties to metallicity. for the accretion ratesstudied, only the first anomalous burst in one model produces nuclei as heavyas a=100, other bursts make chiefly nuclei with a~64. the amount of carbonremaining after hydrogen-helium bursts is typically &lt;1% by mass, and decreasesfurther as the ashes are periodically heated by subsequent bursts. at the loweraccretion rate of 0.02 eddington and solar metallicity, the bursts ignite in ahydrogen-free helium layer. at the base of this layer, up to 90% of the heliumhas already burned to carbon prior to the unstable ignition. thesehelium-ignited bursts have briefer, brighter light curves with shorter tails,very rapid rise times (&lt;0.1 s), and ashes lighter than the iron group.

astro-ph;0308122	periodic thermonuclear x-ray bursts from gs 1826-24 and the fuel  composition as a function of accretion rate	we analyze 24 type i x-ray bursts from gs 1826-24 observed by the rossi x-raytiming explorer between 1997 november and 2002 july. the bursts observedbetween 1997-98 were consistent with a stable recurrence time of 5.74 +/- 0.13hr. the persistent intensity of gs 1826-24 increased by 36% between 1997-2000,by which time the burst interval had decreased to 4.10 +/- 0.08 hr. in 2002july the recurrence time was shorter again, at 3.56 +/- 0.03 hr. the burstswithin each epoch had remarkably identical lightcurves over the full approx.150 s burst duration; both the initial decay timescale from the peak, and theburst fluence, increased slightly with the rise in persistent flux. thedecrease in the burst recurrence time was proportional to mdot^(-1.05+/-0.02)(where mdot is assumed to be linearly proportional to the x-ray flux), so thatthe ratio alpha between the integrated persistent and burst fluxes wasinversely correlated with mdot. the average value of alpha was 41.7 +/- 1.6.both the alpha value, and the long burst durations indicate that the hydrogenis burning during the burst via the rapid-proton (rp) process. the variation inalpha with mdot implies that hydrogen is burning stably between bursts,requiring solar metallicity (z ~ 0.02) in the accreted layer. we show thatsolar metallicity ignition models naturally reproduce the observed burstenergies, but do not match the observed variations in recurrence time and burstfluence. low metallicity models (z ~ 0.001) reproduce the observed trends inrecurrence time and fluence, but are ruled out by the variation in alpha. wediscuss possible explanations, including extra heating between bursts, or thatthe fraction of the neutron star covered by the accreted fuel increases withmdot.

astro-ph;0407083	superbursts at near-eddington mass accretion rates	models for superbursts from neutron stars involving carbon shell flashespredict that the mass accretion rate should be anywhere in excess of one tenthof the eddington limit. yet, superbursts have so far only been detected insystems for which the accretion rate is limited between 0.1 and 0.25 times thatlimit. the question arises whether this is a selection effect or an intrinsicproperty. therefore, we have undertaken a systematic study of data from thebepposax wide field cameras on the luminous source gx 17+2, comprising 10 msecof effective observing time on superbursts. gx 17+2 contains a neutron starwith regular type-i x-ray bursts and accretes matter within a few tens ofpercents of the eddington limit. we find four hours-long flares whichreasonably match superburst characteristics. two show a sudden rise (i.e.,faster than 10 s), and two show a smooth decay combined with spectralsoftening. the implied superburst recurrence time, carbon ignition column andquenching time for ordinary bursts are close to the predicted values. however,the flare decay time, fluence and the implied energy production of (2-4) x10^17 erg/g are larger than expected from current theory.

astro-ph;0506666	on the possibility of a helium white dwarf donor in the presumed  ultracompact binary 2s 0918-549	2s 0918-549 is a low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) with a low optical to x-rayflux ratio. probably it is an ultracompact binary with an orbital periodshorter than 60 min. such binaries cannot harbor hydrogen rich donor stars. aswith other (sometimes confirmed) ultracompact lmxbs, 2s 0918-549 is observed tohave a high neon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (juett et al. 2001) which has beenused to argue that the companion star is a co or one white dwarf. however,type-i x-ray bursts have been observed from several of these systems implyingthe presence of hydrogen or helium on the neutron star surface. in this paper,we argue that the companion star in 2s 0918-549 is a helium white dwarf wefirst present a type i x-ray burst from 2s 0918-549 with a long duration of 40minutes. we show that this burst is naturally explained by accretion of purehelium at the inferred accretion rate of ~0.01 times the eddington accretionrate. at higher accretion rates of ~0.1 eddington, hydrogen is required toexplain long duration bursts. however, at low rates the long duration is due tothe large amount of helium that accumulates prior to the burst. we show that itis possible to form a helium white dwarf donor in an ultracompact binary ifaccretion starts during the first ascent of the giant branch, when the core ismade of predominantly helium. furthermore, this scenario naturally explains thehigh neon-to-oxgen ratio, without requiring a co or one white dwarf companion.the only observational aspect of 2s 0918-549 that we cannot explain is theabsence of helium lines in the optical spectrum. model calculations of opticalaccretion disk spectra need to be carried out in order to obtain limits on thehelium abundance.

astro-ph;0605689	the superburst recurrence time in luminous persistent lmxbs	theory and observations favor stable helium burning as the most importantmeans to produce fuel for superbursts on neutron star surfaces. however, allknown superbursters exhibit unstable burning as well. this ambiguity promptedus to search for superbursts in data from the bepposax wide field cameras often luminous lmxbs, most of which do not exhibit normal type-i x-ray bursts. wefound no superbursts and determine a lower limit on the recurrence time whichvaries between 30 and 76 days (90% confidence). all recurrence time limitsexcept one are longer than the observed recurrence time for gx 17+2. thisdifference can be understood if the mass accretion rate in gx 17+2 is severaltens of percent higher than in the other sources; alternatively, the accretedmaterial in gx 17+2 might be hydrogen deficient, leading to larger carbonyields than in the other sources. we compare our results to the latest modelsof superbursts. as our search method is indiscriminate of the burst ignitionscenario, the recurrence time limits may also be applied to other bursts ofsimilar duration and brightness.

astro-ph;0701575	discovery of x-ray burst triplets in exo 0748-676	[abridged] type-i x-ray bursts are thermonuclear flashes that take place onthe surface of accreting neutron stars. the wait time between consecutivebursts is set by the time required to accumulate the fuel needed to trigger anew burst; this is at least one hour. sometimes secondary bursts are observed,approximately 10 min after the main burst. these short wait-time bursts are notyet understood. we observed the low-mass x-ray binary and x-ray burster exo0748-676 with xmm-newton for 158 h, during 7 uninterrupted observations lastingup to 30 h each. we detect 76 x-ray bursts. most remarkably, 15 of these burstsoccur in burst triplets, with wait times of 12 min between the three componentsof the triplet. we also detect 14 doublets with similar wait times between thetwo components of the doublet. the characteristics of the bursts indicate thatpossibly all bursts in this system are hydrogen-ignited, in contrast with mostother frequent x-ray bursters in which bursts are helium-ignited, butconsistent with the low mass accretion rate in exo 0748-676. possibly thehydrogen ignition is the determining factor for the occurrence of shortwait-time bursts.
