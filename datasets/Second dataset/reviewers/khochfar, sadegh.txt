0901.4555	on the formation of massive galaxies: a simultaneous study of number  density, size and intrinsic colour evolution in goods	the evolution of number density, size and intrinsic colour is determined fora volume-limited sample of visually classified early-type galaxies selectedfrom the hst/acs images of the goods north and south fields (version 2). thesample comprises 457 galaxies over 320 arcmin2 with stellar masses above 3e10msun in the redshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2. our data allow a simultaneous study ofnumber density, intrinsic colour distribution and size. we find that the mostmassive systems (&gt;3e11 msun) do not show any appreciable change in comovingnumber density or size in our data. furthermore, when including the resultsfrom 2dfgrs, we find that the number density of massive early-type galaxies isconsistent with no evolution between z=1.2 and 0, i.e. over an epoch spanningmore than half of the current age of the universe. massive galaxies show veryhomogeneous **intrinsic** colour distributions, featuring red cores with smallscatter. the distribution of half-light radii -- when compared to z=0 and z&gt;1samples -- is compatible with the predictions of semi-analytic models relatingsize evolution to the amount of dissipation during major mergers. however, in amore speculative fashion, the observations can also be interpreted as weak oreven no evolution in comoving number density **and size** between 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2,thus pushing major mergers of the most massive galaxies towards lowerredshifts.

0903.3415	galaxy zoo: a sample of blue early-type galaxies at low redshift	we report the discovery of a population of nearby, blue early-type galaxieswith high star formation rates (0.5 &lt; sfr &lt; 50 msun/yr). they are identified bytheir visual morphology as provided by galaxy zoo for sdss dr6 and their u-rcolour. we select a volume-limited sample in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt;0.05, corresponding to luminosities of approximately l* and above, and with u-rcolours significantly bluer than the red sequence. we confirm the early-typemorphology of the objects in this sample and investigate their environmentaldependence and star formation properties. blue early-type galaxies tend to livein lower-density environments than `normal' red sequence early-types and makeup 5.7 +/-0.4% of the low-redshift early-type galaxy population. we find thatsuch blue early-type galaxies are virtually absent at high velocity dispersionsabove 200 km/s. our analysis uses emission line diganostic diagrams and we findthat ~25% of them are actively starforming, while another ~25% host both starformation and an agn. another ~12% are agn. the remaining 38% show no strongemission lines. when present and uncontaminated by an agn contribution, thestar formation is generally intense. we consider star formation rates derivedfrom halpha, u-band and infrared luminosities, and radial colour profiles, andconclude that the star formation is spatially extended. of those objects thatare not currently undergoing star formation must have ceased doing so recentlyin order to account for their blue optical colours. the gas phase metallicityof the actively starforming blue early-types galaxies is supersolar in allcases. we discuss the place of these objects in the context of galaxyformation. a catalogue of all 204 blue early-type galaxies in our sample,including star formation rates and emission line classification, is provided.

0906.5357	mergers and bulge formation in lambda-cdm: which mergers matter?	we use a suite of semi-empirical models to predict galaxy merger rates andcontributions to bulge growth as functions of merger mass, redshift, and massratio. the models use empirical halo occupation constraints to identifymergers, together with high-resolution simulations to quantify how mergers withdifferent properties contribute to the bulge population. we find good agreementwith a variety of observational constraints, and provide fitting functions formerger rates and contributions to bulge growth. we identify several robustconclusions. (1) major mergers dominate formation and assembly of l* bulges andthe spheroid mass density, minor mergers contribute ~30%. (2) this ismass-dependent: bulge formation is dominated by more minor mergers inlower-mass systems. at higher masses, bulges form in major mergers near l*, butsubsequently assemble in minor mergers. (3) the minor/major contribution isalso morphology-dependent: higher b/t systems form in more major mergers, lowerb/t systems form in situ from minor mergers. (4) low-mass galaxies, beinggas-rich, require more major mergers to reach the same b/t as high-masssystems. (5) absolute merger rates increase with galaxy mass. (6) predictedrates agree well with observations, but suggest that some morphology-selectedsamples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) predicted rates agreewith integrated growth in bulge mass with cosmic time, but with factor ~2uncertainty - half the bulge mass density could come from non-mergers. weconsider ~1000 model variations and quantify resulting uncertainties.conclusions regarding the major/minor contribution to bulge growth are veryrobust, absolute merger rates have systematic factor ~2 uncertainties.

1002.3394	further constraining galaxy evolution models through the size function  of sdss early-type galaxies	we discuss how the effective radius phi(re) function (erf) recently workedout by bernardi et al. (2009) represents a new testbed to improve the currentunderstanding of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. in particular, wehere show that a detailed hierarchical model of structure formation can broadlyreproduce the correct peak in the size distribution of local early-typegalaxies, although it significantly overpredicts the number of very compact andvery large galaxies. this in turn is reflected in the predicted size-massrelation, much flatter than the observed one, due to too large (~3 kpc)low-mass galaxies (&lt;10^11 \msun), and to a non-negligible fraction of compact(&lt; 0.5-1 kpc) and massive galaxies (&gt; 10^11 \msun). we also find that thelatter discrepancy is smaller than previously claimed, and limited to onlyultracompact (re &lt; 0.5 kpc) galaxies when considering elliptical-dominatedsamples. we explore several causes behind these effects. we conclude that theformer problem might be linked to the initial conditions, given that large andlow-mass galaxies are present at all epochs in the model. the survival ofcompact and massive galaxies might instead be linked to their very old ages andpeculiar merger histories. overall, knowledge of the galactic stellar mass {\emand} size distributions allows a better understanding of where and how toimprove models.

1004.2708	mergers in lambda-cdm: uncertainties in theoretical predictions and  interpretations of the merger rate	different methodologies lead to order-of-magnitude variations in predictedgalaxy merger rates. we examine and quantify the dominant uncertainties.different halo merger rates and subhalo 'destruction' rates agree to within afactor ~2 given proper care in definitions. if however (sub)halo masses are notappropriately defined or are under-resolved, the major merger rate can bedramatically suppressed. the dominant differences in galaxy merger rates owe tobaryonic physics. hydrodynamic simulations without feedback and older modelsthat do not agree with the observed galaxy mass function propagate factor ~5bias in the resulting merger rates. however, if the model matches the galaxymass function, properties of central galaxies are sufficiently converged togive small differences in merger rates. but variations in baryonic physics ofsatellites also have dramatic effects. the known problem of satellite'over-quenching' in most semi-analytic models (sams), whereby sam satellitesare too efficiently stripped of gas, could lead to order-of-magnitudeunder-estimates of merger rates for low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. fixing thesatellite properties to observations tends to predict higher merger rates, butwith factor ~2 empirical uncertainties. choice of mass ratio definitionmatters: at low masses, most true major mergers (in baryonic/dynamical galaxymass) will appear to be minor mergers in their stellar or luminosity massratio. observations and models using these criteria may underestimate majormerger rates by factors ~5. orbital parameters and gas fractions also introducefactor ~3 differences in amount of bulge formed by mergers, even for fixed massratio encounters.

1007.1463	the specific star formation rate of high redshift galaxies: the case for  two modes of star formation	we study the specific star formation rate (ssfr) and its evolution at$z\gtsim 4$, in models of galaxy formation, where the star formation is drivenby cold accretion flows. we show that constant star formation and feedbackefficiencies cannot reproduce the observed trend of ssfr with stellar mass andits observed lack of evolution at $z&gt;4$. model galaxies with $\log(m_*) \ltsim9.5$ m$_{\odot}$ show systematically lower specific star formation rates byorders of magnitudes, while massive galaxies with m$_* \gtsim 5 \times 10^{10}$m$_{\odot}$ have up to an order of magnitude larger ssfrs, compared to recentobservations by stark et al.. to recover these observations we apply anempirical star formation efficiency in galaxies that scales with the host halovelocity dispersion as $\propto 1/\sigma^3$ during galaxy mergers. we find thatthis modification needs to be of stochastic nature to reproduce theobservations, i.e. only applied during mergers and not during accretion drivenstar formation phases. our choice of star formation efficiency during mergersallows us to capture both, the boost in star formation at low masses and thequenching at high masses, and at the same time produce a constant ssfr-stellarmass relation at $z\gtsim 4$ under the assumption that most of the observedgalaxies are in a merger triggered star formation phase. our results suggestthat observed high-z low mass galaxies with high ssfrs are likely to befrequently interacting systems, which experienced bursts in their starformation rate and efficiency (mode 1), in contrast to low redshift $z \ltsim3$ galaxies which are cold accretion-regulated star forming systems with lowerstar formation efficiencies (mode 2).

1008.2757	asymmetries in extragalactic double radio sources: clues from 3d  simulations of jet - disc interaction	observational and theoretical studies of extragalactic radio sources havesuggested that an inhomogeneous environment may be responsible for observed armlength asymmetries of jets and the properties of extended emission line regionsin high redshift radio galaxies. we perform 3d hydrodynamic simulations of theinteraction of a powerful extragalactic bipolar jet with a disc-shaped clumpyinterstellar medium of log-normal density distribution and analyze theasymmetry. furthermore, we compute the relation between jet asymmetry and theism properties by means of monte carlo simulations based on a 1d propagationmodel for the jet through the dense medium. we find that the properties of theism can be related to a probability distribution of jet arm length asymmetries:disc density and height are found to have the largest effect on the asymmetryfor realistic parameter ranges, while the fourier energy spectrum of the ismand turbulent mach number only have a smaller effect. the hydrodynamicsimulations show that asymmetries generally may be even larger than expectedfrom the 1d model due to the complex interaction of the jet and its bow shockwith gaseous clumps, which goes much beyond simple energy disposal. from ourresults, observed asymmetries of medium-sized local radio galaxies may beexplained by gas masses of 10^9 to 10^10 solar masses in massive ellipticalgalaxies. furthermore, the simulations provide a theoretical basis for theobserved correlation that emission line nebulae are generally found to bebrighter on the side of the shorter lobe in high redshift radio galaxies(mccarthy et al. 1991). this interaction of jets with the cold gas phasesuggests that star formation in evolving high redshift galaxies may be affectedconsiderably by jet activity.

1011.3999	the interplay between chemical and mechanical feedback from the first  generation of stars	we study cosmological simulations of early structure formation, includingnon-equilibrium molecular chemistry, metal pollution from stellar evolution,transition from population iii (popiii) to population ii (popii) starformation, regulated by a given critical metallicity, and feedback effects. weinvestigate the properties of early metal spreading from the different stellarpopulations and its interplay with primordial molecular gas. we find that,independently of the details about popiii modeling, after the onset of starformation, regions enriched below the critical level are mostly found inisolated environments, while popii star formation regions are much moreclumped. typical star forming haloes show average sn driven outflow rates of upto 10^{-4} msun/yr in enriched gas, initially leaving the original starformation regions almost devoid of metals. the polluted material, which isgravitationally incorporated in over-dense environments on timescales of 10^7yr, is mostly coming from external, nearby star forming sites ("gravitationalenrichment"). in parallel, the pristine-gas inflow rates are between 10^{-3} -10^{-1} msun/yr. however, thermal feedback from sn generates turbulence anddestroys molecules within the pristine gas, and only the polluted material,incorporated via gravitational enrichment, can continue to cool by atomic metalfine-structure transitions on time scales short enough to end the initialpopiii regime within less than 10^8 yr.

1011.4091	suppression of accretion onto low-mass population iii stars	motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that a substantial fractionof population (pop) iii stars may have had masses low enough for them tosurvive to the present day, we consider the role that the accretion ofmetal-enriched gas may have had in altering their surface composition, therebydisguising them as pop ii stars. we demonstrate that if weak, solar-like windsare launched from low-mass pop iii stars formed in the progenitors of the darkmatter halo of the galaxy, then such stars are likely to avoid significantenrichment via accretion of material from the interstellar medium. we find thatat early times accretion is easily prevented if the stars are ejected from thecentral regions of the haloes in which they form, either by dynamicalinteractions with more massive pop iii stars, or by violent relaxation duringhalo mergers. while accretion may still take place during passage throughsufficiently dense molecular clouds at later times, we find that theprobability of such a passage is generally low (&lt; 0.1), assuming that starshave velocities of order the maximum circular velocity of their host haloes andaccounting for the orbital decay of merging haloes. in turn, due to the highergas density required for accretion onto stars with higher velocities, we findan even lower probability of accretion (~ 0.01) for the subset of pop iii starsformed at z &gt; 10, which are more quickly incorporated into massive haloes thanstars formed at lower redshift. while there is no a priori reason to assumethat low-mass pop iii stars do not have solar-like winds, without them surfaceenrichment via accretion is likely to be inevitable. we briefly discuss theimplications that our results hold for stellar archaeology.

1012.4584	the impact of gas stripping and stellar mass loss on satellite galaxy  evolution	current semi-analytic models (sams) of galaxy formation over-predict thefraction of passive small late-type satellite galaxies in dense environments bya factor of two to three. we hypothesize that this is due to inaccurateprescriptions on cold gas evolution. in the hope of solving this problem weapply detailed prescriptions on the evolution of diffuse hot gases insatellites and on stellar mass loss, both of which are critical to model coldgas evolution. we replace the conventional shock-heating motivated instantstripping with a realistic gradual prescription based on ram pressure and tidalstripping. we also carefully consider stellar mass loss in our model. when bothmechanisms are included, the fraction of passive late types matches the datamuch more closely. the satellite over-quenching problem is still present insmall galaxies in massive haloes, however. in terms of the detectable residualstar formation rates, gradual diffuse gas stripping appears to be much moreimportant than stellar mass loss in our model. the implications of theseresults and other possibilities, such as redshift-dependent merging geometryand tidal disruption, are also discussed.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1103.3272	a tale of two populations: the stellar mass of central and satellite  galaxies	we develop a new empirical methodology to study the relation between thestellar mass of galaxies and the mass of their host subhaloes. our approach issimilar to abundance matching, and is based on assigning a stellar mass to eachsubhalo within a large cosmological n-body simulation. however, wesignificantly extend the method to include a different treatment for centraland satellite galaxies, allowing the stellar mass of satellite galaxies todepend on both the host subhalo mass, and on the halo mass. unlike in previousstudies, our models are constrained by two observations: the stellar massfunction of galaxies, and their auto-correlation functions (cfs). we presentresults for ~10^6 different successful models, showing that the uncertainty inthe host subhalo mass reaches a factor of ~10 for a given stellar mass. ourresults thus indicate that the host subhalo mass of central and satellitegalaxies is poorly constrained by using information coming solely from theabundance and cfs of galaxies. in addition, we demonstrate that the fraction ofstellar mass relative to the universal baryon fraction can vary betweendifferent models, and can reach ~0.6 for a specific population of low massgalaxies. we conclude that additional observational constraints are needed, inorder to better constrain the mass relation between haloes and galaxies. thesemight include weak lensing, satellite kinematics, or measures of clusteringother than the cfs. moreover, cfs based on larger surveys with a betterestimate of the systematic uncertainties are needed.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1105.3207	the contribution of supernovae to cosmic reionization	while stars are widely discussed as the source of the high energy photonswhich reionized the universe, an additional source of ionizing photons thatmust also contribute to reionization in this scenario is the supernovae (sne)which mark the end of the life of massive stars. here we estimate the relativecontributions of sne and stars to reionization. while the rate at whichionizing photons are produced in sn shocks is well below that at which they areproduced by stars, the harder spectra of radiation emitted from sne leads to anenhanced escape fraction of sn generated photons relative to that of stellarphotons. in particular, along a given line of sight out of a galaxy, we findthat for neutral hydrogen column densities n_h &gt;~10^18 cm^-2 the contributionto reionization from sne is greater than that from stars. drawing on theresults of simulations presented in the literature, we find that the overall(line of sight-averaged) sne shock-generated ionizing photon escape fraction islarger than the stellar photon escape fraction by a factor of \simeq 4 to\simeq 7, depending on the metallicity of the stellar population. overall, ourresults suggest that the effect of sne is an enhancement of up to ~ 10 percentin the fraction of hydrogen reionized by stellar sources. we briefly discussthe implications of our results for the population of galaxies responsible forreionization.

1105.4076	the atlas3d project - vi. simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the  link with fast rotators, slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies through mergers with a sampleof 70 high-resolution (softening length &lt; 60 pc and 12*10^6 particles)numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies and 16 simulations ofetg remergers. these simulations, designed to accompany observations and modelsconducted within the atlas3d project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. the progenitor discgalaxies are spiral-like with bulge to disc ratios typical of sb and scgalaxies. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the atlas3dcriterion (based on the lambda_r parameter): they preserve the structure of theinput fast rotating spiral progenitors. they have intrinsic ellipticitieslarger than 0.5, cover intrinsic lambda_r values between 0.2 and 0.6, withinthe range of observed fast rotators. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the fast rotators produced inmajor mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities between 0.4 and0.6. most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. besides a handful ofspecific observed systems -- the counter-rotating discs (2-sigma galaxies) --these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators inthe nearby universe. the mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamentalparameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but italso requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (sb) progenitor galaxywith respect to the orbital angular momentum.

1107.0002	the atlas3d project - x. on the origin of the molecular and ionised gas  in early-type galaxies	we make use of interferometric co and hi observations, and opticalintegral-field spectroscopy to probe the origin of the molecular and ionisedinterstellar medium (ism) in local early-type galaxies (etgs). we find that36\pm5% of our sample of fast rotating etgs have their ionised gaskinematically misaligned with respect to the stars, setting a strong lowerlimit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and coldaccretion). slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicatingthat the dominant source of gas is external. the molecular, ionised and atomicgas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even whenthey are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases ofthe ism share a common origin. in addition, we find that the origin of the coldand warm gas in fast-rotating etgs is strongly affected by environment, despitethe molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent ofgroup/cluster membership. galaxies in dense groups and the virgo cluster nearlyalways have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellarkinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin. in the field, however,kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicatethat &gt;46% of local fast-rotating etgs have their gas supplied from externalsources. we discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmentaldichotomy, but find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematicmisalignment difference and the constant detection rate. furthermore, ourresults suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factorassociated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotatinggalaxies in our sample (m_k&lt;-24 mag; stellar mass of &gt;8x10^10 msun) alwayshaving kinematically aligned gas.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1109.6323	the road to the red sequence: a detailed view of the formation of a  massive galaxy at z~2	(abridged) we present here a detailed analysis of the star formation history(sfh) of fw4871, a massive galaxy at z=1.893+-0.002. we compare rest-frameoptical and nuv slitless grism spectra from the hubble space telescope with alarge set of composite stellar populations to constrain the underlying starformation history. even though the morphology features prominent tidal tails,indicative of a recent merger, there is no sign of on-going star formationwithin an aperture encircling one effective radius, which corresponds to aphysical extent of 2.6 kpc. a model assuming truncation of an otherwiseconstant sfh gives a formation epoch zf~10, with a truncation after 2.7 gyr,giving a mass-weighted age of 1.5 gyr and a stellar mass of 0.8-3e11msun,implying star formation rates of 30-110 msun/yr. a more complex model includinga recent burst of star formation places the age of the youngest component at145 myr, with a mass contribution lower than 20%, and a maximum amount of dustreddening of e(b-v)&lt;0.4 mag (95% confidence levels). this low level of dustreddening is consistent with the low emission observed at 24 micron,corresponding to rest-frame 8 micron, where pah emission should contributesignificantly if a strong formation episode were present. the colour profile offw4871 does not suggest a significant radial trend in the properties of thestellar populations out to 3re. we suggest that the recent merger that formedfw4871 is responsible for the quenching of its star formation.

1110.0493	the imprint of cosmological non-gaussianities on primordial structure  formation	we study via numerical n-body/sph chemistry simulations the effects ofprimordial non-gaussianities on the formation of the first stars and galaxies,and investigate the impact of supernova feedback in cosmologies with differentfnl. density distributions are biased to higher values, so star formation andthe consequent feedback processes take place earlier in high-fnl models andlater in low-fnl ones. mechanical feedback is responsible for shocking andevacuating the gas from star forming sites earlier in the highly non-gaussiancases, because of the larger bias at high densities. chemical feedbacktranslates into high-redshift metal filling factors that are larger by someorders of magnitude for larger fnl, but that converge within one gyr, for bothpopulation iii and population ii-i stellar regimes. the efficient enrichmentprocess, though, leads to metallicities &gt; 0.01 zsun by redshift ~9, almostindependently from fnl. the impact of non-gaussianities on the formation ofdark-matter haloes at high redshift is directly reflected in the properties ofthe gas in these haloes, as models with larger fnl show more concentrated gasprofiles at early times. non-gaussian signatures in the gas behaviour are lostafter the first feedback takes place and introduces a significant degree ofturbulence and chaotic motions.

1111.4478	jet-induced star formation in gas-rich galaxies	feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) has become a major component insimulations of galaxy evolution, in particular for massive galaxies. agn jetshave been shown to provide a large amount of energy and are capable ofquenching cooling flows. their impact on the host galaxy, however, is still notunderstood. subgrid models of agn activity in a galaxy evolution context so farhave been mostly focused on the quenching of star formation. to shed more lighton the actual physics of the "radio mode" part of agn activity, we haveperformed simulations of the interaction of a powerful agn jet with the massivegaseous disc (10^11 solar masses) of a high-redshift galaxy. we spatiallyresolve both the jet and the clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium (ism) andinclude an explicit star formation model in the simulation. following thesystem over more than 10^7 years, we find that the jet activity excavates thecentral region, but overall causes a significant change to the shape of thedensity probability distribution function and hence the star formation rate dueto the formation of a blast wave with strong compression and cooling in theism. this results in a ring- or disc-shaped population of young stars. at latertimes, the increase in star formation rate also occurs in the disc regionsfurther out since the jet cocoon pressurizes the ism. the total mass of theadditionally formed stars may be up to 10^10 solar masses for one duty cycle.we discuss the details of this jet-induced star formation (positive feedback)and its potential consequences for galaxy evolution and observable signatures.

1201.0885	simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the link with fast rotators,  slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies (etgs) through mergers with asample of 70 high-resolution numerical simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies. these simulations encompass various mass ratios, initial conditionsand orbital parameters. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with massratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators accordingto the atlas3d criterion: they preserve the structure of the input fastrotating spiral progenitors. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1)lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the slow rotators hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. the mass ratio of theprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators inbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitorgalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. the importance of theinitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxymergers of the galmer project.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.1670	the first billion years project - iv: proto-galaxies reionising the  universe	the contribution of stars in galaxies to cosmic reionisation depends on thestar formation history in the universe, the abundance of galaxies duringreionisation, the escape fraction of ionising photons and the clumping factorof the inter-galactic medium (igm). we compute the star formation rate andclumping factor during reionisation in a cosmological volume using ahigh-resolution hydrodynamical simulation. we post-process the output withdetailed radiative transfer simulations to compute the escape fraction ofionising photons. together, this gives us the opportunity to assess thecontribution of galaxies to reionisation self-consistently. the strong mass andredshift dependence of the escape fraction indicates that reionisation occurredbetween z=15 and z=10 and was mainly driven by proto-galaxies forming indark-matter haloes with masses between 1e7 and 1e8 solar mass. more massivegalaxies that are rare at these redshifts and have significantly lower escapefractions contribute less photons to the reionisation process than themore-abundant low-mass galaxies. star formation in the low-mass haloes issuppressed by radiative feedback from reionisation, therefore theseproto-galaxies only contribute when the part of the universe they live in isstill neutral. after z~10, massive galaxies become more abundant and providemost of the ionising photons. in addition, we find that population (pop) iiistars are too short-lived and not frequent enough to have a major contributionto reionisation. although the stellar component of the proto-galaxies thatproduce the bulk of ionising photons during reionisation is too faint to bedetected by the james webb space telescope (jwst), these sources are brightestin the h-alpha and ly-alpha recombination lines, which will likely be detectedby jwst in deep surveys.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1212.2630	the atlas 3d project - xvi. physical parameters and spectral line energy  distributions of the molecular gas in gas-rich early-type galaxies	[abridged] we present a detailed study of the physical properties of themolecular gas in a sample of 18 molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies (etgs)from the atlas$ 3d sample. our goal is to better understand the star formationprocesses occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the densestar-forming gas. we use existing integrated $^{12}$co(1-0, 2-1),$^{13}$co(1-0, 2-1), hcn(1-0) and hco$^{+}$(1-0) observations and present new$^{12}$co(3-2) single-dish data. from these, we derive for the first time theaverage kinetic temperature, h$_{2}$ volume density and column density of theemitting gas, this using a non-lte theoretical model. since the co lines tracedifferent physical conditions than of those the hcn and hco$^{+}$ lines, thetwo sets of lines are treated separately. we also compare for the first timethe predicted co spectral line energy distributions (sleds) and gas propertiesof our molecular gas-rich etgs with those of a sample of nearby well-studieddisc galaxies. the gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 etgs appearanalogous to those in the centre of the milky way. such results have never beenobtained before for etgs and open a new window to explore furtherstar-formation processes in the universe. the conclusions drawn shouldnevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number ofobservations and on a simple model. in the near future, with higher cotransition observations, it should be possible to better identify the variousgas components present in etgs, as well as more precisely determine theirassociated physical conditions. to achieve these goals, we show here from ourtheoretical study, that mid-j co lines (such as the $^{12}$co(6-5) line) areparticularly useful.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1302.6996	unravelling obese black holes in the first galaxies	we predict the existence and observational signatures of a new class ofobjects that assembled early, during the first billion years of cosmic time:obese black-hole galaxies (obgs). obgs are objects in which the mass of thecentral black hole initially exceeds that of the stellar component of the hostgalaxy, and the luminosity from black-hole accretion dominates the starlight.from a cosmological simulation, we demonstrate that there are sites where starformation is initially inhibited and direct-collapse black holes (dcbhs) formdue to the photo-dissociating effect of lyman-werner radiation on molecularhydrogen. we show that the formation of obgs is inevitable, because theprobability of finding the required extra-galactic environment and the rightphysical conditions in a halo conducive to dcbh formation is quite high in theearly universe. we estimate an obg number density of 0.009/mpc^3 at z~8 and0.03/mpc^3 at z~6. extrapolating from our simulation volume, we infer that themost luminous quasars detected at z~6 likely transited through an earlier obgphase. we find that these primordial galaxies start off with an over-massive bhand acquire their stellar component from subsequent merging as well as in-situstar formation. in doing so, they inevitably go through an obg phase dominatedby the accretion luminosity at the eddington rate or below, released from thegrowing bh. the obg phase is characterised by an ultra-violet (uv) spectrumwith slope of beta ~ -2.3 and the absence of a balmer break. obgs should alsobe spatially unresolved, and are expected to be brighter than the majority ofknown high-redshift galaxies. obgs could potentially be revealed via hstfollow-up imaging of samples of brighter lyman-break galaxies provided bywide-area ground-based surveys such as ultravista, and should be easilyuncovered and studied with instruments aboard jwst...(abridged)

1311.1109	the first billion years project: dark matter haloes going from  contraction to expansion and back again	we study the effect of baryons on the inner dark matter profile of the firstgalaxies using the first billion years simulation between z=16-6 before secularevolution sets in. using a large statistical sample from two simulations of thesame volume and cosmological initial conditions, one with and one withoutbaryons, we are able to directly compare haloes with their baryon-freecounterparts, allowing a detailed study of the modifications to the dark matterdensity profile due to the presence of baryons during the first billion yearsof galaxy formation. for each of the ~ 5000 haloes in our sample we quantifythe impact of the baryons using eta, defined as the ratio of dark matter massenclosed in 100 pc in the baryonic run to its counterpart without baryons.during this epoch of rapid growth of galaxies, we find that many haloes ofthese first galaxies show an enhancement of dark matter in the halo centrecompared to the baryon-free simulation, while many others show a deficit. wefind that the mean value of eta is close to unity, but there is a largedispersion, with a standard deviation of 0.677. the enhancement is cyclical intime and tracks the star formation cycle of the galaxy; as gas falls to thecentre and forms stars, the dark matter moves in as well. supernova feedbackthen removes the gas, and the dark matter again responds to the changingpotential. we study three physical models relating the motion of baryons tothat of the dark matter: adiabatic contraction, dynamical friction, and rapidoutflows. abridged, see text for full abstract

1311.1225	angular momentum loss of primordial gas in lyman-alpha radiation field	we present results on the radiation drag exerted by an isotropic andhomogenous background of lya photons on neutral gas clouds orbiting within hiiregions around population iii stars of different masses. the doppler shiftcauses a frequency difference between photons moving in the direction of thecloud and opposite to it resulting in a net momentum loss of the cloud in thedirection of motion. we find that half of the angular momentum of gas withv_theta &lt;~ 20 km/s near (r &lt;~ 3 kpc) a population iii star of 120 msun at z=20is lost within ~ 10^6 yr. the radiation drag is a strong function of cloudvelocity that peaks at v ~ 20 km/s reflecting the frequency dependence of thephoton cross section. clouds moving with velocities larger than ~ 100 km/sloose their angular momentum on time scales of ~ 10^8 yr. at lower redshiftsradiation drag becomes inefficient as the lya photon density in hii regionsdecreases by a factor (1+z)^3 and angular momentum is lost on time scales &gt;10^8 yr even for low velocity clouds. our results suggest that a sweet spotexists for the loss of angular momentum by radiation drag for gas clouds at z &gt;10 and with v ~ 20 km/s. comparison to dynamical friction forces acting ontypical gas clouds suggest that radiation drag is the dominant effect impactingthe orbit. we propose that this effect can suppress the formation of extendedgas discs in the first galaxies and help gas accretion near galactic centresand central black holes.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1405.2081	the impact of reionization on the formation of supermassive black hole  seeds	direct collapse black holes (dcbhs) formed from the collapse ofatomically-cooled primordial gas in the early universe are strong candidatesfor the seeds of supermassive bhs. dcbhs are thought to form in atomic coolinghaloes in the presence of a strong molecule-dissociating, lyman-werner (lw)radiation field. given that star forming galaxies are likely to be the sourceof the lw radiation in this scenario, ionizing radiation from these galaxiesmay accompany the lw radiation. we present cosmological simulations resolvingthe collapse of primordial gas into an atomic cooling halo, including theeffects of both lw and ionizing radiation. we find that in cases where the gasis not self-shielded from the ionizing radiation, the collapse can be delayedby ~ 25 myr. when the ionized gas does collapse, the free electrons that arepresent catalyze h2 formation. in turn, h2 cooling becomes efficient in thecenter of the halo, and dcbh formation is prevented. we emphasize, however,that in many cases the gas collapsing into atomic cooling haloes at highredshift is self-shielding to ionizing radiation. therefore, it is only in afraction of such haloes in which dcbh formation is prevented due toreionization.

1407.4115	revised rate coefficients for h$_2$ and h$^-$ destruction by realistic  stellar spectra	understanding the processes that can destroy h$_2$ and h$^-$ species isquintessential in governing the formation of the first stars, black holes andgalaxies. in this study we compute the reaction rate coefficients for h$_2$photo--dissociation by lyman--werner photons ($11.2 - 13.6$ ev), and h$^-$photo--detachment by 0.76 ev photons emanating from self-consistent stellarpopulations that we model using publicly available stellar synthesis codes. sofar studies that include chemical networks for the formation of molecularhydrogen take these processes into account by assuming that the source spectracan be approximated by a power-law dependency or a black-body spectrum at10$^4$ or $10^5$ k. we show that using spectra generated from realistic stellarpopulation models can alter the reaction rates for photo-dissociation, $\rmk_{\rm{di}}$, and photo-detachment, $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$, significantly. inparticular, $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$ can be up to $\sim 2-4$ orders of magnitude lowerin the case of realistic stellar spectra suggesting that previous calculationshave over-estimated the impact that radiation has on lowering h$_2$ abundances.in contrast to burst modes of star formation, we find that models withcontinuous star formation predict increasing $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$ and $\rmk_{\rm{di}}$, which makes it necessary to include the star formation history ofsources to derive self-consistent reaction rates, and that it is not enough tojust calculate j$_{21}$ for the background. for models with constant starformation rate the change in shape of the spectral energy distribution leads toa non-negligible late-time contribution to $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$ and $\rmk_{\rm{di}}$, and we present self-consistently derived cosmological reactionrates based on star formation rates consistent with observations of the highredshift universe.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1504.07639	the first population ii stars formed in externally enriched mini-halos	we present a simulation of the formation of the earliest population ii stars,starting from cosmological initial conditions and ending when metals created inthe first supernovae are incorporated into a collapsing gas-cloud. this occursafter a supernova blast-wave collides with a nearby mini-halo, inducing furtherturbulence that efficiently mixes metals into the dense gas in the center ofthe halo. the gas that first collapses has been enriched to a metallicity of z~ 2e-5 zsun. due to the extremely low metallicity, collapse proceeds similarlyto metal-free gas until dust cooling becomes efficient at high densities,causing the cloud to fragment into a large number of low mass objects. thisexternal enrichment mechanism provides a plausible origin for the mostmetal-poor stars observed, such as smss j031300.36-670839.3, that appear tohave formed out of gas enriched by a single supernova. this mechanism operateson shorter timescales than the time for low-mass mini-halos (m &lt; 5e5 msun) torecover their gas after experiencing a supernova. as such, metal-enriched starswill likely form first via this channel if the conditions are right for it tooccur. we identify a number of other externally enriched halos that may formstars in this manner. these halos have metallicities as high as 0.01 zsun,suggesting that some members of the first generation of metal-enriched starsmay be hiding in plain sight in current stellar surveys.

(5) wecompare the results with predictions from a set of lcdm models. in the models,a high mass spiral can have a bulge with a present-day low b/t&lt;0.2 only if itdid not undergo a major merger since z&lt;2. the predicted fraction (~1.6%) ofhigh mass spirals, which have undergone a major merger since z&lt;4 and host abulge with a present-day low b/t&lt;0.2, is a factor of over thirty smaller thanthe observed fraction (~66%) of high mass spirals with b/t&lt;0.2. thus, contraryto common perception, bulges built via major mergers since z&lt;4 seriously failto account for the bulges present in ~66% of high mass spirals. most of thesepresent-day low b/t&lt;0.2 bulges are likely to have been built by a combinationof minor mergers and/or secular processes since z&lt;4.

astro-ph;0409705	on the origin of isophotal shapes in elliptical galaxies	using semi-analytical models of galaxy formation, the origin of boxy anddisky elliptical galaxies is investigated. we find that the simple scenario,motivated by n-body simulations, in which the isophotal shape is only dependenton the mass ratio of the last major merger, is not able to reproduce theobservation that the fraction of boxy and disky ellipticals depends on galaxyluminosity. the observations can however be reproduce with the followingreasonable assumptions: (i) equal-mass mergers lead to boxy ellipticals andunequal-mass mergers produce disky ellipticals (as motivated by n-bodysimulations) (ii) major mergers between bulge-dominated galaxies result alwaysin boxy ellipticals, independent of the mass ratio, (iii) merger remnants thatsubsequently accrete gas leading to a secondary stellar disk with more than $20%$ the total stellar fraction are always disky. boxy and disky ellipticals canbe divided into two subclasses, depending on their formation history. boxyellipticals either formed by equal mass mergers of disk galaxies or by majormergers of early-type galaxies. we find that disky ellipticals are indicatorsof unequal-mass mergers or late gas infall. disky ellipticals with highluminosities preferentially are 1-component systems that result from unequalmass mergers whereas low-luminosity disky ellipticals are more likely to harborsecondary disk components. in addition, the fraction of disky ellipticals withsecular disk components should increase in regions with higher galaxydensities. taking into account the conversion of cuspy cores into flatlow-density cores by black hole merging we find that disky ellipticals shouldcontain central density cusps whereas boxy ellipticals should in general becharacterized by flat cores.

astro-ph;0509667	properties of early-type, dry galaxy mergers and the origin of massive  elliptical galaxies	the luminosity dependence of kinematical and isophotal properties ofelliptical galaxies is investigated using numerical simulations of galaxymerging, combined with semi-analytical models of hierarchical structureformation. mergers of spiral galaxies as the only formation mechanism forelliptical galaxies can neither reproduce the kinematical and photometricproperties of very massive elliptical galaxies nor the change from rotationallyflattened disky to anisotropic boxy systems with increasing luminosity. wepresent numerical simulations showing that binary mergers of early-typegalaxies open an additional channel for the formation of anisotropic, slowlyrotating and boxy ellipticals. including this channel in a semi-analyticalmodel we can successfully reproduce the observed trend that more luminous giantellipticals are more boxy and less flattened by rotation. this trend can bestrengthened by suppressing residual gas infall and star formation for galaxieswith stellar bulge masses $m_* \geq 3 \times 10^{10} m_{\odot}$. hence wepropose that mergers of early-type galaxies play an important role for theassembly of massive elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0605436	a simple model for the size-evolution of elliptical galaxies	we use semi-analytical modelling of galaxy formation to predict theredshift-size-evolution of elliptical galaxies. using a simple model in whichrelative sizes of elliptical galaxies of a given mass correlate with thefraction of stars formed in a star burst during a major merger event, we areable to reproduce the observed size redshif t evolution. the size evolution isa result of the amount of cold gas available during the major merger. mergersat high redshifts are gas-rich and produce ellipticals with smaller sizes. inparticular we find a power-law relation between the sizes at differentredshifts, with the power-law index giving a measure of the relative amount ofdissipation during the mergers that lead to the formation of an elliptical. thesize evolution is found to be stronger for more massive galaxies as theyinvolve more gas at high redshifts when they form compared to less massiveellipticals. local ellipticals more massive than $5 \times 10^{11}$ m$_{\odot}$will be approximately 4 times larger than their counterparts at $z=2$. ourresults indicate that the scatter in the size of similar massive present dayelliptical galaxies is a result of their formation epoch, with smallerellipticals being formed earlier.
