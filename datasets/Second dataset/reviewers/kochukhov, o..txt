0903.3474	model atmospheres of chemically peculiar stars: self-consistent  empirical stratified model of hd24712	high-resolution spectra of some chemically peculiar stars clearly demonstratethe presence of strong abundance gradients in their atmospheres. however, theseinhomogeneities are usually ignored in the standard scheme of model atmospherecalculations, braking the consistency between model structure andspectroscopically derived abundance pattern. in this paper we present firstempirical self-consistent stellar atmosphere model of roap star hd24712, withstratification of chemical elements included, and which is derived directlyfrom the observed profiles of spectral lines without time-consuming simulationsof physical mechanisms responsible for these anomalies. we used the llmodelsstellar model atmosphere code and ddafit minimization tool for analysis ofchemical elements stratification and construction of self-consistentatmospheric model. empirical determination of pr and nd stratification in theatmosphere of hd24712 is based on nlte line formation for prii/iii and ndii/iiiwith the use of the detail code. based on iterative procedure of stratificationanalysis and subsequent re-calculation of model atmosphere structure weconstructed a self-consistent model of hd24712, i.e. the model whichtemperature-pressure structure is consistent with results of stratificationanalysis. it is shown that stratification of chemical elements leads to theconsiderable changes in model structure as to compare with non-stratifiedhomogeneous case. we find that accumulation of ree elements allows for theinverse temperature gradient to be present in upper atmosphere of the star withthe maximum temperature increase of about 600k.

0903.3512	a self-consistent empirical model atmosphere, abundance and  stratification analysis of the benchmark roap star alpha circini	chemically peculiar (cp) stars are unique natural laboratories forinvestigation of the microscopic diffusion processes of chemical elements. theelement segregation under the influence of gravity and radiation pressure leadsto the appearance of strong abundance gradients in the atmospheres of cp stars.consequently, the atmospheric temperature-pressure structure of these objectscould deviate significantly from the atmospheres of normal stars withhomogeneous abundances. in this study we performed a self-consistent, empiricalmodel atmosphere study of the brightest rapidly oscillating ap star alpha cir.we account for chemical stratification in the model atmosphere calculations andassess the importance of non-uniformed vertical element distribution on themodel structure, energy distribution and hydrogen line profiles. based on aniterative procedure of the chemical abundance analysis of 52 ions of 35elements, stratification modeling of 4 elements (si, ca, cr and fe) andsubsequent re-calculations of the atmospheric structure, we derived a new modelatmosphere of alpha cir, which is consistent with the inferred atmosphericchemistry of the star. we find teff=7500 k, logg=4.1, and demonstrate thatchemical stratification has a noticeable impact on the model structure andmodifies the formation of the hydrogen balmer lines. our spectroscopicallydetermined teff of alpha cir agrees with the fundamental effective temperatureof this star. this shows that temperatures inferred in detailed spectroscopicanalyses of cool magnetic cp stars are not affected by a large systematic bias.

0906.5269	the chemical abundance analysis of normal early a- and late b-type stars	modern spectroscopy of early-type stars often aims at studying complexphysical phenomena. comparatively less attention is paid to identifying andstudying the "normal" a- and b-type stars and testing how the basic atomicparameters and standard spectral analysis allow one to fit the observations. wewish to stablish whether the chemical composition of the solar photosphere canbe regarded as a reference for early a- and late b-type stars. we have obtainedoptical high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of three slowlyrotating early-type stars (hd 145788, 21 peg and pi cet) that show no obvioussign of chemical peculiarity, and performed a very accurate lte abundanceanalysis of up to 38 ions of 26 elements (for 21 peg), using a vast amount ofspectral lines visible in the spectral region covered by our spectra. weprovide an exhaustive description of the abundance characteristics of the threeanalysed stars with a critical review of the line parameters used to derive theabundances. we compiled a table of atomic data for more than 1100 measuredlines that may be used in the future as a reference. the abundances we obtainedfor he, c, al, s, v, cr, mn, fe, ni, sr, y, and zr are compatible with thesolar ones derived with recent 3d radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of thesolar photosphere. the abundances of the remaining studied elements show somedegree of discrepancy compared to the solar photosphere. those of n, na, mg,si, ca, ti, and nd may well be ascribed to non-lte effects; for p, cl, sc andco, non-lte effects are totally unknown; o, ne, ar, and ba show discrepanciesthat cannot be ascribed to non-lte effects. the discrepancies obtained for o(in two stars) and ne agree with very recent non-lte abundance analysis ofearly b-type stars in the solar neighbourhood.

0708.0289	pulsation tomography of rapidly oscillating ap stars. resolving the  third dimension in peculiar pulsating stellar atmospheres	we present detailed analysis of the vertical pulsation mode cross-section inten rapidly oscillating ap (roap) stars based on spectroscopic time-seriesobservations. the aim of this analysis is to derive from observations acomplete picture of how the amplitude and phase of magnetoacoustic waves dependon depth. we find common features in the pulsational behaviour of roap stars.within a sample of representative elements the lowest amplitudes are detectedfor eu ii (and fe in 33 lib and in hd 19918), then pulsations go through thelayers where halpha core, nd, and pr lines are formed. there rv amplitudereaches its maximum, and after that decreases in most stars. the maximum rv ofthe second ree ions is always delayed relative to the first ions. the largestphase shifts are detected in tb iii and th iii lines. pulsational variabilityof the th iii lines is detected here for the first time. the y ii lines deviatefrom this picture, showing even lower amplitudes than eu ii lines but half aperiod phase shift relative to other weakly pulsating lines. the roap starsexhibit similarity in the depth-dependence of pulsation phase and amplitude,indicating similar chemical stratification and comparable vertical modecross-sections. in general, pulsations waves are represented by a superpositionof the running and standing wave components. in the atmospheres of roap starswith the pulsation frequency below the acoustic cut-off frequency, pulsationshave a standing-wave character in the deeper layers and behave like a runningwave in the outer layers. cooler roap stars develop a running wave higher inthe atmosphere. in stars with pulsation frequency close to the acoustic cut-offone, pulsation waves have a running character starting from deep layers.(abridged)

1109.0328	revisiting the rigidly rotating magnetosphere model for sigma ori e. i.  observations and data analysis	we have obtained 18 new high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations ofthe b2vp star sigma ori e with both the narval and espadonsspectropolarimeters. the aim of these observations is to test, with moderndata, the assumptions of the rigidly rotating magnetosphere (rrm) model oftownsend &amp; owocki (2005), applied to the specific case of sigma ori e bytownsend et al. (2005). this model includes a substantially offset dipolemagnetic field configuration, and approximately reproduces previousobservational variations in longitudinal field strength, photometricbrightness, and halpha emission. we analyze new spectroscopy, including h i, hei, c ii, si iii and fe iii lines, confirming the diversity of variability inphotospheric lines, as well as the double s-wave variation of circumstellarhydrogen. using the multiline analysis method of least-squares deconvolution(lsd), new, more precise longitudinal magnetic field measurements reveal asubstantial variance between the shapes of the observed and rrm modeltime-varying field. the phase resolved stokes v profiles of he i 5876 a and6678 a lines are fit poorly by synthetic profiles computed from the magnetictopology assumed by townsend et al. (2005). these results challenge the offsetdipole field configuration assumed in the application of the rrm model to sigmaori e, and indicate that future models of its magnetic field should alsoinclude complex, higher-order components.

1109.5043	stellar magnetism through the polarized eyes of the fors1 instrument	during the last decade, the fors1 instrument of the eso very large telescopehas been used to obtain low resolution circular polarized spectra for about 500stars, with the aim of measuring their mean longitudinal magnetic fields.magnetic field estimates were obtained by different authors, using differentsoftware tools. several interesting detections were obtained at a 3 sigmalevel; some of them were eventually confirmed by follow-up investigations, someof them were not. this raises issues about the reliability of the stateduncertainties of some of the published field values. to investigate theseproblems, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure for magnetic fielddetermination, which includes self-consistent checks for field detectionreliability. we have applied our procedure to the full content of single star("fast mode") circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the fors1 archive,and explored the details and interagreement of various methods for datareduction. we have finally produced a catalogue of fors1 longitudinal fieldmeasurements which includes about 1000 entries. here we critically review thepreviously published fors1 measurements, and, based on our results, we suggestthat the incidence of the magnetic field in various classes of stars should berevised.

1110.0829	no magnetic field in the spotted hgmn star mu leporis	chemically peculiar stars of the mercury-manganese (hgmn) type represent anew class of spotted late-b stars, in which evolving surface chemicalinhomogeneities are apparently unrelated to the presence of strong magneticfields but are produced by some hitherto unknown astrophysical mechanism. thegoal of this study is to perform a detailed line profile variability analysisand carry out a sensitive magnetic field search for one of the brightest hgmnstars - mu lep. we acquired a set of very high-quality intensity andpolarization spectra of mu lep with the harpspol polarimeter. these data wereanalyzed with the multiline technique of least-squares deconvolution in orderto extract information on the magnetic field and line profile variability. ourspectra show very weak but definite variability in the lines of sc, all fe-peakelements represented in the spectrum of mu lep, as well as y, sr, and hg.variability might also be present in the lines of si and mg. anomalous profileshapes of ti ii and y ii lines suggest a dominant axisymmetric distribution ofthese elements. at the same time, we found no evidence of the magnetic field inmu lep, with the 3 sigma upper limit of only 3 g for the mean longitudinalmagnetic field. this is the most stringent upper limit on the possible magneticfield derived for a spotted hgmn star. the very weak variability detected formany elements in the spectrum mu lep suggests that low-contrast chemicalinhomogeneities may be common in hgmn stars and that they have not beenrecognized until now due to the limited precision of previous spectroscopicobservations and a lack of time-series data. the null result of the magneticfield search reinforces the conclusion that formation of chemical spots in hgmnstars is not magnetically driven.

1111.6065	magnetism, chemical spots, and stratification in the hgmn star phi  phoenicis	mercury-manganese (hgmn) stars have been considered as non-magnetic andnon-variable chemically peculiar (cp) stars for a long time. however, recentdiscoveries of the variability in spectral line profiles have suggested aninhomogeneous surface distribution of chemical elements in some hgmn stars.from the studies of other cp stars it is known that magnetic field plays a keyrole in the formation of surface spots. all attempts to find magnetic fields inhgmn stars have yielded negative results. in this study, we investigate thepossible presence of a magnetic field in phi phe (hd 11753) and reconstructsurface distribution of chemical elements that show variability in spectrallines.we also test a hypothesis that a magnetic field is concentrated inchemical spots and look into the possibility that some chemical elements arestratified with depth in the stellar atmosphere. our analysis is based onhigh-quality spectropolarimetric time-series observations, covering a fullrotational period of the star. spectra were obtained with the harpspol at theeso 3.6-m telescope. combining information from all suitable spectral lines, weset an upper limit of 4 g on the mean longitudinal magnetic field. for chemicalspots, an upper limit on the longitudinal field varies between 8 and 15 g. weconfirmed the variability of y, sr, and ti and detected variability in crlines. stratification analysis showed that y and ti are not concentrated in theuppermost atmospheric layers. our spectropolarimetric observations rule out thepresence of a strong, globally-organised magnetic field in phi phe. thisimplies an alternative mechanism of spot formation, which could be related to anon-equilibrium atomic diffusion. however, the typical time scales of thevariation in stratification predicted by the recent time-dependent diffusionmodels exceed significantly the spot evolution time-scale reported for phi phe.

1112.3969	magnetic field measurements and their uncertainties: the fors1 legacy	during the last decade, the fors1 instrument of the eso vlt has beenextensively used to study stellar magnetism. a number of interestingdiscoveries of magnetic fields in several classes of stars have been announced,many of which obtained at a ~3 sigma level; some of the discoveries areconfirmed by measurements obtained with other instruments, some are not. herewe investigate the reasons for the discrepancies between the results obtainedwith fors1 and those obtained with other instruments.  using the eso fors pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure formagnetic field determination. we have applied this procedure to the fullcontent of circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the fors1 archive. wehave devised and applied a number of consistency checks to our fielddeterminations, and we have compared our results to those previously publishedin the literature.  we find that for high signal-to-noise ratio measurements, photon noise doesnot account for the full error bars. we discuss how field measurements dependon the specific algorithm adopted for data reduction, and we show that verysmall instrument flexures, negligible in most of the instrument applications,may be responsible for some spurious field detections in the null profiles.finally, we find that we are unable to reproduce some results previouslypublished in the literature. consequently, we do not confirm some importantdiscoveries of magnetic fields obtained with fors1 and reported in previouspublications.  our revised field measurements show that there is no contradiction betweenthe results obtained with the low-resolution spectropolarimeter fors1 and thoseobtained with high-resolution spectropolarimeters. fors1 is an instrumentcapable of performing reliable magnetic field measurements, provided that thevarious source of uncertainties are properly taken into account.

1201.1902	magnetic doppler imaging considering atmospheric structure modifications  due to local abundances: a luxury or a necessity?	magnetic doppler imaging is currently the most powerful method ofinterpreting high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of stars. thistechnique has revealed the presence of unexpected small-scale magnetic fieldson the surfaces of ap stars. these studies were recently criticisied by stiftet al. (2012), who claimed that magnetic inversions are not robust and areundermined by neglecting a feedback on the stokes line profiles from the localatmospheric structure in the regions of enhanced metal abundance. we show thatstift et al. misinterpreted published magnetic doppler imaging results andneglected some of the most fundamental principles behind magnetic mapping. wedemonstrate that the variation of atmospheric structure across the surface of astar with chemical spots affects the local continuum intensity but isnegligible for the normalised local stokes profiles. for the disk-integratedspectra of an ap star with extreme abundance variations, we find that theassumption of a mean model atmosphere leads to moderate errors in stokes i butis negligible for polarisation spectra. employing a new magnetic inversioncode, which incorporates the horizontal variation of atmospheric structure, wereconstructed new maps of magnetic field and fe abundance for the ap staralpha^2 cvn. the resulting distribution of chemical spots changesinsignificantly compared to the previous modelling based on a single modelatmosphere, while the magnetic field geometry does not change at all. thisshows that the assertions by stift et al. are exaggerated as a consequence ofunreasonable assumptions and extrapolations, as well as methodological flawsand inconsistencies of their analysis. our discussion proves that publishedmagnetic inversions based on a mean stellar atmosphere are robust and reliable,and that the presence of small-scale magnetic field structures on the surfacesof ap stars is real.

1211.0208	basic parameters and properties of the rapidly rotating magnetic helium  strong b star hr7355	the spectral and magnetic properties and variability of the b2vnpemission-line magnetosphere star hr7355 were analyzed. the object rotates atalmost 90% of the critical value, meaning it is a magnetic star for whichoblateness and gravity darkening effects cannot be ignored any longer. adetailed modeling of the photospheric parameters indicate that the star issignificantly cooler than suggested by the b2 spectral type, with t_eff=17500katypically cool for a star with a helium enriched surface. the spectroscopicvariability of helium and metal lines due to the photospheric abundance patternis far more complex than a largely dipolar, oblique magnetic field of about 11to 12kg may suggest. doppler imaging shows that globally the most he enrichedareas coincide with the magnetic poles and metal enriched areas with themagnetic equator. while most of the stellar surface is helium enriched withrespect to the solar value, some isolated patches are depleted. the stellarwind in the circumstellar environment is governed by the magnetic field, i.e.the stellar magnetosphere is rigidly corotating with the star. themagnetosphere of hr7355 is similar to the well known \sigma ori e: the gastrapped in the magnetospheric clouds is fairly dense, and at the limit to beingoptically thick in the hydrogen emission. apart from a different magneticobliquity, hr7355 and the more recently identified hr5907 have virtuallyidentical stellar and magnetic parameters.

0712.1742	magnetic doppler imaging of ap stars	historically, the magnetic field geometries of the chemically peculiar apstars were modelled in the context of a simple dipole field. however, with theacquisition of increasingly sophisticated diagnostic data, it has become clearthat the large-scale field topologies exhibit important departures from thissimple model. recently, new high-resolution circular and linear polarisationspectroscopy has even hinted at the presence of strong, small-scale fieldstructures, which were completely unexpected based on earlier modelling. thisproject investigates the detailed structure of these strong fossil magneticfields, in particular the large-scale field geometry, as well as small scalemagnetic structures, by mapping the magnetic and chemical surface structure ofa selected sample of ap stars. these maps will be used to investigate therelationship between the local field vector and local surface chemistry,looking for the influence the field may have on the various chemical transportmechanisms (i.e., diffusion, convection and mass loss). this will lead tobetter constraints on the origin and evolution, as well as refining themagnetic field model for ap stars. mapping will be performed using highresolution and signal-to-noise ratio time-series of spectra in both circularand linear polarisation obtained using the new-generation espadons and narvalspectropolarimeters at the cfht and pic du midi observatory. with these data wewill perform tomographic inversion of doppler-broadened stokes iquv zeemanprofiles of a large variety of spectral lines using the invers10 magneticdoppler imaging code, simultaneously recovering the detailed surface maps ofthe vector magnetic field and chemical abundances.

1304.6717	are there tangled magnetic fields on hgmn stars?	several recent spectrophotometric studies failed to detect significant globalmagnetic fields in late-b hgmn chemically peculiar stars, but someinvestigations have suggested the presence of strong unstructured or tangledfields in these objects. we used detailed spectrum synthesis analysis to searchfor evidence of tangled magnetic fields in high-quality observed spectra of 8slowly rotating hgmn stars and one normal late-b star. we also evaluated recentsporadic detections of weak longitudinal magnetic fields in hgmn stars based onthe moment technique. our analysis of the zeeman broadening of magneticallysensitive spectral lines reveals no evidence of tangled magnetic fields in anyof the studied hgmn or normal stars. we infer upper limits of 200-700 g for themean magnetic field modulus -- much smaller than the field strengths implied bystudies based on differential magnetic line intensification and quadratic fielddiagnostics. the new harpspol longitudinal field measurements for the extremehgmn star hd 65949 and the normal late-b star 21 peg are consistent with zeroat a precision of 3-6 g. re-analysis of our stokes v spectra of the spottedhgmn star hd 11753 shows that the recent moment technique measurementsretrieved from the same data are incompatible with the lack of circularpolarization signatures in the spectrum of this star. we conclude that there isno evidence for substantial tangled magnetic fields on the surfaces of studiedhgmn stars. we cannot independently confirm the presence of very strongquadratic or marginal longitudinal fields for these stars, so results from themoment technique are likely to be spurious.

1306.0997	three-dimensional magnetic and abundance mapping of the cool ap star hd  24712 i. spectropolarimetric observations in all four stokes parameters	high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations provide simultaneousinformation about stellar magnetic field topologies and three-dimensionaldistributions of chemical elements. here we present analysis of a unique fullstokes vector spectropolarimetric data set, acquired for the cool magnetic apstar hd 24712. the goal of our work is to examine circular and linearpolarization signatures inside spectral lines and to study variation of thestellar spectrum and magnetic observables as a function of rotational phase. hd24712 was observed with the harpspol instrument at the 3.6-m eso telescope overa period of 2010-2011. the resulting spectra have s/n ratio of 300-600 andresolving power exceeding 100000. the multiline technique of least-squaresdeconvolution (lsd) was applied to combine information from the spectral linesof fe-peak and rare-earth elements. we used the harpspol spectra of hd 24712 tostudy the morphology of the stokes profile shapes in individual spectral linesand in lsd stokes profiles corresponding to different line masks. from the lsdstokes v profiles we measured the longitudinal component of the magnetic field,&lt;bz&gt;, with an accuracy of 5-10 g. we also determined the net linearpolarization from the lsd stokes q and u profiles. we determined an improvedrotational period of the star, p_rot = 12.45812 +/- 0.00019d. we measured &lt;bz&gt;from the cores of halpha and hbeta lines. the analysis of &lt;bz&gt; measurementsshowed no evidence for a significant radial magnetic field gradient in theatmosphere of hd 24712. we used our &lt;bz&gt; and net linear polarizationmeasurements to determine parameters of the dipolar magnetic field topology. wefound that magnetic observables can be reasonably well reproduced by thedipolar model. we discovered rotational modulation of the halpha core andrelated it a non-uniform surface distribution of rare-earth elements.

1408.4035	zeeman doppler imaging of a cool star using line profiles in all four  stokes parameters for the first time	magnetic fields in cool stars are ubiquitous but can still be challenging tocharacterize due to their complexity and relatively low strength. thepolarization signature amplitudes are proportional to the field strength, andcurrent studies of cool star magnetic fields are using circular polarizationonly since linear polarization is even weaker. however, circular polarizationis only sensitive to the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field, meaningthat many structural features are not recovered or may be misinterpreted whenonly circular polarization is used for reconstruction of stellar magnetictopologies. linear polarization, on the other hand, is sensitive to thetransverse component of the magnetic field and would provide a more completepicture of the magnetic field topology if combined with circular polarization.we have identified the first cool target, the rs cvn star ii~peg, suitable forfull stokes vector analysis. using current instrumentation, we have succeededin systematically detecting its linear polarization signatures with a precisionand rotational phase coverage sufficient for magnetic mapping. here we presentthe very first temperature and magnetic field maps reconstructed for a coolstar using all four stokes parameter spectra.

1511.07881	magnetic field topology of tau sco. the uniqueness problem of stokes v  zdi inversions	the early b-type star tau sco exhibits an unusually complex, relatively weaksurface magnetic field. its topology was previously studied with the zeemandoppler imaging (zdi) modelling of high-resolution circular polarisation(stokes v) observations. here we assess the robustness of the stokes v zdireconstruction of the magnetic field geometry of tau sco and explore theconsequences of using different parameterisations of the surface magnetic maps.we succeeded in reproducing previously published magnetic field maps of tau scousing both general harmonic expansion and a direct, pixel-based representationof the magnetic field. these maps suggest that the field topology of tau sco iscomprised of comparable contributions of the poloidal and toroidal magneticcomponents. at the same time, we also found that available stokes vobservations can be successfully fitted employing restricted harmonicexpansions, by either neglecting the toroidal field altogether or linking theradial and horizontal components of the poloidal field as required by thewidely used potential field extrapolation technique. these alternativemodelling approaches lead to a stronger and topologically more complex surfacefield structure. the field distributions recovered with different zdi optionsdiffer significantly, yielding indistinguishable stokes v profiles butdifferent linear polarisation (stokes q and u) signatures. our investigationunderscores the well-known problem of non-uniqueness of the stokes v zdiinversions. for the magnetic stars with properties similar to tau sco(relatively complex field, slow rotation) the outcome of magneticreconstruction depends sensitively on the adopted field parameterisation.stokes q and u spectropolarimetric observations represent the only way ofbreaking the degeneracy of surface magnetic field models.

astro-ph;0409609	indirect imaging of nonradial pulsations in a rapidly oscillating ap  star	many types of stars show periodic variations of radius and brightness, whichare commonly referred to as `stellar pulsations'. observed pulsationalcharacteristics are determined by fundamental stellar parameters. consequently,investigations of stellar pulsations provide a unique opportunity to verify andrefine our understanding of the evolution and internal structure of stars.however, a key boundary condition for this analysis -- precise informationabout the geometry of pulsations in the outer stellar envelopes -- has beennotoriously difficult to secure. here we demonstrate that it is possible tosolve this problem by constructing an `image' of the pulsation velocity fieldfrom time series observations of stellar spectra. this technique is applied tostudy the geometry of nonradial pulsations in a prototype magnetic oscillating(roap) star hr 3831. our velocity map directly demonstrates an alignment ofpulsations with the axis of the global magnetic field and reveals a significantmagnetically induced distortion of pulsations. this observation constitutes along-sought solution of the problem of the pulsation geometry of roap stars andenables very stringent tests of the recent theories of stellar magneto-acousticoscillations.

astro-ph;0503438	variation of the line profile moments for stars pulsating in distorted  oblique non-radial modes	we derive expressions and develop a numerical technique for the analysis ofthe line profile moment variations for stars pulsating in oblique non-radialmodes. this represents an extension of the widely used spectroscopic momentmode identification method to the oblique distorted pulsations observed inrapidly oscillating ap stars. we demonstrate that a non-axisymmetricsuperposition of the pulsation and rotation velocity fields results in aqualitatively new behaviour of some of the line profile characteristics. it isfound that for the majority of roap stars the second moment varies with thepulsation frequency rather than with its first harmonic even for axisymmetricmodes. we also identify pulsation observables which do not change duringpulsation cycle but are modulated by the stellar rotation and can contribute tothe variability of the stellar spectra averaged over many pulsation cycles. asan illustration of the new version of the moment technique, we computerotational modulation of the pulsational changes of the line profile momentsfor the oblique axisymmetric dipolar pulsation modes with different parameters.it is also shown that a distortion of the oblique dipolar modes predicted bythe recent theoretical studies of the stellar magneto-acoustic oscillations canbe readily diagnosed through the moment analysis. in particular, the shape ofthe pulsation phase modulation for the radial velocity and the second moment isvery sensitive to non-axisymmetric pulsation components, whereas the rotationalmodulation of the second moment amplitude is best suited to reveal axisymmetricmagnetically induced distortion of pulsations.

astro-ph;0505124	inhomogeneous distribution of mercury on the surfaces of rapidly  rotating hgmn stars	starspots are usually associated with the action of magnetic fields at thestellar surfaces. however, recently an inhomogeneous chemical distribution ofmercury was found for the mercury-manganese (hgmn) star alpha and -- awell-established member of a non-magnetic subclass of the chemically peculiarstars of the upper main sequence. in this study we present first results of thehigh-resolution survey of the hgii 3984 resonance line in the spectra ofrapidly rotating hgmn stars with atmospheric parameters similar to those ofalpha and. we use spectrum synthesis modelling and take advantage of thedoppler resolution of the stellar surfaces to probe horizontal structure ofmercury distribution. clear signatures of spots are found in the hgii 3984 lineprofiles of hr 1185 and hr 8723. two observations of the latter star separatedby two days give evidence for the line profile variability. we conclude thatinhomogeneous distribution of hg is a common phenomenon for the rapidlyrotating hgmn stars in the 13000--13800 k effective temperature rangeindependently of the stellar evolutionary stage. these results establishexistence of a new class of spectrum variable spotted b-type stars. it issuggested that the observed hg inhomogeneities arise from dynamicalinstabilities in the chemical diffusion processes and are unrelated to magneticphenomena.

astro-ph;0509446	pulsational line profile variation of the roap star hr 3831	we report the first comprehensive investigation of the line profile variationcaused by non-radial pulsation in a magnetic oscillating chemically peculiarstar. spectrum variation of the well-known roap star hr 3831 is detected usingvery high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopic time-seriesobservations and are followed through the whole rotation cycle of the star. weconfirm outstanding diversity of pulsational behaviour of different lines inthe hr 3831 spectrum and attribute this phenomenon to an interplay betweenextreme vertical chemical inhomogeneity of the hr 3831 atmosphere and a runningpulsation wave, propagating towards the upper photospheric layers withincreasing amplitude. rapid profile variation of the ndiii 6145 a line ischaracterized by measuring changes of its equivalent width and the first threemoments. we demonstrate that rotational modulation of the radial velocityoscillations cannot be fully explained by an oblique axisymmetric dipole(ell=1, m=0) mode, implied by the classical oblique pulsator model of roapstars. pulsational variation of the higher moments reveal substantialcontribution of the high-order (ell=3) spherical harmonics which appear due todistortion of pulsations in hr 3831 by the global magnetic field. we interpretobservations with a novel numerical model of the pulsational variation androtational modulation of the line profile moments in roap stars. the comparisonbetween observed and computed amplitudes and phases of the radial velocity andline width variation is used to establish parameters of the oblique pulsatormodel of hr 3831. furthermore, definite detection of pulsational variation inlines of light and iron-peak elements enables the first 3-d mapping ofpulsations in non-radially oscillating star.

astro-ph;0601461	evolutionary state of magnetic chemically peculiar stars	we present a comprehensive statistical investigation of the evolution ofmagnetic cp stars, aimed at providing constraints to the theories that dealwith the origin of the magnetic field in these stars. we have collected fromthe literature data for 150 magnetic cp stars with accurate hipparcosparallaxes. we have retrieved from the eso archive 142 fors1 observations ofcircularly polarized spectra for 100 stars. from these spectra we have measuredthe mean longitudinal magnetic field, and discovered 48 new magnetic cp stars(five of which belonging to the rare class of rapidly oscillating ap stars). wehave determined effective temperature and luminosity, then mass and position inthe h-r diagram for a final sample of 194 magnetic cp stars. we found thatmagnetic stars with m&gt;3msun are homogeneously distributed along the mainsequence. instead, there are statistical indications that lower mass stars(especially those with m&lt;=2msun) tend to concentrate in the centre of the mainsequence band. we show that this inhomogeneous age distribution cannot beattributed to the effects of random errors and small number statistics. ourdata suggest also that the surface magnetic flux of cp stars increases withstellar age and mass, and correlates with the rotation period. for stars withm&gt;3msun, rotation periods decrease with age in a way consistent with theconservation of the angular momentum, while for less massive magnetic cp starsan angular momentum loss cannot be ruled out. the mechanism that originates andsustains the magnetic field in the upper main sequence stars may be differentin cp stars of different mass.

astro-ph;0612301	the lorentz force in atmospheres of cp stars: $\theta$ aurigae	several dynamical processes may induce considerable electric currents in theatmospheres of magnetic chemically peculiar (cp) stars. the lorentz force,which results from the interaction between the magnetic field and the inducedcurrents, modifies the atmospheric structure and induces characteristicrotational variability of the hydrogen balmer lines. to study this phenomena wehave initiated a systematic spectroscopic survey of the balmer lines variationin magnetic cp stars. in this paper we continue presentation of results of theprogram focusing on the high-resolution spectral observations of a0p star \aur(hd 40312). we have detected a significant variability of the h$\alpha$,h$\beta$, and h$\gamma$ spectral lines during full rotation cycle of the star.this variability is interpreted in the framework of the model atmosphereanalysis, which accounts for the lorentz force effects. both the inward andoutward directed lorentz forces are considered under the assumption of theaxisymmetric dipole or dipole+quadrupole magnetic field configurations. wedemonstrate that only the model with the outward directed lorentz force in thedipole+quadrupole configuration is able to reproduce the observed hydrogen linevariation. these results present new strong evidences for the presence ofnon-zero global electric currents in the atmosphere of an early-type magneticstar.

astro-ph;0612761	line profile variations in rapidly oscillating ap stars: resolution of  the enigma	we have carried out the first survey of the pulsational line profilevariability in rapidly oscillating ap (roap) stars. we analysed highsignal-to-noise time-series observations of ten sharp-lined roap stars obtainedwith the high-resolution spectrographs attached to the vlt and cfht telescopes.we investigated in detail the variations of pr iii, nd ii, nd iii and tb iiilines and discovered a prominent change of the profile variability pattern withheight in the atmospheres of all studied roap stars. in every investigated starprofile variability of at least one rare-earth ion is characterized by unusualblue-to-red moving features - a behaviour inexplicable in the framework of thestandard oblique pulsator model of slowly rotating roap stars. using analysisof the line profile moments and spectrum synthesis calculations, we demonstratethat unusual oscillations in spectral lines of roap stars arise from thepulsational modulation of line widths. this variation occurs approximately inquadrature with the radial velocity changes, and its amplitude rapidlyincreases with height in stellar atmosphere. we propose that the line widthmodulation is a consequence of the periodic expansion and compression ofturbulent layers in the upper atmospheres of roap stars. thus, the line profilechanges observed in slowly rotating magnetic pulsators should be interpreted asa superposition of two types of variability: the usual time-dependent velocityfield due to an oblique low-order pulsation mode and an additional line widthmodulation, synchronized with the changes of stellar radius. our explanation ofthe line profile variations of roap stars solves the long-standingobservational puzzle and opens new possibilities for constraining geometric andphysical properties of the stellar magnetoacoustic pulsations.
