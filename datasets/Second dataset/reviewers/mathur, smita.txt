0901.3378	black hole masses of intermediate-redshift quasars: near infrared  spectroscopy	we present near-infrared spectra of ten luminous, intermediate redshiftquasars observed with sofi at the ntt of eso/la silla. with these rest-frameoptical spectra we probe the hb -[oiii] emission line region. using thestandard scaling relation involving the width of the hb line and the continuumluminosity, we measure black hole masses in the range of ~2x10^9 to 10^10 msol.we also used sdss spectra to probe mgii2798 and civ1549 emission lines and usedthese for black hole mass measurements as well. the massive black holes weobserve could not have grown by simple radiatively efficient accretion at theobserved accretion rate starting from seeds of up to thousand solar masses.about 10% of the observed black hole mass must have been accumulated by earliermerger events and radiatively inefficient accretion. radiatively efficientaccretion would further grow these bhs to masses of several 10^9 msol in 2 to 3e-folding times i.e. in several 10^8yrs. the hb-based eddington luminosityratios are in the range of ~0.2 to ~0.7, with an average of (lbol/ledd) =0.39+-0.05. the lbol/ledd ratio distribution follows a log-normal distributionwhich is consistent with prior studies of quasars with comparable luminosity.the lbol/ledd ratio distribution of less luminous quasars tend to be shifted tolower eddington ratios. we also find that the gas metallicity of the broad-lineregion is ~3z/zsol, using niii]/oiii] and nv/civ emission line ratios. we findno correlation of the gas metallicity with the optical feii emission linestrength.

0901.3566	galex measurements of the big blue bump in soft x-ray selected agn	we study the uv properties of type i agn from the rosat all-sky survey thathave been selected to show unusually soft x-ray continua. we examine a sampleof 54 seyfert 1 galaxies with detections in both near-uv and far-uv bands ofthe galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite. our sample is systematicallyfainter in the uv than galaxies studied in similar work by previous authors. welook for correlations between their uv and x-ray properties as well ascorrelations of these properties with either black hole mass or eddingtonratio. the shape of the big blue bump(bbb) in the galex regime does not appearto correlate with its strength relative to the power law continuum, whichconflicts with results reported by previous authors. the strength of the bbb iscorrelated with the shape of the x-ray continuum, in agreement with previouswork, but the slope of the correlation is different than previously reported.the properties of the accretion disks of type i agn in the galex regime arerelatively independent of black hole mass and eddington ratio. we compare ourmeasurements to the predictions of alternative theories for the origin of thesoft excess, but we are unable to distinguish between comptonization of bbbphotons by a hot plasma and absorption in relativistic winds as the most likelyorigins for the soft x-ray excess.

0908.2001	a search for oxygen in the low-density lyman-alpha forest using the  sloan digital sky survey	we use 2167 sloan digital sky survey (sdss) quasar spectra to search forlow-density oxygen in the intergalactic medium (igm). oxygen absorption isdetected on a pixel-by-pixel basis by its correlation with lyman-alpha forestabsorption. we have developed a novel locally calibrated pixel (lcp) searchmethod that uses adjacent regions of the spectrum to calibrate interlopers andspectral artifacts, which would otherwise limit the measurement of oviabsorption. despite the challenges presented by searching for weak ovi withinthe lyman-alpha forest in spectra of moderate resolution and signal-to-noise,we find a highly significant detection of absorption by oxygen at 2.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.2(the null hypothesis has a chi^2=80 for 9 data points).  we interpret our results using synthetic spectra generated from a lognormaldensity field assuming a mixed quasar-galaxy photoionizing background (haardt &amp;madau 2001) and that it dominates the ionization fraction of detected ovi. thelcp search data can be fit by a constant metallicity model with [o/h] =-2.15_(-0.09)^(+0.07), but also by models in which low-density regions areunenriched and higher density regions have a higher metallicity. thedensity-dependent enrichment model by aguirre et al. (2008) is also anacceptable fit. all our successful models have similar mass-weighted oxygenabundance, corresponding to [&lt;o/h&gt;_mw] = -2.45+-0.06. this result can be usedto find the cosmic oxygen density in the lyman-alpha forest, omega_(oxy, igm) =1.4(+-0.2)x10^(-6) = 3x10^(-4) omega_b. this is the tightest constraint on themass-weighted mean oxygen abundance and the cosmic oxygen density in thelyman-alpha forest to date and indicates that it contains approximately 16% ofmetals produced by star formation (bouch\'e et al. 2008) up to z = 3.

0910.3691	agn feedback: does it work?	while feedback is important in theoretical models, we do not really know ifit works in reality. feedback from jets appears to be sufficient to keep thecooling flows in clusters from cooling too much and it may be sufficient toregulate black hole growth in dominant cluster galaxies. only about 10% of allquasars, however, have powerful radio jets, so jet-related feedback cannot begeneric. the outflows could potentially be a more common form of agn feedback,but measuring mass and energy outflow rates is a challenging task, the mainunknown being the location and geometry of the absorbing medium. using a noveltechnique, we made first such measurement in ngc 4051 using xmm data and foundthe mass and energy outflow rates to be 4 to 5 orders of magnitude below thoserequired for efficient feedback. to test whether the outflow velocity in ngc4051 is unusually low, we compared the ratio of outflow velocity to escapevelocity in a sample of agns and found it to be generally less than one. it isthus possible that in most seyferts the feedback is not sufficient and may notbe necessary.

0707.2053	variable x-ray absorption toward gravitationally-lensed blazar  pks1830-211	we present x-ray spectral analysis of five chandra and xmm-newtonobservations of the gravitationally-lensed blazar pks1830-211 from 2000 to2004. we show that the x-ray absorption toward pks1830-211 is variable, and thevariable absorption is most likely to be intrinsic with amplitudes of about2-30e22 cm^-2 depending on whether or not the absorber is partially coveringthe x-ray source. our results confirm the variable absorption observedpreviously, although interpreted differently, in a sequence of ascaobservations. this large variation in the absorption column density can beinterpreted as outflows from the central engine in the polar direction,consistent with recent numerical models of inflow/outflows in agns. inaddition, it could possibly be caused by the interaction between the blazar jetand its environment, or the variation from the geometric configuration of thejet. while the spectra can also be fitted with a variable absorption at thelens redshift, we show that this model is unlikely. we also rule out the simplemicrolensing interpretation of variability which was previously suggested.

1001.0356	suzaku monitoring of the iron k emission line in the type 1 agn ngc 5548	we present 7 sequential weekly observations of ngc 5548 conducted in 2007with the \textit{suzaku} x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) in the 0.2-12 kevband and hard x-ray detector (hxd) in 10-600 kev band. the iron k$\alpha$ lineis well detected in all seven observations and k$\beta$ line is also detectedin four observations. in this paper, we investigate the origin of the fe klines using both the width of the line and the reverberation mapping method.  with the co-added xis and hxd spectra, we identify fe k$\alpha$ and k$\beta$line at 6.396$_{-0.007}^{+0.009}$ kev and 7.08$_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ kev,respectively. the width of line obtained from the co-added spectra is38$_{-18}^{+16}$ ev ($\textrm{fwhm}=4200_{-2000}^{+1800}$ km/s) whichcorresponds to a radius of 20$_{-10}^{+50}$ light days, for the virialproduction of $1.220\times10^7$ m$_{\odot}$ in ncg 5548.  to quantitatively investigate the origin of the narrow fe line by thereverberation mapping method, we compare the observed light curves of fek$\alpha$ line with the predicted ones, which are obtained by convolving thecontinuum light curve with the transfer functions in a thin shell and aninclined disk. the best-fit result is given by the disk case with $i=30^\circ$which is better than a fit to a constant flux of the fe k line at the 92.7%level (f-test). we find that the emitting radius obtained from the light curveis 25-37 light days, which is consistent with the radius derived from the fe kline width. combining the results of the line width and variation, the mostlikely site for the origin of the narrow iron lines is 20-40 light days awayfrom the central engine, though other possibilities are not completely ruledout.

1001.5282	the composite spectrum of strong lyman-alpha forest absorbers	we present a new method for probing the physical conditions and metalenrichment of the intergalactic medium: the composite spectrum of ly-alphaforest absorbers. we apply this technique to a sample of 9480 ly-alphaabsorbers with redshift 2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 identified in the spectra of 13,279high-redshift quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) fifth datarelease (dr5). absorbers are selected as local minima in the spectra with 2.4 &lt;tau_ly-alpha &lt; 4.0; at sdss resolution (~ 150km/s fwhm), these absorbers areblends of systems that are individually weaker. in the stacked spectra wedetect seven lyman-series lines and metal lines of o vi, n v, c iv, c iii, siiv, c ii, al ii, si ii, fe ii, mg ii, and o i. many of these lines have peakoptical depths of &lt; 0.02, but they are nonetheless detected at high statisticalsignificance. modeling the lyman-series measurements implies that our selectedsystems have total h i column densities n_hi ~ 10^15.4cm-2. assuming typicalphysical conditions rho / &lt;rho&gt; = 10, t = 10^4 - 10^4.5 k, and [fe/h]= -2yields reasonable agreement with the line strengths of high-ionization species,but it underpredicts the low-ionization species by two orders of magnitude ormore. this discrepancy suggests that the low ionization lines arise in dense,cool, metal-rich clumps, present in some absorption systems.

1011.4295	discovery of nuclear x-ray sources in sings galaxies	we present the results of a search for nuclear x-ray activity in nearbygalaxies using chandra archival data in a sample of 62 galaxies from thespitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey (sings). we detect 37 nuclear x-raysources; seven of these are new detections. most of the nuclear x-ray sourcesare likely to be agns. the fraction of galaxies hosting agns is thus about 60%,much higher than that found with optical searches, and demonstrates theefficacy of x-ray observations to find hidden agns in optically normalgalaxies. we find that the nuclear x-ray sources are preferentially present inearlier type galaxies. unlike what is observed at high redshift, we do not finda strong correlation between the agn luminosity and the 24 micron luminosity ofthe host galaxy; we find a strong correlation with the 3.6 micron luminosityinstead. this suggests that at the present epoch the accretion rate depends onthe total mass of the galaxy, as perhaps does the black hole mass.

1102.0537	supermassive black holes, pseudobulges, and the narrow-line seyfert 1  galaxies	we present hst/acs observations of ten galaxies that host narrow-line seyfert1 (nls1) nuclei, believed to contain relatively smaller mass black holesaccreting at high eddington ratios. we deconvolve each acs image into a nuclearpoint source (agn), a bulge, and a disk, and fitted the bulge with a sersicprofile and the disk with an exponential profile. we find that at least fivegalaxies can be classified as having pseudobulges. all ten galaxies lie belowthe \mbh--l$_{bulge}$ relation, confirming earlier results. their locus issimilar to that occupied by pseudobulges. this leads us to conclude that thegrowth of bhs in nls1s is governed by secular processes rather thanmerger-driven. active galaxies in pseudobulges point to an alternative track ofblack hole--galaxy co-evolution. because of the intrinsic scatter in black holemass--bulge properties scaling relations caused by a combination of factorssuch as the galaxy morphology, orientation, and redshift evolution, applicationof scaling relations to determine bh masses may not be as straightforward ashas been hoped.

0709.3769	on the nature of the z=0 x-ray absorbers: ii. the contrast between local  and agn host galaxy absorption	we search for highly-ionized gas near three agn host galaxies using thechandra low-energy transmission grating spectrograph. strong absorption linesfrom such gas are seen at z=0, most likely from one or more of the followingcomponents: (1) a galactic corona, (2) the local group medium, and (3) anextended warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) filament passing through ourlocal overdensity. since agns reside within host galaxies that are alsoexpected to sit within cosmically overdense regions, similar absorptionresulting from these three components should appear at the agn redshifts aswell. however, no such absorption is seen. the lack of strong absorption linesis likely a result of the gas in these host galaxies and surrounding galaxyclusters being much hotter, and hence more highly ionized, than the gas in thelocal group+galaxy system. we conclude that whim filaments produce nomeasurable absorption lines at the agn redshifts, and therefore contribute atmost a small fraction of the observed z=0 warm-hot gas.

1108.5181	a spitzer-mips search for dust in compact high-velocity hi clouds	we employ three-band spitzer-mips observations to search for cold dustemission in three neutral hydrogen compact high-velocity clouds (chvcs) in thevicinity of the milky way. far-infrared emission correlated with hi columndensity was previously reported in hvc complex c, indicating that this objectcontains dust heated by the galactic radiation field at its distance of ~10kpc.assuming published spitzer, iras, and planck ir-hi correlations for complex c,our spitzer observations are of sufficient depth to directly detect 160um dustemission in the chvcs if it is present at the same level as in complex c, butno emission is detected in any of the targets. for one of the targets (chvc289)which has well-localized hi clumps, we therefore conclude that it isfundamentally different from complex c, with either a lower dust-to-gas ratioor a greater distance from the galactic disk (and consequently cooler dusttemperature). firm conclusions cannot be drawn for the other twospitzer-observed chvcs since their small-scale hi structures are notsufficiently well known; nonetheless, no extended dust emission is apparentdespite their relatively high hi column densities. the lack of dust emission inchvc289 suggests that at least some compact high-velocity clouds objects mayexhibit very low dust-to-gas ratios and/or greater galactocentric distancesthan large hvc complexes.

1109.4651	ngc 5548: lack of a broad fe k line and constraints on the location of  the hard x-ray source	we present an analysis of the co-added and individual 0.7-40 kev spectra fromseven suzaku observations of the sy 1.5 galaxy ngc 5548 taken over a period ofeight weeks. we conclude that the source has a moderately ionized, three-zonewarm absorber, a power-law continuum, and exhibits contributions from cold,distant reflection. relativistic reflection signatures are not significantlydetected in the co-added data, and we place an upper limit on the equivalentwidth of a relativistically broad fe k line at ew \leq 26 ev at 90% confidence.thus ngc 5548 can be labeled an "weak" type-1 agn in terms of its observedinner disk reflection signatures, in contrast to sources with very broad,strong iron lines such as mcg-6-30-15, which are likely much fewer in number.we compare physical properties of ngc 5548 and mcg-6-30-15 that might explainthis difference in their reflection properties. though there is some evidencethat ngc 5548 may harbor a truncated inner accretion disk, this evidence isinconclusive, so we also consider light bending of the hard x-ray continuumemission in order to explain the lack of relativistic reflection in ourobservation. if the absence of a broad fe k line is interpreted in thelight-bending context, we conclude that the source of the hard x-ray continuumlies at &lt;100 gravitational radii. we note, however, that light-bending modelsmust be expanded to include a broader range of physical parameter space inorder to adequately explain the spectral and timing properties of average agn,rather than just those with strong, broad iron lines.

1211.1674	xmm-newton observations of three interacting luminous infrared galaxies	we investigate the x-ray properties of three interacting luminous infraredgalaxy systems. in one of these systems, iras 18329+5950, we resolve twoseparate sources. a second, iras 20550+1656, and third, iras 19354+4559, haveonly a single x-ray source detected. we compare the observed emission to psfprofiles and determine that three are extended in emission. one is compact,which is suggestive of an agn, although all of our profiles have largeuncertainties. we then model the spectra to determine soft (0.5--2 kev) andhard (2--10 kev) luminosities for the resolved sources and then compare theseto relationships found in the literature between infrared and x-rayluminosities for starburst galaxies. we obtain luminosities of$\log(l_{\textrm{soft}}/\textrm{l}_{\odot}) = 7.32,\:7.06,\:7.68$ and$\log(l_{\textrm{hard}}/\textrm{l}_{\odot}) = 7.33,\: 7.07,\: 7.88$ for iras18329+5950, iras 19354+4559, and iras 20550+1656, respectively. these areintermediate to two separate predictions in the literature forstar-formation-dominated sources. our highest quality spectrum of iras20550+1656 suggests super-solar abundance of alpha elements at $2\sigma$significance, with $\log(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\odot}}) = [\alpha] =0.4\pm0.2$. this is suggestive of recent enrichment with type ii supernovae,consistent with a starburst environment. the x-ray properties of the targetgalaxies are most likely due to starbursts, but we cannot conclusively rule outagn.

1308.4410	stringent constraints on the h i spin temperature in two z &gt; 3 damped  lyman-alpha systems from redshifted 21 cm absorption studies	physical properties of damped lyman-alpha absorbers and their evolution areclosely related to galaxy formation and evolution theories, and have importantcosmological implications. h i 21 cm absorption study is one useful way ofmeasuring the temperature of these systems. in this work, very strongconstraints on the temperature of two damped lyman-alpha absorbers at z &gt; 3 arederived from low radio frequency observations. the h i spin temperature isfound to be greater than 2000 k for both the absorbers. the high spintemperature of these high-redshift systems is in agreement with the trend foundin a compilation of temperatures for other damped lyman-alpha absorbers. wealso argue that the temperature - metallicity relation, reported earlier in theliterature, is unlikely to be a spurious line of sight effect, and that theredshift evolution of the spin temperature does not arises due to a selectioneffect. all of these are consistent with a redshift evolution of the warm gasfraction in damped lyman-alpha systems.

0801.4382	low-level nuclear activity in nearby spiral galaxies	we are conducting a search for supermassive black holes (smbhs) with massesbelow 10^7 m_sun by looking for signs of extremely low-level nuclear activityin nearby galaxies that are not known to be agns. our survey has the followingcharacteristics: (a) x-ray selection using the chandra x-ray observatory, sincex-rays are a ubiquitous feature of agns; (b) emphasis on late-type spiral anddwarf galaxies, as the galaxies most likely to have low-mass smbhs; (c) use ofmultiwavelength data to verify the source is an agn; and (d) use of the highestangular resolution available for observations in x-rays and other bands, toseparate nuclear from off-nuclear sources and to minimize contamination by hostgalaxy light. here we show the feasibility of this technique to find agns byapplying it to six nearby, face-on spiral galaxies (ngc 3169, ngc 3184, ngc4102, ngc 4647, ngc 4713, ngc 5457) for which data already exist in the chandraarchive. all six show nuclear x-ray sources. the data as they exist at presentare ambiguous regarding the nature of the nuclear x-ray sources in ngc 4713 andngc 4647. we conclude, in accord with previous studies, that ngc 3169 and ngc4102 are almost certainly agns. most interestingly, a strong argument can bemade that ngc 3184 and ngc 5457, both of type scd, host agns.

astro-ph;0006225	150 kev emission from pks2149-306 with bepposax	a bepposax observation of the z=2.34 quasar pks2149-306 produced a strongsignal in the high energy pds instrument up to a maximum observed energy ofnearly 50 kev, 150 kev in the quasar frame. the beppo-sax spectrum spans almost3 decades (0.3-150 kev, quasar frame) and shows an extremely hard(alpha=0.4+/-0.05) x-ray spectrum above 3 kev (comparable to the x-raybackground slope), and either a softer (alpha=1.0(+0.6, -0.3)) low energycomponent, or an ionized absorber at zero redshift. no evidence is seen of anfe-k emission line (ew&lt;167 ev at 6.5 kev quasar frame) or a compton hump(r&lt;0.3). a bremsstrahlung fit gives kt(rest)=46(+32, -16) kev, similar to thex-ray background value, and a high energy cut-off power law requires e(cut)&gt;120kev (quasar frame).  the sed of pks 2149-306 shows two peaks at ~ 10(12+/-0.5}hz and\~10(21+/-1.0)hz (~ 0.3 mm and ~ 4 mev), strongly resembling a low energycutoff bl~lac object (lbl). the ratio of the two peaks shows an extreme comptondominance (c_d=1.4+/- 0.4), as in flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs). thepresence of an additional `optical/uv big bump' component may provide photonsthat cool the jet, suppressing the radio emission.

astro-ph;0010429	bepposax observations of the maser sy2 galaxy: eso103-g35	we have made bepposax observations of the seyfert 2/1.9 galaxy eso103-g35,which contains a nuclear maser source and is known to be heavily absorbed inthe x-rays. analysis of the x-ray spectra observed by sax in october 1996 and1997 yields a spectral index 0.74+/-0.07, typical of seyfert galaxies andconsistent with earlier observations of this source. the strong, soft x-rayabsorption has column density 1.79e(23)/cm^2, again consistent with earlierresults. the best fitting spectrum is that of a power law with a high energycutoff at 29+/-10 kev, a cold, marginally resolved fe kalpha line with ew 290ev (1996) and a mildly ionized fe k-edge at 7.37 kev. the kalpha line and coldabsorption are consistent with origin in a accretion disk/torus through whichour line-of-sight passes at a radial distance of $\sim 50$ pc. the fe k-edge ismildly ionized suggesting the presence of ionized gas probably in the inneraccretion disk, close to the central source or in a separate warm absorber. thedata quality is too low to distinguish between these possibilities but theedge-on geometry implied by the water maser emission favors the former.comparison with earlier observations of eso103-g35 shows little/no change inspectral parameters while the flux changes by factors of a few on timescales ofa few months. the 2--10 kev flux decreased by a factor of 2.7 between oct 1996and oct 1997 with no detectable change in the count rate &gt;20 kev suggesting aconstant or delayed response reflection component. the high energy cutoff islower than the typical 300kev values seen in seyfert galaxies. a significantsubset of similar sources would affect current models of the agn contributionto the cosmic x-ray background which generally assume a high energy cutoff of300 kev.

astro-ph;0104263	evolution of active galaxies: black-hole mass - bulge relations for  narrow line objects	mathur (2000) has proposed that the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1s)are likely to be the active galaxies in early stage of evolution. to test thishypothesis, we have calculated the black hole (bh) masses and the host galaxybulge masses for a sample of nls1s. we find that the mean bh to bulge massratio of nls1s is significantly smaller than that for normal seyfert galaxies.we also find that the ratio of bh mass to bulge velocity dispersion is alsosignificantly smaller for nls1s. a scenario of bh growth is our preferredinterpretation, though alternative explanations are discussed. assuming thatthe bhs grow with accretion with a radiative efficiency of 0.1, it will takethem about $3.3\times 10^8$ years to become as massive as in normal seyfert 1s.these timescales are consistent with the theoretical estimates of quasartimescale $t_q$ less than about $4.5\times 10^8$ years calculated by haehnelt,natarajan &amp; rees (1998). studies of low redshift nls1s thus provide a powerful,and due to their proximity relatively easy, way to understand the high redshiftquasars and their evolution.

astro-ph;0105258	a chandra survey of broad absorption line quasars	we have carried out a survey with the chandra x-ray observatory of a sampleof 10 optically bright broad absorption line (bal) qsos. eight out of tensources are detected. the 6 brightest x-ray sources have only high ionizationbals (hibals), while the 4 faintest all show low ionization bals (lobals). weperform a combined spectral fit for hibal qsos to determine the mean spectralparameters of this sample. we derive an underlying best-fit power-law slopegamma=1.8+/-0.35, consistent with the mean slope for radio-quiet quasars fromasca, but balqsos require a (restframe) absorbing column of 6.5e22, with apartial covering fraction of 80%. removing the absorption component from ourbest-fit spectral model yields a range of alphaox from 1.55 to 2.28. all 6hibal qsos have de-absorbed x-ray emission consistent with non-bal qsos ofsimilar luminosity. the spectral energy distributions of the hibal qsos - boththe underlying power-law slope and alphaox provide the first conclusiveevidence that balqsos have appeared to be x-ray weak because of intrinsicabsorption, and that their underlying emission is consistent with non-bal qsos.by contrast, removal of the best-fit absorption column detected in the hibalqsos still leaves the 4 lobal qsos as unusually x-ray faint for their opticalluminosities.

astro-ph;0402236	chandra observations of x-ray weak narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we present chandra observations of 17 optically-selected, x-ray weaknarrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies. these objects were optically identifiedby williams et al. (2002) in the sloan digital sky survey early data release,but were not found in the rosat all-sky survey (rass) despite having opticalproperties similar to rass-detected nls1s. all objects in this sample weredetected by chandra and exhibit a range of 0.5-2 kev photon indicesgamma=1.1-3.4. one object was not detected in the soft band, but has a best-fitgamma=0.25 over the full 0.5-8 kev range. these photon indices extend to valuesfar below what are normally observed in nls1s. a composite x-ray spectrum ofthe hardest objects in this sample does not show any signs of absorption,although the data do not prohibit one or two of the objects from being highlyabsorbed. we also find a strong correlation between gamma and l_1kev; this maybe due to differences in l_bol/l_edd among the nls1s in this sample. suchvariations are seemingly in conflict with the current paradigm that nls1saccrete near the eddington limit. most importantly, this sample shows thatstrong, ultrasoft x-ray emission is not a universal characteristic of nls1s; infact, a substantial number may exhibit weak and/or low-gamma x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0504159	super-solar metallicity in the nls1 galaxy markarian 1044	the determination of the bulk metallicity and the abundance mixture ofvarious elements is very difficult in quasars and agns because only a few linesare observed and the ionization correction is unknown. most abundance studiesof agns assume the n/c ratio scales as metallicity (nitrogen goes asmetallicity squared) and so serves as a metallicity indicator. we present anaccurate metallicity determination of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxymarkarian 1044, using o vi column density measurements from the far ultravioletspectroscopic explorer (fuse) together with c iv, n v, and h i from hubblespace telescope (hst) observations. in this absorption line study we find thatthe circumnuclear gas in mrk 1044 has a metallicity of at least five timessolar. this is consistent with the expectation that nls1s have a highmetallicity, similar to that found in high-redshift quasars. more surprisingly,we find that the absorbing material requires a near-solar mixture. in otherwords, the n/c is consistent with the solar ratio, and does not scale with themetallicity. this suggests that the chemical enrichment scenario for thisobject, and perhaps for agns in general, may be different from the traditionalmodel of galactic metal enrichment, at least in the high-metallicity regime.

astro-ph;0601620	xmm-newton view of the z&gt;0 warm-hot intergalactic medium toward  markarian 421	the recent detection with chandra of two warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim)filaments toward mrk 421 by nicastro et al. provides a measurement of the bulkof the "missing baryons" in the nearby universe. since mrk 421 is a brightx-ray source, it is also frequently observed by the xmm-newton reflectiongrating spectrometer (rgs) for calibration purposes. using all availablearchived xmm observations of this source with small pointing offsets (&lt;15"), weconstruct the highest-quality xmm grating spectrum of mrk 421 to date with anet exposure time (excluding periods of high background flux) of 437 ks and\~15000 counts per resolution element at 21.6a, more than twice that of thechandra spectrum. despite the long exposure time neither of the two interveningabsorption systems is seen, though the upper limits derived are consistent withthe chandra equivalent width measurements. this appears to result from (1) thelarger number of narrow instrumental features caused by bad detector columns,(2) the degraded resolution of xmm/rgs as compared to the chandra/letg, and (3)fixed pattern noise at \lambda &gt; 29a. the non-detection of the whim absorbersby xmm is thus fully consistent with the chandra measurement.

astro-ph;0610435	hubble space telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy of fourteen low-redshift  quasars	we present low-resolution ultraviolet spectra of 14 low redshift (z&lt;0.8)quasars observed with hst/stis as part of a snap project to understand therelationship between quasar outflows and luminosity. by design, allobservations cover the civ emission line. nine of the quasars are from thehamburg-eso catalog, three are from the palomar-green catalog, and one is fromthe parkes catalog. the sample contains a few interesting quasars including twobroad absorption line (bal) quasars (he0143-3535, he0436-2614), one quasar witha mini-bal (he1105-0746), and one quasar with associated narrow absorption(he0409-5004). these bal quasars are among the brightest known (though not themost luminous) since they lie at z&lt;0.8. we compare the properties of these balquasars to the z&lt;0.5 palomar-green and z&gt;1.4 large bright quasar samples. bydesign, our objects sample luminosities in between these two surveys, and ourfour absorbed objects are consistent with the v ~ l^0.62 relation derived bylaor &amp; brandt (2002). another quasar, he0441-2826, contains extremely weakemission lines and our spectrum is consistent with a simple power-lawcontinuum. the quasar is radio-loud, but has a steep spectral index and alobe-dominated morphology, which argues against it being a blazar. the unusualspectrum of this quasar resembles the spectra of the quasars pg1407+265,sdssj1136+0242, and pks1004+13 for which several possible explanations havebeen entertained.

astro-ph;0611578	the weak absorbing outflow in agn mrk 279: evidence of super-solar metal  abundances	we present analysis and photoionization modeling of the chandra highresolution spectrum of mrk 279. there is clear evidence of an absorbing outflowwhich is best fit by a two component model, one with a low ionization parameterand one with a higher ionization parameter. the column density of the x-raywarm absorber, about log n_h=20, is the smallest known of all agns in whichx-ray absorbing outflows are observed. we find that the x-ray and uv/fuvabsorbers are part of the same overall outflow. there is some evidence ofsuper-solar carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron in the chandra spectrum of mrk279. while this is not a robust result in itself, chandra data in combinationwith the uv data and the pressure equilibrium between two phases of theoutflow, support the scenario of super-solar abundances. this the first casewhere super-solar abundances are reported in the nucleus of a normal seyfertgalaxy. the data suggest that the outflow originates from a compact regionaround the nuclear black hole and that it carries insignificant amount of massand energy.

astro-ph;0611583	chandra and far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer observations of z~0  warm-hot gas toward pks 2155-304	the x-ray bright z=0.116 quasar pks 2155-304 is frequently observed as achandra calibration source, with a total of 483 ksec of low energy transmissiongrating (letg) exposure time accumulated through may 2006. highly-ionized metalabsorption lines, including numerous lines at z=0 and a putative oviii k-alphaline at z=0.055, have been reported in past chandra studies of this source.using all available chandra letg spectra and analysis techniques developed forsuch z=0 x-ray absorption along other sightlines, we revisit these previousdetections. we detect 4 absorption lines at &gt;3\sigma significance (oviik-alpha/beta, oviii k-alpha, and neix k-alpha), with ovii k-alpha being a7.3\sigma detection. the 1\sigma ranges of z=0 ovii column density and dopplerparameter are consistent with those derived for mrk 421 and within 2\sigma ofthe mrk 279 absorption. temperatures and densities inferred from the relativeovii and other ionic column densities are found to be consistent with eitherthe local warm-hot intergalactic medium or a galactic corona. unlike the localx-ray absorbers seen in other sightlines, a link with the low- or high-velocityfar-ultraviolet ovi absorption lines cannot be ruled out. the z=0.055 oviiiabsorption reported by fang et al. is seen with 3.5\sigma confidence in theacis/letg spectrum, but no other absorption lines are found at the sameredshift.

astro-ph;0611819	revisiting the black hole masses of soft x-ray-selected active galactic  nuclei	in our previous work, using luminosity and the h-beta fwhm as surrogates forblack hole mass (m_bh), we compared the black hole masses of narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxies (nls1s) and broad-line seyfert 1 galaxies (bls1s) in asample of soft x-ray-selected active galactic nuclei. we found that thedistributions of black hole masses in the two populations are statisticallydifferent. recent work shows that the second moment of the h-beta emission line(the line dispersion) is a better estimator of black hole mass than fwhm. totest whether changing the width measure affects our results, we calculate linedispersion-based black hole masses for our sample. we find that using the linedispersion rather than the fwhm as a measure of the gas velocity shifts nls1and bls1 virial product distributions closer together, but they remaindistinct. on the m_bh-sigma plane, we find that using the line dispersionleaves nls1s below the m_bh-sigma relation, but to a less significant degreethan when fwhm is used to calculate black hole masses (the [oiii] 5007a fwhm isused as a surrogate for the bulge stellar velocity dispersion). the level ofsignificance of our findings is such that we cannot draw firm conclusions onthe location of the two samples on the m_bh-sigma plane. we are still left withtwo alternative scenarios: either (1) nls1s lie below the m_bh-sigma relationindicating that their black hole masses are growing, or (2) nls1s lie on them_bh-sigma relation, so they preferentially reside in smaller mass, lessluminous galaxies; the present data do not allow us to choose one over theother. more trustworthy stellar velocity dispersions and accurate black holemass measurements are required for a firmer statement about the locus of nls1son the m_bh-sigma plane.

astro-ph;0701515	on the faint end of the high redshift agn luminosity function	using the results of recent optical surveys we conclude that the {\itnon}-detection of quasars down to faint magnitudes implies a significantflattening of the high redshift (z~6) optical active galactic nuclei (agn)luminosity function for m_{1450}&gt;-24.7. we find that all the data areconsistent with a faint-end slope for the optical agn luminosity function of\beta=-2.2 and \beta=-2.8, at the 90% and 99% confidence level respectively,flatter than the bright-end slope of \beta'~ -3.2. we also show that x-ray deepsurveys have probed even fainter magnitudes than the optical ones yielding moresignificant constraints on the shallow faint-end slope of the opticalluminosity function. the inclusion of type ii agn candidates, detected in thechandra deep fields, hints towards an higher normalization for the total agnluminosity function, if these sources lie at 5&lt;z &lt;6.5. we then discuss simpletheoretical models of agn formation and evolution in the context of cold darkmatter cosmology. the comparison with the total agn luminosity function favorsa redshift-dependent relation between black hole and dark matter halo masses ofthe type m_bh~m_ halo^\alpha, with 1.3&lt; \alpha&lt; 1.7, compatible withindependent studies from statistical analysis and rotation curve measurements.finally we compute the quasar contribution to reionization to be &lt;9% at z~6, upto ~30% when integrated within 5.5&lt; z&lt;6.5, significantly smaller than that fromgalaxies.

astro-ph;0702399	the compact, conical, accretion-disk warm absorber of the seyfert 1  galaxy ngc 4051 and its implications for igm-galaxy feedback processes	(abridged) using a 100 ks xmm-newton exposure of ngc 4051, we show that thetime evolution of the ionization state of the x-ray absorbers in response tothe rapid and highly variable x-ray continuum constrains all the main physicaland geometrical properties of an agn warm absorber wind. the absorber consistsof two different ionization components. by tracking the response in the opacityof the gas in each component to changes in the ionizing continuum, we were ableto constrain the electron density of the system. the measured densities requirethat the high and low ionization absorbing components of ngc 4051 must becompact, at distances 0.5-1.0 l-d (2200 - 4400rs) and &lt; 3.5 l-d (&lt; 15800rs)from the continuum source, respectively. this rules out an origin in the dustyobscuring torus, as the dust sublimation radius is at least an order ofmagnitude larger (&gt;12 l-d). an accretion disk origin for the warm absorber windis strongly suggested, and an association with the high ionization, heiiemitting, broad emission line region (radius &lt;2 l-d) is possible. the twodetected phases are consistent with pressure equilibrium, which suggests thatthe absorber consists of a two phase medium. a radial flow in a sphericalgeometry is unlikely, and a conical wind geometry is preferred. the impliedmass outflow rate from this wind, can be well constrained, and is 2-5% of themass accretion rate. if the mass outflow rate scaling with accretion rate isrepresentative of all quasars, our results imply that warm absorbers inpowerful quasars are unlikely to produce important evolutionary effects ontheir larger environment, unless we are observing the winds before they getfully accelerated. only in such a scenario can agn winds be important forcosmic feedback.

astro-ph;9510006	optical detection of the hidden nuclear engine in ngc~4258	the sub-parsec masing disk recently found to be orbiting a central mass of$\sim3.6\times10^7$~\msun\ in the seyfert/liner galaxy ngc~4258 provides themost compelling evidence to date for the existence of a massive black hole inthe nucleus of a galaxy. the disk is oriented nearly edge-on %($\bf i=83$\deg)and the x-ray spectrum %(makishima \etal\ 1994) is heavily absorbed. therefore,in this galaxy, the optical emission-line spectrum generally exhibited by anactive galactic nucleus is perhaps best sought using polarized light: probingfor light scattered off material surrounding the central source. newpolarimetry of ngc~4258 has uncovered a compact polarized nucleus whosespectrum consists of a faint blue continuum similar to those of unobscuredquasars ($f_\nu\propto\nu^{-1.1}$), plus broadened (\twid1000\kms) emissionlines. the lines are strongly linearly polarized ($5-10$\%) at a position angle(85\deg$\pm$2\deg) coincident with the plane of the maser disk. this resultprovides substantiating evidence for a weakly active central engine in ngc~4258and for the existence of obscuring, orbiting tori which impart many of theperceived distinctions between various types of active galaxy.

astro-ph;9512032	broad absorption line qsos observed by the rosat pspc	recent results from the rosat all-sky survey (rass) have shown that broadabsorption line (bal) qsos are either highly absorbed or underluminous in thesoft x-ray bandpass. here, we extend this work by analyzing all known bona fidebalqsos observed within the inner 20' of the rosat pspc. this sample includesboth targeted and serendipitous exposures ranging from 8 to 75 ksec. despitethese deep exposures, most of the balqsos are undetected, and have unusuallyweak x-ray emission, as evidenced by large optical-to-x-ray slopes (aox). largevalues of aox ($\gapprox$1.8) may prove to be a defining characteristic ofbalqsos. we predict that samples of qso candidates with large aox will yield ahigher percentage of balqsos, particularly at low redshift. as a corollary,x-ray-selected qso samples should yield the optical/uv emission line spectra ofbal and non-bal qsos are quite similar, suggesting that their intrinsicspectral energy distributions are similar as well. absorption thus seems thelikely reason for the x-ray quiet nature of balqsos. to constrain the totalabsorbing column of the bal clouds, we compare our measured soft x-ray fluxesor upper limits to those expected from normal radio quiet qsos of comparableoptical continuum magnitude and redshift. from sensitive x-ray observations, wederive column densities of greater than about 2 times 10^22 cm-2, for intrinsiccold absorbers of solar metallicity. these new results suggest columns {\em atleast} an order of magnitude larger than the columns previously estimated fromoptical/uv spectra alone.

astro-ph;9610107	the x-ray warm absorber in ngc3516	the seyfert 1 galaxy, ngc3516 has been the subject of many absorption linestudies at both ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths. in the uv, strong, broad,variable associated metal line absorption with velocity width $\sim 2000$ \kms\is thought to originate in gas with nh larger than about $10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$lying between 0.01 and 9 pc from the central active nucleus. the ginga x-raydata are consistent with several possibilities: a warm absorber and a coldabsorber combined either with partial covering or an unusually strongreflection spectrum. we present rosat observations of ngc3516 which show astrong detection of a warm absorber dominated by a blend of ovii/oviii edges at$\sim$ 0.8 kev with nh $\sim 7\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and u: 8--12. we arguethat ngc3516 contains an outflowing `xuv' absorber showing the presence ofx-ray absorption edges, that are consistent with the presence of broadabsorption lines in the old iue spectra and their disappearance in the new uvobservations. our dynamical model suggests that the ovii absorption edge willcontinue to weaken compared to the oviii edge, an easily testable predictionwith future missions like axaf. eventually the source would be transparent tothe x-rays unless a new absorption system is produced.

astro-ph;9702207	evidence against bals in the x-ray bright qso pg1416-129	recent results from the rosat all sky survey, and from deep rosat pointingsreveal that broad absorption line quasars (balqsos) are weak in the soft x-raybandpass (with optical-to-x-ray spectral slope alpha_{ox}&gt;1.8) in comparison toqsos with normal ouv spectra (mean alpha_{ox}=1.4). one glaring exceptionappeared to be the nearby balqso pg1416-129, which is a bright rosat sourceshowing no evidence for intrinsic soft x-ray absorption. we present here ournew hst fos spectrum of pg1416-129, in which we find no evidence for bals. weshow that the features resulting in the original bal classification, based oniue spectra, were probably spurious. on the basis of uv, x-ray and opticalevidence, we conclude that pg1416-129, is not now, and has never been a balqso.our result suggests that weak soft x-ray emission is a defining characteristicof true balqsos. if balqsos indeed harbor normal intrinsic spectral energydistributions, their observed soft x-ray weakness is most likely the result ofabsorption. the ubiquitous occurrence of weak soft x-ray emission with uvabsorption (bals) thus suggests absorbers in each energy regime that arephysically associated, if not identical.

astro-ph;9703015	x-ray absorption towards the einstein ring source pks1830-211	pks1830-211 is an unusually radio-loud gravitationally lensed quasar. in theradio, the system appears as two compact, dominant features surrounded byrelatively extended radio emission which forms an einstein ring. as the line ofsight to it passes close to our galactic center, pks1830-211 has not beendetected in wave-bands other than the radio and x-ray so far. here we presentx-ray data of pks1830-211 observed with rosat pspc. the x-ray spectrum showsthat absorption in excess of the galactic contribution is highly likely, whichat the redshift of the lensing galaxy ($z_l=0.886$) corresponds ton$_h=3.5^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\times 10^{22}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$. the effective opticalextinction is large, a$_v$(observed)\gax5.8. when corrected for this additionalextinction, the two point optical to x-ray slope \aox\ of pks1830-211 lies justwithin the observed range of quasars. it is argued here that both compactimages must be covered by the x-ray absorber(s) which we infer to be thelensing galaxy(galaxies). the dust to gas ratio along the line of sight withinthe lensing galaxy is likely to be somewhat larger than for our galaxy.

astro-ph;9806275	ngc 7582: the prototype narrow-line x-ray galaxy	ngc 7582 is a candidate prototype of the narrow line x-ray galaxies (nlxgs)found in deep x-ray surveys. an asca observation shows the hard (&gt; 3 kev) x-raycontinuum of ngc 7582 drops 40% in ~6 ks, implying an agn, while the soft band(&lt; 3 kev) does not drop in concert with the hard continuum, requiring aseparate component. the x-ray spectrum of ngc 7582 also shows a clear 0.5-2 kevsoft (kt = 0.8 (+0.9,-0.3) kev or gamma = 2.4 +/- 0.6; l(x) = 6 x 10**40 ergss**-1) low--energy component, in addition to a heavily absorbed [n(h) = (6 +/-2)\times 10**22 cm**-2 ] and variable 2-10 kev power law [gamma = 0.7(+0.3,-0.4); l(x) = (1.7-2.3) x 10**42 ergs s**-1]. this is one of the flattest2-10 kev slopes in any agn observed with asca. (the rosat hri image of ngc 7582further suggests extent to the se.)  these observations make it clear that the hard x-ray emission of ngc 7582,the most "narrow-line" of the nlxgs, is associated with an agn. the strongsuggestion is that all nlxgs are obscured agns, as hypothesized to explain thex-ray background spectral paradox. the separate soft x-ray component makes ngc7582 (and by extension other nlxgs) detectable as a rosat source.

astro-ph;9901275	multiple velocity components in the civ absorption line of ngc5548	we have observed the much studied seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548 with the ghrsspectrometer on hst. our 14ksec observation covers the civ emission line at aresolution of &gt;20,000. our purpose was to study the absorption line found atlower resolution by iue and hst/fos. we found that the civ absorption lineresolves into 6 separate doublets with ews of 0.07\aa--0.38\aa. the absorptionlines have blueshifts relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy of 380 --1250 km/s, except for one which has a redshift of 250 km/s, suggesting bothinflow and outflow. the inflowing component may be related to the accretionflow into the nuclear black hole. all the doublet lines are resolved by theghrs. three doublets are narrow with fwhm\lax100 km/s, and three are broad,fwhm \sim 160--290 km/s . we find evidence of partial covering by the narrowabsorption lines. either (but not both) of the two strongest broad doubletscould be from the same material that produces the x-ray ionized absorber seenin soft x-rays. the remaining five systems must be at least 10 times lessionized (and so of lower total column density) to remain consistent with thex-ray spectra.
