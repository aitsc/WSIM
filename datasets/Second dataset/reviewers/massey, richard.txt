0908.0945	results of the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	we present the results of the great08 challenge, a blind analysis challengeto infer weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from images. the primarygoal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchersoutside the shear measurement community. six great08 team methods werepresented at the launch of the challenge and five additional groups submittedresults during the 6 month competition. participants analyzed 30 millionsimulated galaxies with a range in signal to noise ratio, point-spread functionellipticity, galaxy size, and galaxy type. the large quantity of simulationsallowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracysuitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the firsttime. different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameterspace and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. anumber of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the challenge including are-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies,which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. the imagesimulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future great challenges,meanwhile the great08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additionaldevelopments in shear measurement algorithms.

1001.1739	the dark matter of gravitational lensing	we review progress in understanding dark matter by astrophysics, andparticularly via the effect of gravitational lensing. evidence from manydifferent directions now all imply that five sixths of the material content ofthe universe is in this mysterious form, separate from and beyond the ordinary"baryonic" particles in the standard model of particle physics. dark matterappears not to interact via the electromagnetic force, and therefore neitheremits nor reflects light. however, it definitely does interact via gravity, andhas played the most important role in shaping the universe on large scales. themost successful technique with which to investigate it has so far been theeffect of gravitational lensing. the curvature of space-time near anygravitating mass (including dark matter) deflects passing rays of light -observably shifting, distorting and magnifying the images of backgroundgalaxies. measurements of such effects currently provide constraints on themean density of dark matter, and its density relative to baryonic matter; thesize and mass of individual dark matter particles; and its cross section undervarious fundamental forces.

1002.1479	the effects of charge transfer inefficiency (cti) on galaxy shape  measurements	(abridged) we examine the effects of charge transfer inefficiency (cti)during ccd readout on galaxy shape measurements required by studies of weakgravitational lensing. we simulate a ccd readout with cti such as that causedby charged particle radiation damage. we verify our simulations on data fromlaboratory-irradiated ccds. only charge traps with time constants of the sameorder as the time between row transfers during readout affect galaxy shapemeasurements. we characterize the effects of cti on various galaxy populations.we baseline our study around p-channel ccds that have been shown to have chargetransfer efficiency up to an order of magnitude better than several models ofn-channel ccds designed for space applications. we predict that for galaxiesfurthest from the readout registers, bias in the measurement of galaxy shapes,delta(e), will increase at a rate of 2.65 +/- 0.02 x 10^(-4) per year at l2 foraccumulated radiation exposure averaged over the solar cycle. if uncorrected,this will consume the entire shape measurement error budget of a dark energymission within about 4 years. software mitigation techniques demonstratedelsewhere can reduce this by a factor of ~10, bringing the effect well belowmission requirements. ccds with higher cti than the ones we studeied may notmeet the requirements of future dark energy missions. we discuss ways in whichhardware could be designed to further minimize the impact of cti.

1005.2193	using faraday rotation to probe mhd instabilities in intracluster media	it has recently been suggested that conduction-driven magnetohydrodynamic(mhd) instabilities may operate at all radii within an intracluster medium(icm), and profoundly affect the structure of a cluster's magnetic field. wheremhd instabilities dominate the dynamics of an icm, they will re-orient magneticfield lines perpendicular to the temperature gradient inside a cooling core, orparallel to the temperature gradient outside it. this characteristic structureof magnetic field could be probed by measurements of polarized radio emissionfrom background sources. motivated by this possibility we have constructed 3-dmodels of a magnetized cooling core cluster and calculated faraday rotationmeasure (rm) maps in the plane of the sky under realistic observing conditions.we compare a scenario in which magnetic field geometry is characterized byconduction driven mhd instabilities to that where it is determined by isotropicturbulent motions. we find that future high-sensitivity spectro-polarimetricmeasurements of rm, such as will be enabled by the expanded very large arrayand square kilometer array can distinguish between these two cases withplausible exposure times. such observations will test the existence ofconduction-driven mhd instabilities in dynamically relaxed cooling coreclusters. more generally, our findings imply that observations of faraday rmshould be able to discern physical mechanisms that result in qualitativelydifferent magnetic field topologies, without a priori knowledge about thenature of the processes.

1007.1924	cluster bulleticity	the unique properties of dark matter are revealed during collisions betweenclusters of galaxies, like the bullet cluster (1e 0657-56) and baby bullet(macsj0025-12). these systems provide evidence for an additional, invisiblemass in the separation between the distribution of their total mass, measuredvia gravitational lensing, and their ordinary 'baryonic' matter, measured viaits x-ray emission. unfortunately, the information available from these systemsis limited by their rarity. constraints on the properties of dark matter, suchas its interaction cross-section, are therefore restricted by uncertainties inthe individual systems' impact velocity, impact parameter and orientation withrespect to the line of sight.  here we develop a complementary, statistical measurement in which every pieceof substructure falling into every massive cluster is treated as a bullet. wedefine 'bulleticity' as the mean separation between dark matter and ordinarymatter, and we measure the signal in hydrodynamical simulations. the phasespace of substructure orbits also exhibits symmetries that provide anequivalent control test.  any detection of bulleticity in real data would indicate a difference in theinteraction cross-sections of baryonic and dark matter that may rule outhypotheses of non-particulate dark matter that are otherwise able to modelindividual systems. a subsequent measurement of bulleticity could constrain thedark matter cross-section. even with conservative estimates, the existing hstarchive should yield an independent constraint tighter than that from thebullet cluster. this technique is then trivially extendable to, and benefitsenormously from larger, future surveys.

1009.0779	gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2010 (great10) challenge handbook	gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2010 (great10) is a public imageanalysis challenge aimed at the development of algorithms to analyzeastronomical images. specifically, the challenge is to measure varying imagedistortions in the presence of a variable convolution kernel, pixelization andnoise. this is the second in a series of challenges set to the astronomy,computer science and statistics communities, providing a structured environmentin which methods can be improved and tested in preparation for plannedastronomical surveys. great10 extends upon previous work by introducingvariable fields into the challenge. the "galaxy challenge" involves the precisemeasurement of galaxy shape distortions, quantified locally by two parameterscalled shear, in the presence of a known convolution kernel. crucially, theconvolution kernel and the simulated gravitational lensing shape distortionboth now vary as a function of position within the images, as is the case forreal data. in addition, we introduce the "star challenge" that concerns thereconstruction of a variable convolution kernel, similar to that in a typicalastronomical observation. this document details the great10 challenge forpotential participants. continually updated information is also available fromhttp://www.greatchallenges.info.

0709.1479	weak lensing ellipticities in a strong lensing regime	it is now routine to measure the weak gravitational lensing shear signal fromthe mean ellipticity of distant galaxies. however, conversion betweenellipticity and shear assumes local linearity of the lensing potential (ie thatthe spatial derivatives of the shear are small), and this condition is notsatisfied in some of the most interesting regions of the sky. we extend aderivation of lensing equations to include higher order terms, and assess thelevel of biases introduced by assuming that first-order weak lensing theoryholds in a relatively strong shear regime. we find that, even in a worst-casescenario, a fully linear analysis is accurate to within 1% outside ~1.07 timesthe einstein radius of a lens, by deriving an analytic function that can beused to estimate the applicability of any first-order analysis. the effect istoo small to explain the discrepancy between weak- and strong-lensing estimatesof the mass of the bullet cluster, and should not impact cluster surveys forthe forseeable future. in fact, it means that arclets can be used to measureshears closer to a cluster core than has been generally appreciated. however,at the level of accuracy demanded by future lensing surveys, this bias ought tobe considered in measurements of the inner slope of cluster mass distributionsand the small-scale end of the mass power spectrum. both of these are centralin determining the relationship between baryonic and dark matter.

1104.0928	new constraints on the evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter  connection: a combined analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering, and  stellar mass functions from z=0.2 to z=1	using data from the cosmos survey, we perform the first joint analysis ofgalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy numberdensities. carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter betweenstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using anovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. our results provide strongconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo massrelation (shmr) from z=0.2 to z=1. at low stellar mass, we find that halo massscales as mh m*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly withredshift to z=1. we show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, mh/m*, varies from lowto high masses, reaching a minimum of mh/m*~27 at m*=4.5x10^10 msun andmh=1.2x10^12 msun. this minimum is important for models of galaxy formationbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of thecentral galaxy has been the most efficient. we describe the shmr at thisminimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", m*piv, the "pivot halo mass",mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", (mh/m*)piv. thanks to a homogeneous analysis of asingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends forboth mhpiv and m*piv. the pivot stellar mass decreases fromm*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 msun at z=0.88 to m*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 msun at z=0.37.intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of mhpiv leaves the pivotratio constant with redshift at (mh/m*)piv~27. we use simple arguments to showhow this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching mayultimately depend on mh/m* and not simply mh, as is commonly assumed. we showthat simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in thesites of star formation. finally, we discuss the implications of our results inthe context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and agnfeedback.

1106.5805	lossy compression of weak lensing data	future orbiting observatories will survey large areas of sky in order toconstrain the physics of dark matter and dark energy using weak gravitationallensing and other methods. lossy compression of the resultant data will improvethe cost and feasibility of transmitting the images through the spacecommunication network. we evaluate the consequences of the lossy compressionalgorithm of bernstein et al. (2010) for the high-precision measurement ofweak-lensing galaxy ellipticities. this square-root algorithm compresses eachpixel independently, and the information discarded is by construction less thanthe poisson error from photon shot noise. for simulated space-based images(without cosmic rays) digitized to the typical 16 bits per pixel, applicationof the lossy compression followed by image-wise lossless compression yieldsimages with only 2.4 bits per pixel, a factor of 6.7 compression. wedemonstrate that this compression introduces no bias in the sky background. thecompression introduces a small amount of additional digitization noise to theimages, and we demonstrate a corresponding small increase in ellipticitymeasurement noise. the ellipticity measurement method is biased by the additionof noise, so the additional digitization noise is expected to induce amultiplicative bias on the galaxies' measured ellipticities. after correctingfor this known noise-induced bias, we find a residual multiplicativeellipticity bias of m ~ -4x10^{-4}. this bias is small when compared to themany other issues that precision weak lensing surveys must confront, andfurthermore we expect it to be reduced further with better calibration ofellipticity measurement methods.

1108.1981	weak lensing measurement of galaxy clusters in the cfhtls-wide survey	we present the first weak gravitational lensing analysis of the completedcanada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls). we study the 64 squaredegrees w1 field, the largest of the cfhtls-wide survey fields, and present thelargest contiguous weak lensing convergence "mass map" yet made. 2.66 milliongalaxy shapes are measured, using a ksb pipeline verified againsthigh-resolution hubble space telescope imaging that covers part of the cfhtls.our i'-band measurements are also consistent with an analysis of independentr'-band imaging. the reconstructed lensing convergence map contains 301 peakswith signal-to-noise ratio {\nu}&gt;3.5, consistent with predictions of a{\lambda}cdm model. of these peaks, 126 lie within 3.0' of a bcg identifiedfrom multicolor optical imaging in an independent, red sequence survey. we alsoidentify 7 counterparts for massive clusters previously seen in x-ray emissionwithin 6 square degrees xmm-lss survey. with photometric redshift estimates forthe source galaxies, we use a tomographic lensing method to fit the redshiftand mass of each convergence peak. matching these to the optical observations,we confirm 85 groups/clusters with \chi^2 reduced &lt; 3.0, at a mean redshift&lt;z_c&gt; = 0.36 and velocity dispersion &lt;\sigma_c&gt; = 658.8 km/s. future surveys,such as des, lsst, kdust and euclid, will be able to apply these sametechniques to map clusters in much larger volumes and thus tightly constraincosmological models.

0710.3588	a comparison of weak lensing measurements from ground- and space-based  facilities	we assess the relative merits of weak lensing surveys, using overlappingimaging data from the ground-based subaru telescope and the hubble spacetelescope (hst). our tests complement similar studies undertaken with simulateddata. from observations of 230,000 matched objects in the 2 square degreecosmos field, we identify the limit at which faint galaxy shapes can bereliably measured from the ground. our ground-based shear catalog achievessub-percent calibration bias compared to high resolution space-based data, forgalaxies brighter than i'~24.5 and with half-light radii larger than 1.8". thisselection corresponds to a surface density of ~15 galaxies per sq arcmincompared to ~71 per sq arcmin from space. on the other hand the survey speed ofcurrent ground-based facilities is much faster than that of hst, although thisgain is mitigated by the increased depth of space-based imaging desirable fortomographic (3d) analyses. as an independent experiment, we also reconstructthe projected mass distribution in the cosmos field using both data sets, andcompare the derived cluster catalogs with those from x-ray observations. theground-based catalog achieves a reasonable degree of completeness, with minimalcontamination and no detected bias, for massive clusters at redshifts0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5. the space-based data provide improved precision and a greatersensitivity to clusters of lower mass or at higher redshift.

1202.6491	cosmos: stochastic bias from measurements of weak lensing and galaxy  clustering	in the theory of structure formation, galaxies are biased tracers of theunderlying matter density field. the statistical relation between galaxy andmatter density field is commonly referred as galaxy bias. in this paper, wetest the linear bias model with weak-lensing and galaxy clustering measurementsin the 2 square degrees cosmos field (scoville et al. 2007). we estimate thebias of galaxies between redshifts z=0.2 and z=1, and over correlation scalesbetween r=0.2 h^-1 mpc and r=15 h^-1 mpc. we focus on three galaxy samples,selected in flux (simultaneous cuts i_814w &lt; 26.5 and k_s &lt; 24), and instellar-mass (10^9 &lt; m_* &lt; 10^10 h^-2 msun and 10^10 &lt; m^*&lt; 10^11 h^-2 msun).at scales r &gt; 2 h^-1 mpc, our measurements support a model of bias increasingwith redshift. the tinker et al. (2010) fitting function provides a good fit tothe data. we find the best fit mass of the galaxy halos to be log(m_200 h^-1msun) = 11.7^+0.6_-1.3 and log(m_200 h^-1 msun) = 12.4^+0.2_-2.9 respectivelyfor the low and high stellar-mass samples. in the halo model framework, bias isscale-dependent with a change of slope at the transition scale between the oneand the two halo terms. we detect a scale-dependence of bias with a turn-downat scale r=2.3\pm1.5 h^-1 mpc, in agreement with previous galaxy clusteringstudies. we find no significant amount of stochasticity, suggesting that alinear bias model is sufficient to describe our data. we use n-body simulationsto quantify both the amount of cosmic variance and systematic errors in themeasurement.

1205.4245	the correlated formation histories of massive galaxies and their dark  matter halos	using observations in the cosmos field, we report an intriguing correlationbetween the star formation activity of massive (~10^{11.4}\msol) centralgalaxies, their stellar masses, and the large-scale (~10 mpc) environments oftheir group-mass (~10^{13.6}\msol) dark matter halos. probing the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an x-raydetected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relationderived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. at z=1,we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two lessthan in passive centrals at the same halo mass. this implies that the presenceor lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochasticprocess. by z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the differentgrowth rates of these objects. a similar but weaker trend is observed whendividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. remarkably, wefind that star-forming centrals at z~1 live in groups that are significantlymore clustered on 10 mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passivecentrals. we discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recentsimulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higherangular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halosare known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. if confirmed, thiswould be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history ofhalos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that forminside them.

1205.4262	galaxies in x-ray groups. ii. a weak lensing study of halo centering	locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding themass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massivegalaxies that they host. the task is observationally challenging because wecannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or x-rayemission from hot plasma are imperfect. in this paper we quantify theconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129x-ray selected galaxy groups in the cosmos field with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 and halomasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 m_sun. by measuring the stacked lensingsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest membergalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the x-ray centroid), wedetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. in thissample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the x-ray centroids tracethe center of mass to &lt;~75 kpc, while the x-ray position and centroids based onthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to thestatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiplebright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles thatare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.we find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is notaddressed.

1209.2143	on dark peaks and missing mass: a weak lensing mass reconstruction of  the merging cluster system abell 520	merging clusters of galaxies are unique in their power to directly probe andplace limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. detailedobservations of several merging clusters have shown the intracluster gas to bedisplaced from the centroids of dark matter and galaxy density by ram pressure,while the latter components are spatially coincident, consistent withcollisionless dark matter. this has been used to place upper limits on the darkmatter particle self-inteaction cross-section of order 1 cm^2/g. the clusterabell 520 has been seen as a possible exception. we revisit a520 presenting newhst acs mosaic images and a magellan image set. we perform a detailed weaklensing analysis and show that the weak lensing mass measurements andmorphologies of the core galaxy-filled structures are mostly in good agreementwith previous works. there is however one significant difference -- we do notdetect the previously claimed "dark core" that contains excess mass with nosignificant galaxy overdensity at the location of the x-ray plasma. this peakhas been suggested to be indicative of a large self-interaction cross-sectionfor dark matter (at least ~5 sigma larger than the upper limit of 0.7 cm^2/gdetermined by observations of the bullet cluster). we find no such indicationand instead find that the mass distribution of a520, after subtraction of thex-ray plasma mass, is in good agreement with the luminosity distribution of thecluster galaxies. we conclude that a520 shows no evidence to contradict thecollisionless dark matter scenario.

1210.7690	origins of weak lensing systematics, and requirements on future  instrumentation (or knowledge of instrumentation)	the first half of this paper explores the origin of systematic biases in themeasurement of weak gravitational lensing. compared to previous work, we expandthe investigation of psf instability and fold in for the first time the effectsof non-idealities in electronic imaging detectors and imperfect galaxy shapemeasurement algorithms. together, these now explain the additive a(l) andmultiplicative m(l) systematics typically reported in current lensingmeasurements. we find that overall performance is driven by a product of atelescope/camera's *absolute performance*, and our *knowledge about itsperformance*.  the second half of this paper propagates any residual shear measurementbiases through to their effect on cosmological parameter constraints. fullyexploiting the statistical power of stage iv weak lensing surveys will requireadditive biases a&lt;1.8e-12 and multiplicative biases m&lt;4.0e-3. these can beallocated between individual budgets in hardware, calibration data andsoftware, using results from the first half of the paper.  if instrumentation is stable and well-calibrated, we find extant shearmeasurement software from great10 already meet requirements on galaxiesdetected at s/n=40. averaging over a population of galaxies with a realisticdistribution of sizes, it also meets requirements for a 2d cosmic shearanalysis from space. if used on fainter galaxies or for 3d cosmic sheartomography, existing algorithms would need calibration on simulations to avoidintroducing bias at a level similar to the statistical error. requirements onhardware and calibration data are discussed in more detail in a companionpaper. our analysis is intentionally general, but is specifically being used todrive the hardware and ground segment performance budget for the design of theeuropean space agency's recently-selected euclid mission.

1211.0966	flexion measurement in simulations of hubble space telescope data	we present a simulation analysis of weak gravitational lensing flexion andshear measurement using shapelet decomposition, and identify differencesbetween flexion and shear measurement noise in deep survey data. taking modelsof galaxies from the hubble space telescope ultra deep field (hudf) andapplying a correction for the hudf point spread function we generate lensedsimulations of deep, optical imaging data from hubble's advanced camera forsurveys (acs), with realistic galaxy morphologies. we find that flexion andshear estimates differ in our measurement pipeline: whereas intrinsic galaxyshape is typically the dominant contribution to noise in shear estimates, pixelnoise due to finite photon counts and detector read noise is a majorcontributor to uncertainty in flexion estimates, across a broad range of galaxysignal-to-noise. this pixel noise also increases more rapidly as galaxysignal-to-noise decreases than is found for shear estimates. we provide simplepower law fitting functions for this behaviour, for both flexion and shear,allowing the effect to be properly accounted for in future forecasts forflexion measurement. using the simulations we also quantify the systematicbiases of our shapelet flexion and shear measurement pipeline for deep hubbledata sets such as galaxy evolution from morphology and seds, space telescopea901/902 galaxy evolution survey or the cosmic evolution survey. flexionmeasurement biases are found to be significant but consistent with previousstudies.

0712.3293	combined analysis of weak lensing and x-ray blind surveys	we present a joint weak lensing and x-ray analysis of 4 deg$^2$ from thecfhtls and xmm-lss surveys. our weak lensing analysis is the first analysis ofa real survey using shapelets, a new generation weak lensing analysis method.we create projected mass maps of the images, and extract 6weak-lensing-detected clusters of galaxies. we show that their counts can beused to constrain the power spectrum normalisation $\sigma_8=0.92_{-0.30}^{+0.26}$ for $\omega_m=0.24$. we show that despite the largescatter generally observed in the m-t relation derived from lensing masses,tight constraints on both its slope and normalisation $m_*$ can be obtainedwith a moderate number of sources provided that the covered mass range is largeenough. adding clusters from bardeau et al. (2007) to our sample, we measure$m_* = 2.71_{-0.61}^{+0.79} 10^{14} h^{-1} m_\odot$. although they aredominated by shot noise and sample variance, our measurements are consistentwith currently favoured values, and set the stage for future surveys. we thusinvestigate the dependence of those estimates on survey size, depth, andintegration time, for joint weak lensing and x-ray surveys. we show that deepsurveys should be dedicated to the study of the physics of clusters and groupsof galaxies. for a given exposure time, wide surveys provide a larger number ofdetected clusters and are therefore preferred for the measurement ofcosmological parameters such as $\sigma_8$ and $m_*$. we show that a widesurvey of a few hundred square degrees is needed to improve upon currentmeasurements of these parameters. more ambitious surveys covering 7000 deg$^2$will provide the 1% accuracy in the estimation of the power spectrum and them-t relation normalisations.

1305.2117	dark matter astrometry: accuracy of sub-halo positions for the  measurement of self-interaction cross sections	direct evidence for the existence of dark matter and measurements of itsinteraction cross-section have been provided by the physical offset betweendark matter and intra- cluster gas in merging systems like the bullet cluster.although a smaller signal, this effect is more abundant in minor mergers whereinfalling substructure dark matter and gas are segregated. in such low-masssystems the gravitational lensing signal comes primarily from weak lensing. afundamental step in determining such an offset in sub- structure is the abilityto accurately measure the positions of dark matter sub-peaks. using simulatedhubble space telescope observations, we make a first assessment of theprecision and accuracy with which we can measure infalling groups using weakgravitational lensing. we demonstrate that using an existing and well-used massre- construction algorithm can measure the positions of 1.5x1013 msubstructures that have parent halos ten times more massive with a bias of lessthan 0.3 . in this regime, our analysis suggests the precision is sufficient todetect (at 3 {\sigma} statistical significance) the expected mean offsetbetween dark matter and baryonic gas in infalling groups from a sample of 50massive clusters.

1308.2974	evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter relation: separating  star-forming and passive galaxies from z=1 to 0	we use measurements of the stellar mass function, galaxy clustering, andgalaxy-galaxy lensing within the cosmos survey to constrain the stellar-to-halomass relation (shmr) of star forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0]. for massive galaxies, m*&gt;~10^10.6 msol, our results indicatethat star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matterhalos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. at lowermasses, there is minimal difference in the shmrs, implying that the majoritylow-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their starformation. our analysis also affords a breakdown of all cosmos galaxies intothe relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. atz=1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellarmass function. but the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshiftevolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass centralgalaxies being quenched of their star formation. at m*~10^10 msol, the fractionof central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of ten over ourredshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at thatmass is constant with redshift. we define a "migration rate" to the redsequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. we find thatthe migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearlyan order of magnitude from z=1 to z=0. these results imply that the efficiencyof quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, whilethe mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groupsand clusters is losing efficiency.

1309.3891	weak lensing calibrated m-t scaling relation of galaxy groups in the  cosmos field	the scaling between x-ray observables and mass for galaxy clusters and groupsis instrumental for cluster based cosmology and an important probe for thethermodynamics of the intracluster gas. we calibrate a scaling relation betweenthe weak lensing mass and x-ray spectroscopic temperature for 10 galaxy groupsin the cosmos field, combined with 55 higher mass clusters from the literature.the cosmos data includes hst imaging and redshift measurements of 46 sourcegalaxies per square arcmin, enabling us to perform unique weak lensingmeasurements of low mass systems. our sample extends the mass range of thelensing calibrated m-t relation an order of magnitude lower than any previousstudy, resulting in a power-law slope of 1.48$^{+0.13}_{-0.09}$. the slope isconsistent with the self-similar model, predictions from simulations, andobservations of clusters. however, x-ray observations relying on massmeasurements derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium haveindicated that masses at group scales are lower than expected. both simulationsand observations suggest that hydrostatic mass measurements can be biased low.our external weak lensing masses provides the first observational support forhydrostatic mass bias at group level, showing an increasing bias withdecreasing temperature and reaching a level of 30-50% at 1 kev.

1310.1731	on the cross-section of dark matter using substructure infall into  galaxy clusters	we develop a statistical method to measure the interaction cross-section ofdark matter, exploiting the continuous minor merger events in which smallsubstructures fall into galaxy clusters. we find that by taking the ratio ofthe distances between the galaxies and dark matter, and galaxies and gas inaccreting sub-halos, we form a quantity that can be statistically averaged overa large sample of systems whilst removing any inherent line-of-sightprojections. in order to interpret this ratio as a cross-section of dark matterwe derive an analytical description of sub-halo infall which encompasses; theforce of the main cluster potential, the drag on a gas sub-halo, a model fordark matter self-interactions and the resulting sub-halo drag, the force on thegas and galaxies due to the dark matter sub-halo potential, and finally thebuoyancy on the gas and dark matter. we create mock observations fromcosmological simulations of structure formation and find that collisionlessdark matter becomes physically separated from x-ray gas by up to 20h^-1 kpc.adding realistic levels of noise, we are able to predict achievable constraintsfrom observational data. current archival data should be able to detect adifference in the dynamical behaviour of dark matter and standard modelparticles at 6 sigma, and measure the total interaction cross-section sigma/mwith 68% confidence limits of +/- 1cm2g^-1. we note that this method is notrestricted by the limited number of major merging events and is easily extendedto large samples of clusters from future surveys which could potentially pushstatistical errors to 0.1cm^2g^-1.

1401.1151	an improved model of charge transfer inefficiency and correction  algorithm for the hubble space telescope	charge-coupled device (ccd) detectors, widely used to obtain digital imaging,can be damaged by high energy radiation. degraded images appear blurred,because of an effect known as charge transfer inefficiency (cti), which trailsbright objects as the image is read out. it is often possible to correct mostof the trailing during post-processing, by moving flux back to where itbelongs. we compare several popular algorithms for this: quantifying the effectof their physical assumptions and tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. wecombine their best elements to construct a more accurate model of damaged ccdsin the hubble space telescope's advanced camera for surveys/wide field channel,and update it using data up to early 2013. our algorithm now corrects 98% ofcti trailing in science exposures, a substantial improvement over previouswork. further progress will be fundamentally limited by the presence of readnoise. read noise is added after charge transfer so does not get trailed - butit is incorrectly untrailed during post-processing.

0802.2174	first catalog of strong lens candidates in the cosmos field	we present the first catalog of 67 strong galaxy-galaxy lens candidatesdiscovered in the 1.64 square degree hubble space telescope cosmos survey.twenty of these systems display multiple images or strongly curved large arcs.our initial search is performed by visual inspection of the data and isrestricted, for practical considerations, to massive early-type lens galaxieswith arcs found at radii smaller than ~5''. simple mass models are constructedfor the best lens candidates and our results are compared to the strong lensingcatalogs of the slacs survey and the castles database. these new stronggalaxy-galaxy lensing systems constitute a valuable sample to study the massdistribution of early-type galaxies and their associated dark matter halos. wefurther expect this sample to play an important role in the testing of softwarealgorithms designed to automatically search for strong gravitational lenses.  from our analysis a robust lower limit is derived for the expected occurrenceof strong galaxy-galaxy systems in current and future space-based wide-fieldimaging surveys. we expect that such surveys should uncover a large number ofstrong lensing systems (more than 10 systems per square degree), which willallow for a detailed statistical analysis of galaxy properties and will likelylead to constraints on models of gravitational structure formation andcosmology. the sample of strong lenses is available here:http://cosmosstronglensing.uni-hd.de/

1408.4758	reconciling planck cluster counts and cosmology? chandra/xmm  instrumental calibration and hydrostatic mass bias	the mass of galaxy clusters can be inferred from the temperature of theirx-ray emitting gas, $t_{\mathrm{x}}$. their masses may be underestimated if itis assumed that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium, by an amount$b^{\mathrm{hyd}}\sim(20\pm10)$ % suggested by simulations. we have previouslyfound consistency between a sample of observed \textit{chandra} x-ray massesand independent weak lensing measurements. unfortunately, uncertainties in theinstrumental calibration of {\em chandra} and {\em xmm-newton} observatoriesmean that they measure different temperatures for the same gas. in this paper,we translate that relative instrumental bias into mass bias, and infer that\textit{xmm-newton} masses of $\sim 10^{14}\,\mbox{m}_{\odot}$ ($&gt; 5\cdot10^{14} \mbox{m}_{\odot}$) clusters are unbiased ($\sim 35$ % lower) comparedto wl masses. for massive clusters, \textit{chandra}'s calibration may thus bemore accurate. the opposite appears to be true at the low mass end. we observethe mass bias to increase with cluster mass, but presence of eddington biasprecludes firm conclusions at this stage. nevertheless, the systematic\textit{chandra} -- \textit{xmm-newton} difference is important because {\emplanck}'s detections of massive clusters via the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effectare calibrated via {\em xmm-newton} observations. the number of detected szclusters are inconsistent with {\em planck}'s cosmological measurements of theprimary cosmic microwave background (cmb). given the \textit{planck} clustermasses, if an (unlikely) uncorrected $\sim 20$ % calibration bias existed, thistension would be eased, but not resolved.

1505.02046	self-interacting dark matter scattering rates through cosmic time	we estimate the rate of dark matter scattering in collapsed structuresthroughout the history of the universe. if the scattering cross-section isvelocity-independent, then the canonical picture is correct that scatteringsoccur mainly at late times. the scattering rate peaks slightly at redshift z~6,and remains significant today. half the scatterings occur after z~1, instructures more massive than 10^12 m_sun. within a factor of two, these numbersare robust to changes in the assumed astrophysics, and the scatterings would becaptured in cosmological simulations. however, for particle physics models witha velocity-dependent cross-section (as for yukawa potential interactions via amassive mediator), the scattering rate peaks before z~20, in objects with massless than 10^4 m_sun. these precise values are sensitive to theredshift-dependent mass-concentration relation and the small-scale cutoff inthe matter power spectrum. in extreme cases, the qualitative effect of earlyinteractions may be reminiscent of warm dark matter and strongly affect thesubsequent growth of structure. however, these scatterings are being missed inexisting cosmological simulations with limited mass resolution.

1512.05591	problems using ratios of galaxy shape moments on requirements for weak  lensing surveys	the shapes of galaxies can be quantified by ratios of their quadrupolemoments. for faint galaxies, observational noise can make the denominator closeto zero, so the ratios become ill-defined. knowledge of these ratios (i.e.their measured standard deviation) is commonly used to assess the efficiency ofweak gravitational lensing surveys. since the requirements cannot be formallytested for faint galaxies, we explore two complementary mitigation strategies.in many weak lensing contexts, the most problematic sources can be removed by acut in measured size. we investigate how a size cuts affects the requiredprecision of the charge transfer inefficiency model and find slightly widertolerance margins compared to the full size distribution. however, subtlebiases in the data analysis chain may be introduced. instead, as our secondstrategy, we propose requirements directly on the quadrupole momentsthemselves. to optimally exploit a stage-iv dark energy survey, we find thatthe mean and standard deviation of a population of galaxies' quadrupole momentsmust to be known to better than $1.4\times10^{-3}$ arcsec$^{2}$, or the stokesparameters to $1.9\times10^{-3}$ arcsec$^2$. this testable requirement can nowform the basis for future performance validation, or for proportioning therequirements between subsystems to ensure unbiased cosmological parameterinference.

astro-ph;0403229	probing dark matter and dark energy with space-based weak lensing	weak lensing provides a direct measure of the distribution of mass in theuniverse, and is therefore a uniquely powerful probe of dark matter. weaklensing can also be used to measure the twin phenomenon of dark energy, via itseffect upon the cosmological growth rate of structures. essential for thistechnique are well-resolved images of background galaxies out to largedistances. as a concrete example of the surveys that will become available bythe end of the decade, we consider the planned supernova/acceleration probe(snap) space telescope. detailed simulations of space-based images,manufactured using the shapelets formalism, enable us to quantitatively predictthe future sensitivity to weak lensing shear. the high number density ofgalaxies resolved from space will enable maps of dark matter to be produced intwo and three dimensions, with a resolution superior to that from the ground.such observations will also afford reduced systematics for high-precisionmeasurements of weak lensing statistics. these will be used to set tightconstraints on cosmological parameters. in particular, the parameter forequation of state of dark energy, w, will be measured using weak lensing with aprecision comparable to and somewhat orthogonal to constraints from othermethods.

astro-ph;0408445	polar shapelets	the shapelets method for image analysis is based upon the decomposition oflocalised objects into a series of orthogonal components with convenientmathematical properties. we extend the "cartesian shapelet" formalism fromearlier work, and construct "polar shapelet" basis functions that separate animage into components with explicit rotational symmetries. these frequentlyprovide a more compact parameterisation, and can be interpreted in an intuitiveway. image manipulation in shapelet space is simplified by the conciseexpressions for linear coordinate transformations; and shape measures(including object photometry, astrometry and galaxy morphology estimators) takea naturally elegant form. particular attention is paid to the analysis ofastronomical survey images, and we test shapelet techniques upon real data fromthe hubble space telescope. we present a practical method to automaticallyoptimise the quality of an arbitrary shapelet decomposition in the presence ofobservational noise, pixellisation and a point-spread function. a centralcomponent of this procedure is the adaptive choice of the shapelet expansion'sscale size and truncation order. a complete software package to performshapelet image analysis is made available on the world-wide web athttp://www.astro.caltech.edu/~rjm/shapelets/ .

astro-ph;0408568	shapelets "multiple multipole" shear measurement methods	the measurement of weak gravitational lensing is currently limited to aprecision of ~10% by instabilities in galaxy shape measurement techniques anduncertainties in their calibration. the potential of large, on-going and futurecosmic shear surveys will only be realised with the development of moreaccurate image analysis methods. we present a description of several possibleshear measurement methods using the linear "shapelets" decomposition. shapeletsprovides a complete reconstruction of any galaxy image, including higher-ordershape moments that can be used to generalise the ksb method to arbitrary order.many independent shear estimators can then be formed for each object, usinglinear combinations of shapelet coefficients. these estimators can be treatedseparately, to improve their overall calibration; or combined in moresophisticated ways, to eliminate various instabilities and a calibration bias.we apply several methods to simulated astronomical images containing a knowninput shear, and demonstrate the dramatic improvement in shear recovery usingshapelets. a complete idl software package to perform image analysis andmanipulation in shapelet space can be downloaded from the shapelets web site athttp://www.astro.caltech.edu/~rjm/shapelets/ .

astro-ph;0506112	the shear testing programme 1: weak lensing analysis of simulated  ground-based observations	the shear testing programme, step, is a collaborative project to improve theaccuracy and reliability of all weak lensing measurements in preparation forthe next generation of wide-field surveys. in this first step paper we presentthe results of a blind analysis of simulated ground-based observations ofrelatively simple galaxy morphologies. the most successful methods are shown toachieve percent level accuracy. from the cosmic shear pipelines that have beenused to constrain cosmology, we find weak lensing shear measured to an accuracythat is within the statistical errors of current weak lensing analyses, withshear measurements accurate to better than 7%. the dominant source ofmeasurement error is shown to arise from calibration uncertainties where themeasured shear is over or under-estimated by a constant multiplicative factor.this is of concern as calibration errors cannot be detected through standarddiagnostic tests. the measured calibration errors appear to result from stellarcontamination, false object detection, the shear measurement method itself,selection bias and/or the use of biased weights. additive systematics (falsedetections of shear) resulting from residual point-spread function anisotropyare, in most cases, reduced to below an equivalent shear of 0.001, an order ofmagnitude below cosmic shear distortions on the scales probed by currentsurveys.  our results provide a snapshot view of the accuracy of current ground-basedweak lensing methods and a benchmark upon which we can improve. to this end weprovide descriptions of each method tested and include details of the eightdifferent implementations of the commonly used kaiser, squires and broadhurst(1995) method (ksb+) to aid the improvement of future ksb+ analyses.

astro-ph;0512170	modelling and correcting the time-dependent acs psf	the ability to accurately measure the shapes of faint objects in images takenwith the advanced camera for surveys(acs) on the hubble space telescope (hst)depends upon detailed knowledge of the point spread function (psf). we showthat thermal fluctuations cause the psf of the acs wide field camera (wfc) tovary over time. we describe a modified version of the tinytim psf modelingsoftware to create artificial grids of stars across the acs field of view at arange of telescope focus values. these models closely resemble the stars inreal acs images. using ~10 bright stars in a real image, we have been able tomeasure hst's apparent focus at the time of the exposure. tinytim can then beused to model the psf at any position on the acs field of view. this obviatesthe need for images of dense stellar fields at different focus values, orinterpolation between the few observed stars. we show that residual differencesbetween our tinytim models and real data are likely due to the effects ofcharge transfer efficiency (cte) degradation. furthermore, we discussstochastic noise that is added to the shape of point sources when distortion isremoved, and we present multidrizzle parameters that are optimal for weaklensing science. specifically, we find that reducing the multidrizzle outputpixel scale and choosing a gaussian kernel significantly stabilizes theresulting psf after image combination, while still eliminating cosmic rays/badpixels, and correcting the large geometric distortion in the acs. we discussfuture plans, which include more detailed study of the effects of ctedegradation on object shapes and releasing our tinytim models to theastronomical community.

astro-ph;0608643	the shear testing programme 2: factors affecting high precision weak  lensing analyses	the shear testing programme (step) is a collaborative project to improve theaccuracy and reliability of weak lensing measurement, in preparation for thenext generation of wide-field surveys. we review sixteen current and emergingshear measurement methods in a common language, and assess their performance byrunning them (blindly) on simulated images that contain a known shear signal.we determine the common features of algorithms that most successfully recoverthe input parameters. we achieve previously unattained discriminatory precisionin our analysis, via a combination of more extensive simulations, and pairs ofgalaxy images that have been rotated with respect to each other, thus removingnoise from their intrinsic ellipticities. the robustness of our simulationapproach is also confirmed by testing the relative calibration of methods onreal data.  weak lensing measurement has improved since the first step paper. severalmethods now consistently achieve better than 2% precision, and are still beingdeveloped. however, the simulations can now distinguish all methods fromperfect performance. our main concern continues to be the potential for amultiplicative shear calibration bias: not least because this can not beinternally calibrated with real data. we determine which galaxy populations areresponsible and, by adjusting the simulated observing conditions, we alsoinvestigate the effects of instrumental and atmospheric parameters. we haveisolated several previously unrecognised aspects of galaxy shape measurement,in which focussed development could provide further progress towards thesub-percent level of precision desired for future surveys.

astro-ph;0609795	weak gravitational shear and flexion with polar shapelets	we derive expressions, in terms of "polar shapelets", for the imagedistortion operations associated with weak gravitational lensing. shear causesgalaxy shapes to become elongated, and is sensitive to the second derivative ofthe projected gravitational potential along their line of sight; flexion bendsgalaxy shapes into arcs, and is sensitive to the third derivative. polarshapelets provide a natural representation, in which both shear and flexiontransformations are compact. through this tool, we understand progress inseveral weak lensing methods. we then exploit various symmetries of shapeletsto construct a range of shear estimators with useful properties. through ananalogous investigation, we also explore several flexion estimators. inparticular, some of the estimators can be measured simultaneously andindependently for every galaxy, and will provide unique checks for systematicsin future weak lensing analyses. using simulated images from the shear testingprogramme (step), we show that we can recover input shears with no significantbias. a complete software package to parametrize astronomical images in termsof polar shapelets, and to perform a full weak lensing analysis, is availableat http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~rjm/shapelets/ .

astro-ph;0701480	cosmos: 3d weak lensing and the growth of structure	we present a three dimensional cosmic shear analysis of the hubble spacetelescope cosmos survey, the largest ever optical imaging program performed inspace. we have measured the shapes of galaxies for the tell-tale distortionscaused by weak gravitational lensing, and traced the growth of that signal as afunction of redshift. using both 2d and 3d analyses, we measure cosmologicalparameters omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, thenormalization of the matter power spectrum. the introduction of redshiftinformation tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces therelative sampling (or "cosmic") variance compared to recent surveys that may belarger but are only two dimensional. from the 3d analysis, we findsigma_8*(omega_m/0.3)^0.44=0.866+^0.085_-0.068 at 68% confidence limits,including both statistical and potential systematic sources of error in thetotal budget. indeed, the absolute calibration of shear measurement methods isnow the dominant source of uncertainty. assuming instead a baseline cosmologyto fix the geometry of the universe, we have measured the growth of structureon both linear and non-linear physical scales. our results thus demonstrate aproof of concept for tomographic analysis techniques that have been proposedfor future weak lensing surveys by a dedicated wide-field telescope in space.

astro-ph;0701589	the sloan lens acs survey. iv: the mass density profile of early-type  galaxies out to 100 effective radii	we present a weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 early-type strong lensgalaxies, based on deep hst images obtained as part of the sloan lens acssurvey. using the most advanced techniques to control systematic uncertaintiesrelated to the variable psf and charge transfer efficiency of the acs, wedetect weak lensing signal out to 300 kpc/h. we analyze blank control fieldsfrom the cosmos survey in the same manner, inferring that the residualsystematic uncertainty in the tangential shear is &lt;0.3%. a joint strong andweak lensing analysis shows that the average total mass density profile isconsistent with isothermal over two decades in radius (3-300 kpc/h,approximately 1-100 reff). this finding extends by over an order of magnitudein radius previous results, based on strong lensing and/or stellar dynamics,that luminous and dark component ``conspire'' to form an isothermal massdistribution. in order to disentangle the contributions of luminous and darkmatter, we fit a two-component mass model (r^1/4 + nfw) to the weak and stronglensing constraints. it provides a good fit to the data with only two freeparameters; i) the average stellar mass-to-light ratio m_*/l_v=4.48 +- 0.46hmo/lo, in agreement with that expected for an old stellar population; ii) theaverage virial mass-to-light ratio m_vir/l_v = 246+101-87 hmo/lo.

astro-ph;0701594	dark matter maps reveal cosmic scaffolding	ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for onlyone-sixth of the total matter in the universe. the remainder is a mysterious"dark matter" component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thusneither emits nor reflects light. as dark matter cannot be seen directly usingtraditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties.it does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed throughgravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by thegravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. this is a purelygeometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive toall matter -- whether baryonic or dark. here we show high fidelity maps of thelarge-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. wefind a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect inmassive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. our results areconsistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, inwhich the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filamentsthen into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas canaccumulate, and stars can be built.

astro-ph;0702140	the stability of the point spread function of the advanced camera for  surveys on the hubble space telescope and implications for weak gravitational  lensing	(abridged) we examine the spatial and temporal stability of the hst acs widefield camera (wfc) point spread function (psf) using the two square degreecosmos survey. we show that stochastic aliasing of the psf necessarily occursduring `drizzling'. this aliasing is maximal if the output pixel scale is equalto the input pixel scale of 0.05''. we show that this source of psf variationcan be significantly reduced by choosing a gaussian drizzle kernel and bysetting the output pixel size to 0.03''. we show that the psf is temporallyunstable, most likely due to thermal fluctuations in the telescope's focus. wefind that the primary manifestation of this thermal drift in cosmos images isan overall slow periodic focus change. using a modified version of tinytim, wecreate undistorted stars in a 30x30 grid across the acs wfc ccds. these psfmodels are created for telescope focus values in the range -10 microns to +5microns, thus spanning the allowed range of telescope focus values. we then usethe approximately ten well measured stars in each cosmos field to pick thebest-fit focus value for each field. the tinytim model stars are then used toperform psf corrections for weak lensing allowing systematics due toincorrectly modeled psfs to be greatly reduced. we have made the software forpsf modeling using our modified version of tinytim available to theastronomical community. we show the effects of charge transfer efficiency (cte)degradation, which distorts the object in the readout direction, mimicking aweak lensing signal. we derive a parametric correction for the effect of cte onthe shapes of objects in the cosmos field as a function of observation date,position within the acs wfc field, and object flux.

astro-ph;0702242	gravitational shear, flexion and strong lensing in abell 1689	we present a gravitational lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster abell 1689,incorporating measurements of the weak shear, flexion, and strong lensinginduced in background galaxies. this is the first time that a shapelettechnique has been used to reconstruct the distribution of mass in thiscluster, and the first time that a flexion signal has been measured usingcluster members as lenses. from weak shear measurements alone, we generate anon-parametric mass reconstruction, which shows significant substructurecorresponding to groups of galaxies within the cluster. additionally, ourgalaxy-galaxy flexion signal demonstrates that the cluster galaxies can bewell-fit by a singular isothermal sphere model with a characteristic velocitydispersion of $\sigma_v = 295\pm 40 km/s $. we identify a major, distinct darkmatter clump, offset by 40$h^{-1}$kpc from the central cluster members, whichwas not apparent from shear measurements alone. this secondary clump is presentin a parametric mass reconstruction using flexion data alone, and its existenceis suggested in a non-parametric reconstruction of the cluster using acombination of strong and weak lensing. as found in previous studies, the massprofile obtained by combining weak and strong lensing data shows a much steeperprofile than that obtained from only weak lensing data.

astro-ph;0703471	pixelation effects in weak lensing	weak gravitational lensing is a promising probe of dark matter and darkenergy requiring accurate measurement of the shapes of faint, distant galaxies.such measures are hindered by the finite resolution and pixel scale of typicalcameras. on the other hand, as imaging telescopes are practically limited to afixed number of pixels and operational life-span, so the survey area increaseswith pixel size. we investigate the optimum choice of pixel scale in thistrade-off for a space-based mission, using the full engineering model andsurvey strategy of the proposed supernova/acceleration probe as an example. ourmethodology is to simulate realistic astronomical images of known shear and toevaluate the surface density of sources where the shear is accurately recoveredusing the rhodes, refregier, &amp; groth algorithm in the context of the deriveddark matter power spectrum. in addition to considering single exposures, wealso examine the benefits of sub-pixel dithering. although some of our resultsdepend upon the adopted shape measurement method, the relative trends,particularly those involving the surface density of resolved galaxies, arerobust. our approach provides a practical counterpart to studies which considerthe effects of pixelation from analytic principles, which necessarily assume anidealized shape measurement method. we find that the statistical error on themass power spectrum is minimized with a pixel scale equal to 75-80% of the fwhmof the point-spread function, and that dithering is marginally beneficial atlarger pixel scales.
