0901.3779	a candidate sub-parsec supermassive binary black hole system	we identify sdss j153636.22+044127.0, a qso discovered in the sloan digitalsky survey, as a promising candidate for a binary black hole system. this qsohas two broad-line emission systems separated by 3500 km/sec. the redder systemat z=0.3889 also has a typical set of narrow forbidden lines. the bluer system(z=0.3727) shows only broad balmer lines and uv fe ii emission, making ithighly unusual in its lack of narrow lines. a third system, which includes onlyunresolved absorption lines, is seen at a redshift, z=0.3878, intermediatebetween the two emission-line systems. while the observational signatures ofbinary nuclear black holes remain unclear, j1536+0441 is unique among all qsosknown in having two broad-line regions, indicative of two separate black holespresently accreting gas. the interpretation of this as a bound binary system oftwo black holes having masses of 10^8.9 and 10^7.3 solar masses, yields aseparation of ~ 0.1 parsec and an orbital period of ~100 years. the separationimplies that the two black holes are orbiting within a single narrow-lineregion, consistent with the characteristics of the spectrum. this object wasidentified as an extreme outlier of a karhunen-loeve transform of 17,500 z &lt;0.7 qso spectra from the sdss. the probability of the spectrum resulting from achance superposition of two qsos with similar redshifts is estimated at2x10^-7, leading to the expectation of 0.003 such objects in the samplestudied; however, even in this case, the spectrum of the lower redshift qsoremains highly unusual.

0901.4162	a quintet of black hole mass determinations	we report five new measurements of central black hole masses based on stisand wfpc2 observations with the hubble space telescope and on axisymmetric,three-integral, schwarzschild orbit-library kinematic models. we selected asample of galaxies within a narrow range in velocity dispersion that cover arange of galaxy parameters (including hubble type and core/power-law surfacedensity profile) where we expected to be able to resolve the galaxy's sphere ofinfluence based on the predicted value of the black hole mass from the m-sigmarelation. we find masses in units of 10^8 solar masses for the followinggalaxies:  ngc 3585, m_bh = 3.4 (+1.5, -0.6);  ngc 3607, m_bh = 1.2 (+0.4, -0.4);  ngc 4026, m_bh = 2.1 (+0.7, -0.4); and  ngc 5576, m_bh = 1.8 (+0.3, -0.4), all significantly excluding m_bh = 0. for  ngc 3945, m_bh = 0.09 (+0.17, -0.21), which is significantly belowpredictions from m-sigma and m-l relations and consistent with m_bh = 0, thoughthe presence of a double bar in this galaxy may present problems for ouraxisymmetric code.

0903.4897	the m-sigma and m-l relations in galactic bulges and determinations of  their intrinsic scatter	we derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black holemass (m_bh) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity(l) (the m-sigma and m-l relations), based on 49 m_bh measurements and 19 upperlimits. particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter(epsilon_0) in both relations. we find log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta *log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/-0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.23 +/-0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. the results forellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatterrecovered for spirals is significantly larger. the scatter inferred reinforcesthe need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass functionbased on the m-sigma relation, and further implies that there may besubstantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the m-sigma relation.we estimate the m-l relationship as log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta * log(l_v/ 10^11 l_sun,v) of (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18,0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. these results appear to beinsensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and thedistribution of intrinsic scatter. we show that culling the sample according tothe resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations tolarger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

0904.4290	rr lyrae variables in two fields in the spheroid of m31	we present hubble space telescope observations taken with the advanced camerafor surveys wide field channel of two fields near m32 - between four and sixkpc from the center of m31. the data cover a time baseline sufficient for theidentification and characterization of 681 rr lyrae variables of which 555 areab-type and 126 are c-type. the mean magnitude of these stars is &lt;v&gt;=25.29 +/-0.05 where the uncertainty combines both the random and systematic errors. thelocation of the stars in the bailey diagram and the ratio of c-type rr lyraesto all types are both closer to rr lyraes in oosterhoff type i globularclusters in the milky way as compared with oosterhoff ii clusters. the meanperiods of the ab-type and c-type rr lyraes are &lt;p(ab)&gt;=0.557 +/- 0.003 and&lt;p(c)&gt;=0.327 +/- 0.003, respectively, where the uncertainties in each caserepresent the standard error of the mean. when the periods and amplitudes ofthe ab-type rr lyraes in our sample are interpreted in terms of metallicity, wefind the metallicity distribution function to be indistinguishable from agaussian with a peak at &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-1.50 +/- 0.02, where the quoted uncertaintyis the standard error of the mean. using a relation between rr lyrae luminosityand metallicity along with a reddening of e(b-v) = 0.08 +/- 0.03, we find adistance modulus of (m-m)o=24.46 +/- 0.11 for m31. we examine the radialmetallicity gradient in the environs of m31 using published values for thebulge and halo of m31 as well as the abundances of its dwarf spheroidalcompanions and globular clusters. in this context, we conclude that the rrlyraes in our two fields are more likely to be halo objects rather thanassociated with the bulge or disk of m31, in spite of the fact that they arelocated at 4-6 kpc in projected distance from the center.

0906.0020	hst images and kpno spectroscopy of the binary black hole candidate sdss  j153636.22+044127.0	we present hst wfpc2/pc images and kpno 4-m longslit spectroscopy of the qsosdss j153636.22+044127.0, which we advanced as a candidate binary supermassiveblack hole. the images reveal a close companion coincident with the radiosource identified by wrobel &amp; laor (2009). it appears to be consistent with am_g ~ -21.4 elliptical galaxy, if it is at the qso redshift. the spectroscopy,however, shows no spatial offset of the red or blue balmer line subcomponents.the companion is thus not the source of either the red or blue broad linesystems; sdss j153636.22+044127.0 cannot be explained as a chance superpositionof objects, or as an ejected black hole. over the delta t=0.75 yr differencebetween the rest frame epochs of the present and sdss spectroscopy, we find novelocity shift to within 40 km/s, nor any amplitude change in either broad linesystem. the lack of a shift can be admitted under the binary hypothesis if theimplied radial velocity is a larger component of the full orbital velocity thanwas assumed in our earlier work. a strong test of the binary hypothesisrequires yet longer temporal baselines. the lack of amplitude variations isunusual for the alternative explanation of this object as a "double-peaked"emitter; we further argue that sdss j153636.22+044127.0 has unique spectralfeatures that have no obvious analogue with other members of this class.

0911.0355	rr lyrae variables in m32 and the disk of m31	we observed two fields near m32 with the advanced camera for surveys/highresolution channel (acs/hrc) on board the hubble space telescope (hst). themain field, f1, is 1.8 arcmin from the center of m32; the second field, f2,constrains the m31 background, and is 5.4 arcmin distant. each field wasobserved for 16-orbits in each of the f435w (narrow b) and f555w (narrow v)filters. the duration of the observations allowed rr lyrae stars and othershort-period variables to be detected. a population of rr lyrae starsdetermined to belong to m32 would prove the existence of an ancient populationin that galaxy, a subject of some debate. we detected 17 rr lyrae variables inf1 and 14 in f2. a 1-sigma upper limit of 6 rr lyrae variables belonging to m32is inferred from these two fields alone. use of our two acs/wfc parallel fieldsprovides better constraints on the m31 background, however, and implies that$7_{-3}^{+4}$ (68 % confidence interval) rr lyrae variables in f1 belong tom32. we have therefore found evidence for an ancient population in m32. itseems to be nearly indistinguishable from the ancient population of m31. the rrlyrae stars in the f1 and f2 fields have indistinguishable mean v-bandmagnitudes, mean periods, distributions in the bailey diagram and ratios of rrcto rr(tot) types. however, the color distributions in the two fields aredifferent, with a population of red rrab variables in f1 not seen in f2. wesuggest that these might be identified with the detected m32 rr lyraepopulation, but the small number of stars rules out a definitive claim.

1005.0028	exploring the spectral space of low redshift qsos	the karhunen-loeve (kl) transform can compactly represent the informationcontained in large, complex datasets, cleanly eliminating noise from the dataand identifying elements of the dataset with extreme or inconsistentcharacteristics. we develop techniques to apply the kl transform to the4000-5700a region of 9,800 qso spectra with z &lt; 0.619 from the sdss archive. upto 200 eigenspectra are needed to fully reconstruct the spectra in this sampleto the limit of their signal/noise. we propose a simple formula for selectingthe optimum number of eigenspectra to use to reconstruct any given spectrum,based on the signal/noise of the spectrum, but validated by formalcross-validation tests. we show that such reconstructions can boost theeffective signal/noise of the observations by a factor of 6 as well as fill ingaps in the data. the improved signal/noise of the resulting set will allow forbetter measurement and analysis of these spectra. the distribution of the qsospectra within the eigenspace identifies regions of enhanced density ofinteresting subclasses, such as narrow line seyfert 1s (nls1s). the weightings,as well as the inability of the eigenspectra to fit some of the objects, alsoidentifies "outliers," which may be objects that are not valid members of thesample or objects with rare or unique properties. we identify 48 spectra fromthe sample that show no broad emission lines, 21 objects with unusual [o iii]emission line properties, and 9 objects with peculiar h-beta emission lineprofiles. we also use this technique to identify a binary supermassive blackhole candidate. we provide the eigenspectra and the reconstructed spectra ofthe qso sample.

1009.0750	the black hole mass in brightest cluster galaxy ngc 6086	we present the first direct measurement of the central black hole mass, m_bh,in ngc 6086, the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in abell 2162. ourinvestigation demonstrates for the first time that stellar dynamicalmeasurements of m_bh in bcgs are possible beyond the nearest few galaxyclusters. we observed ngc 6086 with laser guide star adaptive optics and theintegral-field spectrograph (ifs) osiris at the w.m. keck observatory, and withthe seeing-limited ifs gmos-n at gemini observatory north. we combined the twoifs data sets with existing major-axis kinematics, and used axisymmetricstellar orbit models to determine m_bh and the r-band stellar mass-to-lightratio, m*/l_r. we find m_bh = 3.6(+1.7)(-1.1) x 10^9 m_sun and m*/l_r =4.6(+0.3)(-0.7) m_sun/l_sun (68% confidence), from models using the mostmassive dark matter halo allowed within the gravitational potential of the hostcluster. models fitting only ifs data confirm m_bh ~ 3 x 10^9 m_sun and m*/l_r~ 4 m_sun/l_sun, with weak dependence on the dark matter halo structure. whendata out to 19 kpc are included, the unrealistic omission of dark matter causesthe best-fit black hole mass to decrease dramatically, to 0.6 x 10^9 m_sun, andthe best-fit stellar mass-to-light ratio to increase to 6.7 m_sun/l_sun. thelatter value is at further odds with stellar population studies favoring m*/l ~2 m_sun/l_sun,r. biases from dark matter omission could extend to dynamicalmodels of other galaxies with central stellar cores, and new measurements ofm_bh from models with dark matter could steepen the empirical scalingrelationships between black holes and their host galaxies.

0709.0585	the black hole mass and extreme orbital structure in ngc1399	the largest galaxies, and in particular central galaxies in clusters, offerunique insight into understanding the mechanism for the growth of nuclear blackholes. we present hubble space telescope kinematics for ngc1399, the centralgalaxy in fornax. we find the best-fit model contains a black hole of 5.1 +-0.7x 10^8 msun (at a distance of 21.1 mpc), a factor of over 2 below thecorrelation of black hole mass and velocity dispersion. we also find a dramaticsignature for central tangential anisotropy. the velocity profiles on adjacentsides 0.5" away from the nucleus show strong bimodality, and the centralspectrum shows a large drop in the dispersion. both of these observations pointto an orbital distribution that is tangentially biased. the best-fit orbitalmodel suggests a ratio of the tangential to radial internal velocitydispersions of three. this ratio is the largest seen in any galaxy to date andwill provide an important measure for the mode by which the central black holehas grown.

1101.1954	the black-hole mass in m87 from gemini/nifs adaptive optics observations	we present the stellar kinematics in the central 2" of the luminouselliptical galaxy m87 (ngc 4486), using laser adaptive optics to feed thegemini telescope integral-field spectrograph, nifs. the velocity dispersionrises to 480 km/s at 0.2". we combine these data with extensive stellarkinematics out to large radii to derive a black-hole mass equal to(6.6+-0.4)x10^9 msun, using orbit-based axisymmetric models and including onlythe nifs data in the central region. including previously-reported ground-baseddata in the central region drops the uncertainty to 0.25x10^9 msun with nochange in the best-fit mass; however, we rely on the values derived from thenifs-only data in the central region in order to limit systematic differences.the best-fit model shows a significant increase in the tangential velocityanisotropy of stars orbiting in the central region with decreasing radius;similar to that seen in the centers of other core galaxies. the black-hole massis insensitive to the inclusion of a dark halo in the models --- the highangular-resolution provided by the adaptive optics breaks the degeneracybetween black-hole mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. the present black-holemass is in excellent agreement with the gebhardt &amp; thomas value, implying thatthe dark halo must be included when the kinematic influence of the black holeis poorly resolved. this degeneracy implies that the black-hole masses ofluminous core galaxies, where this effect is important, may need to bere-evaluated. the present value exceeds the prediction of the blackhole-dispersion and black hole-luminosity relations, both of which predictabout 1x10^9 msun for m87, by close to twice the intrinsic scatter in therelations. the high-end of the black hole correlations may be poorly determinedat present.

1111.3977	the star formation history of m32	we use deep hst acs/hrc observations of a field within m32 (f1) and an m31background field (f2) to determine the star formation history (sfh) of m32 fromits resolved stellar population. we find that 2-5gyr old stars contribute\som40%+/- 17% of m32's mass, while 55%+/-21% of m32's mass comes from starsolder than 5 gyr. the mass-weighted mean age and metallicity of m32 at f1 are&lt;age&gt;=6.8+/-1.5 gyr and &lt;[m/h]&gt;=-0.01+/-0.08 dex. the sfh additionallyindicates the presence of young (&lt;2 gyr old), metal-poor ([m/h]\sim-0.7) stars,suggesting that blue straggler stars contribute ~2% of the mass at f1; theremaining \sim3% of the mass is in young metal-rich stars. line-strengthindices computed from the sfh imply a light-weighted mean age and metallicityof 4.9 gyr and [m/h] = -0.12 dex, and single-stellar-population-equivalentparameters of 2.9+/-0.2 gyr and [m/h]=0.02+/-0.01 dex at f1 (~2.7 re). thiscontradicts spectroscopic studies that show a steep age gradient from m32'scenter to 1re. the inferred sfh of the m31 background field f2 reveals that themajority of its stars are old, with \sim95% of its mass already acquired 5-14gyr ago. it is composed of two dominant populations; \sim30%+/-7.5% of its massis in a 5-8 gyr old population, and \sim65%+/-9% of the mass is in a 8-14 gyrold population. the mass-weighted mean age and metallicity of f2 are&lt;age&gt;=9.2+/-1.2 gyr and &lt;[m/h]&gt;=-0.10+/-0.10 dex, respectively. our resultssuggest that the inner disk and spheroid populations of m31 areindistinguishable from those of the outer disk and spheroid. assuming the meanage of m31's disk at f2 (\sim1 disk scale length) to be 5-9 gyr, our resultsagree with an inside-out disk formation scenario for m31's disk.

1112.1078	two ten-billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of giant  elliptical galaxies	observational work conducted over the last few decades indicates that allmassive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres. although theluminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early universesuggest that some are powered by black holes with masses greater than 10billion solar masses, the remnants of these objects have not been found in thenearby universe. the giant elliptical galaxy messier 87 hosts the hitherto mostmassive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses. here wereport that ngc 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance fromearth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billionsolar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present inngc 4889, the brightest galaxy in the coma cluster (at a distance of 103megaparsecs). these two black holes are significantly more massive thanpredicted by linearly extrapolating the widely-used correlations between blackhole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the hostgalaxy. although these correlations remain useful for predicting black holemasses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest thatdifferent evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxiesand their black holes.

1112.1419	the cluster of blue stars surrounding the m31 nuclear black hole	we obtained u_330 and b band images of the m31 nucleus using the highresolution camera of the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble spacetelescope (hst). the spatial resolution in the u_330-band, 0.03" fwhm, or 0.1pc at m31, is sufficient to resolve the outskirts of the compact cluster (p3)of uv-bright stars surrounding the m31 black hole. the center of the cluster ismarked by an extended source that is both brighter and redder than the otherpoint sources within p3; it is likely to be a blend of several bright stars. wehypothesize that it marks the location of the m31 black hole. both stellarphotometry and a surface brightness fluctuation analysis, show that the p3stellar population is consistent with early-type main sequence stars formed ina ~100 - ~200 myr old starburst population. evolutionary tracks of post earlyasymptotic giant-branch stars, associated with late-stage evolution of an oldpopulation, also traverse the u and u-b domain occupied by the p3 stars; but weargue that only a few stars could be accounted for that way. peagb evolution isvery rapid, and there is no progenitor population of red giants associated withp3. the result that p3 comprises young stars is consistent with inferences fromearlier hst observations of the integrated light of the cluster. like the milkyway, m31 harbors a black hole closely surrounded by apparently young stars.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1205.3839	a brightest cluster galaxy with an extremely large flat core	hubble space telescope images of the galaxy cluster abell 2261, obtained aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble, show that thebrightest galaxy in the cluster, a2261-bcg, has the largest core yet detectedin any galaxy. the cusp radius of a2261-bcg is 3.2 kpc, twice as big as thenext largest core known, and ~3x bigger than those typically seen in the mostluminous bcgs. the morphology of the core in a2261-bcg is also unusual, havinga flat or even slightly-depressed interior surface brightness profile, ratherthan the typical shallow cusp. this implies that the galaxy has a core withconstant or even centrally decreasing stellar density. interpretation of thecore as an end product of the "scouring" action of a binary supermassive blackhole implies a total black hole mass ~1e+10 m_sun from the extrapolation ofmost relationships between core structure and black hole mass. the core falls1-sigma above the cusp-radius versus galaxy luminosity relation. its large sizein real terms, and the extremely large black hole mass required to generate it,raise the possibility that the core has been enlarged by additional processes,such as the ejection of the black holes that originally generated the core. theflat central stellar density profile is consistent with this hypothesis. thecore is also displaced by 0.7 kpc from the center of the surrounding envelope,consistent with a local dynamical perturbation of the core.

1206.4045	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury i: bright uv stars in the  bulge of m31	as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) multi-cycleprogram, we observed a 12' \times 6.5' area of the bulge of m31 with thewfc3/uvis filters f275w and f336w. from these data we have assembled a sampleof \sim4000 uv-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. weuse updated padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars intothree classes: post-agb stars (p-agb), post-early agb (pe-agb) stars andagb-manqu\'e stars. p-agb stars are the end result of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,whereas pe-agb and agb-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hotpost-horizontal branch; hp-hb) stars are the result of insufficient envelopemasses to allow a full agb phase, and are expected to be particularly prominentat high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the rgb is high.our data support previous claims that most uv-bright sources in the bulge arelikely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (ehb) and their progeny. weconstruct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show thatthey are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated uv oroptical light. however, we find that this uv-bright population does notdominate the total uv luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only theprogeny of the ehb stars that are the likely source of the uvx. we calculatethat only a few percent of ms stars in the central bulge can have gone throughthe hp-hb phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance fromthe center. we also find that the surface density of hot uv-bright stars hasthe same radial variation as that of low-mass x-ray binaries. we discuss age,metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observedradial variation in the uv-bright population.

1209.2416	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ii. tracing the inner m31  halo with blue horizontal branch stars	we attempt to constrain the shape of m31's inner stellar halo by tracing thesurface density of blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars at galactocentricdistances ranging from 2 kpc to 35 kpc. our measurements make use of resolvedstellar photometry from a section of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury(phat) survey, supplemented by several archival hubble space telescopeobservations. we find that the ratio of bhb to red giant stars is relativelyconstant outside of 10 kpc, suggesting that the bhb is as reliable a tracer ofthe halo population as the red giant branch. in the inner halo, we do notexpect bhb stars to be produced by the high metallicity bulge and disk, makingbhb stars a good candidate to be a reliable tracer of the stellar halo to muchsmaller galactocentric distances. if we assume a power-law profile r^(-\alpha)for the 2-d projected surface density bhb distribution, we obtain ahigh-quality fit with a 2-d power-law index of \alpha=2.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2} outsideof 3 kpc, which flattens to \alpha&lt;1.2 inside of 3 kpc. this slope isconsistent with previous measurements but is anchored to a radial baseline thatextends much farther inward. finally, assuming azimuthal symmetry and aconstant mass-to-light ratio, the best-fitting profile yields a total halostellar mass of 2.1^{+1.7}_{-0.4} x 10^9 m_sun. these properties are comparablewith both simulations of stellar halo formation formed by satellite disruptionalone, and with simulations that include some in situ formation of halo stars.

1209.4357	cores and the kinematics of early-type galaxies	i have combined the emsellem et al. atlas3d rotation measures of a largesample of early-type galaxies with hst-based classifications of their centralstructure to characterize the rotation velocities of galaxies with cores. "coregalaxies" rotate slowly, while "power-law galaxies" (galaxies that lack cores)rotate rapidly, confirming the analysis of faber et al. significantly, theamplitude of rotation sharply discriminates between the two types in the -19 &gt;mv &gt; -22 domain over which the two types coexist. the slow rotation in thesmall set of core galaxies with mv &gt; -20, in particular, brings them intoconcordance with the more massive core galaxies. the atlas3d "fast-rotating"and "slow-rotating" early-type galaxies are essentially the same as power-lawand core galaxies, respectively, or the kormendy &amp; bender two families ofelliptical galaxies based on rotation, isophote shape, and central structure.the atlas3d fast rotators do include roughly half of the core galaxies, buttheir rotation-amplitudes are always at the lower boundary of that subset.essentially all core galaxies have atlas3d rotation-amplitudes lambda_(r_e/2)&lt;= 0.25, while all galaxies with lambda_(r_e/2) &gt; 0.25 and figure eccentricity&gt; 0.2 lack cores. both figure rotation and the central structure of early-typegalaxies should be used together to separate systems that appear to have formedfrom "wet" versus "dry" mergers.

1303.4393	the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio on black  hole mass measurements	we have tested the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio(y) on measurements of black hole masses (mbh) derived from stellar orbitsuperposition models. such models construct a static gravitational potentialfor a galaxy and its central black hole, but typically assume spatially uniformy. we have modeled three giant elliptical galaxies with gradients alpha = d(logy)/d(log r) from -0.2 to +0.1. color and line strength gradients suggest mildlynegative alpha in these galaxies. introducing a negative (positive) gradient iny increases (decreases) the enclosed stellar mass near the center of the galaxyand leads to systematically smaller (larger) mbh measurements. for models withalpha = -0.2, the best-fit values of mbh are 28%, 27%, and 17% lower than theconstant-y case, in ngc 3842, ngc 6086, and ngc 7768, respectively. for alpha =+0.1, mbh are 14%, 22%, and 17% higher than the constant-y case for the threerespective galaxies. for ngc 3842 and ngc 6086, this bias is comparable to thestatistical errors from individual modeling trials. at larger radii, negative(positive) gradients in y cause the total stellar mass to decrease (increase)and the dark matter fraction within one effective radius to increase(decrease).

1312.4799	the black hole mass and the stellar ring in ngc 3706	we determine the mass of the nuclear black hole ($m$) in ngc 3706, an earlytype galaxy with a central surface brightness minimum arising from an apparentstellar ring, which is misaligned with respect to the galaxy's major axis atlarger radii. we fit new hst/stis and archival data with axisymmetric orbitmodels to determine $m$, mass-to-light ratio ($\upsilon_v$), and dark matterhalo profile. the best-fit model parameters with 1$\sigma$ uncertainties are $m= (6.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}) \times 10^8\ m_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}$ and$\upsilon_v = 6.0 \pm 0.2\ m_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}\ l_{{\scriptscriptstyle\odot},v}^{-1}$ at an assumed distance of 46 mpc. the models are inconsistentwith no black hole at a significance of $\delta\chi^2 = 15.4$ and require adark matter halo to adequately fit the kinematic data, but the fits areconsistent with a large range of plausible dark matter halo parameters. thering is inconsistent with a population of co-rotating stars on circular orbits,which would produce a narrow line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd).instead, the ring's losvd has a small value of $|v|/\sigma$, the ratio of meanvelocity to velocity dispersion. based on the observed low $|v|/\sigma$, ourorbit modeling, and a kinematic decomposition of the ring from the bulge, weconclude that the stellar ring contains stars that orbit in both directions. weconsider potential origins for this unique feature, including multiple tidaldisruptions of stellar clusters, a change in the gravitational potential fromtriaxial to axisymmetric, resonant capture and inclining of orbits by a binaryblack hole, and multiple mergers leading to gas being funneled to the center ofthe galaxy.

1403.2691	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. vii. the steep  mid-ultraviolet to near-infrared extinction curve in the central 200 pc of  the m31 bulge	we measure the extinction curve in the central 200 pc of m31 atmid-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths (from 1928a to 1.5{\mu}m), usingswift/uvot and hst wfc3/acs observations in thirteen bands. taking advantage ofthe high angular resolution of the hst wfc3 and acs detectors, we develop amethod to simultaneously determine the relative extinction and the fraction ofobscured starlight for five dusty complexes located in the circumnuclearregion. the extinction curves of these clumps (rv =2.4-2.5) are steeper thanthe average galactic one (rv =3.1), but are similar to optical andnear-infrared curves recently measured toward the galactic bulge (rv~2.5). thissimilarity suggests that steep extinction curves may be common in the innerbulge of galaxies. in the ultraviolet, the extinction curves of these clumpsare also unusual. we find that one dusty clump (size &lt;2 pc) exhibits a stronguv bump (extinction at 2175a), more than three standard deviation higher thanthat predicted by common models. although the high stellar metallicity of them31 bulge indicates that there are sufficient carbon and silicon to producelarge dust grains, the grains may have been destroyed by supernova explosionsor past activity of the central super-massive black hole, resulting in theobserved steepened extinction curve.

1407.2260	brightest cluster galaxies at the present epoch	we have observed 433 z&lt;=0.08 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in a full-skysurvey of abell clusters. the bcg hubble diagram is consistent to within 2% ofa omega_m=0.3, lambda=0.7 hubble relation. the l_m-alpha relation for bcgs,which uses alpha, the log-slope of the bcg photometric curve of growth, topredict metric luminosity, l_m, has 0.27 mag residuals. we measure centralstellar velocity dispersions, sigma, of the bcgs, finding the faber-jacksonrelation to flatten as the metric aperture grows to include an increasingfraction of the total bcg luminosity. a 3-parameter "metric plane" relationusing alpha and sigma together gives the best prediction of l_m, with 0.21 magresiduals. the projected spatial offset, r_x, of bcgs from the x-ray-definedcluster center is a gamma=-2.33 power-law over 1&lt;r_x&lt;10^3 kpc. the medianoffset is ~10 kpc, but ~15% of the bcgs have r_x&gt;100 kpc. the absolutecluster-dispersion normalized bcg peculiar velocity |delta v_1|/sigma_c followsan exponential distribution with scale length 0.39+/-0.03. both l_m and alphaincrease with sigma_c. the alpha parameter is further moderated by both thespatial and velocity offset from the cluster center, with larger alphacorrelated with the proximity of the bcg to the cluster mean velocity orpotential center. at the same time, position in the cluster has little effecton l_m. the luminosity difference between the bcg and second-ranked galaxy, m2,increases as the peculiar velocity of the bcg within the cluster decreases.further, when m2 is a close luminosity "rival" of the bcg, the galaxy that isclosest to either the velocity or x-ray center of the cluster is most likely tohave the larger alpha. we conclude that the inner portions of the bcgs areformed outside the cluster, but interactions in the heart of the galaxy clustergrow and extend the envelopes of the bcgs.

1409.0899	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury x. ultraviolet to infrared  photometry of 117 million equidistant stars	we have measured stellar photometry with the hubble space telescope (hst)wide field camera 3 (wfc3) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) in nearultraviolet (f275w, f336w), optical (f475w, f814w), and near infrared (f110w,f160w) bands for 117 million resolved stars in m31. as part of the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey, we measured photometry withsimultaneous point spread function fitting across all bands and at all sourcepositions after precise astrometric image alignment (&lt;5-10 milliarcsecondaccuracy). in the outer disk, the photometry reaches a completeness-limiteddepth of f475w~28, while in the crowded, high surface brightness bulge, thephotometry reaches f475w~25. we find that simultaneous photometry and optimizedmeasurement parameters significantly increase the detection limit of the lowestresolution filters (wfc3/ir) providing color-magnitude diagrams that are up to2.5 magnitudes deeper when compared with color-magnitude diagrams from wfc3/irphotometry alone. we present extensive analysis of the data quality includingcomparisons of luminosity functions and repeat measurements, and we useartificial star tests to quantify photometric completeness, uncertainties andbiases. we find that largest sources of systematic error in the photometry aredue to spatial variations in the point spread function models and chargetransfer efficiency corrections. this stellar catalog is the largest everproduced for equidistant sources, and is publicly available for download by thecommunity.

1501.06631	tracing the metal-poor m31 stellar halo with blue horizontal branch  stars	we have analyzed new hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging in f475w and f814w of twopreviously-unobserved fields along the m31 minor axis to confirm our previousconstraints on the shape of m31's inner stellar halo. both of these newdatasets reach a depth of at least f814w$&lt;$27 and clearly detect the bluehorizontal branch (bhb) of the field as a distinct feature of thecolor-magnitude diagram. we measure the density of bhb stars and the ratio ofbhb to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to ourprevious work. we find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of apower-law for the 2-d projected surface density with an index of2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\alpha &lt;$1.2 inside of3 kpc. our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field bhb stars inm31 are part of the halo population. however, the total halo profile is nowknown to differ from this bhb profile, which suggests that we have isolated themetal-poor component. this component appears to have an unbroken power-lawprofile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halostellar mass. discrepancies between the bhb density profile and othermeasurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the differentprofile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than theprofile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. theseprofile differences also help to explain the large ratio of bhb/rgb stars inour observations.

1506.01097	photometric evidence of an intermediate-age stellar population in the  inner bulge of m31	we explore the assembly history of the m31 bulge within a projectedmajor-axis radius of 180" (~680 pc) by studying its stellar populations inhubble space telescope wfc3 and acs observations. colors formed by comparingnear-ultraviolet vs. optical bands are found to become bluer with increasingmajor-axis radius, which is opposite to that predicted if the sole sources ofnear-ultraviolet light were old extreme horizontal branch stars with a negativeradial gradient in metallicity. spectral energy distribution fits require ametal-rich intermediate-age stellar population (300 myr to 1 gyr old, ~solarmetallicity) in addition to the dominant old population. the radial gradientsin age and metallicity of the old stellar population are consistent with thosein previous works. for the intermediate-age population, we find an increase inage with radius and a mass fraction that increases up to 2% at 680 pc away fromthe center. we exclude contamination from the m31 disk and/or halo as the mainorigin for this population. our results thus suggest that intermediate-agestars exist beyond the central 5" (19 pc) of m31 and contribute ~1% of thetotal stellar mass in the bulge. these stars could be related to the seculargrowth of the m31 bulge.

0805.3533	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: ii. 'cusp' ellipticals	we study the origin and properties of 'extra' or 'excess' central light inthe surface brightness profiles of cusp or power-law ellipticals. dissipationalmergers give rise to two-component profiles: an outer profile established byviolent relaxation acting on stars present in the progenitors prior to thefinal merger, and an inner stellar population comprising the extra light,formed in a compact starburst. combining a large set of hydrodynamicalsimulations with data that span a broad range of profiles and masses, we showthat this picture is borne out -- cusp ellipticals are indeed 'extra light'ellipticals -- and examine how the properties of this component scale withglobal galaxy properties. we show how to robustly separate the 'extra' light,and demonstrate that observed cusps are reliable tracers of the degree ofdissipation in the spheroid-forming merger. we show that the typical degree ofdissipation is a strong function of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gasfractions at each mass. we demonstrate a correlation between extra lightcontent and effective radius at fixed mass: systems with more dissipation aremore compact. the outer shape of the light profile does not depend on mass,with a mean outer sersic index ~2.5. we explore how this relates to shapes,kinematics, and stellar population gradients. simulations with the gas contentneeded to match observed profiles also reproduce observed age, metallicity, andcolor gradients, and we show how these can be used as tracers of the degree ofdissipation in spheroid formation.

1509.06988	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury viii: a wide-area,  high-resolution map of dust extinction in m31	we map the distribution of dust in m31 at 25pc resolution, using stellarphotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. we develop a newmapping technique that models the nir color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of redgiant branch (rgb) stars. the model cmds combine an unreddened foreground ofrgb stars with a reddened background population viewed through a log-normalcolumn density distribution of dust. fits to the model constrain the medianextinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction ofreddened stars. the resulting extinction map has &gt;4 times better resolutionthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of thedust column. there is superb morphological agreement between the new map andmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by draine et al. 2014.however, the widely-used draine &amp; li (2007) dust models overpredict theobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that m31's true dust massis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed indraine et al. (2014). the discrepancy we identify is consistent with similarfindings in the milky way by the planck collaboration (2015), but has a morecomplex dependence on parameters from the draine &amp; li (2007) dust models. wealso show that the discrepancy with the draine et al.

0806.2325	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: iii. 'core' ellipticals  and 'missing' light	we investigate how 'extra' central light in the surface brightness profilesof cusp ellipticals relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. cuspelliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting onstars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipationalstarbursts. core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)cusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve acompact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).comparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how toobservationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals. wedemonstrate that these survive re-mergers and reliably trace the dissipation inthe initial gas-rich merger(s). the typical degree of dissipation is a strongfunction of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions. we find acorrelation between dissipation and effective radius: systems with moredissipation are more compact. the survival of this component and scattering ofstars into the envelope naturally explain high-sersic index profilescharacteristic of massive core ellipticals. this is also closely related to thekinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst componentsfrom their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/coreellipticals. we show that it is critical to adopt physically motivated profileswhen attempting to quantify how much mass has been 'scoured' or scattered outof the inner regions by binary black holes. estimates of scoured mass ignoringmulti-component structure can be strongly biased, potentially explainingobserved systems with large inferred core masses in apparent conflict withcore-scouring models.

astro-ph;0008131	observational constraints on higher order clustering up to $z\simeq 1	constraints on the validity of the hierarchical gravitational instabilitytheory and the evolution of biasing are presented based upon measurements ofhigher order clustering statistics in the deeprange survey, a catalog of$\sim710,000$ galaxies with $i_{ab} \le 24$ derived from a kpno 4m ccd imagingsurvey of a contiguous $4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}$ region. we compute the3-point and 4-point angular correlation functions using a direct estimation forthe former and the counts-in-cells technique for both. the skewness $s_3$decreases by a factor of $\simeq 3-4$ as galaxy magnitude increases over therange $17 \le i \le 22.5$ ($0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$). this decrease isconsistent with a small {\it increase} of the bias with increasing redshift,but not by more than a factor of 2 for the highest redshifts probed. ourresults are strongly inconsistent, at about the $3.5-4 \sigma$ level, withtypical cosmic string models in which the initial perturbations follow anon-gaussian distribution - such models generally predict an opposite trend inthe degree of bias as a function of redshift. we also find that the scalingrelation between the 3-point and 4-point correlation functions remainsapproximately invariant over the above magnitude range. the simplest model thatis consistent with these constraints is a universe in which an initiallygaussian perturbation spectrum evolves under the influence of gravity combinedwith a low level of bias between the matter and the galaxies that decreasesslightly from $z \sim 0.8$ to the current epoch.

astro-ph;0203468	the slope of the black-hole mass versus velocity dispersion correlation	observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the massof the central dark object m and the velocity dispersion sigma of the hostgalaxy, of the form log(m/m_sun) = a + b*log(sigma/sigma_0); however, publishedestimates of the slope b span a wide range (3.75 to 5.3). merritt &amp; ferraresehave argued that low slopes (&lt;4) arise because of neglect of random measurementerrors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of themilky way galaxy. we show that these explanations account for at most a smallpart of the slope range. instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because ofsystematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups forthe same galaxies. the origin of these differences remains unclear, but wesuggest that one significant component of the difference results from ferrarese&amp; merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r_e/8 (r_e is theeffective radius) using an empirical formula. another component may arise fromdispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. a new determinationof the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, forsigma_0=200 km/s. the m-sigma relation has an intrinsic dispersion in log mthat is no larger than 0.3 dex. in an appendix, we present a simple model forthe velocity-dispersion profile of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0206122	galaxies with a central minimum in stellar luminosity density	we used hst wfpc2 images to identify six early-type galaxies with surface-brightness profiles that decrease inward over a limited range of radii neartheir centers. the implied luminosity density profiles of these galaxies havelocal minima interior to their core break radii. ngc 3706 harbors a highsurface brightness ring of starlight with radius ~20 pc. its central structuremay be related to that in the double-nucleus galaxies m31 and ngc 4486b. ngc4406 and ngc 6876 have nearly flat cores that on close inspection are centrallydepressed. colors for both galaxies imply that this is not due to dustabsorption. the surface brightness distributions of both galaxies areconsistent with stellar tori that are more diffuse than the sharply definedsystem in ngc 3706. the remaining three galaxies are the brightest clustergalaxies in a260, a347, and a3574. color information is not available for theseobjects, but they strongly resemble ngc 4406 and ngc 6876 in their cores. thethin ring in ngc 3706 may have formed dissipatively. the five other galaxiesresemble the endpoints of some simulations of the merging of two gas-freestellar systems, each harboring a massive nuclear black hole. in one version ofthis scenario, diffuse stellar tori are produced when stars initially bound toone black hole are tidally stripped away by the second black hole.alternatively, some inward-decreasing surface-brightness profiles may reflectthe ejection of stars from a core during the hardening of the binary black holecreated during the merger.

astro-ph;0211074	hubble space telescope imaging of brightest cluster galaxies	we used the hst wfpc2 to obtain i-band images of the centers of 81 brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs), drawn from a volume-limited sample of nearby bcgs. theimages show a rich variety of morphological features, including multiple ordouble nuclei, dust, stellar disks, point source nuclei, and central surfacebrightness depressions. high resolution surface brightness profiles could beinferred for 60 galaxies. of those, 88% have well-resolved cores. twelvepercent of the bcg sample lacks a well-resolved core; all but one of these bcgshave ``power-law'' profiles. some of these galaxies have higher luminositiesthan any power-law galaxy identified by faber et al. (1997), and have physicalupper limits on the break radius well below the values observed for coregalaxies of the same luminosity. these results support the idea that thecentral structure of early-type galaxies is bimodal in its physical properties,but also suggest that there exist high luminosity galaxies with power-lawprofiles (or unusually small cores). the bcgs in the latter category tend tofall at the low end of the bcg luminosity function and tend to have low valuesof the quantity alpha (the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity as afunction of radius, at 10 kpc). since theoretical calculations have shown thatthe luminosities and alpha values of bcgs grow with time as a result ofaccretion, this suggests a scenario in which elliptical galaxies evolve frompower-law profiles to core profiles through accretion and merging. this isconsistent with theoretical scenarios that invoke the formation of massiveblack hole binaries during merger events (abridged).

astro-ph;0306128	red galaxy clustering in the noao deep wide-field survey	we have measured the clustering of z&lt;0.9 red galaxies and constrained modelsof the evolution of large-scale structure using the initial 1.2 sq. degree datarelease of the noao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs). the area and bwri passbandsof the ndwfs allow samples of &gt;1000 galaxies to be selected as a function ofspectral type, absolute magnitude, and photometric redshift. spectral synthesismodels can be used to predict the colors and luminosities of a galaxypopulation as a function of redshift. we have used pegase2 models, withexponentially declining star formation rates, to estimate the observed colorsand luminosity evolution of galaxies and to connect, as an evolutionarysequence, related populations of galaxies at different redshifts. a red galaxysample, with present-day rest-frame vega colors of bw-r&gt;1.44, was chosen toallow comparisons with the 2df galaxy redshift survey and sloan digital skysurvey. we find the spatial clustering of red galaxies to be a strong functionof luminosity, with r0 increasing from 4.4+/-0.4 mpc/h at m_r=-20 to 11.2+/-1.0mpc/h at m_r=-22. clustering evolution measurements using samples where therest-frame selection criteria vary with redshift, including all deepsingle-band magnitude limited samples, are biased due to the correlation ofclustering with rest-frame color and luminosity. the clustering of m_r=-21,bw-r&gt;1.44 galaxies exhibits no significant evolution over the redshift rangeobserved with r0= 6.3+/-0.5 mpc/h in comoving coordinates. this is consistentwith recent lcdm models where the bias of l* galaxies undergoes rapid evolutionand r0 evolves very slowly at z&lt;2.

astro-ph;0310845	microlensing candidates in m87 and the virgo cluster with the hubble  space telescope	the position of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 at the center of the virgocluster means that the inferred column density of dark matter associated withboth the cluster halo and the galaxy halo is quite large. this system is thusan important laboratory for studying massive dark objects in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters by gravitational microlensing, stronglycomplementing the studies of spiral galaxy halos performed in the local group.we have performed a microlensing survey of m87 with the wfpc2 instrument on thehubble space telescope. over a period of thirty days, with images taken oncedaily, we discover seven variable sources. four are variable stars of somesort, two are consistent with classical novae, and one exhibits an excellentmicrolensing lightcurve, though with a very blue color implying the somewhatdisfavored possibility of a horizontal branch source being lensed. based onsensitivity calculations from artificial stars and from artificial lightcurves,we estimate the expected microlensing rate. we find that the detection of oneevent is consistent with a dark halo with a 20% contribution of microlensingobjects for both m87 and the virgo cluster, similar to the value found fromobservations in the local group. further work is required to test thehypothesized microlensing component to the cluster.

astro-ph;0403257	black hole mass determinations from orbit superposition models are  reliable	we show that orbit-superposition dynamical models (schwarzschild's method)provide reliable estimates of nuclear black hole masses and errors whenconstructed from adequate orbit libraries and kinematic data. we thus rebut tworecent papers that argue that bh masses obtained from this method areunreliable. these papers claim to demonstrate that the range of allowable bhmasses derived from a given dataset is artificially too narrow as a result ofan inadequate number of orbits in the library used to construct dynamicalmodels. this is an elementary error that is easily avoided. we describe amethod to estimate the number and nature of orbits needed for the library. weprovide an example that shows that this prescription is adequate, in the sensethat the range of allowable bh masses is not artificially narrowed by use oftoo few orbits. a second point raised by critics is that kinematic data aregenerally obtained with insufficient spatial resolution to obtain a reliablemass. we make the distinction between unreliable determinations and impreciseones. we show that there are several different properties of a kinematicdataset that can lead to imprecise bh determinations, but none of theattributes we have investigated leads to an unreliable determination. in short,the degree to which the bh radius of influence is resolved by spectroscopicobservations is already reflected in the bh-mass error envelope, and is not ahidden source of error. the bh masses published by our group and the leidengroup are reliable.

0808.4001	a stellar dynamical measurement of the black hole mass in the maser  galaxy ngc 4258	we determine the mass of the black hole at the center of the spiral galaxyngc 4258 by constructing axisymmetric dynamical models of the galaxy. thesemodels are constrained by high spatial resolution imaging and long-slitspectroscopy of the nuclear region obtained with the {\em hubble spacetelescope}, complemented by ground-based observations extending to largerradii. our best mass estimate is $\mbh = (3.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^7 \msun $ fora distance of 7.28 mpc (statistical errors only). this is within 15% of $(3.82\pm 0.01) \times 10^7 \msun$, the mass determined from the kinematics ofwater masers (rescaled to the same distance) assuming they are in keplerianrotation in a warped disk. the construction of accurate dynamical models of ngc4258 is somewhat compromised by an unresolved active nucleus and colorgradients, the latter caused by variations in the stellar population and/orobscuring dust. these problems are not present in the $\sim 30$ other blackhole mass determinations from stellar dynamics that have been published by usand other groups; thus, the relatively close agreement between the stellardynamical mass and the maser mass in ngc 4258 enhances our confidence in theblack hole masses determined in other galaxies from stellar dynamics usingsimilar methods and data of comparable quality.

0705.4103	selection bias in observing the cosmological evolution of the mbh-sigma  and mbh-l relationships	programs to observe evolution in the mbh-sigma or mbh-l relations typicallycompare black-hole masses, mbh, in high-redshift galaxies selected by nuclearactivity to mbh in local galaxies selected by luminosity l, or stellar velocitydispersion sigma. because agn luminosity is likely to depend on mbh, selectioneffects are different for high-redshift and local samples, potentiallyproducing a false signal of evolution. this bias arises because cosmic scatterin the mbh-sigma and mbh-l relations means that the mean log(l) or log(sigma)among galaxies that host a black hole of given mbh, may be substantiallydifferent than the log(l) or log(sigma) obtained from inverting the mbh-l ormbh-sigma relations for the same nominal mbh. the bias is particularly strongat high mbh, where the luminosity and dispersion functions of galaxies arefalling rapidly. the most massive black holes occur more often as rare outliersin galaxies of modest mass than in the even rarer high-mass galaxies, whichwould otherwise be the sole location of such black holes in the absence ofcosmic scatter. because of this bias, mbh will typically appear to be too largein the distant sample for a given l or sigma. for the largest black holes andthe largest plausible cosmic scatter, the bias can reach a factor of 3 in mbhfor the mbh-sigma relation and a factor of 9 for the mbh-l relation.unfortunately, the actual cosmic scatter is not known well enough to correctfor the bias. measuring evolution of the mbh and galaxy property relationsrequires object selection to be precisely defined and exactly the same at allredshifts.

astro-ph;0606739	the masses of nuclear black holes in luminous elliptical galaxies and  implications for the space density of the most massive black holes	black hole masses predicted from the mbh-sigma relationship conflict withthose predicted from the mbh-l relationship for the most luminous galaxies,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). this is because stellar velocitydispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with l for bcgs and other giantellipticals. the mbh-l relationship predicts that the most luminous bcgs mayhave mbh approaching 10^{10}m_sol, while the m-sigma relationship alwayspredicts mbh&lt;3x10^9m_sol. we argue that the mbh-l relationship is a plausibleor even preferred description for bcgs and other galaxies of similarluminosity. if cores in central stellar density are formed by binary bhs, thenthe inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of mbh.using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxiesobserved by hst, we argue that l is superior to sigma as an indicator ofr_gamma in luminous galaxies. the observed r_gamma-mbh relationship for 11 coregalaxies with measured mbh appears to be consistent with the mbh-l relationshipfor bcgs. bcgs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities thatmay be difficult to generate with the modest bh masses inferred from thembh-sigma relationship. mbh~l may be expected to hold for bcgs, if they wereformed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of bh to stellarmass. this picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigmawith l and the more rapid increase in effective radii with l seen in bcgs. ifbcgs have large bhs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local bhmass function for mbh&gt;3x10^9m_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richerthan that inferred from the mbh-sigma relationship. the volume density of qsosat earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the mbh-l relationship.

astro-ph;0609762	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst. vi. bimodal central surface  brightness profiles	we combine the results from several hst investigations of the centralstructure of early-type galaxies to generate a large sample of parameterizedsurface photometry. the studies included were those that used the "nuker law"to characterize the inner light distributions of the galaxies. the samplecomprises wfpc1 and wfpc2 v band observations published earlier by our group, rband wfpc2 photometry of rest et al., nicmos h band photometry by ravindranathet al. and quillen et al., and the bcg wfpc2 i band photometry of laine et al.the distribution of the logarithmic slopes of the central profiles stronglyaffirms that the central structure of elliptical galaxies with mv &lt; -19 isbimodal, based on both parametric and non-parametric analysis. at the hstresolution limit, most galaxies are either power-law systems, which have steepcusps in surface brightness, or core systems, which have shallow cusps interiorto a steeper envelope brightness distribution. a rapid transition between thetwo forms occurs over the luminosity range -22 &lt; mv &lt; -20, with coresdominating at the highest luminosities, and power-laws at the lowest. there area few "intermediate" systems that have both cusp slopes and total luminositiesthat fall within the core/power-law transition, but they are rare and do notfill in the overall bimodal distribution of cusp slopes. these results areinconsistent with the ferrarese et al. virgo cluster survey (vcs) analysis.however, using galaxies common to the vcs samples, we demonstrate that the vcsmodels of the cusps are either a poor match to the observations or consist offorms fitted to the galaxy envelopes and extrapolated inward to the hstresolution limit.

astro-ph;9607094	hubble space telescope observations of m32: the color-magnitude diagram	we present a v-i color-magnitude diagram for a region 1'-2' from the centerof m32 based on hubble space telescope wfpc2 images. the broad color-luminositydistribution of red giants shows that the stellar population comprises starswith a wide range in metallicity. this distribution cannot be explained by aspread in age. the blue side of the giant branch rises to m_i ~ -4.0 and can befitted with isochrones having [fe/h] ~ -1.5. the red side consists of a heavilypopulated and dominant sequence that tops out at m_i ~ -3.2, and extends beyondv-i=4. this sequence can be fitted with isochrones with -0.2 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; +0.1,for ages running from 15 gyr to 5 gyr respectively. we do not find theoptically bright asymptotic giant branch stars seen in previous ground-basedwork and argue that the majority of them were artifacts of crowding. ourresults are consistent with the presence of the infrared-luminous giants foundin ground-based studies, though their existence cannot be directly confirmed byour data. there is little evidence for an extended or even a red horizontalbranch, but we find a strong clump on the giant branch itself. if the agespread is not extreme, the distribution of metallicities in m32 is considerablynarrower than that of the closed-box model of chemical evolution, and alsoappears somewhat narrower than that of the solar neighborhood. overall, the m32hst color-magnitude diagram is consistent with the average luminosity-weightedage of 8.5 gyr and [fe/h] = -0.25 inferred from integrated spectral indices.

astro-ph;9610055	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst. iv. central parameter  relations	we analyze hubble space telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hot galaxies). luminous hot galaxieshave cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r ~ r_b toshallow inner profiles with logslope less than 0.3. faint hot galaxies showsteep, largely featureless power-law profiles at all radii and lack cores. thecenters of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass andluminosity than the cores of large galaxies at a limiting radius of 10 pc. atintermediate magnitudes (-22.0 &lt; m_v &lt; -20.5), core and power-law galaxiescoexist, and there is a range in r_b at a given luminosity of at least twoorders of magnitude. central properties correlate with global rotation andshape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-lawgalaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. the dense power-law centers ofdisky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-richmergers. the parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products ofgas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. for example, core galaxies accretesmall, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-densitycores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. an alternative modelfor core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (bhs): thebh may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any existsand scouring out a core. an average bh mass per spheroid of 0.002 times thestellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii ofobserved cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of agns andkinematic detections of bhs in nearby galaxies.

(1997). the bcgglobular cluster luminosity functions give distances essentially identical tothe sbf results. using the velocities and sbf distances of the four bcg alonegives h_0 = 82 +/- 8 km/s/mpc in the cmb frame, valid on ~4,500 km/s scales.use of bcg as photometric redshift estimators allows the bcg hubble diagram tobe calibrated independently of recession velocities, yielding a far field h_0 =89 +/- 10 km/s/mpc with an effective depth of ~11,000 km/s. the error in thiscase is dominated by the photometric cosmic scatter in using bcg as distanceestimators. the concordance of the present results with other recent h_0determinations, and a review of theoretical treatments on perturbations in thenear field hubble flow, argue that going to the far field removes an importantsource of uncertainty, but that there is not a large systematic error to becorrected for to begin with. further improvements in h_0 depend more onunderstanding nearby calibrators than on improved sampling of the distant flow.

astro-ph;9810394	combining undersampled dithered images	undersampled images, such as those produced by the hst wfpc-2, misrepresentfine-scale structure intrinsic to the astronomical sources being imaged.analyzing such images is difficult on scales close to their resolution limitsand may produce erroneous results. a set of ``dithered'' images of anastronomical source generally contains more information about its structurethan any single undersampled image, however, and may permit reconstruction of a``superimage'' with nyquist sampling. i present a tutorial on a method of imagereconstruction that builds a superimage from a complex linear combination ofthe fourier transforms of a set of undersampled dithered images. this methodworks by algebraically eliminating the high order satellites in the periodictransforms of the aliased images. the reconstructed image is an exactrepresentation of the data-set with no loss of resolution at the nyquist scale.the algorithm is directly derived from the theoretical properties of aliasedimages and involves no arbitrary parameters, requiring only that the dithersare purely translational and constant in pixel-space over the domain of theobject of interest. i show examples of its application to wfc and pc images. iargue for its use when the best recovery of point sources or morphologicalinformation at the hst diffraction limit is of interest.

astro-ph;9907100	the photometry of undersampled point spread functions	an undersampled point spread function may interact with the microstructure ofa solid-state detector such that the total flux detected can depend sensitivelyon where the psf center falls within a pixel. such intra-pixel sensitivityvariations will not be corrected by flat field calibration and may limit theaccuracy of stellar photometry conducted with undersampled images, as aretypical for hubble space telescope observations. the total flux in a stellarimage can vary by up to 0.03 mag in f555w wfc images depending on how it issampled, for example. for nic3, these variations are especially strong, up to0.39 mag, strongly limiting its use for stellar photometry. intra-pixelsensitivity variations can be corrected for, however, by constructing awell-sampled psf from a dithered data set. the reconstructed psf is theconvolution of the optical psf with the pixel response. it can be evaluated atany desired fractional pixel location to generate a table of photometriccorrections as a function of relative psf centroid. a caveat is that thecentroid of an undersampled psf can also be affected by the pixel responsefunction, thus sophisticated centroiding methods, such as cross-correlating theobserved psf with its fully-sampled counterpart, are required to derive theproper photometric correction.

0811.0391	color bimodality in m87 globular clusters	we present an analysis of a 50 orbit hst acs observation of the m87 globularcluster system. we use the extraordinary depth of this dataset to test whetherthe colors and magnitudes show evidence for a mass-metallicity relation inglobular cluster populations. we find only a weak or absent relation betweenthe colors and magnitudes of the metal poor subpopulation of globular clusters.the weakness or absence of a color-magnitude relation is established over awide range in luminosity from $m_v=-11$ to $m_v=-6$, encompassing most of them87 globular clusters. the constancy of the colors of the metal-poorsubpopulation seen in our 50 orbit observation is in contrast to suggestionsfrom single orbit acs data that the metal-poor globular clusters in m87 andseveral other galaxies show a "blue tilt." the formal best fit for themass-metallicity relation for the metal-poor subpopulation in our much deeperdata is $z\propto m^{0.08\pm0.05}$. our analysis of these data also shows apossible small "red tilt" in the metal-rich globular cluster subpopulation.while either of these small tilts may be real, they may also illustrate thelimit to which mass-metallicity relations can be determined, even in suchextraordinarily deep data. we specifically test for a wide range of systematiceffects and find that while small tilts cannot be confirmed or rejected, thedata place a strong upper limit to any tilt of $|0.20|\pm0.05$. this upperlimit is much smaller than some earlier claims from single orbit data, andstrongly limits self-enrichment within globular clusters. this mass-metallicityrelation for globular clusters is also shallower than the relation forgalaxies, suggesting that the formation mechanisms for these two types ofobjects are different.
