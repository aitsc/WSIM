0704.1129	sw sextantis stars: the dominant population of cvs with orbital periods  between 3-4 hours	[abridged] we present time-series optical photometry of five new cvsidentified by the hamburg quasar survey. the eclipses observed in hs 0129+2933,hs 0220+0603, and hs 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. hs0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)h. time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new cvs (with the exception of hs0805+3822) is also presented. radial velocity studies provided an orbitalperiod of 3.55 h for hs 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observedphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. the spectroscopicbehaviour clearly identifies these new cvs as new sw sextantis stars. these newadditions increase the number of known sw sex stars to 35. almost 40 per centof the total sw sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating therequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and themodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. on the other hand,the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becomingmore pronounced. in fact, almost half the cvs which populate the 3-4.5 h periodinterval are definite members of the class. these statistics are confirmed byour results from the hamburg quasar survey cvs. remarkably, 54 per cent of thehamburg nova-like variables have been identified as sw sex stars with orbitalperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. the observation of this pile-up of systems closeto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with thestandard theory of cv evolution, as the sw sex stars are believed to have thehighest mass transfer rates among cvs. finally, we review the full range ofcommon properties that the sw sex stars exhibit.

0905.3476	sdss unveils a population of intrinsically faint cataclysmic variables  at the minimum orbital period	we discuss the properties of 137 cataclysmic variables (cvs) which areincluded in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic data base, andfor which accurate orbital periods have been measured. 92 of these systems arenew discoveries from sdss and were followed-up in more detail over the past fewyears. 45 systems were previously identified as cvs because of the detection ofoptical outbursts and/or x-ray emission, and subsequently re-identified fromthe sdss spectroscopy. the period distribution of the sdss cvs differsdramatically from that of all the previously known cvs, in particular itcontains a significant accumulation of systems in the orbital period range80--86 min. we identify this feature as the elusive "period minimum spike"predicted by cv population models, which resolves a long-standing discrepancybetween compact binary evolution theory and observations. we show that thisspike is almost entirely due to the large number of cvs with very low accretionactivity identified by sdss. the optical spectra of these systems are dominatedby emission from the white dwarf photosphere, and display little or nospectroscopic signature from the donor stars, suggesting very low-masscompanion stars. we determine the average absolute magnitude of theselow-luminosity cvs at the period minimum to be &lt;m_g&gt;=11.6+-0.7. comparison ofthe sdss cv sample to the cvs found in the hamburg quasar survey and thepalomar green survey suggests that the depth of sdss is the key ingredientresulting in the discovery of a large number of intrinsically faintshort-period systems.

0707.0449	optical spectroscopy of the low mass x-ray binary gx9+9	phase-resolved medium resolution vlt spectroscopy of the low mass x-raybinary gx9+9 has revealed narrow ciii emission lines that move in phaserelative to our new estimate of the ephemeris, and show a velocity amplitude of230+/-35 km/s. we identify the origin of these lines as coming from the surfaceof the donor star, thereby providing the first estimate of the mass function off(m_1)&gt;=0.22m_sun. rotational broadening estimates together with assumptionsfor the mass donor give 0.07&lt;q&lt;0.35 and 182&lt;k_2&lt;406 km/s. despite a low massratio, there is no evidence for a superhump in our dataset. doppler maps ofgx9+9 show the presence of a stream overflow, either in the form of materialflowing downward along the accretion disk rim or in a similar fashion as occursin high mass transfer rate cataclysmic variables known as the sw sex stars.finally we note that the bowen region in gx9+9 is dominated by ciii instead ofniii emission as has been the case for most other x-ray binaries.

0907.4376	the quiescent spectral energy distribution of v404 cyg	we present a multiwavelength study of the black hole x-ray binary v404 cyg inquiescence, focusing upon the spectral energy distribution (sed). radio,optical, uv, and x-ray coverage is simultaneous. we supplement the sed withadditional non-simultaneous data in the optical through infrared wherenecessary. the compiled sed is the most complete available for this, the x-rayand radio brightest quiescent black hole system. we find no need for asubstantial contribution from accretion light from the near-uv to the near-ir,and in particular the weak uv emission constrains published spectral models forv404 cyg. we confirm that no plausible companion spectrum and interstellarextinction can fully explain the mid-ir, however, and an ir excess from a jetor cool disc appears to be required. the x-ray spectrum is consistent with agamma~2 power-law as found by all other studies to date. there is no evidencefor any variation in the hardness over a range of a factor of 10 in luminosity.the radio flux is consistent with a flat spectrum (in f(nu)). the breakfrequency between a flat and optically thin spectrum most likely occurs in themid or far-ir, but is not strongly constrained by these data. we find the radioto be substantially variable but with no clear correlation with x-rayvariability.

0911.2516	the optical counterparts of accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars during  quiescence	eight accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars (amxps) are known to date. opticaland nir observations carried out during quiescence give a unique opportunity toconstrain the nature of the donor star and to investigate the origin of theobserved quiescent luminosity at long wavelengths. using data obtained with theeso-very large telescope, we performed a deep optical and nir photometric studyof the fields of xte j1814-338 and of the ultracompact systems xte j0929-314and xte j1807-294 during quiescence in order to look for the presence of avariable counterpart. if suitable candidates were found, we also carried outoptical spectroscopy. we present here the first multi-band (vr) detection ofthe optical counterpart of xte j1814-338 in quiescence together with itsoptical spectrum. the optical light curve shows variability in both bandsconsistent with a sinusoidal modulation at the known 4.3 hr orbital period andpresents a puzzling decrease of the v-band flux around superior conjunctionthat may be interpreted as a partial eclipse. the marginal detection of thevery faint counterpart of xte j0929-314 and deep upper limits for theoptical/nir counterpart of xte j1807-294 are also reported. we also brieflydiscuss the results reported in the literature for the optical/nir counterpartof xte j1751-305. our findings are consistent with amxps being systemscontaining an old, weakly magnetized neutron star, reactivated as a millisecondradio pulsar during quiescence which irradiates the low-mass companion star.the absence of type i x-ray bursts and of hydrogen and helium lines in outburstspectra of ultracompact (p_orb &lt; 1 hr) amxps suggests that the companion starsare likely evolved dwarf stars.

1004.0435	doppler tomography of the black hole binary a0620-00 and the origin of  chromospheric emission in quiescent x-ray binaries	doppler tomography of emission line profiles in low mass x-ray binariesallows us to disentangle the different emission sites and study the structureand variability of accretion disks. we present uves high-resolutionspectroscopic observations of the black hole binary a0620-00 atquiescence.these spectroscopic data constrain the orbital parametersporb=0.32301405(1) d and k2=437.1+-2.0 km/s. these values, together with themass ratio q=m2/m1=0.062+-0.010, imply a minimum mass for the compact object ofm1(sin i)^3=3.15+-0.10 msun, consistent with previous works.the h$\alpha$emission from the accretion disk is much weaker than in previous studies,possibly due to a decrease in disk activity. doppler imaging of the h$\alpha$line shows for the first time a narrow component coming from the secondarystar, with an observed equivalent width of 1.4+-0.3 angstroms, perhapsassociated to chromospheric activity. subtracting a k-type template star andcorrecting for the veiling of the accretion disk yields to an equivalent widthof 2.8+-0.3 angstroms. a bright hot-spot is also detected at the position wherethe gas stream trajectory intercepts with the accretion disk. the h$\alpha$flux associated to the secondary star is too large to be powered by x-rayirradiation. it is comparable to those observed in rs cvn binaries with similarorbital periods and, therefore, is probably triggered by the rapid stellarrotation.

1009.1043	the necklace: equatorial and polar outflows from the binary central star  of the new planetary nebula iphasxj194359.5+170901	iphasxj194359.5+170901 is a new high-excitation planetary nebula withremarkable characteristics. it consists of a knotty ring expanding at a speedof 28 km/s, and a fast collimated outflow in the form of faint lobes and capsalong the direction perpendicular to the ring. the expansion speed of the polarcaps is 100 km/s, and their kinematical age is twice as large as the age of thering. time-resolved photometry of the central star of iphasxj194359.5+170901reveals a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 1.16 days. this is interpretedas evidence for binarity of the central star, the brightness variations beingrelated to the orbital motion of an irradiated companion. this is supported bythe spectrum of the central star in the visible range, which appears to bedominated by emission from the irradiated zone, consisting of a warm (6000-7000k) continuum, narrow c iii, c iv, and n iii emission lines, and broader linesfrom a flat h i balmer sequence in emission. iphasxj194359.5+170901 helps toclarify the role of (close) binaries in the formation and shaping of planetarynebulae. the output of the common-envelope evolution of the system is astrongly flattened circumstellar mass deposition, a feature that seems to bedistinctive of this kind of binary system. also, iphasxj194359.5+170901 isamong the first post-ce pne for which the existence of a high-velocity polaroutflow has been demonstrated. its kinematical age might indicate that thepolar outflow is formed before the common-envelope phase. this points to masstransfer onto the secondary as the origin, but alternative explanations arealso considered.

1111.6946	the nature of the x-ray transient maxi j0556-332	phase-resolved spectroscopy of the newly discovered x-ray transient maxij0556-332 has revealed the presence of narrow emission lines in the bowenregion that most likely arise on the surface of the mass donor star in this lowmass x-ray binary. a period search of the radial velocities of these linesprovides two candidate orbital periods (16.43+/-0.12 and 9.754+/-0.048 hrs),which differ from any potential x-ray periods reported. assuming that maxij0556-332 is a relatively high inclination system that harbors a precessingaccretion disk in order to explain its x-ray properties, it is only possible toobtain a consistent set of system parameters for the longer period. theseassumptions imply a mass ratio of q~0.45, a radial velocity semi-amplitude ofthe secondary of k_2~190 km/s and a compact object mass of the order of thecanonical neutron star mass, making a black hole nature for maxi j0556-332unlikely. we also report the presence of strong n iii emission lines in thespectrum, thereby inferring a high n/o abundance. finally we note that thestrength of all emission lines shows a continuing decay over the ~1 month ofour observations.

1303.6308	a 420 day x-ray/optical modulation and extended x-ray dips in the  short-period transient swift j1753.5-0127	we have discovered a \sim420d modulation, with associated x-ray dips, inrxte-asm/maxi/swift-bat archival light-curves of the short-period (3.2h)black-hole x-ray transient, swift j1753.5-0127. this modulation only appearedat the end of a gradual rebrightening, approximately 3 years after the initialx-ray outburst in mid-2005. the same periodicity is present in both the 2-20kev and 15-50 kev bands, but with a \sim0.1 phase offset (\sim40d).contemporaneous photometry in the optical and near-ir reveals a weakermodulation, but consistent with the x-ray period. there are two substantialx-ray dips (very strong in the 15-50 kev band, weaker at lower energies) thatare separated by an interval equal to the x-ray period. this likely indicatestwo physically separated emitting regions for the hard x-ray and lower energyemission. we interpret this periodicity as a property of the accretion disc,most likely a long-term precession, where the disc edge structure and x-rayirradiation is responsible for the hard x-ray dips and modulation, although wediscuss other possible explanations, including lense-thirring precession in theinner disc region and spectral state variations. such precession indicates avery high mass ratio lmxb, which even for a \sim10m_sun bh requires a browndwarf donor (\sim0.02m_sun), making swift j1753.5-0127 a possible analogue ofmillisecond x-ray pulsars.we compare the properties of swift j1753.5-0127 withother recently discovered short-period transients, which are now forming aseparate population of high latitude bh transients located in the galactichalo.

1401.3711	a be-type star with a black hole companion	stellar-mass black holes have all been discovered through x-ray emission,which arises from the accretion of gas from their binary companions (this gasis either stripped from low-mass stars or supplied as winds from massive ones).binary evolution models also predict the existence of black holes accretingfrom the equatorial envelope of rapidly spinning be-type stars (stars of the betype are hot blue irregular variables showing characteristic spectral emissionlines of hydrogen). of the ~80 be x-ray binaries known in the galaxy, however,only pulsating neutron stars have been found as companions. a black hole wasformally allowed as a solution for the companion to the be star mwc 656 (alsoknown as hd 215227), although that was based on a single radial velocity curveof the be star, a mistaken spectral classification and rough estimates of theinclination angle. here we report observations of an accretion disk linemirroring the orbit of the be star. this, together with an improved radialvelocity curve of the be star through fitting sharp fe ii profiles from theequatorial disk, and a refined be classification (to that of a b1.5-b2 iiistar), reveals a black hole of 3.8 to 6.9 solar masses orbiting mwc 656, thecandidate counterpart of the gamma-ray source agl j2241+4454. the black hole isx-ray quiescent and fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow giving aluminosity less than 1.6 x 10-7 times the eddington luminosity. this impliesthat be binaries with black-hole companions are difficult to detect byconventional x-ray surveys.

1404.0901	discovery of x-ray emission from the first be/black hole system	mwc 656 (= hd 215227) was recently discovered to be the first binary systemcomposed of a be star and a black hole (bh). we observed it with\textit{xmm-newton}, and detected a faint x-ray source compatible with theposition of the optical star, thus proving it to be the first be/bh x-raybinary. the spectrum analysis requires a model fit with two components, a blackbody plus a power law, with $k_{\rm b}t = 0.07^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$~kev and aphoton index $\gamma= 1.0\pm0.8$, respectively. the non-thermal componentdominates above $\simeq$0.8 kev. the obtained total flux is $f(0.3$--$5.5~{\rmkev}) = (4.6^{+1.3}_{-1.1})\times10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. at adistance of $2.6\pm0.6$~kpc the total flux translates into a luminosity $l_{\rmx} = (3.7\pm1.7)\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. considering the estimated range ofbh masses to be 3.8--6.9 $m_{\odot}$, this luminosity represents$(6.7\pm4.4)\times10^{-8}~l_{\rm edd}$, which is typical of stellar-mass bhs inquiescence. we discuss the origin of the two spectral components: the thermalcomponent is associated with the hot wind of the be star, whereas the power lawcomponent is associated with emission from the vicinity of the bh. we also findthat the position of mwc~656 in the radio versus x-ray luminosity diagram maybe consistent with the radio/x-ray correlation observed in bh low-mass x-raybinaries. this suggests that this correlation might also be valid for bhhigh-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) with x-ray luminosities down to $\sim10^{-8}l_{\rm edd}$. mwc~656 will allow the accretion processes and theaccretion/ejection coupling at very low luminosities for bh~hmxbs to bestudied.

1408.6526	the large observatory for x-ray timing	the large observatory for x-ray timing (loft) was studied within esa m3cosmic vision framework and participated in the final down-selection for alaunch slot in 2022-2024. thanks to the unprecedented combination of effectivearea and spectral resolution of its main instrument, loft will study thebehaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitationalfield in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes andneutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutronstars. the science payload is based on a large area detector (lad, 10 m 2effective area, 2-30 kev, 240 ev spectral resolution, 1 deg collimated field ofview) and a widefield monitor (wfm, 2-50 kev, 4 steradian field of view, 1arcmin source location accuracy, 300 ev spectral resolution). the wfm isequipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. grb) localization. thetrigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30s from discovery. in this paper we present the status of the mission at the endof its phase a study.

1501.02208	evidence of coupling between the thermal and nonthermal emission in the  gamma-ray binary ls i +61 303	the gamma-ray binary ls i +61 303 is composed of a be star and a compactcompanion orbiting in an eccentric orbit. variable flux modulated with theorbital period of ~26.5 d has been detected from radio to very high-energygamma rays. in addition, the system presents a superorbital variability of thephase and amplitude of the radio outburst with a period of ~4.6 yr. we presentoptical photometric observations of ls i +61 303 spanning ~1.5 yr andcontemporaneous halpha equivalent width (ew halpha) data. the opticalphotometry shows, for the first time, that the known orbital modulation suffersa positive orbital phase shift and an increase in flux for data obtained 1-yrapart. this behavior is similar to that already known at radio wavelengths,indicating that the optical flux follows the superorbital variability as well.the orbital modulation of the ew halpha presents the already known superorbitalflux variability but shows, also for the first time, a positive orbital phaseshift. in addition, the optical photometry exhibits a lag of ~0.1-0.2 inorbital phase with respect to the ew halpha measurements at similarsuperorbital phases, and presents a lag of ~0.1 and ~0.3 orbital phases withrespect noncontemperaneous radio and x-ray outbursts, respectively. the phaseshifts detected in the orbital modulation of thermal indicators, such as theoptical flux and the ew halpha, are in line with the observed behavior fornonthermal indicators, such as x-ray or radio emission. this shows that thereis a strong coupling between the thermal and nonthermal emission processes inthe gamma-ray binary ls i +61 303. the orbital phase lag between the opticalflux and the ew halpha is naturally explained considering different emittingregions in the circumstellar disk, whereas the secular evolution might becaused by the presence of a moving one-armed spiral density wave in the disk.

1504.03146	on the formation and evolution of the first be star in a black hole  binary mwc 656	we find that the formation of mwc 656 (the first be binary containing a blackhole) involves a common envelope phase and a supernova explosion. this resultsupports the idea that a rapidly rotating be star can emerge out of a commonenvelope phase, which is very intriguing because this evolutionary stage isthought to be too fast to lead to significant accretion and spin up of the bstar.  we predict $\sim 10-100$ of b bh binaries to currently reside in the galacticdisk, among which around $1/3$ contain a be star, but there is only a smallchance to observe a system with parameters resembling mwc 656. if mwc 656 isrepresentative of intrinsic galactic be bh binary population, it may indicatethat standard evolutionary theory needs to be revised. this would pose anotherevolutionary problem in understanding bh binaries, with bh x-ray novaeformation issue being the prime example.  the future evolution of mwc 656 with a $\sim 5$ m$_{\odot}$ black hole andwith a $\sim 13$ m$_{\odot}$ main sequence companion on a $\sim 60$ day orbitmay lead to the formation of a coalescing bh-ns system. the estimated advancedligo/virgo detection rate of such systems is up to $\sim 0.2$ yr$^{-1}$. thisempirical estimate is a lower limit as it is obtained with only one particularevolutionary scenario, the mwc 656 binary. this is only a third such estimateavailable (after cyg x-1 and cyg x-3), and it lends additional support to theexistence of so far undetected bh--ns binaries.

1507.07473	the binary millisecond pulsar psr j1023+0038 during its accretion state  - i. optical variability	we present time-resolved optical photometry of the binary millisecond`redback' pulsar psr j1023+0038 (=ay sex) during its low-mass x-ray binaryphase. the light curves taken between 2014 january and april show an underlyingsinusoidal modulation due to the irradiated secondary star and accretion disc.we also observe superimposed rapid flaring on time-scales as short as ~20 swith amplitudes of ~0.1-0.5 mag and additional large flare events ontime-scales of ~5-60 min with amplitudes ~0.5-1.0 mag. the power densityspectrum of the optical flare light curves is dominated by a red-noisecomponent, typical of aperiodic activity in x-ray binaries. simultaneous x-rayand uv observations by the swift satellite reveal strong correlations that areconsistent with x-ray reprocessing of the uv light, most likely in the outerregions of the accretion disc. on some nights we also observe sharp-edged,rectangular, flat-bottomed dips randomly distributed in orbital phase, with amedian duration of ~250 s and a median ingress/egress time of ~20 s. theserectangular dips are similar to the mode-switching behaviour between disc`active' and `passive' luminosity states, observed in the x-ray light curves ofother redback millisecond pulsars. this is the first time that the opticalanalogue of the x-ray mode-switching has been observed. the properties of thepassive and active state light curves can be explained in terms of clumpyaccretion from a trapped inner accretion disc near the corotation radius,resulting in rectangular, flat-bottomed optical and x-ray light curves.

astro-ph;0011296	evidence of magnetic accretion in an sw sex star: discovery of variable  circular polarization in ls pegasi	we report on the discovery of variable circular polarization in the sw sexstar ls pegasi. the observed modulation has an amplitude of ~0.3 % and a periodof 29.6 minutes, which we assume as the spin period of the magnetic whitedwarf. we also detected periodic flaring in the blue wing of hbeta, with aperiod of 33.5 minutes. the difference between both frequencies is just theorbital frequency, so we relate the 33.5-min modulation to the beat between theorbital and spin period. we propose a new accretion scenario in sw sex stars,based on the shock of the disk-overflown gas stream against the white dwarf'smagnetosphere, which extends to the corotation radius. from this geometry, weestimate a magnetic field strength of b(1) ~ 5-15 mg. our results indicate thatmagnetic accretion plays an important role in sw sex stars and we suggest thatthese systems are probably intermediate polars with the highest mass accretionrates.

astro-ph;0312149	dw cancri: a magnetic vy scl star with an orbital period of 86 minutes	we present the first time-resolved spectroscopic study of the cataclysmicvariable dw cancri. we have determined an orbital period of 86.10 +- 0.05 min,which places the system very close to the observed minimum period ofhydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables. this invalidates previous speculations ofdw cnc being either a permanent superhumper below the period minimum or anova-like variable with an orbital period longer than 3 hours showingquasi-periodic oscillations. the balmer and hei lines have double-peakedprofiles and exhibit an intense s-wave component moving with the orbitalperiod. remarkably, the balmer and hei radial velocity curves are modulated attwo periods: 86.10 +- 0.05 min (orbital) and 38.58 +- 0.02 min. the same shortperiod is found in the equivalent width variations of the single-peaked heii4686 line. we also present time-resolved photometry of the system which shows ahighly-coherent variation at 38.51 min, consistent with the short spectroscopicperiod. the large number of similarities with the short-period intermediatepolar v1025 cen lead us to suggest that dw cnc is another intermediate polarbelow the period gap, and we tentatively identify the photometric andspectroscopic 38-min signals with the white dwarf spin period. dw cnc has neverbeen observed to undergo an outburst, but it occasionally exhibits low states\~2 mag fainter than its typical brightness level of v~14.5, resembling thebehaviour of the high mass-transfer vy scl stars.

astro-ph;0401459	the nonradially-pulsating primary of the cataclysmic variable gw librae	the dwarf nova gw librae is the first cataclysmic variable discovered to havea primary in a white dwarf instability strip, making it the first multi-mode,nonradially-pulsating star known to be accreting. the primaries of cvs,embedded in hot, bright accretion discs, are difficult to study directly.applying the techniques of asteroseismology to gw librae could therefore giveus an unprecedented look at a white dwarf that has undergone ~10^9 years ofaccretion. however, an accreting white dwarf may have characteristicssufficiently different from those of single pulsating white dwarfs to renderthe standard models of white dwarf pulsations invalid for its study. this paperpresents amplitude spectra of gw lib from a series of observing campaignsconducted during 1997, 1998 and 2001. we find that the dominant pulsation modescluster at periods near 650, 370 and 230 s, which also appear in linearcombinations with each other. gw lib's pulsation spectrum is highly unstable ontime-scales of months, and exhibits clusters of signals very closely spaced infrequency, with separations on the order of a few microhz.

astro-ph;0402408	the distance and interstellar sight line to gx339-4	the distance to the black hole binary gx339-4 remains a topic of debate. weexamine high-resolution optical spectra of the nad lines resolving the velocitystructure along the line of sight. we find this to be complex, with at leastnine components, mostly blue-shifted, spanning a velocity range of nearly200km/s. the presence of components with a large blue-shift rules out a nearbylocation and requires that the binary be located at or beyond the tangentpoint, implying a lower limit to the distance of ~6kpc. the presence of asignificant red-shifted component at +30km/s is even more intriguing as gx339-4also has a slightly positive systemic velocity, suggesting that the source, andthis cloud, could be on the far side of the galaxy, where the radial velocitiesdue to galactic rotation become positive again. if this is the case, we requirea distance of ~15kpc. this is less secure than the 6kpc lower limit however. wediscuss the implications of these possible distances for the outburst andquiescent luminosities, and the nature of the companion star, and argue that alarge distance is consistent with these characteristics. in particular, itwould explain the non-detection of the companion star during the fainteststates.

astro-ph;0408331	evidence for a black hole in the x-ray transient gs 1354-64 (=bw cir)	we present the first radial velocity curve of the companion star to bw cirwhich demonstrates the presence of a black hole in this x-ray transient whichrecorded outbursts in 1987 and 1997 (and possibly 1971-2). we identify weakabsorption features corresponding to a g0-5iii donor star, strongly veiled by aresidual accretion disc which contributes 61-65 % of the total light at lambda6300. the doppler motions of these features trace an orbit of p=2.54448 days(or its 1-yr alias of p=2.56358 days) and velocity semi-amplitude k2=279 +- 5km/s (or k2=292 +- 5 km/s). both solutions are equally possible. the massfunction implied by the shorter period solution is f(m)= 5.75 +- 0.30 msunwhich, combined with the rotational broadening of the tidally locked companion(v sin i =71 +- 4 km/s), yields a compact object mass of m1 sin3 i = 7.34 +-0.46 msun. this is substantially above the mass of a neutron star under anystandard equation of state of nuclear matter. the companion star is probably ag subgiant which has evolved off the main sequence in order to fill its rochelobe. remarkably, a distance of &gt; 27 kpc is inferred by the companion'sluminosity and this is supported by the large observed systemic velocity (gamma= 103 +- 4 km/s) which requires such a distance in order to be consistent withthe galactic rotation curve.
