0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0902.1812	the discovery of an m4+t8.5 binary system	we report the discovery of a t8.5 dwarf, which is a companion to the m4 dwarfwolf 940. at a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 au. the m4 primarydisplays no halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of west etal. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 gyr. weak halphaabsorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limitof 6 gyr. we apply the relations of bonfils et al for v-ks and m_ks todetermine the metallicity, [fe/h] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for wolf~940a, and byextension the t8.5 secondary, wolf 940b. we have obtained jhk niri spectroscopyand jhkl' photometry of wolf 940b, and use these data, in combination withtheoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18e-16 wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(l*/lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. using the ageconstraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of baraffe etal. we determine teff = 570 +/- 25k and log g = 4.75-5.00 for wolf940b, basedon its bolometric luminosity. this represents the first determination of theseproperties for a t8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of t-dwarfspectral models. this object represents the first system containing a t8+ dwarffor which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compareits spectra with those of the latest very cool bt-settl models. this clearlydemonstrates that the use of the (w_j,k/j) spectral ratios (used previously toconstrain teff and log g) would have over-estimated teff by ~100k.

0907.0322	a deep look into the core of young clusters. ii. lambda-orionis	over the past years, the lambda-orionis cluster has been a prime location forthe study of young very low mass stars, substellar and isolated planetary massobjects and the determination of the initial mass function and other propertiesof low mass cluster members. in the continuity of our previous studies of youngassociations cores, we search for ultracool members and new multiple systemswithin the central 5.3' (~0.6pc) of the cluster. we obtained deep seeinglimited j, ks-band images of the 5.3' central part of the cluster with ntt/sofiand h-band images with caha/omega2000. these images were complemented bymulti-conjugate adaptive optics (mcao) h and ks images of the 1.5' centralregion of the lambda-orionis cluster obtained with the prototype mcao facilitymad at the vlt. the direct vicinity of the massive lambda-ori o8iii-star wasprobed using naco/sdi at the vlt. finally, we also retrieved spitzer iracimages of the same area and used archival subaru suprime-cam and cfht cfht12ki-band images. we report the detection of 9 new member candidates selected fromoptical and near-ir color-color and color-magnitude diagrams and 7 previouslyknown members. the high spatial resolution images resolve 3 new visual multiplesystems. two of them are most likely not members of the association. the thirdone is made of a brown dwarf candidate companion to the f8v star hd36861c. thesimultaneous differential images allow us to rule out the presence of visualcompanions more massive than m&gt;0.07msun in the range 1-2.5", and m&gt;0.25msun inthe range 0.5-2.5"

1001.4393	the discovery of a very cool binary system	we report the discovery of a very cool d/sdl7+t7.5p common proper motionbinary system, sdss j1416+13ab, found by cross-matching the ukidss large areasurvey data release 5 against the sloan digital sky survey data release 7. thed/sdl7 is blue in j-h and h-k and has other features suggestive oflow-metallicity and/or high gravity. the t7.5p displays spectral peculiarityseen before in earlier type dwarfs discovered in ukidss las dr4, and referredto as ch4-j-early peculiarity. we suggest that ch4-j-early peculiarity arisesfrom low-metallicity and/or high-gravity, and speculate as to its use forclassifying t dwarfs. ukidss and follow-up ukirt/wfcam photometry shows the tdwarf to have the bluest near infrared colours yet seen for such an object withh-k = -1.31+/-0.17. warm spitzer irac photometry shows the t dwarf to haveextremely red h-[4.5] = 4.86+/-0.04, which is the reddest yet seen for asubstellar object. the lack of parallax measurement for the pair limits ourability to estimate parameters for the system. however, applying a conservativedistance estimate of 5-15 pc suggests a projected separation in range 45-135au. by comparing h-k:h-[4.5] colours of the t dwarf to spectral models weestimate that teff = 500 k and [m/h]~-0.30, with log g ~ 5.0. this suggests amass of ~30 mjupiter for the t dwarf and an age of ~10 gyr for the system. theprimary would then be a 75mjupiter object with log g ~ 5.5 and a relativelydust-free teff ~ 1500k atmosphere. given the unusual properties of the systemwe caution that these estimates are uncertain. we eagerly await parallaxmeasurements and high-resolution imaging which will constrain the parametersfurther.

1003.4426	a multiwavelength study of star formation in the vicinity of galactic  hii region sh2-100	we present multiwavelength investigation of morphology, physical-environment,stellar contents and star formation activity in the vicinity of star-formingregion sh 2-100. it is found that the sh 2-100 region contains seven hiiregions of ultracompact and compact nature. the present estimation of distancefor three hii regions, along with the kinematic distance for others, suggeststhat all of them belong to the same molecular cloud complex. using nirphotometry, we identified the most probable ionizing sources of six hiiregions. their approximate photometric spectral type estimates suggest thatthey are massive early-b to mid-o zams stars and agree well with radiocontinuum observations at 1280 mhz. the morphology of the complex shows anon-uniform distribution of warm and hot dust, well mixed with the ionized gas,which correlates well with the variation of average visual extinction (~ 4.2 -97 mag) across the region. we estimated the physical parameters of ionized gaswith the help of radio continuum observations. we detected an optically visiblecompact nebula located to the south of the 850 micron emission associated withone of the hii regions and the diagnostic of the optical emission line ratiosgives electron density and electron temperature of ~ 0.67 x 10^3 cm^-3 and ~10^4 k, respectively. the physical parameters suggest that all the hii regionsare in different stages of evolution, which correlate well with the probableages in the range ~ 0.01 - 2 myr of the ionizing sources. the positions of irexcess stars, ultracompact and compact hii regions at the periphery of an hishell, possibly created by a wr star, indicate that star formation in sh 2-100region might have been induced by an expanding hi shell.

1005.5162	imaging of a transitional disk gap in reflected light: indications of  planet formation around the young solar analog lkca 15	we present h- and ks-band imaging data resolving the gap in the transitionaldisk around lkca 15, revealing the surrounding nebulosity. we detect sharpelliptical contours delimiting the nebulosity on the inside as well as theoutside, consistent with the shape, size, ellipticity, and orientation ofstarlight reflected from the far-side disk wall, whereas the near-side wall isshielded from view by the disk's optically thick bulk. we note thatforward-scattering of starlight on the near-side disk surface could provide analternate interpretation of the nebulosity. in either case, this discoveryprovides confirmation of the disk geometry that has been proposed to explainthe spectral energy distributions (sed) of such systems, comprising anoptically thick outer disk with an inner truncation radius of ~46 au enclosinga largely evacuated gap. our data show an offset of the nebulosity contoursalong the major axis, likely corresponding to a physical pericenter offset ofthe disk gap. this reinforces the leading theory that dynamical clearing by atleast one orbiting body is the cause of the gap. based on evolutionary models,our high-contrast imagery imposes an upper limit of 21 jupiter masses oncompanions at separations outside of 0.1" and of 13 jupiter masses outside of0.2". thus, we find that a planetary system around lkca 15 is the most likelyexplanation for the disk architecture.

1007.0807	pre-transitional disk nature of the ab aur disk	the disk around ab aur was imaged and resolved at 24.6\,$\mu$m using thecooled mid-infrared camera and spectrometer on the 8.2m subaru telescope. thegaussian full-width at half-maximum of the source size is estimated to be 90$\pm$ 6 au, indicating that the disk extends further out at 24.6\,$\mu$m thanat shorter wavelengths. in order to interpret the extended 24.6\,$\mu$m image,we consider a disk with a reduced surface density within a boundary radius$r_c$, which is motivated by radio observations that suggest a reduced innerregion within about 100 au from the star. introducing the surface densityreduction factor $f_c$ for the inner disk, we determine that the best matchwith the observed radial intensity profile at 24.6\,$\mu$m is achieved with$r_c$=88 au and $f_c$=0.01. we suggest that the extended emission at24.6\,$\mu$m is due to the enhanced emission from a wall-like structure at theboundary radius (the inner edge of the outer disk), which is caused by a jumpin the surface density at $r_c$. such reduced inner disk and geometricallythick outer disk structure can also explain the more point-like nature atshorter wavelengths. we also note that this disk geometry is qualitativelysimilar to a pre-transitional disk, suggesting that the ab aur disk is in apre-transitional disk phase.

1011.3575	different evolutionary stages in the massive star forming region s255  complex	to understand evolutionary and environmental effects during the formation ofhigh-mass stars, we observed three regions of massive star formation atdifferent evolutionary stages that reside in the same natal molecular cloud.methods. the three regions s255ir, s255n and s255s were observed at 1.3 mm withthe submillimeter array (sma) and followup short spacing information wasobtained with the iram 30m telescope. near infrared (nir) h + k-band spectraand continuum observations were taken for s255ir with vlt-sinfoni to study thedifferent stellar populations in this region. the combination of millimeter(mm) and near infrared data allow us to characterize different stellarpopulations within the young forming cluster in detail. while we find multiplemm continuum sources toward all regions, their outflow, disk and chemicalproperties vary considerably. the most evolved source s255ir exhibits acollimated bipolar outflow visible in co and h2 emission, the outflows from theyoungest region s255s are still small and rather confined in the regions of themm continuum peaks. also the chemistry toward s255ir is most evolved exhibitingstrong emission from complex molecules, while much fewer molecular lines aredetected in s255n, and in s255s we detect only co isotopologues and so lines.also, rotational structures are found toward s255n and s255ir. furthermore, acomparison of the nir sinfoni and mm data from s255ir clearly reveal twodifferent (proto) stellar populations with an estimated age difference ofapproximately 1 myr. a multi-wavelength spectroscopy and mapping study revealsdifferent evolutionary phases of the star formation regions. we propose thetriggered outside-in collapse star formation scenario for the bigger pictureand the fragmentation scenario for s255ir.

1202.6139	discovery of small-scale spiral structures in the disk of sao 206462 (hd  135344b): implications for the physical state of the disk from spiral density  wave theory	we present high-resolution, h-band, imaging observations, collected withsubaru/hiciao, of the scattered light from the transitional disk around sao206462 (hd 135344b). although previous sub-mm imagery suggested the existenceof the dust-depleted cavity at r~46au, our observations reveal the presence ofscattered light components as close as 0.2" (~28au) from the star. moreover, wehave discovered two small-scale spiral structures lying within 0.5" (~70au). wepresent models for the spiral structures using the spiral density wave theory,and derive a disk aspect ratio of h~0.1, which is consistent with previoussub-mm observations. this model can potentially give estimates of thetemperature and rotation profiles of the disk based on dynamical processes,independently from sub-mm observations. it also predicts the evolution of thespiral structures, which can be observable on timescales of 10-20 years,providing conclusive tests of the model. while we cannot uniquely identify theorigin of these spirals, planets embedded in the disk may be capable ofexciting the observed morphology. assuming that this is the case, we can makepredictions on the locations and, possibly, the masses of the unseen planets.such planets may be detected by future multi-wavelengths observations.

1203.1612	the missing cavities in the seeds polarized scattered light images of  transitional protoplanetary disks: a generic disk model	transitional circumstellar disks around young stellar objects have adistinctive infrared deficit around 10 microns in their spectral energydistributions (sed), recently measured by the spitzer infrared spectrograph(irs), suggesting dust depletion in the inner regions. these disks have beenconfirmed to have giant central cavities by imaging of the submillimeter(sub-mm) continuum emission using the submillimeter array (sma). however, thepolarized near-infrared scattered light images for most objects in a systematicirs/sma cross sample, obtained by hiciao on the subaru telescope, show noevidence for the cavity, in clear contrast with sma and spitzer observations.radiative transfer modeling indicates that many of these scattered light imagesare consistent with a smooth spatial distribution for micron-sized grains, withlittle discontinuity in the surface density of the micron-sized grains at thecavity edge. here we present a generic disk model that can simultaneouslyaccount for the general features in irs, sma, and subaru observations.particularly, the scattered light images for this model are computed, whichagree with the general trend seen in subaru data. decoupling between thespatial distributions of the micron-sized dust and mm-sized dust inside thecavity is suggested by the model, which, if confirmed, necessitates amechanism, such as dust filtration, for differentiating the small and big dustin the cavity clearing process. our model also suggests an inwardly increasinggas-to-dust-ratio in the inner disk, and different spatial distributions forthe small dust inside and outside the cavity, echoing the predictions in graincoagulation and growth models.

1205.3159	high-contrast nir polarization imaging of mwc480	one of the key predictions of modeling from the ir excess of herbig ae starsis that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settlinghas occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partiallyor largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimationradius. when the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expectedto be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scaleheight of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.high-contrast imaging combined with the ir spectral energy distribution allowus to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine theproperties of the outer disk. we present polarimetric differential imaging in$h$ band obtained with subaru/hiciao of one such system, mwc 480. the hiciaodata were obtained at a historic minimum of the nir excess. the disk isdetected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137au). together withthe marginal detection of the disk from 1998 february 24 by hst/nicmos, ourdata constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. when compared with similar measures in co forthe gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of thegas disk scale height (h/r$\sim$0.03). such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giantplanets have formed.

1206.1215	high-resolution near-infrared polarimetry of a circumstellar disk around  ux tau a	we present h-band polarimetric imagery of ux tau a taken with hiciao/ao188 onthe subaru telescope. ux tau a has been classified as a pre-transitional diskobject, with a gap structure separating its inner and outer disks. our imagerytaken with the 0.15 (21 au) radius coronagraphic mask has revealed a stronglypolarized circumstellar disk surrounding ux tau a which extends to 120 au, at aspatial resolution of 0.1 (14 au). it is inclined by 46 \pm 2 degree as thewest side is nearest. although sed modeling and sub-millimeter imagerysuggested the presence of a gap in the disk, with the inner edge of the outerdisk estimated to be located at 25 - 30 au, we detect no evidence of a gap atthe limit of our inner working angle (23 au) at the near-infrared wavelength.we attribute the observed strong polarization (up to 66 %) to light scatteringby dust grains in the disk. however, neither polarization models of thecircumstellar disk based on rayleigh scattering nor mie scatteringapproximations were consistent with the observed azimuthal profile of thepolarization degrees of the disk. instead, a geometric optics model of the diskwith nonspherical grains with the radii of 30 micron meter is consistent withthe observed profile. we suggest that the dust grains have experienced frequentcollisional coagulations and have grown in the circumstellar disk of ux tau a.

(2012), whosemembers only show evidence of the cavity in the millimeter-sized dust but notthe sub-micron-sized dust in resolved images. the two classes of(pre-)transitional disks may form through different mechanisms, or they mayjust be at different evolution stages in the disk clearing process.

1402.1766	the architecture of the lkca 15 transitional disk revealed by  high-contrast imaging	we present four new epochs of ks-band images of the young pre-transitionaldisk around lkca 15, and perform extensive forward modeling to derive thephysical parameters of the disk. we find indications of strongly anisotropicscattering (henyey-greenstein g = 0.67 [-0.11,+0.18]) and a significantlytapered gap edge ('round wall'), but see no evidence that the inner disk, whoseexistence is predicted by the spectral energy distribution, shadows the outerregions of the disk visible in our images. we marginally confirm the existenceof an offset between the disk center and the star along the line of nodes;however, the magnitude of this offset (x = 27 [-20,+19] mas) is notably lowerthan that found in our earlier h-band images (thalmann et al. 2010).intriguingly, we also find, at high significance, an offset of y = 69 [-25,+49] mas perpendicular to the line of nodes. if confirmed by futureobservations, this would imply a highly elliptical -- or otherwise asymmetric-- disk gap with an effective eccentricity of e = ~0.3. such asymmetry wouldmost likely be the result of dynamical sculpting by one or more unseen planetsin the system. finally, we find that the bright arc of scattered light we seein direct imaging observations originates from the near side of the disk, andappears brighter than the far side because of strong forward scattering.

1403.4707	star formation activity in the southern galactic hii region g351.63-1.25	the southern galactic high mass star-forming region, g351.6-1.3, is a hiiregion-molecular cloud complex with a luminosity of 2.0 x 10^5 l_sun, locatedat a distance of 2.4 kpc. in this paper, we focus on the investigation of theassociated hii region, embedded cluster and the interstellar medium in thevicinity of g351.6-1.3. we address the identification of exciting source(s) aswell as the census of stellar populations. the ionised gas distribution hasbeen mapped using the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), india at threecontinuum frequencies: 1280, 610 and 325 mhz. the hii region shows an elongatedmorphology and the 1280 mhz map comprises six resolved high density regionsencompassed by diffuse emission spanning 1.4 pc x 1.0 pc. the zero agemain-sequence (zams) spectral type of the brightest radio core is o7.5. we havecarried out near-infrared observations in the jhks bands using the siriusinstrument on the 1.4 m infrared survey facility (irsf) telescope. thenear-infrared images reveal the presence of a cluster embedded in nebulousfan-shaped emission. the log-normal slope of the k-band luminosity function ofthe embedded cluster is found to be 0.27 +- 0.03 and the fraction of thenear-infrared excess stars is estimated to be 43%. these indicate that the ageof the cluster is consistent with 1 myr. the champagne flow model from a flat,thin molecular cloud is used to explain the morphology of radio emission withrespect to the millimetre cloud and infrared brightness.

1411.2587	the structure of pre-transitional protoplanetary disks. ii. azimuthal  asymmetries, different radial distributions of large and small dust grains in  pds~70	the formation scenario of a gapped disk, i.e., transitional disk, and itsasymmetry is still under debate. proposed scenarios such as disk-planetinteraction, photoevaporation, grain growth, anticyclonic vortex, eccentricity,and their combinations would result in different radial distributions of thegas and the small (sub-$\mu$m size) and large (millimeter size) dust grains aswell as asymmetric structures in a disk. optical/near-infrared (nir) imagingobservations and (sub-)millimeter interferometry can trace small and large dustgrains, respectively; therefore multi-wavelength observations could helpelucidate the origin of complicated structures of a disk. here we report smaobservations of the dust continuum at 1.3~mm and $^{12}$co~$j=2\rightarrow1$line emission of the pre-transitional protoplanetary disk around the solar-massstar pds~70. pds~70, a weak-lined t tauri star, exhibits a gap in the scatteredlight from its disk with a radius of $\sim$65~au at nir wavelengths. however,we found a larger gap in the disk with a radius of $\sim$80~au at 1.3~mm.emission from all three disk components (the gas and the small and large dustgrains) in images exhibits a deficit in brightness in the central region of thedisk, in particular, the dust-disk in small and large dust grains hasasymmetric brightness. the contrast ratio of the flux density in the dustcontinuum between the peak position to the opposite side of the disk reaches1.4. we suggest the asymmetries and different gap-radii of the disk aroundpds~70 are potentially formed by several (unseen) accreting planets inducingdust filtration.

0809.0242	using spica space telescope to characterize exoplanets	we present the 3.5m spica space telescope, a proposed japanese-led jaxa-esamission scheduled for launch around 2017. the actively cooled (&lt;5 k), singleaperture telescope and monolithic mirror will operate from ~3.5 to ~210 um andwill provide superb sensitivity in the mid- and far-ir spectral domain (betterthan jwst at lambda &gt; 18 um). spica is one of the few space missions selectedto go to the next stage of esa's cosmic vision 2015-2025 selection process. inthis white paper we present the main specifications of the three instrumentscurrently baselined for spica: a mid-infrared (mir) coronagraph (~3.5 to ~27um) with photometric and spectral capabilities (r~200), a mir wide-field cameraand high resolution spectrometer (r~30,000), and a far-infrared (fir ~30 to~210 um) imaging spectrometer - safari - led by a european consortium. wediscuss their capabilities in the context of mir direct observations ofexo-planets (eps) and multiband photometry/high resolution spectroscopyobservations of transiting exo-planets. we conclude that spica will be able tocharacterize the atmospheres of transiting exo-planets down to the super-earthsize previously detected by ground- or space-based observatories. it will alsodirectly detect and characterize jupiter/neptune-size planets orbiting atlarger separation from their parent star (&gt;5-10 au), by performing quantitativeatmospheric spectroscopy and studying proto-planetary and debris disks. inaddition, spica will be a scientific and technological precursor for future,more ambitious, ir space missions for exo-planet direct detection as it will,for example, quantify the prevalence exo-zodiacal clouds in planetary systemsand test coronographic techniques, cryogenic systems and lightweight, highquality telescopes.

astro-ph;0504570	a deep survey of brown dwarfs in orion with gemini	we report the results of a deep near infrared (jhk) survey of the outer partsof the trapezium cluster with gemini south/flamingos. 396 sources were detectedin a 26 arcmin^2 area, including 138 brown dwarf candidates, defined as m&lt;0.075msun for an assumed age of 1 myr. only 33 of the brown dwarf candidates areplanetary mass candidates (pmcs) with estimated masses in the range0.003&lt;m&lt;0.012msun. in an extinction limited sample (a(v)&lt;5) complete toapproximately 0.005 msun (5 mjup) the mass function appears to drop by a factorof 2 at the deuterium burning threshold, i.e. at planetary masses. afterallowing for background contamination it is likely that planetary mass objectsat 3-13 mjup number &lt;10% of the cluster population, with an upper limit of 13%.analysis of the spatial distribution of stars and brown dwarf candidatessuggests that brown dwarfs and very low mass stars (m&lt;0.1 msun) are less likelythan more massive stars to have wide (&gt;150 au) binary companions. this resulthas modest statistical significance (96%) in our data but is supported at 93%confidence by analysis of an completely independent sample taken from thesubaru data of kaifu et al.(2000). there is a statistically very significantexcess of both stars and brown dwarfs with small separations from each other(&lt;6 arcsec or 2600 au). this appears to be due to the presence of small nsubgroups, which are likely to be dynamically unstable in the long term. hencethese results are consistent with the 'ejected stellar embryo' hypothesis forbrown dwarf formation (reipurth &amp; clarke 2001). we also report the discovery oftwo new bipolar nebulae, which are interpreted as class i protostars.

astro-ph;0512268	subaru ir echelle spectroscopy of herbig-haro driving sources i. h_2 and  [fe ii] emission	we present infrared echelle spectroscopy of three herbig-haro (hh) drivingsources (svs 13, b5-irs 1 and hh 34 irs) using subaru-ircs. the large diameterof the telescope and wide spectral coverage of the spectrograph allowed us todetect several h_2 and [fe ii] lines in the h- and k-bands. these include h_2lines arising from v=1-3 and j=1-11, and [fe ii] lines with upper levelenergies of e/k=1.1-2.7x10^4 k. for all objects the outflow is found to havetwo velocity components: (1) a high-velocity (-70 to -130 km s^-1) component(hvc), seen in [fe ii] or h_2 emission and associated with a collimated jet;and (2) a low-velocity (-10 to -30 km s^-1) component (lvc), which is seen inh_2 emission only and is spatially more compact. such a kinematic structureresembles optical forbidden emission line outflows associated with classical ttauri stars, whereas the presence of h_2 emission reflects the low-excitationnature of the outflowing gas close to these protostars. the observed h_2 fluxratios indicate a temperature of 2-3x10^3 k, and a gas density of 10^5 cm^-3 ormore, supporting shocks as the heating mechanism. b5-irs 1 exhibits faintextended emission associated with the h_2-lvc, in which the radial velocityslowly increases with distance from the protostar (by ~20 km s^-1 at ~500 au).this is explained as warm molecular gas entrained by an unseen wide-angledwind. the [fe ii] flux ratios indicate electron densities to be ~10^4 cm^-3 orgreater, similar to forbidden line outflows associated with classical t tauristars. finally the kinematic structure of the [fe ii] emission associated withthe base of the b5-irs 1 and hh 34 irs outflows is shown to support disk-windmodels.

astro-ph;0702534	two t dwarfs from the ukidss early data release	we report on the first ultracool dwarf discoveries from the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) large area survey early data release (las edr), inparticular the discovery of t dwarfs which are fainter and more distant thanthose found using the 2mass and sdss surveys. we aim to show that ourmethodologies for searching the ~27 sq degs of the las edr are successful forfinding both l and t dwarfs $via$ cross-correlation with the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) dr4 release. while the area searched so far is small, the numbersof objects found shows great promise for near-future releases of the las andgreat potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. ultracool dwarfs areselected by combinations of their yjh(k) ukidss colours and sdss dr4 z-j andi-z colours, or, lower limits on these red optical/infrared colours in the caseof dr4 dropouts. after passing visual inspection tests, candidates have beenfollowed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.our main result is the discovery following ch4 imaging and spectroscopy of at4.5 dwarf, ulasj 1452+0655, lying ~80pc distant. a further t dwarf candidate,ulasj 1301+0023, has very similar ch4 colours but has not yet been confirmedspectroscopically. we also report on the identification of a brighter l0 dwarf,and on the selection of a list of las objects designed to probe for t-likedwarfs to the survey j-band limit. our findings indicate that the combinationof the ukidss las and sdss surveys provide an excellent tool for identifying land t dwarfs down to much fainter limits than previously possible. ourdiscovery of one confirmed and one probable t dwarf in the edr is consistentwith expectations from the previously measured t dwarf density on the sky.

astro-ph;0702597	near-infrared imaging polarimetry of the star forming region ngc 2024	we conducted wide-field jhks imaging polarimetry toward ngc 2024. we found aprominent and extended polarized nebula over ngc 2024, and constrained thelocation of illuminating source of the nebula through the analysis ofpolarization vectors. a massive star, irs 2b, is located in the center of thesymmetric vector pattern. five small polarized nebulae associated with ysos arediscovered on our polarization images. these nebulae are responsible for thestructures of circumstellar matter that produce strongly polarized lightthrough dust scattering. for the point-like sources, we performed softwareaperture polarimetry in order to measure integrated polarizations, and foundfive young brown dwarfs with highly polarized integrated emission. thesesources serve as direct evidence for the existence of disk/envelope systemaround brown dwarfs. we investigated the magnetic field structure of ngc 2024through the measurements of dichroic polarization. the average position angleof projected magnetic fields across the region is found to be 110 degrees. wefound a good consistency in magnetic field structures obtained usingnear-infrared dichroic polarization and sub-mm/far-infrared dust emissionpolarization, indicating that the dichroic polarizations at near-infraredwavelengths trace magnetic field structures inside dense molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0703237	planetary formation scenarios revistied: core-accretion versus disk  instability	the core-accretion and disk instability models have so far been used toexplain planetary formation. these models have different conditions, such asplanet mass, disk mass, and metallicity for formation of gas giants. thecore-accretion model has a metallicity condition ([fe/h] &gt; &amp;#8722;1.17 in thecase of g-type stars), and the mass of planets formed is less than 6 times thatof the jupiter mass mj. on the other hand, the disk instability model does nothave the metallicity condition, but requires the disk to be 15 times moremassive compared to the minimum mass solar nebulae model. the mass of planetsformed is more than 2mj. these results are compared to the 161 detected planetsfor each spectral type of the central stars. the results show that 90% of thedetected planets are consistent with the core-accretion model regardless of thespectral type. the remaining 10% are not in the region explained by thecore-accretion model, but are explained by the disk instability model. wederived the metallicity dependence of the formation probability of gas giantsfor the core-accretion model. comparing the result with the observed fractionhaving gas giants, they are found to be consistent. on the other hand, theobservation cannot be explained by the disk instability model, because thecondition for gas giant formation is independent of the metallicity.consequently, most of planets detected so far are thought to have been formedby the core-accretion process, and the rest by the disk instability process.

astro-ph;0703316	simultaneous x-ray, radio, near-infrared, and optical monitoring of  young stellar objects in the coronet cluster	multi-wavelength (x-ray to radio) monitoring of young stellar objects (ysos)can provide important information about physical processes at the stellarsurface, in the stellar corona, and/or in the inner circumstellar disk regions.while coronal processes should mainly cause variations in the x-ray and radiobands, accretion processes may be traced by time-correlated variability in thex-ray and optical/infrared bands. several multi-wavelength studies have beensuccessfully performed for field stars and approx. 1-10 myr old t tauri stars,but so far no such study succeeded in detecting simultaneous x-ray to radiovariability in extremely young objects like class i and class 0 protostars.here we present the first simultaneous x-ray, radio, near-infrared, and opticalmonitoring of ysos, targeting the coronet cluster in the corona australisstar-forming region, which harbors at least one class 0 protostar, severalclass i objects, numerous t tauri stars, and a few herbig aebe stars. [...]seven objects are detected simultaneously in the x-ray, radio, andoptical/infrared bands; they constitute our core sample. while most of thesesources exhibit clear variability in the x-ray regime and several also displayoptical/infrared variability, none of them shows significant radio variabilityon the timescales probed. we also do not find any case of clearlytime-correlated optical/infrared and x-ray variability. [...] the absence oftime-correlated multi-wavelength variability suggests that there is no directlink between the x-ray and optical/infrared emission and supports the notionthat accretion is not an important source for the x-ray emission of these ysos.no significant radio variability was found on timescales of days.

0811.1837	young brown dwarfs in the core of the w3 main star-forming region	we present the results of deep and high-resolution (fwhm ~ 0".35) jhk nirobservations with the subaru telescope, to search for very low mass youngstellar objects (ysos) in the w3 main star-forming region. the nir surveycovers an area of ~ 2.6 arcmin^2 with 10-sigma limiting magnitude exceeding 20mag in the jhk bands. the survey is sensitive enough to provide unprecedenteddetails in w3 irs 5 region and reveals a census of the stellar population downto objects below the hydrogen-burning limit. we construct jhk color-color (cc)and j-h/j and h-k/k color-magnitude (cm) diagrams to identify very lowluminosity ysos and to estimate their masses. based on these cc and cmdiagrams, we identified a rich population of embedded yso candidates withinfrared excesses (class i and class ii), associated with the w3 main region. alarge number of red sources (h-k &gt; 2) have also been detected around w3 main.we argue that these red stars are most probably pre-main-sequence (pms) starswith intrinsic color excesses. based on the comparison between theoreticalevolutionary models of very low-mass pms objects with the observed cm diagram,we find there exists a substantial substellar population in the observedregion. the mass function (mf) does not show the presence of cutoff and sharpturnover around the substellar limit, at least at the hydrogen-burning limit.furthermore, the mf slope indicates that the number ratio of young brown dwarfsand hydrogen-burning stars in the w3 main is probably higher than those intrapezium and ic 348. the presence of mass segregation, in the sense thatrelatively massive ysos lie near the cluster center, is seen. the estimateddynamical evolution time indicates that the observed mass segregation in the w3main may be the imprint of the star formation process.
