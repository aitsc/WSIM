(ii) the mainknots k1, k2 and k3 -of this hypergiant shell s3- show a stellar population andemission line ratios associated with the presence of a starburst + of/shocks.(iii) the internal shells s1 and s2 show structures, of components andproperties very similar to those detected in the nuclear shells of mrk 231.(iv) the shells s1+s2 and s3 are aligned at pa = 131: i.e. suggesting that theof process is in the blow-out phase with bipolar structure. in addition, theshells s4 and s5 (at 80-100 kpc scale) are aligned at pa = 40, i.e.: a bipolarof perpendicular to the internal of. finally, the generation of uhe cosmic raysand neutrino/ dark-matter -associated with hyne in bal + ir + fe ii qsos- isdiscussed.

0904.3066	barred galaxies in the abell 901/2 supercluster with stages	we present a study of bar and host disk evolution in a dense clusterenvironment, based on a sample of ~800 bright (mv &lt;= -18) galaxies in the abell901/2 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w imaging from the stagessurvey, and data from spitzer, xmm-newton, and combo-17. we identify andcharacterize bars through ellipse-fitting, and other morphological featuresthrough visual classification. (1) we explore three commonly used methods forselecting disk galaxies. we find 625, 485, and 353 disk galaxies, respectively,via visual classification, a single component s'ersic cut (n &lt;= 2.5), and ablue-cloud cut. in cluster environments, the latter two methods miss 31% and51%, respectively, of visually-identified disks. (2) for moderately inclineddisks, the three methods of disk selection yield a similar global optical barfraction (f_bar-opt) of 34% +10%/-3%, 31% +10%/-3%, and 30% +10%/-3%,respectively. (3) f_bar-opt rises in brighter galaxies and those which appearto have no significant bulge component. within a given absolute magnitude bin,f_bar-opt is higher in visually-selected disk galaxies that have no bulge asopposed to those with bulges. for a given morphological class, f_bar-opt risesat higher luminosities. (4) for bright early-types, as well as faint late-typesystems with no evident bulge, the optical bar fraction in the abell 901/2clusters is comparable within a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 to that of field galaxiesat lower redshifts (5) between the core and the virial radius of the cluster atintermediate environmental densities, the optical bar fraction does not appearto depend strongly on the local environment density and varies at most by afactor of ~1.3. we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution ofbars and disks in dense environments.

0907.2923	quasar induced galaxy formation: a new paradigm ?	we discuss observational evidence that quasars play a key role in theformation of galaxies starting from the detailed study of the quasarhe0450-2958 and extending the discussion to a series of converging evidencethat radio jets may trigger galaxy formation. the direct detection with visirat the eso-vlt of the 7 kpc distant companion galaxy of he0450-2958 allows usto spatially separate the sites of quasar and star formation activity in thiscomposite system made of two ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). no hostgalaxy has yet been detected for this quasar, but the companion galaxy stellarmass would bring he0450-2958 in the local m(bh)-m(stellar bulge) relation if itwere to merge with the qso. this is bound to happen because of their closedistance (7 kpc) and small relative velocity (~60-200 km/s). we conclude thatwe may be witnessing the building of the m(bh)-m(stellar bulge) relation, or atleast of a major event in that process. the star formation rate (~340 msun/yr),age (40-200 myr) and stellar mass ([5-6]x10^10 msun) are consistent withjet-induced formation of the companion galaxy. we suggest that he0450-2958 maybe fueled in fresh material by cold gas accretion from intergalactic filaments.we map the projected galaxy density surrounding the qso as a potential tracerof intergalactic filaments and discuss a putative detection. comparison toother systems suggests that inside-out formation of quasar host galaxies andjet-induced galaxy formation may be a common process. two tests are proposedfor this new paradigm: (1) the detection of offset molecular gas or dustemission with respect to the position of distant qsos, (2) the delayedformation of host galaxies as a result of qso activity, hence the two stepbuilding of the m(bh)/m(stellar bulge) ratio.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0910.5718	interacting galaxies in the a901/902 supercluster with stages	we present a study of galaxy mergers and the influence of environment in theabell 901/902 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w data from thestages survey, combo-17, spitzer 24um, and xmm-newton x-ray data. our analysisutilizes both a visual classification system, and quantitative cas parametersto identify systems which show evidence of a recent or ongoing merger of massratio &gt;1/10. our results are: (1) after visual classification and minimizingthe contamination from false projection pairs, we find that the merger fractionf_merge is 0.023+/-0.007. the estimated fractions of likely major mergers,likely minor mergers, and ambiguous cases are 0.01+/-0.004, 0.006+/-0.003, and0.007+/-0.003, respectively. (2) the mergers lie outside the cluster core ofradius r &lt; 0.25 mpc: the lack of mergers in the core is likely due to the largegalaxy velocity dispersion in the core. mergers populate the region (0.25 mpc &lt;r &lt;= 2 mpc) between the core and outskirt. in this region, the estimatedfrequency of mergers is similar to those seen at typical group overdensities.this suggests ongoing growth of the clusters via accretion of group and fieldgalaxies. (3) we compare our observed merger fraction with those reported inother clusters and groups out to z~0.4. existing data points on the mergerfraction for l&lt;= l* galaxies in clusters allow for a range of evolutionaryscenarios. (4) the fraction of mergers, which lie on the blue cloud is80%+/-18% versus 34%+/-7% for non-interacting galaxies, implying thatinteracting galaxies are preferentially blue. (5) the average sfr, based on uvor uv+ir data, is enhanced by a factor of ~1.5 to 2 in mergers compared tonon-interacting galaxies. however, mergers in the clusters contribute only asmall fraction (between 10% and 15%) of the total sfr density.(abridged)

0911.0005	observational constraints on the co-evolution of supermassive black  holes and galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) and black hole accretion rate (bhar) functionsare measured to be proportional to each other at z &lt; ~3. this closecorrespondence between sf and bha would naturally yield a bh mass-galaxy masscorrelation, whereas a bh mass-bulge mass correlation is observed. to explorethis apparent contradiction we study the sf in spheroid-dominated galaxiesbetween z=1 and the present day. we use 903 galaxies from the combo-17 surveywith m* &gt;2x10^10m_sun, ultraviolet and infrared-derived sfrs from spitzer andgalex, and morphologies from gems hst/acs imaging. using stacking techniques,we find that &lt;25% of all sf occurs in spheroid-dominated galaxies (sersic indexn&gt;2.5), while the bhar that we would expect if the global scalings held isthree times higher. this rules out the simplest picture of co-evolution, inwhich sf and bha trace each other at all times. these results could beexplained if sf and bha occur in the same events, but offset in time, forexample at different stages of a merger event. however, one would then expectto see the corresponding star formation activity in early-stage mergers, inconflict with observations. we conclude that the major episodes of sf and bhaoccur in different events, with the bulk of sf happening in isolated disks andmost bha occurring in major mergers. the apparent global co-evolution resultsfrom the regulation of the bh growth by the potential well of the galacticspheroid, which includes a major contribution from disrupted disk stars.

0911.0523	properties and environment of radio emitting galaxies in the vla-zcosmos  survey	we investigate the properties and the environment of radio sources withoptical counterpart from the combined vla-cosmos and zcosmos samples. theadvantage of this sample is the availability of optical spectroscopicinformation, high quality redshifts, and accurate density determination.  by comparing the star formation rates estimated from the optical spectralenergy distribution with those based on the radio luminosity, we divide theradio sources in three families, passive agn, non-passive agn and star forminggalaxies. these families occupy specific regions of the 8.0-4.5 $\mu$m infraredcolor--specific star formation plane, from which we extract the correspondingcontrol samples.  only the passive agn have a significantly different environment distributionfrom their control sample. the fraction of radio-loud passive agn increasesfrom ~2% in underdense regions to ~15% for overdensities (1+delta) greater than10. this trend is also present as a function of richness of the groups hostingthe radio sources. passive agn in overdensities tend to have higher radioluminosities than those in lower density environments. since the black holemass distribution is similar in both environments, we speculate that, for lowradio luminosities, the radio emission is controlled (through fueldisponibility or confinement of radio jet by local gas pressure) by theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy, while in other cases it is determinedby the structure (group or cluster) in which the galaxy resides.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

0709.2568	host galaxies of bright high redshift quasars: luminosities and colours	we present the results of a near-infrared imaging study of high redshift(z~3) quasars using the eso-vlt. our targets were selected to have luminositiesamong the highest known (absolute magnitude m_b &lt;~ -28. we searched forresolved structures underlying the bright point-source nuclei by comparing theqso images with stars located in the same fields. two qsos (he2348-1444 atz=2.904 and he2355-5457 at z=2.933) are clearly resolved in k_s, and withsomewhat lower significance also in h; one object is resolved only in k_s. atthese redshifts, h and k_s correspond almost exactlly to rest-frame b and v,respectively, with virtually no k-correction. we also report briefly thenon-detection of some additional qsos. the detected host galaxies are extremelyluminous with m_v ~ -25. their rest-frame b-v colours, however, are close tozero in the vega system, indicating substantial contributions from young starsand a stellar mass-to-light ratio below 1 (in solar units). tentativelyconverting m_v and b-v into rough estimates of stellar masses, we obtain valuesof m_star in the range of several 10^11 m_sun, placing them within thehigh-mass range of recent high-redshift galaxy surveys. we present opticalspectra and use civ line width measurements to predict virial black holemasses, obtaining typical values of m_bh ~ 5x10^9 m_sun. with respect to theknown correlation between host galaxy luminosity l_v(host) and m_bh, ourmeasurements reach to higher luminosities and redshifts than previous studies,but are completely consistent with them. comparing our objects with the local(z~0) m_bh - m_bulge relation and taking also the low stellar mass-to-lightratios into account, we find tentative evidence for an excess in them_bh/m_bulge mass ratio at z~3.

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1109.3309	the low-metallicity qso he 2158-0107: a massive galaxy growing by the  accretion of nearly pristine gas from its environment?	[abridged] the metallicities of agn are usually well above solar in theirnlr, often reaching up to several times solar in their broad-line regions.low-metallicity agn are rare objects which have so far always been associatedwith low-mass galaxies hosting low-mass bhs (m_bh&lt;10^6msun). in this paper wepresent ifs data of the low-redshift qso he 2158-0107 for which we find strongevidence for sub-solar nlr metallicities associated with a massive bh(m_bh~3x10^8msun). the qso is surrounded by a large extended emission-lineregion reaching out to 30kpc from the qso in a tail-like geometry. we presentoptical and near-ir images and investigate the properties of the host galaxy.the sed of the host is rather blue, indicative of a significant young agestellar population formed within the last 1gyr. a 3sigma upper limit ofl_bulge&lt;4.5x10^10lsun for the h band luminosity and a corresponding stellarmass upper limit of m_bulge&lt;3.4x10^10msun show that the host is offset from thelocal bh-bulge relations. this is independently supported by the kinematics ofthe gas. although the stellar mass of the host galaxy is lower than expected,it cannot explain the exceptionally low metallicity of the gas. we suggest thatthe extended emission-line region and the galaxy growth are caused by theinfall of nearly pristine gas from the environment of the qso host. minormergers of dwarf galaxies or the theoretically predicted smooth accretion ofcold gas are both potential drivers behind that process. since the metallicityof the gas in the nlr is much lower than expected, we suspect that the externalgas has already reached the galaxy centre and may even contribute to thecurrent feeding of the bh. he 2158-0107 appears to represent a particular phaseof substantial bh and galaxy growth that can be observationally linked with theaccretion of external material from its environment.

1111.0962	califa, the calar alto legacy integral field area survey: i. survey  presentation	we present here the calar alto legacy integral field area (califa) survey,which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction.we summarizethe survey goals and design, including sample selection and observationalstrategy.we also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs(june/july 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemesand general characteristics of the reduced data. this survey is obtainingspatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of$\sim600$ galaxies in the local universe (0.005&lt; z &lt;0.03). califa has beendesigned to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the followingquantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas:distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematicproperties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. califa uses the ppakintegral field unit (ifu), with a hexagonal field-of-view of$\sim1.3\sq\arcmin'$, with a 100% covering factor by adopting a three-pointingdithering scheme. the optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000{\aa}, using two overlapping setups (v500 and v1200), with differentresolutions: r\sim850 and r\sim1650, respectively. califa is a legacy survey,intended for the community. the reduced data will be released, once the qualityhas been guaranteed. the analyzed data fulfill the expectations of the originalobserving proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratoryanalysis.  we conclude from this first look at the data that califa will be an importantresource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the local universe.

1209.2228	euclid mission: building of a reference survey	euclid is an esa cosmic-vision wide-field-space mission which is designed toexplain the origin of the acceleration of universe expansion. the mission willinvestigate at the same time two primary cosmological probes: weakgravitational lensing (wl) and galaxy clustering (in particular baryon acousticoscillations, bao). the extreme precision requested on primary scienceobjectives can only be achieved by observing a large number of galaxiesdistributed over the whole sky in order to probe the distribution of darkmatter and galaxies at all scales. the extreme accuracy needed requiresobservation from space to limit all observational biases in the measurements.the definition of the euclid survey, aiming at detecting billions of galaxiesover 15 000 square degrees of the extragalactic sky, is a key parameter of themission. it drives its scientific potential, its duration and the mass of thespacecraft. the construction of a reference survey derives from the high levelscience requirements for a wide and a deep survey. the definition of a mainsequence of observations and the associated calibrations were indeed a majorachievement of the definition phase. implementation of this sequencedemonstrated the feasibility of covering the requested area in less than 6years while taking into account the overheads of space segment observing andmaneuvering sequence. this reference mission will be used for sizing thespacecraft consumables needed for primary science. it will also set theframework for optimizing the time on the sky to fulfill the primary science andmaximize the euclid legacy.

1210.8150	califa, the calar alto legacy integral field area survey. ii. first  public data release	we present the first public data release of the califa survey. it consists ofscience-grade optical datacubes for the first 100 of eventually 600 nearby(0.005&lt;z&lt;0.03) galaxies, obtained with the integral-field spectrographpmas/ppak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the calar alto observatory. thegalaxies in dr1 already cover a wide range of properties in color-magnitudespace, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionization conditions. thisoffers the potential to tackle a variety of open questions in galaxy evolutionusing spatially resolved spectroscopy. two different spectral setups areavailable for each galaxy, (i) a low-resolution v500 setup covering the nominalwavelength range 3745-7500a with a spectral resolution of 6.0a (fwhm), and (ii)a medium-resolution v1200 setup covering the nominal wavelength range3650-4840a with a spectral resolution of 2.3a (fwhm). we present thecharacteristics and data structure of the califa datasets that should be takeninto account for scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the effectsof vignetting, bad pixels and spatially correlated noise. the data quality testfor all 100 galaxies showed that we reach a median limiting continuumsensitivity of 1.0x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 5635a and2.2x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 4500a for the v500 and v1200 setuprespectively, which corresponds to limiting r and g band surface brightnessesof 23.6mag/arcsec^2 and 23.4mag/arcsec^2, or an unresolved emission-line fluxdetection limit of roughly 1x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 and0.6x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, respectively. the median spatial resolution is3.7", and the absolute spectrophotometric calibration is better than 15%(1sigma). we also describe the available interfaces and tools that allow easyaccess to this first public califa data.

1304.2158	the mass-metallicity relation explored with califa: i. is there a  dependence on the star formation rate?	we present the results on the study of the global and local m-z relationbased on the first data available from the califa survey (150 galaxies). thissurvey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent ofeach galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separateindividual hii regions and/or aggregations. nearly $\sim$3000 individual hiiregions have been detected. the spectra cover the wavelength range between[oii]3727 and [sii]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise to derive the oxygenabundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. in addition, wehave computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surfacedensities), based on sdss photometric data. we explore the relations betweenthe stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.  we derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and thegas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one already reported inthe literature ($\sigma_{\delta{\rm log(o/h)}}=$0.07 dex). indeed, thisdispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for ouroxygen abundances. however, we do not find any secondary relation with thestar-formation rate, other than the one induced due to the primary relation ofthis quantity with the stellar mass. we confirm the result using the $\sim$3000individual hii regions, for the corresponding local relations.  our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, bothlocally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, like thatof gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. in essence,late-type/disk dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, witha behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneousrecycling/closed-box model.

1308.4271	the nature of liner galaxies: ubiquitous hot old stars and rare  accreting black holes	galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-calledlow-ionisation nuclear emission line region (liner). for 30 years this wasattributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (agn) of lowluminosity, making liner galaxies the largest agn-sub-population, dominating innumbers over higher luminosity seyfert galaxies and quasars. this, however,poses a serious problem. while the inferred energy balance is plausible, manyliners clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an agn. usingintegral field spectroscopic data from the califa survey, we aim at comparingthe observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected fromillumination by an agn. essential for this analysis is a proper extraction ofemission-lines, especially weak lines such as the balmer hb line which issuperposed on an absorption trough. to accomplish this, we use the gandalf codewhich simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.we show for 48 galaxies with liner-like emission, that the radial emission-linesurface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a centralpoint-source and hence cannot be due to an agn alone. the most probableexplanation for the excess liner-like emission is ionisation by evolved starsduring the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-agb. this leadsus to an entirely new interpretation. post-agb stars are ubiquitous and theirionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gaspresent and stars older than ~1 gyr, unless a stronger radiation field fromyoung hot stars or an agn outshines them. this means that galaxies withliner-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but ratherby the absence of a property. it also explains why liner emission is observedmostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.

1310.1399	the xmm-newton spectrum of a candidate recoiling supermassive black  hole: an elusive inverted p-cygni profile	we present a detailed spectral analysis of new xmm-newton data of the sourcecxoc j100043.1+020637, also known as cid-42, detected in the cosmos survey at z= 0.359. previous works suggested that cid-42 is a candidate recoilingsupermassive black holes showing also an inverted p-cygni profile in the x- rayspectra at ~6 kev (rest) with an iron emission line plus a redshiftedabsorption line (detected at 3sigma in previous xmm-newton and chandraobservations). detailed analysis of the absorption line suggested the presenceof ionized material inflowing into the black hole at high velocity. in the newlong xmm-newton observation, while the overall spectral shape remains constant,the continuum 2-10 kev flux decreased of ~20% with respect to previousobservation and the absorption line is undetected. the upper limit on theintensity of the absorption line is ew&lt;162 kev. extensive monte carlosimulations show that the non detection of the line is solely due to variationin the properties of the inflowing material, in agreement with the transientnature of these features, and that the intensity of the line is lower than thepreviously measured with a probability of 98.8%. in the scenario of cid-42 asrecoiling smbh, the absorption line can be interpreted as due to inflow of gaswith variable density and located in the proximity of the smbh and recoilingwith it. new monitoring observations will be requested to further characterizethis line.

1311.7052	a characteristic oxygen abundance gradient in galaxy disks unveiled with  califa	we present the largest and most homogeneous catalog of hii regions andassociations compiled so far. the catalog comprises more than 7000 ionizedregions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the califa survey. we describethe procedures used to detect, select, and analyse the spectroscopic propertiesof these ionized regions. in the current study we focus on the characterizationof the radial gradient of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, based on thestudy of the deprojected distribution of hii regions. we found that allgalaxies without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient inthe oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of alpha = -0.1 dex/rebetween 0.3 and 2 disk effective radii, and a scatter compatible with randomfluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the diskeffective radius. the slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,absolute magnitude or mass. only those galaxies with evidence of interactionsand/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,consistent with previous results. the majority of the 94 galaxies with h iiregions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in theoxygen abundance. the flattening is statistically significant. we cannotprovide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.however, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to thesecular evolution of galaxies. finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygenabundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. all of them arenon-interacting, mostly unbarred, sb/sbc galaxies. this feature is associatedwith a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both features areproduced by radial gas flows induced by resonance processes.

0802.3901	frequency and impact of galaxy mergers and interactions over the last 7  gyr	we explore the history and impact of galaxy mergers and interactions overz~0.24 to 0.80, based on hst acs, combo-17, and spitzer 24 mu data of ~4500galaxies in the gems survey. using visual and quantitative parameters,weidentify galaxies with strong distortions indicative of recent stronginteractions and mergers versus normal galaxies (e/s0, sa, sb-sc, sd/irr). ourresults are: (1) the observed fraction f of strongly disturbed systems amonghigh mass (m&gt;=2.5e10 msun) galaxies is ~9% to 12% in every gyr bin over z~0.24to 0.80. the corresponding merger rate is a few times 10^-4 galaxies gyr-1mpc-3. the fraction f shows fair agreement with the merger fraction of massratio &gt;=1:10 predicted by several lcdm-based simulations. (2) for m&gt;=1e9 msunsystems, the average star formation rate (sfr) of strongly disturbed systems isonly modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies, in agreement withrecent simulations. in fact, over z~0.24 to 0.80, strongly disturbed systemsonly account for a small fraction (&lt;~30%) of the total sfr density. thissuggests that the behaviour of the cosmic sfr density over the last sevenbillion years is predominantly shaped by normal galaxies.

0803.0997	a new method to separate star forming from agn galaxies at intermediate  redshift: the submillijansky radio population in the vla-cosmos survey	we explore the properties of the submillijansky radio population at 20 cm byapplying a newly developed optical color-based method to separate star forming(sf) from agn galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1.3). although opticalrest-frame colors are used, our separation method is shown to be efficient, andnot biased against dusty starburst galaxies. this classification method hasbeen calibrated and tested on a local radio selected optical sample. givenaccurate multi-band photometry and redshifts, it carries the potential to begenerally applicable to any galaxy sample where sf and agn galaxies are the twodominant populations.  in order to quantify the properties of the submillijansky radio population,we have analyzed ~2,400 radio sources, detected at 20 cm in the vla-cosmossurvey. 90% of these have submillijansky flux densities. we classify theobjects into 1) star candidates, 2) quasi stellar objects, 3) agn, 4) sf, and5) high redshift (z&gt;1.3) galaxies. we find, for the composition of thesubmillijansky radio population, that sf galaxies are not the dominantpopulation at submillijansky flux levels, as previously often assumed, but thatthey make up an approximately constant fraction of 30-40% in the flux densityrange of ~50 microjy to 0.7 mjy. in summary, based on the entire vla-cosmosradio population at 20 cm, we find that the radio population at these fluxdensities is a mixture of roughly 30-40% of sf and 50-60% of agn galaxies, witha minor contribution (~10%) of qsos.

1406.2327	late-stage galaxy mergers in cosmos to z~1	the role of major mergers in galaxy and black hole formation is not wellconstrained. to help address this, we develop an automated method to identifylate-stage galaxy mergers before coalescence of the galactic cores. theresulting sample of mergers is distinct from those obtained using pair-findingand morphological indicators. our method relies on median-filtering ofhigh-resolution images in order to distinguish two concentrated galaxy nucleiat small separations. using mock images, we derive statistical contaminationand incompleteness corrections for the fraction of late-stage mergers. we applyour new method to a magnitude-limited (i &lt; 23) sample of 44,164 galaxies fromthe cosmos hst/acs catalog. using a mass-complete sample with $\log m_*/m_\odot&gt; 10.6$ and $0.25 &lt; z \leq 1.00$, we find ~5% of systems are late-stage mergerswith separations between 2.2 and 8 kpc. correcting for incompleteness andcontamination, the fractional merger rate increases strongly with redshift as$(1+z)^{3.8\pm0.9}$, in agreement with earlier studies and with dark matterhalo merger rates. separating the sample into star-forming and quiescentgalaxies shows that the merger rate for star-forming galaxies increasesstrongly redshift, $(1+z)^{4.5\pm1.3}$, while the merger rate for quiescentgalaxies is consistent with no evolution, $(1+z)^{1.1\pm1.2}$. limiting oursample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from zcosmos, we find that thestar formation rates and x-ray selected agn activity in likely late-stagemergers are enhanced by factors of ~2 relative to a control sample. combiningour sample with more widely separated pairs, we find that $8\pm5\%$ of starformation and $20\pm8\%$ of agn activity is triggered by close encounters (&lt;143kpc) or mergers, once more suggesting that major mergers are not the onlychannels for star formation and black hole growth.

1406.4131	integral field spectroscopy of nearby qsos: i. enlr size-luminosity  relation, ongoing star formation &amp; resolved gas-phase metallicities	[abridged] we present optical integral field spectroscopy for a flux-limitedsample of 19 qsos at z&lt;0.2 and spatially resolve their ionized gas propertiesat a physical resolution of 2-5kpc. the extended narrow line regions (enlrs),photoionized by the radiation of agn, have sizes of up to several kpc andcorrelate more strongly with the qso continuum luminosity than with theintegrated [oiii] luminosity. we find a relation of the formlog(r)~(0.46+-0.04)log(l_5100), reinforcing the picture of an approximatelyconstant ionization parameter for the ionized clouds across the enlr. besidesthe enlr, we also find gas ionized by young massive stars in more than 50 percent of the galaxies on kpc scales. in more than half of the sample, thespecific star formation rates based on the extinction-corrected ha luminosityare consistent with those of inactive disc-dominated galaxies, even for somebulge-dominated qso hosts. enhanced sfrs of up to 70msun/yr are rare and alwaysassociated with signatures of major mergers. comparison with the sfr based onthe 60+100micron fir luminosity suggests that the fir luminosity issystematically contaminated by agn emission and ha appears to be a more robustand sensitive tracer for the star formation rate. evidence for efficient agnfeedback is scarce in our sample, but some of our qso hosts lack signatures ofongoing star formation leading to a reduced specific sfr with respect to themain sequence of galaxies. based on 12 qsos where we can make measurements, wefind that on average bulge-dominated qso host galaxies tend to fall below themass-metallicity relation compared to their disc-dominated counterparts. whilenot yet statistically significant for our small sample, this may provide auseful diagnostic for future large surveys if this metal dilution can be shownto be linked to recent or ongoing galaxy interactions.

1407.2939	califa: a diameter-selected sample for an integral field spectroscopy  galaxy survey	we describe and discuss the selection procedure and statistical properties ofthe galaxy sample used by the calar alto legacy integral field area survey(califa), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies using integral fieldspectroscopy. the califa "mother sample" was selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) dr7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with anr-band isophotal major axis between 45" and 79.2" and with a redshift 0.005 &lt; z&lt; 0.03. the mother sample contains 939 objects, 600 of which will be observedin the course of the califa survey. the selection of targets for observationsis based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of themother sample. by comparison with a large set of sdss galaxies, we find thatthe califa sample is representative of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19&gt; mr &gt; -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between 10^9.7 and 10^11.4msun. inparticular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead to anysignificant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or smallgalaxies. only below luminosities of mr = -19 (or stellar masses &lt; 10^9.7msun)is there a prevalence of galaxies with larger isophotal sizes, especially ofnearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form &lt; 10% of the fullsample. we estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities andsizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimatesfrom the full sdss when accounting for large-scale structure. we also present anumber of value-added quantities determined for the galaxies in the califasample. we explore different ways of characterizing the environments of califagalaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from thefield to genuine clusters. we finally consider the expected incidence of activegalactic nuclei among califa galaxies.

astro-ph;0208514	on-axis spatially resolved spectroscopy of low redshift quasar host  galaxies: he 1503+0228 at z=0.135	we present the first result of a comprehensive spectroscopic study of quasarhost galaxies. on-axis, spatially resolved spectra of low redshift quasars havebeen obtained with fors1, mounted on the 8.2m eso very large telescope, antu.the spectra are spatially deconvolved using a spectroscopic version of the``mcs deconvolution algorithm''. the algorithm decomposes two dimensionalspectra into the individual spectra of the central point-like nucleus and ofits host galaxy. applied to he1503+0228, at z=0.135 (m_b=-23.0), it provides uswith the spectrum of the host galaxy between 3600a, and 8500a, (rest-frame), ata mean resolving power of 700. the data allow us to measure several of theimportant lick indices. the stellar populations and gas ionization state of thehost galaxy of he1503+0228, are very similar to the ones measured for normalnon-agn galaxies. dynamical information is also available for the gas andstellar components of the galaxy. using deconvolution and a deprojectionalgorithm, velocity curves are derived for emission lines, from the center upto 4arcsec, away from the nucleus of the galaxy. fitting a simplethree-components mass model (point mass, spherical halo of dark matter, disk)to the position-velocity diagram, we infer a mass of m(r&lt;1kpc) = (2.0 +- 0.3)10^{10} solar mass within the central kiloparsec of the galaxy, and a massintegrated over 10 kpc of m(r&lt;10kpc) = (1.9 +- 0.3) 10^{11} solar mass, with anadditional 10% error due to the uncertainty on the inclination of the galaxy.this, in combination with the analysis of the stellar populations indicatesthat the host galaxy of he1503+0228, is a normal spiral galaxy.

astro-ph;0311123	quasar host galaxy star formation activity from multicolour data	we investigate multicolour imaging data of a complete sample of 19 lowredshift (z&lt;0.2) quasar host galaxies. the sample was imaged in four optical(bvri) and three near-infrared bands (jhk_s). galaxy types, structuralparameters and robust host galaxy luminosities are extracted for all bands bymeans of two-dimensional deblending of galaxy and nucleus. for the discdominated fraction of host galaxies (sa and later) the optical andoptical-to-nir colours agree well with the average colours of inactive galaxiesof same type. the bulge dominated galaxies (e/s0) on the other hand appear asignificant 0.35 mag bluer in (v-k) than their inactive counterparts, being asblue as the discs in the sample. this trend is confirmed by fitting populationsynthesis models to the extracted broad band seds: the stellar population ageof the bulge dominated hosts lies around a few gyr, much younger than expectedfor old evolved ellipticals. comparison to other studies suggests a strongtrend for stellar age in elliptical host galaxies with luminosity.intermediately luminous elliptical hosts have comparably young populations,either intrinsically or from an enhanced star formation rate potentially due tointeraction, the most luminous and massive ellipticals on the contrary show oldpopulations. the correspondence between the nuclear activity and the bluecolours suggests a connection between galaxy interaction, induced starformation and the triggering of nuclear activity. however, the existence ofvery symmetric and undisturbed disks and elliptical host galaxies emphasisedthat other mechanisms like minor merging or gas accretion must exist.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

0809.2098	photometric redshift and classification for the xmm-cosmos sources	we present photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution (sed)classifications for a sample of 1542 optically identified sources detected withxmm in the cosmos field. our template fitting classifies 46 sources as starsand 464 as non-active galaxies, while the remaining 1032 require templates withan agn contribution. high accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts wasaccomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with highsignificance detections, 2) a new set of sed templates including 18 hybridscovering the far-uv to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by thecombination of agn and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epochobservations that have been used to correct for variability (most important fortype 1 agn). the reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated usingthe sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. weachieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5). the high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (wherethe sed is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 agn and qsos out to$z=4.5$. the number of outliers is a large improvement over previousphotometric redshift estimates for x-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%outliers for i$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 and i$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5, respectively). we show thatthe intermediate band photometry is vital to achieving accurate photometricredshifts for agn, whereas the broad sed coverage provided by mid infrared(spitzer/irac) bands is important to reduce the number of outliers for normalgalaxies.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
