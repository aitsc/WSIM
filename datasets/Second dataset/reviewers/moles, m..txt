0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0907.0479	the bright galaxy population of five medium redshift clusters. ii.  quantitative galaxy morphology	aims: following the study already presented in our previous paper, based onthe nordic optical telescope (not) sample, which consists of five clusters ofgalaxies within the redshift range 0.18 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.25, imaged in thecentral 0.5-2 mpc in very good seeing conditions, we have studied thequantitative morphology of their bright galaxy population  methods: we have analyzed the surface brightness profiles of the galaxypopulation in those clusters. previously, we have performed simulations inorder to check the reliability of the fits. we have also derived a quantitativemorphological classification.  results: the structural parameters derived from these analysis have beenanalyzed. we have obtained that the structural parameters of e/s0 galaxies aresimilar to those showed by galaxies in low redshift clusters. however, the discscales are different. in particular, the scales of the discs of galaxies atmedium redshift clusters are statistically different than those located insimilar galaxies in the coma cluster. but, the scales of the discs of galaxiesin medium redshift clusters are similar to nearby field galaxies.  conclusions: the results suggest that the evolution of the disc component ofgalaxies in clusters is faster than in field ones. mechanisms like galaxyharassment showing timescales of $\sim 1$gyr could be the responsible of thisdisc scale evolution. this indicates that spiral galaxies in clusters havesuffered a strong evolution in the last 2.5 gyr or that coma is in some wayanomalous.

0907.2392	superdense massive galaxies in wings local clusters	massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1 have been found to have small physicalsizes, hence to be superdense. several mechanisms, including minor mergers,have been proposed for increasing galaxy sizes from high- to low-z. we searchfor superdense massive galaxies in the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey(wings) of x-ray selected galaxy clusters at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07. we discover asignificant population of superdense massive galaxies with masses and sizescomparable to those observed at high redshift. they approximately represent 22%of all cluster galaxies more massive than 3x10^10msol, are mostly s0 galaxies,have a median effective radius &lt;re&gt; =1.61+/-0.29kpc, a median sersic index &lt;n&gt;= 3.0+/-0.6, and very old stellar populations with a median mass-weighted ageof 12.1+/-1.3gyr. we calculate a number density of 2.9x10^-2mpc^-3 forsuperdense galaxies in local clusters, and a hard lower limit of1.3x10^-5mpc^-3 in the whole comoving volume between z = 0.04 and z = 0.07. wefind a relation between mass, effective radius and luminosity-weighted age inour cluster galaxies, which can mimic the claimed evolution of the radius withredshift, if not properly taken into account. we compare our data withspectroscopic high-z surveys and find that -when stellar masses are considered-there is consistency with the local wings galaxy sizes out to z~2, while adiscrepancy of a factor of 3 exists with the only spectroscopic z&gt;2 study. incontrast, there is strong evidence for a large evolution in radius for the mostmassive galaxies with m*&gt;4x10^11msol compared to similarly massive galaxies inwings, i.e. the bcgs.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1001.2701	the shapes of bcgs and normal ellipticals in nearby clusters	we compare the apparent axial ratio distributions of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) and normal ellipticals (es) in our sample of 75 galaxy clustersfrom the wings survey. most bcgs in our clusters (69%) are classified as cdgalaxies. the sample of cds has been completed by 14 additional cds (non-bcgs)we found in our clusters. we find that: (i) es have triaxial shape, thetriaxiality sharing almost evenly the intrinsic axial ratios parameter space,with a weak preference for prolateness; (ii) the bcgs have triaxial shape aswell. however, their tendence towards prolateness is much stronger than in thecase of es. such a strong prolateness appears entirely due to the sizeable(dominant) component of cds inside the wings sample of bcgs. in fact, while the'normal'(non-cd) bcgs do not differ from es, as far as the shape distributionis concerned, the axial ratio distribution of bcg_cd galaxies is found tosupport quite prolate shapes; (iii) our result turns out to be strongly atvariance with the only similar, previous analysis by ryden et al.(1993)(rlp93),where bcgs and es were found to share the same axial ratio distribution; (iv)our data suggest that the above discrepancy is mainly caused by the differentcriteria that rlp93 and ourselves use to select the cluster samples, coupledwith a preference of cds to reside in powerful x-ray emitting clusters; (v) thegif2 n-body results suggest that the prolateness of the bcgs (in particular thecds) could reflect the shape of the associated dark matter halos.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

0710.5520	the virialized mass of dark matter haloes	(abridged) virial mass is used as an estimator for the mass of a dark matterhalo. however, the commonly used constant overdensity criterion does notreflect the dynamical structure of haloes. here we analyze dark mattercosmological simulations in order to obtain properties of haloes of differentmasses focusing on the size of the region with zero mean radial velocity. darkmatter inside this region is stationary, and thus the mass of this region is amuch better approximation for the virial mass. we call this mass the staticmass to distinguish from the commonly used constant overdensity mass. we alsostudy the relation of this static mass with the traditional virial mass, and wefind that the matter inside galaxy-size haloes is underestimated by the virialmass by nearly a factor of two. at redshift zero the virial mass is close tothe static mass for cluster-size haloes. the same pattern - large haloes havingm_vir &gt; m_static - exists at all redshifts, but the transition mass m_0 = m_vir= m_static decreases dramatically with increasing redshift. when rescaled tothe same m_0 haloes clearly demonstrate a self-similar behaviour, which in astatistical sense gives a relation between the static and virial mass. to oursurprise we find that the abundance of haloes with a given static mass, i.e.the static mass function, is very accurately fitted by the press &amp; schechterapproximation at z=0, but this approximation breaks at higher redshifts.instead, the virial mass function is well fitted as usual by the sheth &amp; tormenapproximation. we find an explanation why the static radius can be 2-3 timeslarger as compared with the constant overdensity estimate. applying thenon-stationary jeans equation we find that the role of the pressure gradientsis significantly larger for small haloes.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.2360	the hybrid solution for the fundamental plane	by exploiting the database of early-type galaxies (etgs) members of the wingssurvey of nearby clusters, we address here the long debated question of theorigin and shape of the fundamental plane (fp). our data suggest that differentphysical mechanisms concur in shaping and tilting the fp with respect to thevirial plane (vp) expectation. in particular, an hybrid solution in which thestructure of galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors tothe fp tilt seems to be favoured. we find that the bulk of the tilt should beattributed to structural non-homology, while stellar population effects play animportant but less crucial role. our data indicate that the differential fptilt between the v and k-band is due to a sort of entanglement betweenstructural and stellar population effects, for which the inward steepening ofcolor profiles (v-k) tends to increase at increasing the stellar mass of etgs.the same analysis applied to the atlas3d and sdss data in common with wings(wsdss throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkabledifference being the less important role of the stellar mass-to-light-ratio indetermining the fp tilt. the atlas3d data also suggest that the tilt depends aswell on the dark matter (dm) fraction and on the rotational contribution to thekinetic energy (vrot/sigma). we show that the global properties of the fp canbe understood in terms of the underlying correlation among mass, structure andstellar population of etgs, for which, at increasing the stellar mass, etgsbecome (on average) older and more centrally concentrated. finally, we showthat a malmquist-like selection effect may mimic a differential evolution ofthe mass-to-light ratio for galaxies of different masses. this should be takeninto account in the studies investigating the amount of the so calleddownsizing phenomenon.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1402.4131	wings-spe iii: equivalent width measurements, spectral properties and  evolution of local cluster galaxies	[abridged] we investigate the frequency of the various spectral types as afunction both of the clusters' properties and of the galaxies' characteristics.in this way, using the same classification criteria adopted for higher redshiftstudies, we can consistently compare the properties of the local clusterpopulation to those of their more distant counterparts. we describe a method wehave developed to automatically measure the equivalent width of spectral linesin a robust way even in spectra with a non optimal signal to noise. like this,we can derive a spectral classification reflecting the stellar content, basedon the presence and strength of the [oii] and hdelta lines. we are able tomeasure 4381 of the ~6000 originally observed spectra, in the fields of 48clusters, 2744 of which are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. thespectral classification is then analyzed as a function of galaxies' luminosity,stellar mass, morphology, local density and host cluster's global properties,and compared to higher redshift samples (morphs and ediscs). the vast majorityof galaxies in the local clusters population are passive objects, being alsothe most luminous and massive. at a magnitude limit of mv&lt;-18, galaxies in apost-starburst phase represent only ~11% of the cluster population and thisfraction is reduced to ~5% at mv&lt;-19.5, which compares to the 18% at the samemagnitude limit for high-z clusters. "normal" star forming galaxies [e( c )]are proportionally more common in local clusters. the relative occurrence ofpost--starbursts suggests a very similar quenching efficiency in clusters atredshifts in the 0 to ~1 range. furthermore, more important than the globalenvironment, the local density seems to be the main driver of galaxy evolutionin local clusters, at least with respect to their stellar populations content.

1505.07115	extracting h$\alpha$ flux from photometric data in the j-plus survey	we present the main steps that will be taken to extract h$\alpha$ emissionflux from javalambre photometric local universe survey (j-plus) photometricdata. for galaxies with $z\lesssim0.015$, the h$\alpha$+[nii] emission iscovered by the j-plus narrow-band filter $f660$. we explore three differentmethods to extract the h$\alpha$ + [nii] flux from j-plus photometric data: acombination of a broad-band and a narrow-band filter ($r'$ and $f660$), twobroad-band and a narrow-band one ($r'$, $i'$ and $f660$), and a sed-fittingbased method using 8 photometric points. to test these methodologies, wesimulated j-plus data from a sample of 7511 sdss spectra with measuredh$\alpha$ flux. based on the same sample, we derive two empirical relations tocorrect the derived h$\alpha$+[nii] flux from dust extinction and [nii]contamination. we find that the only unbiased method is the sed fitting basedone. the combination of two filters underestimates the measurements of theh$\alpha$ + [nii] flux by a 28%, while the three filters method by a 9%. westudy the error budget of the sed-fitting based method and find that, inaddition to the photometric error, our measurements have a systematicuncertainty of a 4.3%. several sources contribute to this uncertainty:differences between our measurement procedure and the one used to derive thespectroscopic values, the use of simple stellar populations as templates, andthe intrinsic errors of the spectra, which were not taken into account. apartfrom that, the empirical corrections for dust extinction and [nii]contamination add an extra uncertainty of 14%. given the j-plus photometricsystem, the best methodology to extract h$\alpha$ + [nii] flux is thesed-fitting based one. using this method, we are able to recover reliableh$\alpha$ fluxes for thousands of nearby galaxies in a robust and homogeneousway.

1505.07555	stellar populations of galaxies in the alhambra survey up to $z \sim 1$.  i. muffit: a multi-filter fitting code for stellar population diagnostics	we present muffit, a new generic code optimized to retrieve the main stellarpopulation parameters of galaxies in photometric multi-filter surveys, and wecheck its reliability and feasibility with real galaxy data from the alhambrasurvey. making use of an error-weighted $\chi^2$-test, we compare themulti-filter fluxes of galaxies with the synthetic photometry of mixtures oftwo single stellar populations at different redshifts and extinctions, toprovide through a monte carlo method the most likely range of stellarpopulation parameters (mainly ages and metallicities), extinctions, redshifts,and stellar masses. to improve the diagnostic reliability, muffit identifiesand removes from the analysis those bands that are significantly affected byemission lines. we highlight that the retrieved age-metallicity locus for asample of $z \le 0.22$ early-type galaxies in alhambra at different stellarmass bins are in very good agreement with the ones from sdss spectroscopicdiagnostics. moreover, a one-to-one comparison between the redshifts, ages,metallicities, and stellar masses derived spectroscopically for sdss and bymuffit for alhambra reveals good qualitative agreements in all the parameters.in addition, and using as input the results from photometric-redshift codes,muffit improves the photometric-redshift accuracy by $\sim 10$-$20\%$, and italso detects nebular emissions in galaxies, providing physical informationabout their strengths. our results show the potential of multi-filter galaxydata to conduct reliable stellar population studies with the appropiateanalysis techniques, as muffit.

1506.01201	galaxy luminosity functions in wings clusters	using v band photometry of the wings survey, we derive galaxy luminosityfunctions (lf) in nearby clusters. this sample is complete down to mv=-15.15,and it is homogeneous, thus allowing the study of an unbiased sample ofclusters with different characteristics. we constructed the photometric lf for72 out of the original 76 wings clusters, excluding only those without avelocity dispersion estimate. for each cluster we obtained the lf for galaxiesin a region of radius=0.5 x r200, and fitted them with single and doubleschechter's functions. we also derive the composite lf for the entire sample,and those pertaining to different morphological classes. finally we derive thespectroscopic cumulative lf for 2009 galaxies that are cluster members. thedouble schechter fit parameters are neither correlated with the clustervelocity dispersion, nor with the x-ray luminosity. our median values of theschechter's fit slope are, on average, in agreement with measurements of nearbyclusters, but are less steep that those derived from large surveys, such as thesdss. early--type galaxies outnumber late-types at all magnitudes, but bothearly and late types contribute equally to the faint end of the lf. finally,the spectroscopic lf is in excellent agreement with the ones derived for a2199,a85 and virgo, and with the photometric one at the bright magnitudes (whereboth are available). there is a large spread in the lf of different clusters.however, this spread is not caused by correlation of the lf shape with clustercharacteristics such as x--ray luminosity or velocity dispersions. the faintend is flatter than what previously derived (alpha_f=-1.7) at odds with whatpredicted from numerical simulations.

1507.05846	the impact from survey depth and resolution on the morphological  classification of galaxies	we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth andspatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifyinggalaxies through non-parametric methods: abraham and conselice-bershadyconcentration indices, gini, m20 moment of light, asymmetry, and smoothness.three different non-local datasets are used, alhambra and sxds (examples ofdeep ground-based surveys), and cosmos (deep space-based survey). we used asample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring theirmorphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). then we simulatedthem to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in thenon-local surveys. the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints onthe use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate theeffectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. allanalysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,the impact of the former being much stronger. when including asymmetry andsmoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken intoaccount carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. m20 is significantlyaffected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at allbrightness levels.we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parametersshould be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,independently of their brightness; for cosmos they should be avoided forgalaxies fainter than f814 = 23.0. these results can be applied directly tosurveys similar to alhambra, sxds and cosmos, and also can serve as anupper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

0805.4232	the bright galaxy population of five medium redshift clusters. i.  color-magnitude relation, blue fractions and visual morphology	using data of five clusters of galaxies within the redshift range 0.15 $\leq$z $\leq$ 0.25, imaged with the nordic optical telescope (not) in the central$\approx$ 1 mpc$^2$ in very good seeing conditions, we have performed anexhaustive inspection of their bright galaxy population. that range ofredshift, where only a small amount of data with the required resolution andquality is available, is particularly important for the understanding of theformation and evolution of clusters of galaxies. we have inspected thecolor-magnitude relation (cmr) for those clusters and measured the bluefraction of galaxies in their cores to check for evidence of evolution as foundin other works. moreover, the visual classification of the galaxy morphologyhas been performed and the morphology-radius relation has been examined we havenot found signs of evolution neither in the slope of the cmr nor in the bluefraction of galaxies. a diversity of situations regarding those parameters andin the morphological mixing has been noticed, with two out of five clusterscontaining a dominant late-type core population. the cluster a1878 stands outas some of its properties differ from those of the other clusters in thesample.  no clear signs of evolution appear in our analysis. the data support the viewthat the morphology and the stellar content of the galaxies in our clustershave been already settled at z $\sim$ 0.2. only the fraction of interactinggalaxies in the clusters appear to be larger than in clusters like comaalthough the number of clusters in the sample is small to give a definitiveconclusion.

0806.3021	the alhambra project: a large area multi medium-band optical and nir  photometric survey	(abridged) we describe the first results of the alhambra survey whichprovides cosmic tomography of the evolution of the contents of the universeover most of cosmic history. our approach employs 20 contiguous, equal-width,medium-band filters covering from 3500 to 9700 a, plus the jhks bands, toobserve an area of 4 sqdeg on the sky. the optical photometric system has beendesigned to maximize the number of objects with accurate classification by sedand redshift, and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission lines. theobservations are being carried out with the calar alto 3.5m telescope using thecameras laica and o-2000. the first data confirm that we are reaching theexpected magnitude limits of ab&lt;~25 mag in the optical filters from the blue to8300 a, and from ab=24.7 to 23.4 for the redder ones. the limit in the nir is(vega) k_s~20, h~21, j~22. we expect to obtain accurate redshift values, deltaz/(1+z) &lt;~ 0.03 for about 5x10^5 galaxies with i&lt;~25 (60% complete), andz_med=0.74. this accuracy, together with the homogeneity of the selectionfunction, will allow for the study of the redshift evolution of the large scalestructure, the galaxy population and its evolution with redshift, theidentification of clusters of galaxies, and many other studies, without theneed for any further follow-up. it will also provide targets for detailedstudies with 10m-class telescopes. given its area, spectral coverage and itsdepth, apart from those main goals, the alhambra-survey will also producevaluable data for galactic studies.

0807.0535	measuring baryon acoustic oscillations along the line of sight with  photometric redshifs: the pau survey	baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) provide a standard ruler of known physicallength, making it a promising probe of the nature of dark energy. the detectionof bao requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. "transversal"(angular distance) bao measure the angular size of this scale, while"line-of-sight" (or "radial") bao require precise redshifts, but provide adirect measurement of the hubble parameter at different redshifts, a moresensitive probe of dark energy. the main goal of this paper is to show that aprecision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure bao in the radialdirection. this precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using afilter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 a, from ~4000 a to ~ 8000 a, supplemented by two broad-band filters. we describe apractical implementation, a new galaxy survey, pau, to be carried out with atelescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years. we expect to measure positions andredshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with l &gt; l* and i_ab &lt;22.5 in the interval 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, with sigma_z &lt; 0.003(1 + z). thispopulation has a number density n &gt; 10^-3 mpc^-3 h^3 within the 9 (gpc/h)^3volume of the survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the baoscale is not limited by shot-noise. by itself, such a survey will deliverprecisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, ifassumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined withfuture cmb measurements. in addition, pau will yield high-quality redshift andlow-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies.

astro-ph;0005171	the evolution of the galactic morphological types in clusters	the morphological types of galaxies in nine clusters in the redshift range0.1&lt;z&lt;0.25 are derived from very good seeing images taken at the not and the lasilla danish telescopes. with the purpose of investigating the evolution of thefraction of different morphological types with redshift, we compare our resultswith the morphological content of nine distant clusters studied by the morphsgroup, five clusters observed with hst-wfpc2 at redshift z = 0.2-0.3, anddressler's (1980) large sample of nearby clusters. after having checked thereliability of our morphological classification both in an absolute sense andrelative to the morphs scheme, we analyze the relative occurrence ofelliptical, s0 and spiral galaxies as a function of the cluster properties andredshift. we find a large intrinsic scatter in the s0/e ratio, mostly relatedto the cluster morphology. in particular, in our cluster sample, clusters witha high concentration of ellipticals display a low s0/e ratio and, vice-versa,low concentration clusters have a high s0/e. at the same time, the trend of themorphological fractions and ratios with redshift clearly points to amorphological evolution: as the redshift decreases, the s0 population tends togrow at the expense of the spiral population, whereas the frequency of esremains almost constant. we also analyze the morphology-density (md) relationin our clusters and find that -similarly to higher redshift clusters- a good mdrelation exists in the high-concentration clusters, while it is absent in theless concentrated clusters. finally, the comparison of the md relation in ourclusters with that of the d97 sample suggests that the transformation ofspirals into s0 galaxies becomes more efficient with decreasing local density.

astro-ph;0006247	near-infrared photometry of isolated spirals with and without an agn.  ii: photometric properties of the host galaxies	we present the analysis of morphological and photometric properties of asample of isolated spirals with (18) and without (11) an active nucleus, basedon near-infrared imaging in the j and k' bands. the aim of this analysis is tofind the differential properties that could be directly connected with thephenomenon of nuclear activity. we stress the importance of using isolatedobjects for that purpose. our study shows that both sets of galaxies aresimilar in their global properties: they define the same kormendy relation,their disk components share the same properties, the bulge and disk scalelengths are correlated in a similar way, bar strengths and lengths are similarfor primary bars. hosts of isolated seyfert galaxies have bulge and diskproperties comparable to those of isolated non active spirals. central colors(the innermost 200 pc) of active galaxies are redder than the centers of nonactive spirals, most probably due to agn light being re-emitted by the hot dustand/or due to circumnuclear star formation, through the contribution ofgiants/supergiants. only one of the seyfert galaxies in our sample does notpresent a primary bar,but both primary and secondary bars are equally presentin active and control objects. secondary central elongations (associated withsecondary bars, lenses, rings or disks) may be somewhat different. numericalmodels indicate that such secondary bars are not strictly necessary to feed thecentral engine when a primary bar is present. our results show that down toscales of 100-300 pc, there are no obvious differences between active and nonactive spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0207020	rotation curves and metallicity gradients from hii regions in spiral  galaxies	in this paper we study long slit spectra in the region of h$\alpha$ emissionline of a sample of 111 spiral galaxies with recognizable and well definedspiral morphology and with a well determined environmental status, ranging fromisolation to non-disruptive interaction with satellites or companions. the formand properties of the rotation curves are considered as a function of theisolation degree, morphological type and luminosity. the line ratios are usedto estimate the metallicity of all the detected hii regions, thus producing acomposite metallicity profile for different types of spirals. we have foundthat isolated galaxies tend to be of later types and lower luminosity than theinteracting galaxies. the outer parts of the rotation curves of isolatedgalaxies tend to be flatter than in interacting galaxies, but they show similarrelations between global parameters. the scatter of the tully-fisher relationdefined by isolated galaxies is significantly lower than that of interactinggalaxies. the [nii]/h$\alpha$ ratios, used as metallicity indicator, show aclear trend between z and morphological type, t, with earlier spirals showinglarger ratios; this trend is tighter when instead of t the gradient of theinner rotation curve, g, is used; no trend is found with the interactionstatus. the z-gradient of the disks depends on the type, being almost flat forearly spirals, and increasing for later types. the [nii]/h$\alpha$ ratiosmeasured for disk hii regions of interacting galaxies are higher than fornormal/isolated objects, even if all the galaxy families present similardistributions of h$\alpha$ equivalent width.

astro-ph;0602587	the scaling relation of early-type galaxies in clusters. ii:  spectroscopic data for galaxies in eight nearby clusters	aims: we present in this work low and intermediate resolution spectroscopicdata collected for 152 early type galaxies in 8 nearby clusters with z $\leq$0.10.  methods: we use low resolution data to produce the redshift and thek-correction for every individual galaxy, as well as to give their overallspectral energy distribution, and some spectral indicators, including the4000\aa break, the mg$_2$ strength, and the nad equivalent width.we have alsoobtained higher resolution data for early type galaxies in three of theclusters, to determine their central velocity dispersion.  results: the effect of the resolution on the measured parameters isdiscussed.  conclusions: new accurate systemic redshift and velocity dispersion ispresented for four of the surveyed clusters, a98, a3125, a3330, and dc2103-39.we have found that the k-correction values for e/s0 bright galaxies in a givennearby clusters are very similar. we also find that the distribution of theline indicators significantly differ from cluster to cluster.

astro-ph;0605085	isolated galaxies: residual of primordial building blocks?	context.the mass assembly is believed to be the dominant process of earlygalaxy formation. this mechanism of galaxy building can proceed either byrepeated major mergers with other systems, or by means of accretion of matterfrom the surrounding regions. aims.in this paper we compare the properties oflocal disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e. not tidally affected by othergalaxies during the last few gyr within the volume given by cz&lt;= 5000 km/s,with those galaxies at z values from 0.25 to 5.  methods.effective radii for 203 isolated galaxies and 1645 galaxies from therc3 have been collected and the two samples have been analyzed statistically. asimilar comparison has been made with half light radii studied at high z fromthe literature.  results.we found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller than otherpresent epoch galaxies from the rc3. we notice the lack of systems larger than7 kpc among them. their size distribution appears to be similar to that ofgalaxies at 1.4 &lt;= z &lt;= 2. the models of the merging history also indicate thatthe isolated galaxies did stop their merging process at about that redshift,evolving passively since then. the galaxy density seems to have remainedunchanged since that epoch.  conclusions.isolated galaxies appears to be the end products of the mergingprocess as proposed in the hierarchical accretion scenario at around z=1.4. forthis class of galaxies this was the last significant merging event in theirlives and have evolved passively since then. this is confirmed by theanalytical estimate of the merging fraction with z and by the comparison withsizes of distant galaxies.

astro-ph;0701426	dark matter annihilation in draco: new considerations of the expected  gamma flux	a new revision of the gamma flux that we expect to detect in imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) from neutralino annihilation in thedraco dsph is presented in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standardmodels (mssm) compatible with the present phenomenological and cosmologicalconstraints, and using the dark matter (dm) density profiles compatible withthe latest observations. this revision takes also into account the importanteffect of the point spread function (psf) of the telescope, and is valid notonly for draco but also for any other dm target. we show that this effect iscrucial in the way we will observe and interpret a possible signal detection.finally, we discuss the prospects to detect a possible gamma signal from dracofor current or planned gamma-ray experiments, i.e. magic, glast and gaw. evenwith the large astrophysical and particle physics uncertainties we find thatthe chances to detect a neutralino annihilation signal in draco seem to be veryscarce for current experiments. however, the prospects for future iacts withupgraded performances (especially lower threshold energies and highersensitivities) such as those offered by the cta project, might be substantiallybetter.

astro-ph;9301001	the peculiar balmer line profiles of oq 208	we present spectrophotometric observations of the broad line radio galaxy oq208 (mrk 668, 1404+286) obtained between 1985 and 1991. we show that the balmerline fluxes and profile shapes undergo remarkable changes. the ratio ofintensities between the broad and narrow components of hbeta increasedmonotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. the peak of the broad componentsof hbeta and halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. we havediscovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacementand the luminosity of hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger whenthe line luminosity is higher. we suggest that the observations are notcompatible with either a binary broad line region model or one involvingballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. radiative acceleration of asystem of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shiftand luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. furthermore, it seemsthat most or all of the balmer emission originates from the inward face of theclouds. theoretical line profiles suggest that the observed hbeta profile isbest fit assuming the contribution of an ensemble which might be spherical orconfined in a thick disk in addition to a component emitted in a thin shellcontained in a cone of half opening angle 12 degrees seen along its axis.

astro-ph;9610168	the eso nearby abell cluster survey. iii. distribution and kinematics of  emission-line galaxies	we have studied the frequency of occurrence, the kinematics and the spatialdistribution of emission-line galaxies (elg) in clusters in the eso nearbyabell cluster survey (enacs). more than 90% of the elg are spirals, but the elgrepresent only 30% of all spirals. the true elg fraction in clusters is 0.10;this is consistent with that in the field (0.21) as a result of differences inmorphological mix. the average elg fraction decreases with increasing velocitydispersion of the cluster. only 1/5 of the clusters shows a significantdifference in the average velocities of the elg and the other (non-elg)galaxies; in a similar fraction of the clusters significant differences invelocity dispersion are seen. yet, the velocity dispersion of the elg is, onaverage, 20% larger than that of the non-elg. this larger velocity dispersionis largely intrinsic, i.e. it is not likely to be the result of velocityoffsets of the elg. the surface density of the elg is significantly less peakedtowards the centre than that of the non-elg. the elg are distributed fairlysmoothly within the cluster with at most 25% in compact substructures. thedistribution and kinematics of the elg yield virial mass estimates that, onaverage, are 50% higher than those based on the non-elg. this probably meansthat the elg are on more radial orbits than the non-elg. all observedproperties of the elg are consistent with most of them being on their firstapproach of the high-density cluster core.

astro-ph;9707194	the dynamical status of stephan's quintet	multiwavelength data for stephan's quintet (sq) are consistent with thefollowing model for this compact galaxy group. (1) discordant redshift ngc 7320is an unrelated foreground galaxy. (2) in the past sq was an accordant redshiftquartet involving ngc 7317, 18a, 19 and 20c. ngc 7320c collided (probably notfor the first time) with the group a few times 10$^8$ years ago and strippedthe interstellar matter from ngc 7319. (3) in the present sq is again anaccordant quartet involving ngc 7317, 18a,b, and 19. ngc 7318b is now enteringthe group at high velocity for the first time, giving rise to a shock zone. ifmost compact groups are like sq, then they are frequently visited by infallingn eighbors that perturb the group and themselves. sq represents strong evidencefor secondary infall in a small group environment. tidal stripping reduces themass of the infalling galaxies, thereby increasing the timescale for theirorbital decay. there is little evidence that these high velocity ``intruders''are rapidly captured and/or merge with the system. instead they are themechanism that sustains compact groups against collapse. efficient gasstripping may account for the low star formation rate observed in compactgroups and infall of residual gas into galactic nuclei may also foster theonset of agn activity.

astro-ph;9901265	effects of interaction on the properties of spiral galaxies. ii.  isolated galaxies: the zero point	we analyse the properties of a sample of 22 bright isolated spiral galaxieson the basis of johnson b,v,i images and optical rotation curves. the fractionof early morphological types in our sample of isolated galaxies (or in othersamples of non-interacting spiral galaxies) appears to be smaller than insamples including interacting systems. the overall morphological aspect isregular and symmetric, but all the galaxies present non-axisymmetric componentsin the form of bars or rings. we find that the color indices become bluertowards the outer parts and that the ir central values are well correlated withthe total colors. the properties of the bulges span a larger range than thoseof the disks, that thus are more alike between them. none of the galaxies showsa truncated, type ii disk profile. it is found that the relation betweensurface brightness and size for the bulges, the kormendy relation, is tighterwhen only isolated galaxies are considered. we find a similar relation for thedisk parameters with an unprecedented low scatter. a principal componentanalysis of the measured parameters shows that 2 eigenvectors suffice toexplain more than 95% of the total variance. these are, as found for othersamples including spiral galaxies in different environmental situations, ascale parameter given by the mass or, equivalently, the luminosity or the size;and a form parameter given by the bulge to disk luminosity ratio, b/d, or,equivalently, by the gradient of the solid-body rotation region of the rotationcurve, the g-parameter. we report here a tight correlation between g and b/dfor our sample of isolated spirals that could be used as a new distanceindicator.

astro-ph;9909351	near-infrared photometry of isolated spirals with and without an agn. i:  the data	we present infrared imaging data in the j and k' bands obtained for 18 activespiral galaxies, together with 11 non active galaxies taken as a controlsample. all of them were chosen to satisfy well defined isolation criteria sothat the observed properties are not related to gravitational interaction. foreach object we give: the image in the k' band, the sharp-divided image(obtained by dividing the observed image by a filtered one), the differenceimage (obtained by subtracting a model to the observed one), the color j-k'image, the ellipticity and position angle profiles, the surface brightnessprofiles in j and k', their fits by bulge+disk models and the color gradient.we have found that four (one) active (control) galaxies previously classifiedas non-barred turn out to have bars when observed in the near-infrared. one ofthese four galaxies (ugc 1395) also harbours a secondary bar. for 15 (9 active,6 control) out of 24 (14 active, 10 control) of the optically classified barredgalaxies (sb or sx) we find that a secondary bar (or a disk, a lense or anelongated ring) is present. the work presented here is part of a large program(degas) aimed at finding whether there are differences between active and nonactive galaxies in the properties of their central regions that could beconnected with the onset of nuclear activity.

0812.2022	wings-spe spectroscopy in the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey	aims. we present the results from a comprehensive spectroscopic survey of thewings (wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey) clusters, a program calledwings-spe. the wings-spe sample consists of 48 clusters, 22 of which are in thesouthern sky and 26 in the north. the main goals of this spectroscopic surveyare: (1) to study the dynamics and kinematics of the wings clusters and theirconstituent galaxies, (2) to explore the link between the spectral propertiesand the morphological evolution in different density environments and across awide range in cluster x-ray luminosities and optical properties. methods. usingmulti object fiber fed spectrographs, we observed our sample of wings clustergalaxies at an intermediate resolu- tion of 6-9 a and, using across-correlation technique, we measured redshifts with a mean accuracy ofabout 45 km/s. results. we present redshift measurements for 6137 galaxies andtheir first analyses. details of the spectroscopic observations are reported.the wings-spe has about 30% overlap with previously published data sets,allowing us to do both a complete comparison with the literature and to extendthe catalogs. conclusions. using our redshifts, we calculate the velocitydispersion for all the clusters in the wings-spe sample. we almost trip- licatethe number of member galaxies known in each cluster with respect to previousworks. we also investigate the x-ray luminosity vs. velocity dispersionrelation for our wings-spe clusters, and find it to be consistent with the formlx proportional to sigma^4.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
