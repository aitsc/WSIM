0901.2215	igr j16351-5806: another close by compton-thick agn	igr j16351-5806 has been associated with the seyfert 2 galaxy eso 137-g34,having been first reported as a high energy emitter in the third integral/ibissurvey. using a new diagnostic tool based on x-ray column density measurementsvs softness ratios, malizia et al. (2007) identified this source as a candidatecompton thick agn. in the present work we have analysed combined xmm-newton andintegral data of igr j16351-5806 in order to study its broad band spectrum andinvestigate its compton thick nature. the prominent k_alpha fluorescence linearound 6.4 kev (ew &gt; 1 kev) together with a flat 2-10 kev spectrum immediatelypoint to a highly obscured source. the overall spectrum can be interpreted interms of a transmission scenario where some of the high energy radiation isable to penetrate through the thick absorption but a good fit is also obtainedusing a pure reflection spectrum. an alternative possibility is that of acomplex absorption, where two layers of absorbing matter each partiallycovering the central nucleus are present in igr j16351-5806. all threescenarios are compatible from a statistical viewpoint and provide reasonableagn spectral parameters; more importantly all point to a source with anabsorbing column greater than 1.5 x 10^24 cm^-2, i.e. to a compton thick agn.because of this heavy obscuration, some extra components which would otherwisebe hidden are able to emerge at low energies and can be studied. by providingstrong evidence for the compton thick nature of igr j16351-5806, we indirectlyconfirm the validity of the malizia et al. diagnostic diagram.

0706.2547	swift-xrt observation of 34 new integral/ibis agns: discovery of compton  thick and other peculiar sources	for a significant number of the sources detected at high energies (&gt;10 kev)by the integral/ibis and swift/bat instruments there is either a lackinformation about them in the 2-10 kev range or they are totally unidentified.herein, we report on a sample of 34 ibis agn or agn candidate objects for whichthere is x-ray data in the swift/xrt archive. thanks to these x-ray follow upobservations, the identification of the gamma ray emitters has been possibleand the spectral shape in terms of photon index and absorption has beenevaluated for the first time for the majority of our sample sources. thesample, enlarged to include 4 more agn already discussed in the literature, hasbeen used to provide photon index and column density distribution. we obtain amean value of 1.88 with a dispersion of 0.12, i.e. typical of an agn sample.sixteen objects (47%) have column densities in excess of 10^{22} cm^{-2} and,as expected, a large fraction of the absorbed sources are within the sey 2sample. we have provided a new diagnostic tool (nh versusf(2-10)kev/f(20-100)kev softness ratio) to isolate peculiar objects; we find atleast one absorbed sey 1 galaxy, 3 compton thick agn candidates; and one secureexample of a "true" type 2 agn. within the sample of 10 still unidentifiedobjects, 3 are almost certainly agn of type 2; 3 to 4 have spectral slopestypical of agn; and two are located high on the galactic plane and are strongenough radio emitters so that can be considered good agn candidates.

0706.3460	the agn nature of 11 out of 12 swift/rxte unidentified sources through  optical and x-ray spectroscopy	the swift burst alert telescope (bat) is performing a high galactic latitudesurvey in the 14-195 kev band at a flux limit of ~10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1},leading to the discovery of new high energy sources, most of which have not sofar been properly classified. a similar work has also been performed with therxte slew survey leading to the discovery of 68 sources detected above 8 kev,many of which are still unclassified. follow-up observations with the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) provide, for many of these objects, source localizationwith a positional accuracy of few arcsec, thus allowing the search for opticalcounterparts to be more efficient and reliable. we present the results ofoptical/x-ray follow-up studies of 11 swift bat detections and one agn detectedin the rxte slew survey, aimed at identifying their counterparts and atassessing their nature. these data allowed, for the first time, the opticalclassification of 8 objects and a distance determination for 3 of them. foranother object, a more refined optical classification than that available inthe literature is also provided. for the remaining sources, opticalspectroscopy provides a characterization of the source near in time to thex-ray measurement. the sample consists of 6 seyfert 2 galaxies, 5 seyferts ofintermediate type 1.2-1.8, and one object of galactic nature - an intermediatepolar (i.e., magnetic) cataclysmic variable. out of the 11 agns, 8 (~70%)including 2 seyferts of type 1.2 and 1.5, are absorbed with nh &gt; 10^{22}cm^{-2}. up to 3 objects could be compton thick (i.e. nh &gt; 1.5 x 10^{24}cm^{-2}), but only in one case (swift j0609.1-8636) does all the observationalevidence strongly suggests this possibility.

0905.2891	an intermediate black hole spin in the nls1 galaxy swift j2127.4+5654:  chaotic accretion or spin energy extraction?	we have observed the hard x-ray selected narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy swiftj2127.4+5654 with suzaku. we report the detection of a broad relativistic ironemission line from the inner accretion disc. by assuming that the inner edge ofthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of theblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spina= 0.6\pm0.2. however, a non-rotating schwarzschild spacetime is excluded atjust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning kerr black hole isexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. the intermediate spin we measure may indicatethat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds throughshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the discand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. the measured steep emissivityindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating x-ray source to be very centrallyconcentrated. light bending may help focus the primary emission towards theinnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. on the otherhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the holerotational energy is at work. if this is the case, the interplay betweenaccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,under standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.rotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account forthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectralanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

0906.2909	the integral complete sample of type 1 agn	in this paper we discuss the broad-band x-ray characteristics of a completesample of 36 type 1 agn, detected by integral in the 20-40 kev band above the5.5sigma level. we present, for all the objects in the sample, the broad-band(1-110 kev) spectral analysis obtained by using integral/swift-bat observationstogether with xmm-newton, chandra, asca and swift/xrt data. we also present thegeneral average properties of the sample, i.e. the distribution of photonindices, high energy cut-offs, reflection fractions and absorption properties,together with an in-depth analysis of their parameter space. we find that theaverage seyfert 1 power law has an index of 1.7 with a dispersion of 0.2. themean cut-off energy is at around 100 kev, with most objects displaying ec inthe range 50-150 kev; the average amount of compton reflection is 1.5 with atypical dispersion of 0.7. we do not find any convincing correlation betweenthe various parameters, an indication that our analysis is not stronglydependent by the interplay between them. finally, we investigate how theresults presented in this work fit into current frameworks for agn spectralmodeling and cosmic diffuse x-ray background synthesis models.

0906.5544	the fraction of compton-thick sources in an integral complete agn sample	we study the nh distribution in a complete sample of 88 agn selected in the20-40 kev band from integral/ibis observations. we find that the fraction ofabsorbed (nh &gt; 10^{22} cm^2) sources is 43% while the compton thick agncomprise 7% of the sample. while these estimates are fully compatible withprevious soft gamma-ray surveys, they would appear to be in contrast withresults reported by risaliti et al. (1999) using an optically selected sample.this apparent difference can be explained as being due to a selection biascaused by the reduction in high energy flux in compton thick objects renderingthem invisible at our sensitivity limit. taking this into account we estimatethat the fraction of highly absorbed sources is actually in close agreementwith the optically selected sample. furthermore we show that the measuredfraction of absorbed sources in our sample decreases from 80% to about 20-30%as a function of redshift with all compton thick agn having z &lt; 0.015. if welimit our analysis to this distance and compare only the type 2 objects in oursample with the risaliti et al. objects below this redshift value, we find aperfect match to their nh distribution. we conclude that in the low redshiftbin we are seeing almost the entire agn population, from unabsorbed to at leastmildly compton thick objects, while in the total sample we lose the heavilyabsorbed 'counterparts' of distant and therefore dim sources with little or noabsorption. taking therefore this low z bin as the only one able to provide the'true' distribution of absorption in type 1 and 2 agn, we estimate the fractionof compton thick objects to be &gt;24%.

1002.4712	re-evaluating the local compton-thick agn fraction	we study the nh distribution in a complete sample of 88 agn selected in the20-40 kev band from integral/ibis observations. we find that the fraction ofabsorbed (nh &gt; 10^22 cm^-2) sources is 43% while compton thick agn comprise 7%of the sample. while these estimates are fully compatible with previous softgamma-ray surveys, they would appear to be in contrast with results reportedfrom an optically selected sample. this apparent difference can be explained asbeing due to a selection bias caused by the reduction in high energy flux incompton thick objects rendering them invisible at our sensitivity limit. takingthis into account we estimate that the fraction of highly absorbed sources isactually in close agreement with the optically selected sample. furthermore weshow that the measured fraction of absorbed sources in our sample decreasesfrom 80% to ~20-30% as a function of redshift with all compton thick agn havingz&lt;0.015. we conclude that in the low redshift bin we are seeing almost theentire agn population, from unabsorbed to at least mildly compton thickobjects, while in the total sample we lose the heavily absorbed 'counterparts'of distant and therefore dim sources with little or no absorption. takingtherefore this low z bin as the only one able to provide the 'true'distribution of absorption in type 1 and 2 agn, we estimate the fraction ofcompton thick objects to be &gt;24%

1006.1272	xmm-newton observations of unidentified integral/ibis sources	about 30% of the sources in the 4th integral-ibis catalogue are unidentifiedin that they lack an optical counterpart. to be able to classify them, x-rayobservations are of crucial importance as they can place tighter constraints onthe high energy error box, which is usually of the order of a few arcminutes,and allow their broad band spectrum to be studied. to this aim we havecross-correlated the list of all unidentified ibis sources in the fourthcatalogue with the archive of all xmm-newton pointings, finding a set of 6objects with archival data. for 1 of them, igr j17331-2406, no x-ray source isdetected by xmm inside the ibis error box, most likely due to the fact that itis a transient object. in the case of igr j17445-2747 two possible x-raycounterparts are found inside the ibis error box: one is very weak while theother is bright but only detected once. in each of the remaining 4 cases: igrj155359-5750, ax j1739.3-2923, ax j1740.2-2903 and igr j18538-0102, we findinstead a convincing association for which we provide an improved x-rayposition and information on the optical/infrared counterpart. we also performeda detailed analysis of their xmm-ibis spectra and on the basis of allinformation acquired we suggest that igr j155359-5750 is an agn of intermediatetype, ax j1739.3-2923 and ax j1740.2-2903 are high mass x-ray binary systems,igr j17331-2406 and igr j17445-2747 are galactic transient sources and igrj18538-0102 could be a background agn.

1201.1906	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  ix. 22 more identifications, and a glance into the far hard x-ray universe	(abridged) since its launch in october 2002, the integral satellite hasrevolutionized our knowledge of the hard x-ray sky thanks to its unprecedentedimaging capabilities and source detection positional accuracy above 20 kev.nevertheless, many of the newly-detected sources in the integral sky surveysare of unknown nature. the combined use of available information at longerwavelengths (mainly soft x-rays and radio) and of optical spectroscopy on theputative counterparts of these new hard x-ray objects allows us to pinpointtheir exact nature. continuing our long-standing program that has been runningsince 2004, and using 6 different telescopes of various sizes, we report theclassification through optical spectroscopy of 22 more unidentified or poorlystudied high-energy sources detected with the ibis instrument onboard integral.we found that 16 of them are active galactic nuclei (agns), while the remaining6 objects are within our galaxy. among the identified extragalactic sources, 14are type 1 agns; of these, 6 lie at redshift larger than 0.5 and one has z =3.12, which makes it the second farthest object detected in the integralsurveys up to now. the remaining agns are of type 2, and one of them is a pairof interacting seyfert 2 galaxies. the galactic objects are identified as twocataclysmic variables, one high-mass x-ray binary, one symbiotic binary and twochromospherically active stars. we thus still find that agns are the mostabundant population among hard x-ray objects identified through opticalspectroscopy. moreover, we note that the higher sensitivity of the more recentintegral surveys is now enabling the detection of high-redshift agns, thusallowing the exploration of the most distant hard x-ray emitting sources andpossibly of the most extreme blazars.

1302.6117	identification of newly-discovered sources belonging to the 4th ibis  catalog and to the 54 months palermo swift/bat catalog	the most recent all-sky surveys performed with the integral and swiftsatellites allowed the detection of more than 1500 sources in hard x-rays above20 kev. about one quarter of them has no obvious counterpart at otherwavelengths and therefore could not be associated with any known class ofhigh-energy emitting objects. although cross-correlation with catalogues orsurveys at other wavelengths (especially soft x-rays) is of invaluable supportin pinpointing the putative optical candidates, only accurate opticalspectroscopy can reveal the true nature of these sources. with the aim ofidentifying them, we started in 2004 an optical spectroscopy program which usesdata from several telescopes worldwide and which proved extremely successful,leading to the identification of about 200 integral objects and nearly 130swift sources. here we want to present a summary of this identification workand an outlook of our preliminary results on identification of newly-discoveredsources belonging to the 4th ibis catalog and to the 54 months palermoswift/bat catalog.

astro-ph;0305329	a bepposax observation of mkn6	we have used the bepposax satellite to study the broad band (0.5-100 kev)x-ray spectrum of the seyfert 1.5 galaxy mkn6. the source is characterized by apower law of gamma=1.7 [+0.08, -0.07] and there is no strong evidence foreither a reflection bump or a high energy cut-off. we have detected a narrowiron line at 6.4 kev (rest frame) with an equivalent width of 98 [+33, -35] ev.mkn6 also exhibits strong and complex absorption. at least two components (nh_1=1.34 [+0.4,-0.4] x 10^(22) cm^(-2) and nh_2 = 4.18 [+2.2, -1.3] x 10^(22)cm^(-2)) are present and they both partially cover the source with coveringfractions of ~90% and ~50% respectively. comparison with a previous ascaobservation indicates that in both absorbing columns the nh is variable over a2 year timescale, while the covering fractions are constant over the sameamount of time. the state of each absorber is cold or mildly photoionized. thebroad line region (blr) is suggested as the possible location for this complexabsorption.

astro-ph;0610880	integral and swift observations of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  axj1845.0-0433=igrj18450-0435	context: axj1845.0-0433 was discovered by asca in 1993 during fast outburstactivity characterized by several flares on short timescales. up to now, thesource was not detected again by any x-ray mission. its optical counterpart issuggested to be an o9.5i supergiant star, which is the only remarkable objectfound inside the asca error box. aims: to detect and characterize new fastoutbursts of axj1845.0-0433 and confirm its supergiant hmxb nature, usingintegral and archival swift xrt observations. methods: we performed an analysisof integral ibis and jem-x data with osa 5.1 as well as an analysis of archiveswift xrt data. results: we report on fast flaring activity from the source ontimescales of a few tens of minutes, the first to be reported since itsdiscovery in 1993. two outbursts have been detected by integral (apr 2005 andapr 2006) with similar peak fluxes and peak luminosities of 80 mcrab and9.3x10^35 erg s^-1 (20--40 kev), respectively. two other outbursts weredetected by swift xrt on nov 2005 and mar 2006. the refined swift xrt positionof axj1845.0-0433 confirms its association with the supergiant star previouslyproposed as optical counterpart. conclusions: our integral and swift resultsfully confirm the supergiant hmxb nature of axj1845.0-0433 which can thereforebe classified as a supergiant fast x-ray transient. moreover they provide forthe first time evidence of its recurrent fast transient behaviour.

astro-ph;0702477	igr j18483-0311: an accreting x-ray pulsar observed by integral	igr j18483-0311 is a poorly known transient hard x-ray source discovered byintegral during observations of the galactic center region performed between23--28 april 2003. aims: to detect new outbursts from igr j18483-0311 usingintegral and archival swift xrt observations and finally to characterize thenature of this source using the optical/near-infrared (nir) informationavailable through catalogue searches. results: we report on 5 newly discoveredoutbursts from igr j18483-0311 detected by integral.for two of them it waspossible to constrain a duration of the order of a few days. the strongestoutburst reached a peak flux of 120 mcrab (20--100 kev): its broad bandjem--x/isgri spectrum (3--50 kev) is best fitted by an absorbed cutoff powerlaw with photon index=1.4+/-0.3, cutoff energy of ~22 kev and nh ~9x10^22cm^-2. timing analysis of integral data allowed us to identify periodicities of18.52 days and 21.0526 seconds which are likely the orbital period of thesystem and the spin period of the x-ray pulsar respectively. swift xrtobservations of igr j18483$-$0311 provided a very accurate source positionwhich strongly indicates a highly reddened star in the usno--b1.0 and 2masscatalogues as its possible optical/nir counterpart. conclusions: the x-rayspectral shape, the periods of 18.52 days and 21.0526 seconds, the highintrinsic absorption, the location in the direction of the scutum spiral armand the highly reddened optical object as possible counterpart, all favour thehypothesis that igr j18483-0311 is a hmxb with a neutron star as compactcompanion. the system is most likely a be x-ray binary, but a supergiant fastx-ray transient nature can not be entirely excluded.

astro-ph;9810086	the quiescent state broadband x-ray spectrum and variability of mkn421	the bl lac object mkn~421 was observed three times by the x-ray observatorybepposax in consecutive days during 1997 april and may. the source was in aquiescent state, with an average 2-10 kev flux of 9.0 x 10^(-11) erg/cm/cm/s.flux variation by a factor of ~2 on timescales as short as a few 10 ks weremore pronounced in the hard (i.e. above ~3 kev) than in the soft x-rays. thebroadband (0.1-40 kev) spectrum is concave and can be most easily explainedwith a power-law model which steepens gradually with energy. in this framework,neither photoabsorption edges nor resonant absorption lines are required,strengthening the case against the ubiquity of such features in bl lac objects,which had been previously suggested by einstein observations. the broadbandspectrum hardens with hard x-ray flux, mostly due to a flattening above ~4 kev.this suggests that the relativistic highest energy electron distributionproperties drive the x-ray spectral dynamics: either a stratification of thedistribution in the jet with energy or inhomogeneities in the electroninjection mechanism could be consistent with the observed variability pattern.

astro-ph;9902054	batse observations of the piccinotti sample of agn	batse earth occultation data have been used to search for emission in the20-100 kev band from all sources in the piccinotti sample, which represents todate the only complete 2-10 kev survey of the extragalactic sky down to alimiting flux of 3.1 x 10^(-11) erg cm^(-2)$ s^(-1). nearly four years ofobservations have been analyzed to reach a 5sigma sensitivity level of about7.8x 10^(-11) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) in the band considered. of the 36 sources inthe sample, 14 have been detected above 5sigma confidence level while marginaldetection (3&lt;sigma&lt;5) can be claimed for 13 sources; for 9 objects 2sigma upperlimits are reported. comparison of batse results with data at higher energiesis used to estimate the robustness of our data analysis: while the detectionlevel of each source is reliable, the flux measurement maybe overestimated insome sources by as much as 35%, probably due to incomplete data cleaning.comparison of batse fluxes with x-ray fluxes, obtained in the 2-10 kev rangeand averaged over years, indicates that a canonical power law of photon index1.7 gives a good description of the broad band spectra of bright agns and thatspectral breaks preferentially occur above 100 kev.

astro-ph;9902075	bepposax lecs background subtraction techniques	we present 3 methods for the subtraction of non-cosmic and unresolved cosmicbackgrounds observed by the low-energy concentrator spectrometer (lecs)on-board bepposax. removal of these backgrounds allows a more accurate modelingof the spectral data from point and small-scale extended sources. at high(&gt;|25| degree) galactic latitudes, subtraction using a standard backgroundspectrum works well. at low galactic latitudes, or in complex regions of thex-ray sky, two alternative methods are presented. the first uses countsobtained from two semi-annuli near the outside of the lecs field of view toestimate the background at the source location. the second method uses rosatposition sensitive proportional counter (pspc) all-sky survey data to estimatethe lecs background spectrum for a given pointing position. a comparison of theresults from these methods provides an estimate of the systematicuncertainties. for high galactic latitude fields, all 3 methods give 3 sigmaconfidence uncertainties of &lt;0.9 10^-3 count/s (0.1-10 kev), or &lt;1.5 10^-3count/s (0.1-2 kev). these correspond to 0.1-2.0 kev fluxes of 0.7-1.8 and0.5-1.1 10^-13 erg/cm2/s for a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2 andphotoelectric absorption of 3 10^20 and 3 10^21 atom/cm2, respectively. at lowgalactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the x-ray sky, the uncertaintiesare a factor ~2.5 higher.

astro-ph;9903109	the low-energy cosmic x-ray background spectrum observed by the bepposax  lecs	the spectrum of the 0.1-7.0 kev cosmic x-ray background (cxb) at galacticlatitudes &gt;|25| degrees has been measured using the bepposax low-energyspectrometer concentrator (lecs). above 1 kev the spectrum is consistent with apower-law of photon index 1.47 +/- 0.10 and normalization 11.0 +/- 0.8 photoncm^-2 s^-1 kev^-1 sr^-1 at 1kev. the overall spectrum can be modeled by apower-law with 2 thermal components, or by a broken power-law and a singlethermal component. in both cases the softer thermal emission dominates at lessthan 0.3 kev and is seen through a column of a few 10^19 atom cm^-2. the othercomponents have columns consistent with the mean line of sight value. the metalabundances for the thermal components are poorly constrained, but consistentwith cosmic values. the power-law together with 2 thermal components model hasbeen used to fit recent combined asca and rosat cxb measurements. here, thesoft thermal component is interpreted as emission from the local hot bubble andthe hard thermal component as emission from a more distant absorbed region.while such a 2 component thermal model is consistent with the lecs spectrum, itis not required, and the hard thermal component may result from inadequatemodeling of the extragalactic contribution. the observed low-energy spectralcomplexity may therefore originate primarily in the local hot bubble. there isno evidence for the presence of a very soft cxb component with a temperature&lt;0.1 kev. the emission measure seen by rosat is rejected at 90% confidence.

astro-ph;9910484	hard x-ray detection of the high redshift quasar 4c 71.07	batse/osse observations of the high redshift quasar 4c 71.07 indicate thatthis is the brightest and furthest agn so far detected above 20 kev. batseearth occultation data have been used to search for emission from 4c 71.07 fromnearly 3 years of observation. the mean source flux over the whole period inthe batse energy range 20-100 kev is (13.2 +/- 1.06) x 10^(-11) erg cm^(-2)s^(-1) corresponding to a luminosity of 2 x 10^(48) erg s^(-1). the batse lightcurve over the 3 years of observations shows several flare-like events, one ofwhich (in january 1996) is associated with an optical flare (r=16.1) but with adelay of 55 days. the osse/batse spectral analysis indicates that the source ischaracterized by a flat power spectrum (gamma about 1.1 - 1.3) when in a lowstate; this spectral form is consistent within errors with the asca and rosatspectra. this means that the power law observed from 0.1 to 10 kev extends upto at least 1 mev but steepens soon after to meet egret high energy data. batsedata taken around the january 1996 flare suggests that the spectrum could besteeper when the source is in a bright state. the nuf-nu representation of thesource is typical of a low frequency peaked/gamma-ray dominated blazar, withthe synchrotron peak in the mm-fir band and the compton peak in the mev band.the batse and osse spectral data seem to favour a model in which the highenergy flux is due to the sum of the synchrotron self-compton and the externalcompton contributions; this is also supported by the variability behaviour ofthe source.

0811.4085	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  vii. identification of 20 galactic and extragalactic hard x-ray sources	within the framework of our program of assessment of the nature ofunidentified or poorly known integral sources, we present here spectroscopy ofoptical objects, selected through positional cross-correlation with soft x-raydetections (afforded with satellites such as swift, rosat, chandra and/orxmm-newton) as putative counterparts of hard x-ray sources detected with theibis instrument onboard integral. using 6 telescopes of various sizes andarchival data from two on-line spectroscopic surveys we are able to identify,either for the first time or independent of other groups, the nature of 20integral hard x-ray sources. our results indicate that: 11 of these objects areactive galactic nuclei (agns) at redshifts between 0.014 and 0.978, 7 of whichdisplay broad emission lines, 2 show narrow emission lines only, and 2 haveunremarkable or no emission lines (thus are likely compton thick agns); 5 arecataclysmic variables (cvs), 4 of which are (possibly magnetic) dwarf novae andone is a symbiotic star; and 4 are galactic x-ray binaries (3 with high-masscompanions and one with a low-mass secondary). it is thus again found that themajority of these sources are agns or magnetic cvs, confirming our previousfindings. when possible, the main physical parameters for these hard x-raysources are also computed using the multiwavelength information available inthe literature. these identifications support the importance of integral in thestudy of the hard x-ray spectrum of all classes of x-ray emitting objects, andthe effectiveness of a strategy of multi-catalogue cross-correlation plusoptical spectroscopy to securely pinpoint the actual nature of unidentifiedhard x-ray sources.
