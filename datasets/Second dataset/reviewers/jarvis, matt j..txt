0901.2517	evidence of a link between the evolution of clusters and their agn  fraction	we discuss the optical properties, x-ray detections, and active galacticnucleus (agn) populations of four clusters at z ~ 1 in the subaru-xmm deepfield (sxdf). the velocity distribution and plausible extended x-ray detectionsare examined, as well as the number of x-ray point sources and radio sourcesassociated with the clusters. we find that the two clusters that appearvirialised and have an extended x-ray detection contain few, if any, agn,whereas the two pre-virialised clusters have a large agn population. thisconstitutes evidence that the agn fraction in clusters is linked to theclusters' evolutionary stage. the number of x-ray agn in the pre-virialisedclusters is consistent with an overdensity of factor ~ 200; the radio agnappear to be clustered with a factor of three to six higher. the median k-bandluminosities of l_k = 1.7 +/- 0.7 l* for the x-ray sources and l_k = 2.3 +/-0.1 l* for the radio sources support the theory that these agn are triggered bygalaxy interaction and merging events in sub-groups with low internal velocitydistributions, which make up the cluster environment in a pre-virialisationevolutionary stage.

0907.1447	the discovery of a typical radio galaxy at z = 4.88	in this letter we report the discovery of a z=4.88 radio galaxy discoveredwith a new technique which does not rely on pre-selection of a sample based onradio properties such as steep-spectral index or small angular size. this radiogalaxy was discovered in the elais-n2 field and has a spectral index of alpha =0.75, i.e. not ultra-steep spectrum. it also has a luminosity consistent withbeing drawn from the break of the radio luminosity function and can thereforebe considered as a typical radio galaxy. using the spitzer-swire data over thisfield we find that the host galaxy is consistent with being similarly massiveto the lower redshift powerful radio galaxies (~1-3l*). we note however, thatat z=4.88 the h-alpha line is redshifted into the irac 3.6micron filter andsome of the flux in this band may be due to this rather than stellar continuumemission. the discovery of such a distant radio source from our initialspectroscopic observations demonstrate the promise of our survey for findingthe most distant radio sources.

0909.4205	constraints on star forming galaxies at z&gt; 6.5 from hawk-i y-band  imaging of goods-south	we present the results of our search for high-redshift lyman-break galaxiesover the goods-south field. we use hst-acs data in b, v, i' &amp; z', vlt-isaac jand ks, spitzer-irac 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron data in conjunction with thenew hawk-i y-band science verification data to search for dropout galaxies inthe redshift range 6&lt;z&lt;9. we survey ~119 arcmin^2 to y_ab=25.7 (5sigma), ofwhich 37.5 arcmin^2 reaches y_ab=25.9. candidate z' and y drop-outs wereselected on the basis of a colour cut of (y-j)_{ab}&gt;0.75 mag and(z'-y)_{ab}&gt;1.0 mag respectively. we find no robust y-drops (z~9) brighter thanj_{ab}&lt;25.4. in our search for z'-band dropouts (z~6.5-7.5), we identify fourpossible candidates, two with z'-drop colours and clear spitzer-irac detectionsand two less likely candidates. we also identify two previously-known galactict-dwarf stellar contaminants with these colours, and two likely transientobjects seen in the y-band data. the implications if all or none of ourcandidates are real on the ultra-violet galaxy luminosity functions at z&gt;6.5are explored. we find our number of z'-drop candidates to be insufficient basedon the expected number of z' drops in a simple no-evolution scenario from thez=3 lyman-break galaxy luminosity function but we are consistent with theobserved luminosity function at z~6 (if all our candidates are real). however,if one or both of our best z'-drop candidates are not z&gt;6.5 galaxies, thiswould demand evolution of the luminosity function at early epochs. we show thatthe future surveys to be conducted with the eso vista telescope over the nextfive years will be able to measure the bulk of the luminosity function for bothz' and y drop-outs.

0910.1098	probing $\sim l_{*}$ lyman-break galaxies at $z\approx 7$ in goods-south  with wfc3 on hst	we analyse recently acquired near-infrared hubble space telescope imaging ofthe goods-south field to search for star forming galaxies at z~7.0. bycomparing wfc 3 0.98 micron y-band images with acs z-band (0.85 micron) images,we identify objects with colours consistent with lyman break galaxies atz~6.4-7.4. this new data covers an area five times larger than that previouslyreported in the wfc3 imaging of the hubble ultra deep field, and affords avaluable constraint on the bright end of the luminosity function. usingadditional imaging of the region in the acs b, v and i-bands from goods v2.0and the wfc3 j-band we attempt to remove any low-redshift interlopers. ourselection criteria yields 6 candidates brighter than y_ab = 27.0, of which allexcept one are detected in the acs z-band imaging and are thus unlikely to betransients. assuming all 6 candidates are at z~7 this implies a surface densityof objects brighter than y_ab = 27.0 of 0.30\pm0.12 arcmin-2, a valuesignificantly smaller than the prediction from the z ~ 6 luminosity function.this suggests continued evolution of the bright end of the luminosity functionbetween z = 6 to 7, with number densities lower at higher redshift.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

1001.5419	the environments of z~1 active galactic nuclei at 3.6um	we present an analysis of a large sample of agn environments at z~1 usingstacked spitzer data at 3.6um. the sample contains type-1 and type-2 agn in theform of quasars and radio galaxies, and spans a large range in both optical andradio luminosity. we find, on average, that 2 to 3 massive galaxies containinga substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300 kpc radius of theagn, constituting a &gt;8-sigma excess relative to the field. secondly, we findevidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radioluminosity of agn, but not with black-hole mass. this is shown first bydividing the agn into their classical agn types, where we see more significantover-densities in the fields of the radio-loud agn. if instead we dispense withthe classical agn definitions, we find that the source over-density as afunction of radio luminosity for all our agn exhibits a positive correlation.one interpretation of this result is that the mpc-scale environment is in someway influencing the radio emission that we observe from agn. this could beexplained by the confinement of radio jets in dense environments leading toenhanced radio emission or, alternatively, may be linked to more rapidblack-hole spin brought on by galaxy mergers.

1003.2166	an excess of star-forming galaxies in the fields of high-redshift qsos	we present submillimetre and mid-infrared imaging observations of five fieldscentred on quasi-stellar objects (qsos) at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.8. all 5 qsos were detectedpreviously at submillimetre wavelengths. at 850 (450) um we detect 17 (11)submillimetre galaxies (smgs) in addition to the qsos. the total area mapped at850 um is ~28 arcmin^2 down to rms noise levels of 1-2 mjy/beam, depending onthe field. integral number counts are computed from the 850 um data using thesame analytical techniques adopted by `blank-field' submillimetre surveys. wefind that the `qso-field' counts show a clear excess over the blank-fieldcounts at deboosted flux densities of 2-4 mjy; at higher flux densities thecounts are consistent with the blank-field counts. robust mid-infraredcounterparts are identified for all four submillimetre detected qsos and ~60per cent of the smgs. the mid-infrared colours of the qsos are similar to thoseof the local ulirg/agn mrk 231 if placed at 1&lt;z&lt;3 whilst most of the smgs havecolours very similar to those of the local ulirg arp 220 at 1&lt;z&lt;3. mid-infrareddiagnostics therefore find no strong evidence that the smgs host buried agnalthough we cannot rule out such a possibility. taken together our resultssuggest that the qsos sit in regions of the early universe which are undergoingan enhanced level of major star-formation activity, and should evolve to becomesimilarly dense regions containing massive galaxies at the present epoch.finally, we find evidence that the level of star-formation activity inindividual galaxies appears to be lower around the qsos than it is around morepowerful radio-loud agn at higher redshifts.

1004.1099	evidence of different star formation histories for high- and  low-luminosity radio galaxies	we present the results of our investigation into the stellar populations of24 radio galaxies at z~0.5 drawn from four complete, low-frequency selectedradio surveys. we use the strength of the 4000a break as an indicator of recentstar formation, and compare this with radio luminosity, optical spectralclassification and morphological classification. we find evidence of differentstar formation histories for high- and low-luminosity radio sources; our groupof low radio luminosity sources (typically fri-type sources) has systematicallyolder stellar populations than the higher radio luminosity group. our sample isalso fairly well divided by optical spectral classification. we find thatgalaxies classified as having low excitation spectra (legs) possess olderstellar populations than high excitation line objects (hegs), with the hegsshowing evidence for recent star formation. we also investigate the linkbetween radio morphology, as used by owen &amp; laing (1989), and the stellarpopulations. we find that there is a preference for the "fat-double" sources tohave older stellar populations than the "classical double" sources, althoughthis is also linked to these sources lying predominantly in the leg and hegcategories respectively. these results are consistent with the hypothesis thathegs are powered by accretion of cold gas, which could be supplied, forexample, by recent mergers, secular instabilities, or filamentary cold flows.these processes could also trigger star formation in the host galaxy. the hostgalaxies of the legs do not show evidence for recent star formation and aninflux of cold gas, and are consistent with being powered by the accretion ofthe hot phase of the inter-stellar medium.

(b) remove point source confusion in secondaryanisotropy studies with planck and ground-based cmb data. (c) find at least1200 strongly lensed bright sub-mm sources leading to a 2% test of generalrelativity. (d) identify 200 proto-cluster regions at z of 2 and perform anunbiased study of the environmental dependence of star formation.

1008.2344	the evolution of the fundamental plane of radio galaxies from z~0.5 to  the present day	we present deep spectroscopic data for a 24-object subsample of our full41-object z~0.5 radio galaxy sample in order to investigate the evolution ofthe fundamental plane of radio galaxies. we find that the low-luminosity,fri-type, radio galaxies in our sample are consistent with the localfundamental plane of radio galaxies defined by bettoni et al. when correctedfor simple passive evolution of their stellar populations. however, we findthat the higher luminosity, frii-type radio galaxies are inconsistent with thelocal fundamental plane if only passive evolution is considered, and findevidence for a rotation in the fundamental plane at z~0.5 when compared withthe local relation. we show that neither passive evolution, nor amass-dependent evolution in the mass-to-light ratio, nor an evolution in thesize of the host galaxies can, by themselves, plausibly explain the observedtilt. however, we suggest that some combination of all three effects, with sizeevolution as the dominant factor, may be sufficient to explain the differencebetween the planes. we also find evidence for a correlation between host galaxyvelocity dispersion and radio luminosity at the 97% significance level withinour sub-sample, although further observations are required in order todetermine whether this is different for the fri and frii radio sources.assuming that the m_bh - sigma relation still holds at z~0.5, this implies thatradio luminosity scales with black hole mass, in agreement with previousstudies.

1009.5390	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared--radio correlation at z&lt;0.5	we use data from the herschel-atlas to investigate the evolution of thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5. using thetotal far-infrared luminosity of all &gt;5sigma sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field and cross-matching these data with radio data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimetres (first) survey and thenrao vla northern sky survey (nvss), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to theherschel sources. with these data we find no evidence for evolution in thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5, where themedian value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rmir}$, over this range is $q_{\rm ir} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rmir}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both thelocal value determined from {\em iras} and values derived from surveystargeting the high-redshift universe. by comparing the radio fluxes of oursample measured from both first and nvss we show that previous resultssuggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm ir}$ from high to low redshiftmay be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshiftsources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although agncontamination could still play a significant role.  we also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust isheated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formationrate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or theradio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individualgalaxies.

1010.0691	evidence for a maximum jet efficiency for the most powerful radio  galaxies	we use new mid-infrared (mid-ir) photometry from the spitzer space telescopeto study the relations between low-frequency radio luminosity density l_151mhz,mid-ir (12um rest-frame) luminosity l_12um, and optical-emission-line ([oii])luminosity l_[oii], for a complete sample of z~1 radio galaxies from the 3crr,6ce, 6c*, 7crs and toot00 surveys. the narrow redshift span of our sample(0.9&lt;z&lt;1.1) means that it is unbiased to evolutionary effects. we find evidencethat these three quantities are positively correlated. the scaling betweenl_12um and l_[oii] is similar to that seen in other agn samples, consistentwith both l_12um and l_[oii] tracing accretion rate. we show that the positivecorrelation between l_12um and l_151mhz implies that there is a genuine lack ofobjects with low values of l_12um at high values of l_151mhz. given that l_12umtraces accretion rate, while l_151mhz traces jet power, this can be understoodin terms of a minimum accretion rate being necessary to produce a given jetpower. this implies that there is a maximum efficiency with which accretedenergy can be chanelled into jet power and that this efficiency is of orderunity.

1108.0930	cosmological measurements with forthcoming radio continuum surveys	we present forecasts for constraints on cosmological models which can beobtained by forthcoming radio continuum surveys: the wide surveys with the lowfrequency array (lofar), australian square kilometre array pathfinder (askap)and the westerbork observations of the deep apertif northern sky (wodan). weuse simulated catalogues appropriate to the planned surveys to predictmeasurements obtained with the source auto-correlation, the cross-correlationbetween radio sources and cmb maps (the integrated sachs-wolfe effect), thecross-correlation of radio sources with foreground objects due to cosmicmagnification, and a joint analysis together with the cmb power spectrum andsupernovae. we show that near future radio surveys will bring complementarymeasurements to other experiments, probing different cosmological volumes, andhaving different systematics. our results show that the unprecedented skycoverage of these surveys combined should provide the most significantmeasurement yet of the integrated sachs-wolfe effect. in addition, we show thatusing the isw effect will significantly tighten constraints on modified gravityparameters, while the best measurements of dark energy models will come fromgalaxy auto-correlation function analyses. using the combination of emu andwodan to provide a full sky survey, it will be possible to measure the darkenergy parameters with an uncertainty of \{$\sigma (w_0) = 0.05$, $\sigma (w_a)= 0.12$\} and the modified gravity parameters \{$\sigma (\eta_0) = 0.10$,$\sigma (\mu_0) = 0.05$\}, assuming planck cmb+sn(current data) priors.finally, we show that radio surveys would detect a primordial non-gaussianityof $f_{\rm nl}$ = 8 at 1-$\sigma$ and we briefly discuss other promisingprobes.

1202.5330	an exponential decline at the bright end of the z=6 galaxy luminosity  function	we present the results of a search for the most luminous star-forminggalaxies at redshifts z~6 based on cfht legacy survey data. we identify asample of 40 lyman break galaxies brighter than magnitude z'=25.3 across anarea of almost 4 square degrees. sensitive spectroscopic observations of sevengalaxies provide redshifts for four, of which only two have moderate to stronglyman alpha emission lines. all four have clear continuum breaks in theirspectra. approximately half of the lyman break galaxies are spatially resolvedin 0.7 arcsec seeing images, indicating larger sizes than lower luminositygalaxies discovered with the hubble space telescope, possibly due to on-goingmergers. the stacked optical and infrared photometry is consistent with agalaxy model with stellar mass ~ 10^{10} solar masses. there is strong evidencefor substantial dust reddening with a best-fit a_v=0.7 and a_v&gt;0.48 at 2 sigmaconfidence, in contrast to the typical dust-free galaxies of lower luminosityat this epoch. the spatial extent and spectral energy distribution suggest thatthe most luminous z~6 galaxies are undergoing merger-induced starbursts. theluminosity function of z=5.9 star-forming galaxies is derived. this agrees wellwith previous work and shows strong evidence for an exponential decline at thebright end, indicating that the feedback processes which govern the shape ofthe bright end are occurring effectively at this epoch.

1204.2020	the infrared properties of sources matched in the wise all-sky and  herschel-atlas surveys	we describe the infrared properties of sources detected over ~36 deg^2 of skyin the gama 15-hr equatorial field, using data from both the herschelastrophysical terahertz large-area survey (h-atlas) and wide-field infraredsurvey (wise). with 5-sigma point-source depths of 34 and 0.048 mjy at 250micron and 3.4 micron, respectively, we are able to identify 50.6% of theh-atlas sources in the wise survey, corresponding to a surface density of ~630deg^{-2}. approximately two-thirds of these sources have measured spectroscopicor optical/near-ir photometric redshifts of z&lt;1. for sources with spectroscopicredshifts at z&lt;0.3, we find a linear correlation between the infraredluminosity at 3.4 micron and that at 250 micron, with +-50% scatter over ~1.5orders of magnitude in luminosity, ~10^9 - 10^{10.5} l_sun. by contrast, thematched sources without previously measured redshifts (r&gt;~20.5) have 250-350micron flux density ratios that suggest either high-redshift galaxies (z&gt;~1.5)or optically faint low-redshift galaxies with unusually low temperatures(t&lt;~20). their small 3.4-250 micron flux ratios favor a high-redshift galaxypopulation, as only the most actively star-forming galaxies at low redshift(e.g., arp 220) exhibit comparable flux density ratios. furthermore, we find arelatively large agn fraction (~30%) in a 12 micron flux-limited subsample ofh-atlas sources, also consistent with there being a significant population ofhigh-redshift sources in the no-redshift sample.

1205.1048	impact of redshift information on cosmological applications with  next-generation radio surveys	in this paper, we explore how the forthcoming generation of large-scale radiocontinuum surveys, with the inclusion of some degree of redshift information,can constrain cosmological parameters. by cross-matching these radio surveyswith shallow optical to near-infrared surveys, we can essentially separate thesource distribution into a low- and a high-redshift sample, thus providing aconstraint on the evolution of cosmological parameters such as those related todark energy. we examine two radio surveys, the evolutionary map of the universe(emu) and the westerbork observations of the deep apertif northern sky (wodan).a crucial advantage is their combined potential to provide a deep, full-skysurvey. the surveys used for the cross-identifications are skymapper and sdss,for the southern and northern skies, respectively. we concentrate on the galaxyclustering angular power spectrum as our benchmark observable, and find thatthe possibility of including such low redshift information yields majorimprovements in the determination of cosmological parameters. with thisapproach, and provided a good knowledge of the galaxy bias evolution, we areable to put strict constraints on the dark energy parameters, i.e.w_0=-0.9+/-0.041 and w_a=-0.24+/-0.13, with type ia supernovae and cmb priors(with a one-parameter bias in this case); this corresponds to a figure of merit(fom) &gt; 600, which is twice better than what is obtained by using only thecross-identified sources and greater than four time better than the casewithout any redshift information at all.

1206.4263	the vista deep extragalactic observations (video) survey	in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible andinfrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) deep extragalactic observations(video) survey. video is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared z,y,j,h andk_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and largestructures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from thepresent day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (agn) and the most massivegalaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. with its depth and area,video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn andstarburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters werebeginning to virialize. video therefore offers a unique data set with which toinvestigate the interplay between agn, starbursts and environment, and the roleof feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.  we provide data over the video-xmm3 tile, which also covers thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey deep-1 field (cfhtls-d1). thereleased video data reach a 5-sigma ab-magnitude depth of z=25.7, y=24.5,j=24.4, h=24.1 and k_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth ofy=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find goodastrometric agreement with the two-micron all sky survey, and source counts inagreement with the recently released ultravista survey data. the addition ofthe video data to the cfhtls-d1 optical data increases the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophicoutliers over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absenceof an i-band luminosity prior.

1301.4477	vlt/xshooter &amp; subaru/moircs spectroscopy of hudf-yd3: no evidence for  lyman-alpha emission at z=8.55	we present spectroscopic observations with vlt/xshooter and subaru/moircs ofa relatively bright y-band drop-out galaxy in the hubble ultra deep field,first selected by bunker et al. (2010), mclure et al. (2010) and bouwens et al.(2010) to be a likely z~8-9 galaxy on the basis of its colours in the hst acsand wfc3 images. this galaxy, hudf.yd3 (also known as udfy-38135539) has beentargetted for vlt/sinfoni integral field spectroscopy by lehnert et al. (2010),who published a candidate lyman-alpha emission line at z=8.55 from this source.in our independent spectroscopy using two different infrared spectrographs (5hours with vlt/xshooter and 11 hours with subaru/moircs) we are unable toreproduce this line. we do not detect any emission line at the spectral andspatial location reported in lehnert et al.

1302.2010	sample variance, source clustering and their influence on the counts of  faint radio sources	the shape of the curves defined by the counts of radio sources per unit areaas a function of their flux density was one of the earliest cosmologicalprobes. radio source counts continue to be an area of interest, used to studythe relative populations of galaxy types in the universe (as well asinvestigate any cosmological evolution in luminosity functions). they are avital consideration for determining how source confusion may limit the depth ofa radio interferometer observation, and are essential for characterisingextragalactic foregrounds in cmb experiments. there is currently no consensusas to the relative populations of the faintest (sub-mjy) source types, wherethe counts turn-up. most of the source counts in this regime are gathered frommultiple observations that each use a deep, single pointing with a radiointerferometer. these independent measurements show large amounts of scatter(factors ~ a few) that significantly exceeds their stated uncertainties. inthis article we use a simulation of the extragalactic radio continuum emissionto assess the level at which sample variance may be the cause of the scatter.we find that the scatter induced by sample variance in the simulated countsdecreases towards lower flux density bins as the raw source counts increase.the field-to-field variations are significant, and could even be the sole causeat &gt;100 {\mu}jy. we present a method for evaluating the flux density limit thata survey must reach in order to reduce the count uncertainty induced by samplevariance to a specific value. we also derive a method for correcting poissonerrors on counts in order to include the uncertainties due to the cosmologicalclustering of sources. an empirical constraint on the effect of sample varianceat these low luminosities is unlikely to arise until the completion of newlarge-scale surveys with next-generation radio telescopes.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1305.1305	evolution of star formation in the ukidss ultra deep survey field - i.  luminosity functions and cosmic star formation rate out to z=1.6	we present new results on the cosmic star formation history in the sxds-udsfield out to z=1.6. we compile narrow-band data from the subaru telescope andthe visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) in conjunctionwith broad-band data from the sxds and uds, to make a selection of 5725emission-line galaxies in 12 redshift slices, spanning 10 gyr of cosmic time.we determine photometric redshifts for the sample using 11-band photometry, anduse a spectroscopically confirmed subset to fine tune the resultant redshiftdistribution. we use the maximum-likelihood technique to determine luminosityfunctions in each redshift slice and model the selection effects inherent inany narrow-band selection statistically, to obviate the retrospectivecorrections ordinarily required. the deep narrow-band data are sensitive tovery low star formation rates (sfrs), and allow an accurate evaluation of thefaint end slope of the schechter function, alpha. we find that alpha isparticularly sensitive to the assumed faintest broadband magnitude of a galaxycapable of hosting an emission line, and propose that this limit should beempirically motivated. for this analysis we base our threshold on the limitingobserved equivalent widths of emission lines in the local universe. we computethe characteristic sfr of galaxies in each redshift slice, and the integratedsfr density, rho_{sfr}. we find our results to be in good agreement with theliterature and parametrize the evolution of the sfr density as rho_{sfr}proportional to (1 + z)^{4.58} confirming a steep decline in star formationactivity since z = 1.6.

1401.1648	the star-formation history of mass-selected galaxies from the video  survey	we measure star-formation rates (sfrs) and specific sfrs (ssfrs) ofks-selected galaxies from the video survey by stacking 1.4-ghz very large arraydata. we split the sample, which spans 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 and stellar masses 10**8.0 &lt;mstellar/msol &lt; 10**11.5, into elliptical, irregular or starburst galaxiesbased on their spectral-energy distributions. we find that ssfr falls withstellar mass, in agreement with the `downsizing' paradigm. we consider thedependence of the ssfr-mass slope on redshift: for our full and ellipticalsamples the slope flattens, but for the irregular and starburst samples theslope is independent of redshift. the rate of ssfr evolution reduces slightlywith stellar mass for ellipticals, but irregulars and starbursts co-evolveacross stellar masses.  our results for ssfr as a function of stellar mass and redshift are inagreement with those derived from other radio-stacking measurements ofmass-selected passive and star-forming galaxies, but inconsistent with thosegenerated from semi-analytic models, which tend to underestimate sfrs andssfrs. there is a need for deeper high-resolution radio surveys such as thosefrom telescopes like the next-generation meerkat in order to probe lower massesat earlier times and to permit direct detections, i.e. to study individualgalaxies in detail.

1401.4018	a jvla 10~degree^2 deep survey	(abridged)one of the fundamental challenges for astrophysics in the 21stcentury is finding a way to untangle the physical processes that govern galaxyformation and evolution. given the importance and scope of this problem, themulti-wavelength astronomical community has used the past decade to build up awealth of information over specific extragalactic deep fields to address keyquestions in galaxy formation and evolution. these fields generally cover atleast 10square degrees to facilitate the investigation of the rarest, typicallymost massive, galaxies and agn. furthermore, such areal coverage allows theenvironments to be fully accounted for, thereby linking the single halo to thetwo-halo terms in the halo occupation distribution. surveys at radiowavelengths have begun to lag behind those at other wavelengths, especially inthis medium-deep survey tier. however, the survey speed offered by the jvlameans that we can now reach a point where we can begin to obtain commensuratedata at radio wavelengths to those which already exists from the x-ray throughto the far-infrared over ~10 square degrees.  we therefore present the case for a 10 square degree survey to 1.5ujy atl-band in a or b array, requiring ~4000 hours to provide census ofstar-formation and agn-accretion activity in the universe. for example, theobservations will allow galaxies forming stars at 10msolar/yr to be detectedout to z~1 and luminous infrared galaxies (1000msolar/yr to be found out toz~6. furthermore, the survey area ensures that we will have enough cosmicvolume to find these rare sources at all epochs. the bandwidth will allow us todetermine the polarisation properties galaxies in the high-redshift universe asa function of stellar mass, morphology and redshift.

1402.2290	radio galaxy populations and the multi-tracer technique: pushing the  limits on primordial non-gaussianity	we explore the use of different radio galaxy populations as tracers ofdifferent mass halos and therefore, with different bias properties, toconstrain primordial non-gaussianity of the local type. we perform a fishermatrix analysis based on the predicted auto and cross angular power spectra ofthese populations, using simulated redshift distributions as a function ofdetection flux and the evolution of the bias for the different galaxy types(star forming galaxies, starburst galaxies, radio-quiet quasars, fri and friiagn galaxies). we show that such a multi-tracer analysis greatly improves theinformation on non-gaussianity by drastically reducing the cosmic variancecontribution to the overall error budget. by using this method applied tofuture surveys, we predict a constraint of sigma_fnl=3.6 on the localnon-gaussian parameter for a galaxy detection flux limit of 10 \mujy andsigma_fnl=2.2 for 1 \mujy. we show that this significantly improves on theconstraints obtained when using the whole undifferentiated populations(sigma_fnl=48 for 10 \mujy and sigma_fnl=12 for 1 \mujy). we conclude thatcontinuum radio surveys alone have the potential to constrain primordialnon-gaussianity to an accuracy at least a factor of two better than the presentconstraints obtained with planck data on the cmb bispectrum, opening a windowto obtain sigma_fnl~1 with the square kilometer array.

1503.02493	far beyond stacking: fully bayesian constraints on sub-microjy radio  source populations over the xmm-lss-video field	measuring radio source counts is critical for characterizing newextragalactic populations, brings a wealth of science within reach and willinform forecasts for ska and its pathfinders. yet there is currently greatdebate (and few measurements) about the behaviour of the 1.4-ghz counts in themicrojy regime. one way to push the counts to these levels is via 'stacking',the covariance of a map with a catalogue at higher resolution and (often) adifferent wavelength. for the first time, we cast stacking in a fully bayesianframework, applying it to (i) the skads simulation and (ii) vla data stacked atthe positions of sources from the video survey. in the former case, thealgorithm recovers the counts correctly when applied to the catalogue, but isbiased high when confusion comes into play. this needs to be accounted for inthe analysis of data from any relatively-low-resolution ska pathfinders. forthe latter case, the observed radio source counts remain flat below the 5-sigmalevel of 85 microjy as far as 40 microjy, then fall off earlier than the fluxhinted at by the skads simulations and a recent p(d) analysis (which is theonly other measurement from the literature at these flux-density levels, itselfextrapolated in frequency). division into galaxy type via spectral-energydistribution reveals that normal spiral galaxies dominate the counts at thesefluxes.

1505.05489	a sparse gaussian process framework for photometric redshift estimation	accurate photometric redshifts are a lynchpin for many future experiments topin down the cosmological model and for studies of galaxy evolution. in thisstudy, a novel sparse regression framework for photometric redshift estimationis presented. simulated and real data from sdss dr12 were used to train andtest the proposed models. we show that approaches which include careful datapreparation and model design offer a significant improvement in comparison withseveral competing machine learning algorithms. standard implementations of mostregression algorithms have as the objective the minimization of the sum ofsquared errors. for redshift inference, however, this induces a bias in theposterior mean of the output distribution, which can be problematic. in thispaper we directly target minimizing $\delta z = (z_\textrm{s} -z_\textrm{p})/(1+z_\textrm{s})$ and address the bias problem via adistribution-based weighting scheme, incorporated as part of the optimizationobjective. the results are compared with other machine learning algorithms inthe field such as artificial neural networks (ann), gaussian processes (gps)and sparse gps. the proposed framework reaches a mean absolute $\delta z =0.0026(1+z_\textrm{s})$, over the redshift range of $0 \le z_\textrm{s} \le 2$on the simulated data, and $\delta z = 0.0178(1+z_\textrm{s})$ over the entireredshift range on the sdss dr12 survey, outperforming the standard annz used inthe literature. we also investigate how the relative size of the training setaffects the photometric redshift accuracy. we find that a training set of\textgreater 30 per cent of total sample size, provides little additionalconstraint on the photometric redshifts, and note that our gp formalismstrongly outperforms annz in the sparse data regime for the simulated data set.

1508.01033	the link between accretion mode and environment in radio-loud active  galaxies	the interactions between radio-loud agn and their environments play animportant role in galaxy and cluster evolution. recent work has demonstratedfundamental differences between high and low excitation radio galaxies (hergsand lergs), and shown that they may have different relationships with theirenvironments. in the chandra large project era (environments of radio-loudagn), we made the first systematic x-ray environmental study of the clusterenvironments of radio galaxies at a single epoch (z~0.5), and found tentativeevidence for a correlation between radio luminosity and cluster x-rayluminosity. we also found that this relationship appeared to be driven by thelerg sub-population (ineson et al. 2013).  we have now repeated the analysis with a low redshift sample (z~0.1), andfound strong correlations between radio luminosity and environment richness andbetween radio luminosity and central density for the lergs but not for thehergs. these results are consistent with models in which the hergs are fuelledfrom accretion discs maintained from local reservoirs of gas, while lergs arefuelled more directly by gas ingested from the intra-cluster medium.  comparing the samples, we found that although the maximum environmentrichness of the herg environments is similar in both samples, there are poorerherg environments in the z~0.1 sample than in the z~0.5 sample. we havetherefore tentative evidence of evolution of the herg environments. we found nodifferences between the lerg sub-samples for the two epochs, as would beexpected if radio and cluster luminosity are related.

astro-ph;0006081	on the redshift cut-off for flat-spectrum radio sources	we use data from the parkes half-jansky flat-spectrum (phjfs) sample(drinkwater et al. 1997) to constrain the cosmic evolution in the co-movingspace density of radio sources in the top decade of the flat-spectrum radioluminosity function (rlf). a consistent picture for the high-redshift evolutionis achieved using both simple parametric models, which are the first to allowfor distributions in both radio luminosity and spectral index, and variants ofthe v / v_max test, some of which incorporate the effects of radio spectralcurvature. for the most luminous flat-spectrum objects, the phjfs sample isextremely similar to that used by shaver et al. (1996, 1998) to argue for anabrupt `redshift cut-off': a decrease by a factor ~30 in space density betweena peak redshift z~2.5 and z~5. our analysis finds that the observable co-movingvolume is too small to make definitive statements about any redshift cut-offfor the most luminous flat-spectrum sources, although both constant-spacedensity (no cut-off) models and models with cut-offs as abrupt as thoseenvisaged by shaver et al. are outside the 90% confidence region. the inferencethat the decline in space density is most likely to be gradual, by a factor ~4between z~2.5 and z~5, is in accordance with previous work on the rlf by dunlop&amp; peacock (1990), but different to the abrupt decline favoured by studies ofoptically-selected quasars. dust obscuration provides one explanation for thisdifference. we show that a significant fraction of the most radio-luminousflat-spectrum objects are giga-hertz peaked spectrum (gps) rather thandoppler-boosted (db) sources, complicating any interpretation of the redshiftcut-off.

astro-ph;0106130	a sample of 6c radio sources designed to find objects at redshift &gt; 4:  iii --- imaging and the radio galaxy k-z relation	in this paper, the third and final of a series, we present complete k-bandimaging and some complementary i-band imaging of the filtered 6c* sample. wefind no systematic differences between the k-z relation of 6c* radio galaxiesand those from complete samples, so the near-infrared properties of luminousradio galaxies are not obviously biased by the additional 6c* radio selectioncriteria (steep spectral index and small angular size). the 6c* k-z datasignificantly improve delineation of the k-z relation for radio galaxies athigh-redshift (z &gt;2). accounting for non-stellar contamination, and forcorrelations between radio luminosity and stellar mass, we find little supportfor previous claims that the underlying scatter in the stellar luminosity ofradio galaxies increases significantly at z &gt;2. in a particular spatially-flatuniverse with a cosmological constant, the most luminous radio sources appearto be associated with galaxies with a luminosity distribution with a high mean(~5 lstar), and a low dispersion (sigma ~ 0.5 mag) which formed their stars atepochs corresponding to z &gt;~2.5. this result is in line with recent sub-mmstudies of high-redshift radio galaxies and the inferred ages of extremely redobjects from faint radio samples.

astro-ph;0106473	on the redshift cut-off for steep-spectrum radio sources	we use three samples (3crr, 6ce and 6c*) selected at low radio frequency toconstrain the cosmic evolution in the radio luminosity function (rlf) for the`most luminous' steep-spectrum radio sources. although intrinsically rare, suchsources give the largest possible baseline in redshift for the completeflux-density-limited samples currently available. using parametric models todescribe the rlf which incorporate distributions in radio spectral shape andlinear size as well as the usual luminosity and redshift, we find that the dataare consistent with a constant comoving space density between z~2.5 and z~4.5.we find this model is favoured over a model with similar evolutionary behaviourto that of optically-selected quasars (i.e. a roughly gaussian distribution inredshift) with a probability ratio of ~25:1 and ~100:1 for spatially-flatcosmologies with omega_lambda = 0 and omega_lambda = 0.7 respectively. withinthe uncertainties, this evolutionary behaviour may be reconciled with theshallow decline preferred for the comoving space density of flat-spectrumsources by dunlop &amp; peacock (1990) and jarvis &amp; rawlings (2000), in line withthe expectations of unified schemes.

astro-ph;0208390	on the black-hole mass -- radio luminosity relation for flat-spectrum  radio-loud quasars	a new analysis of the connection between black-hole mass and radio luminosityin radio-selected flat-spectrum quasars (fsq) is presented. in contrast torecent claims in the literature, we find no evidence that the black-hole massesof radio-selected fsq are systematically lower that those of luminousoptically-selected radio-loud quasars. the black-hole masses of the fsq areestimated via the virial black-hole mass estimator which utilizes theline-width of the h$\beta$ emission line as a tracer of the centralgravitational potential. by correcting for the inevitable effects ofinclination, incurred due to the fsq being viewed close to the line of sight,we find that the black-hole masses of the fsq with intrinsically powerful radiojets are confined, virtually exclusively, to m_bh &gt; 10^8 m_solar. this is ingood agreement with previous studies of optically selected fsq andsteep-spectrum radio-loud quasars.  finally, following the application of a realistic doppler boostingcorrection, we find that the fsq occupy a wide range in intrinsic radioluminosity, and that many sources would be more accurately classified asradio-intermediate or radio-quiet quasars. this range in radio luminositysuggests that the fsq are fully consistent with an upper boundary on radiopower of the form l_5ghz \propto m_bh^2.5.

astro-ph;0209439	near-infrared imaging and the k-z relation for radio galaxies in the 7c  redshift survey	we present k-band imaging of all 49 radio galaxies in the 7c-i and 7c-iiregions of the 7c redshift survey (7crs). the low-frequency (151 mhz) selected7crs sample contains all sources with flux-densities s_151 &gt; 0.5 jy in threeregions of the sky. we combine the k-band magnitudes of the 7crs radio galaxieswith those from the 3crr, 6ce and 6c* samples to investigate the nature of therelationship between k-magnitude and redshift and whether there is anydependence upon radio luminosity. we find that radio galaxies appear to belongto a homogeneous population which formed the bulk of their stars at highredshifts (z_f&gt;5) and evolved passively from then until they reach a meanpresent-day luminosity of 3l*. we find a significant difference between thek-magnitudes of the 7crs and 3crr radio galaxies with the 7crs galaxies being\~0.55 mag fainter at all redshifts. the cause of this weak correlation betweenstellar and radio luminosities probably lies in mutual correlations of theseproperties with the central black hole mass. we compare the evolution-correctedhost luminosities at a constant radio luminosity and find that the typical hostluminosity (mass) increases by approximately 1l* from z~2 to z~0.5 which,although a much smaller factor than predicted by semi-analytic models of galaxyformation, is in line with results on optically-selected quasars. our study hastherefore revealed that the small dispersion in stellar luminosity of radiogalaxies around 3l* includes subtle but significant differences between thehost galaxies of extreme- and moderate-power radio sources at fixed redshift,and between those of high- and low-redshift radio sources at fixed radioluminosity.

astro-ph;0303062	a 3x10^9 solar mass black hole in the quasar sdss j1148+5251 at z=6.41	we present near-infrared h and k-band spectra of the z=6.41 quasar sdssj114816.64+525150.3. the spectrum reveals a broad mgii 2799 emission line witha full-width half-maximium of 6000 km/s. from the peak wavelength of thisemission line we obtain a more accurate redshift than is possible from thepublished optical spectrum and determine a redshift of z=6.41+/-0.01. if thetrue peak of the lyman alpha emission is at the same redshift, then a largefraction of the flux blueward of the peak is absorbed. the equivalent width ofthe mgii emission line is similar to that of lower redshift quasars, suggestingthat the uv continuum is not dominated by a beamed component. making basicassumptions about the line-emitting gas we derive an estimate for the centralblack hole in this quasar of 3x10^9 solar masses. the very high luminosity ofthe quasar shows that it is accreting at the maximal allowable rate for a blackhole of this mass adopting the eddington limit criterion.

astro-ph;0403106	a sample of radio galaxies spanning three decades in radio luminosity -  i. the host-galaxy properties and black-hole masses	the results of analysis of hst i-band imaging of a sample of 41 radiogalaxies spanning three orders of magnitude in radio luminosity at redshiftz~0.5 are presented. the full sample is drawn from four complete, low-frequencyselected radio samples with progressively fainter flux-density limits (3crr,6ce, 7crs and the new texox-1000 sample). modelling of the hst imaging datashows that the host galaxies have surface-brightness distributions consistentwith those expected for classic ellipticals (sersic parameter, beta~0.25), withbeta in the range 0.17&lt;beta&lt;0.30, and a mean of &lt;beta&gt;=0.23\pm0.01. thehost-galaxy luminosities are comparable with those of galaxies drawn from thebright end of the local cluster galaxy luminosity function, spanning the range0.7l^{\star}&lt;l&lt;10l^{\star}, with a mean of 3.2\pm0.3 l^{\star}. in addition,the radio galaxies are shown to follow a kormendy relation indistinguishablefrom that of powerful low-redshift radio galaxies. combining our new resultswith those in the literature it is found that the scalelengths and kormendyrelations of 3c-class radio galaxies do not vary significantly over theredshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.8, providing no evidence for dynamical evolution of thisclass of host galaxy within this redshift interval. converting the host-galaxyluminosities into black-hole mass estimates predicts that the radio galaxiesharbour central black holes with masses in the range 10^{8.1}\msun &lt;m_{bh}&lt;10^{9.5}\msun, with a geometric mean of &lt;m_{bh}&gt;=10^{8.87\pm 0.04}\msun.finally, a significant (~3 sigma) correlation is found between black-hole massand 151-mhz radio luminosity for those objects in the sample with eitherhigh-excitation nuclear spectra or classical double radio structures.(abridged)

astro-ph;0408082	near-infrared k-band imaging of a sample of ultra-steep-spectrum radio  sources selected at 74 mhz	in this paper we present near-infrared k-band imaging of a sample ofultra-steep spectrum (uss) radio sources selected at 74 mhz. the dual selectioncriteria of low frequency and uss means that we should be sensitive to thehighest redshift (z &gt; 5) radio galaxies. we have obtained $k-$band magnitudesfor all of the objects in our sample of 26 and discuss the properties of each.  there is a pronounced bias in this sample towards fainter magnitudes and thushigher redshifts when compared to complete unfiltered samples such as 7crs(willott et al. 2002), implying that the steep-spectrum technique is stillviable at 74 mhz. however, there are more bright (k &lt; 17) sources in the 74 mhzsample than in a similar sample selected at 151 mhz, namely 6c*. this isprincipally due to the additional selection criterion of a small angular sizefor the radio sources in 6c*, four of the six sources in the 74 mhz uss samplewith k &lt; 17 have angular sizes &gt; 15 arcsec (the angular size cutoff of 6c*).  we find that the distribution of k-band magnitudes from a sample selected at74 mhz is statistically indistinguishable from the 6c* sample, when similarangular size filtering is applied to the 74 mhz sample.

astro-ph;0412600	the discovery of a type-ii quasar at z = 1.65 with integral-field  spectroscopy	in this letter we report the serendipitous discovery of a genuine type-iiquasar at z = 1.65 using integral-field data from vimos on the vlt. this is thefirst discovery of a type-ii quasar at z &gt; 1 from optical data alone.j094531-242831, hereafter j0945-2428, exhibits strong narrow (v &lt; 1500km/s)emission lines, has a resolved host galaxy, and is undetected to a radioflux-density limit of s_{5ghz} = 0.15 mjy (3 sigma). all of these lead us tobelieve that j0945-2428 is a bona fide type-ii quasar.  the luminosity of the narrow-emission lines in this object suggest that theintrinsic power of the central engine is similar to that found in powerfulradio galaxies, indicative of similarly large supermassive black hole of ~3 x10^8 m_solar (assuming that it is accreting at its eddington limit). however,from near-infrared imaging observations we find that the old stellar populationin the host galaxy has a luminosity of ~0.2 l*, mildly inconsistent with thecorrelation between black-hole mass and bulge luminosity found locally,although the uncertainty in the black-hole mass estimate is large.  this discovery highlights the power that integral-field units have indiscovering hidden populations of objects, particularly the sought aftertype-ii quasars which are invoked to explain the hard x-ray background. assuch, future large integral-field surveys could open up a new window on theobscured accretion activity in the universe.

astro-ph;0502409	the luminosity function of ly-alpha emitters at 2.3 &lt; z &lt; 4.6 from  integral-field spectroscopy	we have used visible multiobject spectrograph integral-field unit (vimos-ifu)observations centred on a radio galaxy at z=2.9 to search for ly-alpha emitterswithin a comoving volume of ~ 10^4 mpc^3. we find 14 ly-alpha emitters withflux &gt; 1.4 x 10^-20 wm^-2, yielding a comoving space density of 0.0018 +/-0.0006 mpc^-3. we fit a schechter luminosity function which agrees well withprevious studies both at similar redshift (z ~ 3.4) and higher redshift (z ~5.7). we therefore find no evidence for evolution in the properties of ly-alphaemitters between 3 &lt; z &lt; 6, although our sample is small. by summing thestar-formation rates of the individual ly-alpha emitters we find a total cosmicstar-formation rate density of rho_sfr = 6.7 +/- 0.5 x 10^-3 m_solar yr^-1mpc^-3. integrating over the luminosity function for the combined ly-alphasurveys at z ~ 3.4 and accounting for the difference in obscuration between thely-alpha line and the uv-continuum yields an estimate of rho_sfr ~ 2.2 x 10^-2m_solar yr^-1 mpc^-3, in line with previous multi-colour and narrow-bandsurveys of high-redshift star-forming galaxies.  the detection of high-redshift emission-line galaxies in our volumetricsearch shows that the unique capabilities of wide-field integral-fieldspectroscopy are well suited in searching for high-redshift galaxies in arelatively unbiased manner.

astro-ph;0503202	imaging of sdss z&gt;6 quasar fields: gravitational lensing, companion  galaxies and the host dark matter halos	we have undertaken deep optical imaging observations of three 6.2&lt;z&lt;6.5quasar fields in the i' and z' filters. these data are used to search forforeground galaxies which are gravitationally lensing the quasars and distantgalaxies physically associated with the quasars. foreground galaxies are foundcloser than 5 arcsec from the lines-of-sight of two of the three quasars.however, the faintness of these galaxies suggests they have fairly low massesand provide only weak magnifications (mu&lt;1.1). no convincing galaxiesphysically associated with the quasars are found and the number of i'-banddropouts is consistent with that found in random fields. we consider theexpected dark matter halo masses which host these quasars under the assumptionthat a correlation between black hole mass and dark matter halo mass exists. weshow that the steepness of the high-mass tail of the halo mass function at thisredshift, combined with realistic amounts of scatter in this correlation, leadto expected halo masses substantially lower than previously believed. thisanalysis can explain the lack of companion galaxies found here and the lowdynamical mass recently published for one of the quasars.

astro-ph;0603231	orientation dependency of broad-line widths in quasars and consequences  for black-hole mass estimation	in this paper we report new evidence that measurements of the broad-linewidths in quasars are dependent on the source orientation, consistent with theidea that the broad-line region is flattened or disc-like. this reinforces theview derived from radio-selected samples, where the radio-core dominance hasbeen used as a measure of orientation. the results presented here show a highlysignificant (&gt;99.95%) correlation between radio spectral index (which we use asa proxy for source orientation) and broad-line width derived from the h-betaand mgii emission lines. this is the first time that this type of study hasused quasars derived from a large optically selected quasar sample, where theradio-loud quasars (rlqs) and radio-quiet quasars (rqqs) have indistinguishabledistributions in redshift, bolometric luminosity and colour, and thereforeovercomes any biases which may be present in only selecting via radio emission.we find that the mean fwhm for the flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (fsqs) tobe &lt;fwhm(fsq)&gt;= 4990 +/- 536km/s, which differs significant from the mean fwhmof the steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars (ssqs), where &lt;fwhm(ssq)&gt;=6464 +/-506km/s. we also find that the distribution in fwhm for the fsqs isindistinguishable from that of the radio-quiet quasars (rqqs), where&lt;fwhm(rqq)&gt;= 4831 +/-25km/s. considering other observational results in theliterature we interpret this result in the context of a significant fraction ofthe fsqs being derived from the underlying rqq population which have theirradio flux doppler boosted above the rlq/rqq divide. under the assumption of adisc-like broad-line region we find no evidence for a difference in the averageline-of-sight angle for rqqs and rlqs, implying that the difference is due toblack-hole mass.

astro-ph;9910422	the hyperluminous infrared quasar 3c 318 and its implications for  interpreting sub-mm detections of high-redshift radio galaxies	we present near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging of the compact steep-spectrum radio source 3c 318 which shows it to be a quasar at redshift z=1.574(the z=0.752 value previously reported is incorrect). 3c 318 is an iras, isoand scuba source so its new redshift makes it the most intrinsically luminousfar-infrared (fir) source in the 3c catalogue (there is no evidence of stronggravitational lensing effects). its bolometric luminosity greatly exceeds the10^13 solar luminosity level above which an object is said to be hyperluminous.its spectral energy distribution (sed) requires that the quasar heats the dustresponsible for the fir flux, as is believed to be the case in otherhyperluminous galaxies, and contributes (at the &gt;10% level) to the heating ofthe dust responsible for the sub-mm emission. we cannot determine whether astarburst makes an important contribution to the heating of the coolest dust,so evidence for a high star-formation rate (sfr) is circumstantial being basedon the high dust mass required by its sub-mm detection. we show that thecurrent sub-mm and fir data available for high-z radio galaxies are consistentwith seds similar to that of 3c 318. this indicates that at least some of thispopulation may be detected in the sub-mm because of dust heated by the quasarnucleus, and that interpreting sub-mm detection as evidence for very high sfrsmay not always be valid. we show that the 3c318 quasar is slightly reddened(a(v) ~ 0.5), the most likely cause of which is smc-type dust in the hostgalaxy. if very distant radio galaxies are reddened in a similar way then weshow that only slightly greater amounts of dust could obscure the quasars inthese sources, thus explaining the low fraction of quasars amongst the veryhigh redshift (z &gt; 3) objects in low-frequency radio-selected samples.
