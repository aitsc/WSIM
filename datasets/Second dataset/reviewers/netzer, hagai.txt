0907.1654	dusty structure around type-i active galactic nuclei: clumpy torus  narrow line region and near-nucleus hot dust	we fitted spitzer/irs ~2-35 um spectra of 26 luminous qsos in attempt todefine the main emission components. our model has three major components: aclumpy torus, dusty narrow line region (nlr) clouds and a blackbody-like dust.the models utilize the clumpy torus of nenkova et al. (2008) and are the firstto allow its consistent check in type-i agns. single torus models and combinedtorus-nlr models fail to fit the spectra of most sources but three componentmodels adequately fit the spectra of all sources. we present torus inclination,cloud distribution, covering factor and torus mass for all sources and comparethem with bolometric luminosity, black hole mass and accretion rate. the toruscovering factor and mass are found to be correlated with the bolometricluminosity of the sources. we find that a substantial amount of the ~2-7 umradiation originates from a hot dust component, which likely situated in theinnermost part of the torus. the luminosity radiated by this component and itscovering factor are comparable to those of the torus. we quantify the emissionby the nlr clouds and estimate their distance from the center. the distancesare ~700 times larger than the dust sublimation radius and the nlr coveringfactor is about 0.07. the total covering factor by all components is in goodagreement with the known agn type-i:type-ii ratio.

0907.3575	accretion and star formation rates in low redshift type-ii active  galactic nuclei	accretion and star formation (sf) rates in low redshift sdss type-ii activegalactic nuclei (agn) are critically evaluated. comparison with photoionizationmodels indicates that bolometric luminosity (lbol) estimates based on l(oiii5007a) severely underestimate lbol in low ionization sources such as liners. analternative method based on l(hb) is less sensitive to ionization level and anovel method, based on a combination of l(oiii 5007a) and l(oi 6300a), iserhaps the best. using this method i show that low ionization agn are accretingfaster than assumed until now. significant related other findings are: 1. anytype-ii agn property related to the black hole (bh) mass is more reliablyobtained by removing blue galaxies from the sample. 2. seyfert 2s and liner 2sform a continuous sequence of l/ledd with no indication for a change inaccretion mechanism, or mode of mass supply. there are very few, if any, linersin all type-i samples which results in a much arrower l/ledd distributioncompared with type-ii samples. 3. there is a strong correlation between sfluminosity, lsf, and lbol over more than five orders of magnitude inluminosity. this leads to a simple relationship between bulge and bh growthrates, g(bulge)/g(bh) propto lbol^(-0.2), where g(bulge)/g(bh) = 115 forlbol=10^42 erg/sec. seyfert 2s and liner 2s follow the same lsf-lbolcorrelation for all sources with a stellar age indicator, d4000, smaller than1.8. this suggests that a similar fraction of sf gas finds its way to thecenter in all agn. 4. lbol, lsf, l/ledd and the specific sf rate follow d4000in a similar way.

1005.2408	the evolution of m_*/m_bh between z=2 and z=0	we propose a novel method to estimate m_*/m_bh, the ratio of stellar mass(m_*) to black hole mass (m_bh), at various redshifts using two recentobservational results: the correlation between the bolometric luminosity ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) and the star formation rate (sfr) in their hostgalaxies, and the correlation between sfr and m_* in star-forming (sf)galaxies. our analysis is based on m_bh and l_bol measurements in two largesamples of type-i agn at z~1 and z~2, and the measurements of m_*/m_bh in0.05&lt;z&lt;0.2 red galaxies. we find that m_*/m_bh depends on m_bh at allredshifts. at z~2, m_*/m_bh 280 and ~40 for m_bh=10^8 and m_bh=10^9 m_sol,respectively. m_*/m_bh grows by a factor of ~4-8 from z~2 to z~0 with extremecases that are as large as 10-20. the evolution is steeper than reported inother studies, probably because we treat only agn in sf hosts. we caution thatestimates of m_*/m_bh evolution which ignore the dependence of this ratio onm_bh can lead to erroneous conclusions.

1006.3553	the effect of radiation pressure on emission line profiles and black  hole mass determination in active galactic nuclei	we present a new analysis of the motion of broad line region (blr) clouds inactive galactic nuclei (agns) taking into account the combined influence ofgravity and radiation pressure force. we calculate cloud orbits under a largerange of conditions and include the effect of a changing column density as afunction of location. the dependence of radiation pressure force on the levelof ionization and the column density are accurately computed. the main resultsare: a. the mean cloud location r(blr) and the line widths (fwhms) are combinedin such a way that the simple virial mass estimate, r{blr} fwhm^2/g, gives areasonable approximation to the black hole mass m even when radiation pressureforce is important. the reason is that l/m rather than l is the main parameteraffecting the planar cloud motion. b. reproducing the observed mean radius,fwhm and intensity of h-beta and civ 1549 requires at least two differentpopulations of clouds. c. the cloud location is a function of both l^{1/2} andl/m. given this we suggest a new approximation for r(blr) which, when insertedinto the bh mass equation, results in a new approximation for m. the newexpression involves l^{1/2}, fwhm and two constants that are obtained from acomparison with available m-sigma mass estimates. it deviates only slightlyfrom the old mass estimate at all luminosities. d. the quality of present blackhole mass estimators depends, critically, on the way the present m-sigma agnsample (16 objects) represents the agn population, in particular thedistribution of eddington ratios.

0708.3787	black-hole mass and growth rate at high redshift	we present new h and k bands spectroscopy of 15 high luminosity activegalactic nuclei (agns) at redshifts 2.3-3.4 obtained on gemini south. wecombined the data with spectra of additional 29 high-luminosity sources toobtain a sample with 10^{45.2}&lt;\lambda l_{\lambda}(5100a)&lt;10^{47.3} ergs/secand black hole (bh) mass range, using reverberation mapping relationships basedon the h_beta method, of 10^{8.8}-10^{10.7} m_sun. we do not find a correlationof l/l_edd with m_bh but find a correlation with \lambda l_{\lambda}(5100a)which might be due to selection effects. the l/l_edd distribution is broad andcovers the range ~0.07-1.6, similar to what is observed in lower redshift,lower luminosity agns. we suggest that this consistently measured andcalibrated sample gives the best representation of l/l_edd at those redshiftsand note potential discrepancies with recent theoretical and observationalstudies. the lower accretion rates are not in accord with growth scenarios forbhs at such redshifts and the growth times of many of the sources are longerthan the age of the universe at the corresponding epochs. this suggests earlierepisodes of faster growth at z&gt;~3 for those sources. the use of the c iv methodgives considerably different results and a larger scatter; this method seems tobe a poor m_bh and l/l_edd estimator at very high luminosity.

1012.1871	black-hole mass and growth rate at z~4.8: a short episode of fast growth  followed by short duty cycle activity	we present new gemini-north/niri and vlt/sinfoni h-band spectroscopy for aflux limited sample of 40 z~4.8 active galactic nuclei, selected from the sloandigital sky survey. the sample probably contains the most massive active blackholes (bhs) at this redshift and spans a broad range in bolometric luminosity,2.7x10^46&lt; l_bol &lt; 2.4x10^47 erg/sec. the high-quality observations and theaccurate fitting of the mgii(2800a) line, enable us to study, systematically,the distribution of bh mass (m_bh) and normalized accretion rate (l/l_edd) atz~4.8. we find that 10^8 &lt; m_bh &lt; 6.6x10^9 m_sun, with a median of ~8.4x10^8m_sun. we also find that 0.2 &lt; l/l_edd &lt; 3.9 with a median of ~0.6. most ofthese sources had enough time to grow to their observed mass at z~4.8 fromz=20, assuming a range of seed bh masses, with ~40% that are small enough to bestellar remnants. compared to previously studied samples at z~2.4 and 3.3, themasses of the z~4.8 bhs are typically lower by ~0.5 dex. and their l/l_edd ishigher by a similar factor. the new z~4.8 sample can be considered as theprogenitor population of the most massive bhs at z~2.4 and 3.3. such anevolutionary interpretation requires that the growth of the bhs from z~4.8 toz~3.3 and z~2.4 proceeds with short duty cycles, of about 10-20%, depending onthe particular growth scenario.

1110.5326	hot graphite dust and the infrared spectral energy distribution of  active galactic nuclei	we present a detailed investigation of the near-to-far infrared (ir) spectralenergy distribution (sed) of a large sample of spitzer-observed active galacticnuclei (agn). we fitted the spectra of 51 narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies(nls1s) and 64 broad line seyfert 1 galaxies (bls1s) using a three componentmodel: a clumpy torus, a dusty narrow line region (nlr) and hot pure-graphitedust located in the outer part of the broad line region (blr). the fitting isperformed on star formation (sf) subtracted seds using sf templates that takeinto account the entire range of possible host galaxy properties. we find thatthe mid-ir intrinsic emission of nls1s and bls1s are very similar, regardlessof the agn luminosity, with long wavelength downturn at around 20-25 um. wepresent a detailed model of the hot dust component that takes into account thedistribution of dust temperature within the clouds and their emission linespectrum. the hot dust continuum provides a very good fit to the observednear-ir continuum spectrum. most line emission in this component isdramatically suppressed, except mgii(2798a) and hei lines that are stillcontributing significantly to the total blr spectrum. we calculate the coveringfactors of all the agn components and show that the covering factor of thehot-dust clouds is about 0.15-0.35, similar to the covering factor of thetorus, and is anti-correlated with the source luminosity and the normalizedaccretion rate.

1201.3792	star formation in liner host galaxies at z~0.3	we present the results of a herschel-pacs study of a sample of 97 liners atredshift z\sim 0.3 selected from the zcosmos survey. of these sources, 34 aredetected in a least one pacs band, enabling reliable estimates of thefar-infrared l(fir) luminosities, and a comparison to the fir luminosities oflocal liners. many of our pacs-detected liners are also uv sources detected bygalex. assuming that the fir is produced in young dusty star-forming regions,the typical star-formation rates (sfrs) for the host galaxies in our sample is\sim 10 m_sun yr-1, 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than in many local liners.given stellar masses inferred from optical/nir photometry of the (unobscured)evolved stellar populations, we find that the entire sample lies close to thestar-forming "main sequence" for galaxies at redshift 0.3. for youngstar-forming regions, the h\alpha- and uv-based estimates of the sfrs are muchsmaller than the fir-based estimates, by factors \sim 30, even assuming thatall of the h\alpha\ emission is produced by o-star ionization rather than bythe agns. these discrepancies may be due to large (and uncertain) extinctionstowards the young stellar systems. alternatively, the h\alpha\ and uv emissionscould be tracing residual star-formation in an older less obscured populationwith decaying star formation. we also compare l(sf) and l(agn) in local linersand in our sample and comment on the problematic use of several line diagnosticdiagrams in cases similar to the sample under study.

1203.1613	extreme star formation in the host galaxies of the fastest growing  super-massive black holes at z=4.8	we report new herschel observations of 25 z=4.8 extremely luminous opticallyselected active galactic nuclei (agns). five of the sources have extremelylarge star forming (sf) luminosities, l_sf, corresponding to sf rates (sfrs) of2800-5600 m_sol/yr assuming a salpeter imf. the remaining sources have onlyupper limits on their sfrs but stacking their herschel images results in a meansfr of 700 +/- 150 m_sol/yr. the higher sfrs in our sample are comparable tothe highest observed values so far, at any redshift. our sample does notcontain obscured agns, which enables us to investigate several evolutionaryscenarios connecting super-massive black holes and sf activity in the earlyuniverse. the most probable scenario is that we are witnessing the peak of sfactivity in some sources and the beginning of the post-starburst decline inothers. we suggest that all 25 sources, which are at their peak agn activity,are in large mergers. agn feedback may be responsible for diminishing the sfactivity in 20 of them but is not operating efficiently in 5 others.

1207.7074	the effects of disc winds on the spectrum and black hole growth rate of  active galactic nuclei	several properties of the standard alpha-disc model for active galacticnuclei (agn) are not entirely consistent with agn observations. as well as suchdiscrepencies, observations show evidence for the existence of high massoutflow winds originating from the vicinity of the active black hole (bh). suchwinds may originate from various parts of the disc and could change the localaccretion rate which should alter the emitted spectral energy distribution(sed) and affect the global disc luminosity and the bh growth rate. the newcalculations presented here show the effects of several types of winds on theobserved and inferred disc properties. some wind profiles can have a profoundeffect on the observed sed and can perhaps explain the poorly understooddeviations of agn spectra from standard disc spectra. we show a factor ~2possible error in estimating the disc luminosity and larger deviations inestimating l/ledd. the bh growth rate computed without taking the effects ofwind into account may be significantly over-estimated. we also suggest apractical way to use the observed sed in order to make first order correctionsto bh growth rate and account for the effects of disc winds.

1302.1576	what triggers black-hole growth? insights from star formation rates	we present a new semi-analytic model for the common growth of black holes(bhs) and galaxies within a hierarchical universe. the model is tuned to matchthe mass function of bhs at z=0 and the luminosity functions of active galacticnuclei (agns) at z&lt;4. we use a new observational constraint, which relates theluminosity of agns to the star-formation rate (sfr) of their host galaxies. weshow that this new constraint is important in various aspects: a) it indicatesthat bh accretion events are episodic; b) it favours a scenario in which bhaccretion is triggered by merger events of all mass ratios; c) it constrainsthe duration of both merger-induced star-bursts and bh accretion events. themodel reproduces the observations once we assume that only 4 per cent of themerger events trigger bh accretion; bhs accretion is not related to secularevolution; and only a few per cent of the mass made in bursts goes into the bh.we find that agns with low or intermediate luminosity are mostly beingtriggered by minor merger events, in broad agreement with observations. ourmodel matches various observed properties of galaxies, such as the stellar massfunction at z&lt;4 and the clustering of galaxies at redshift zero. this allows usto use galaxies as a reliable backbone for bh growth, with reasonable estimatesfor the frequency of merger events. other modes of bh accretion, such asdisk-instability events, were not considered here, and should be furtherexamined in the future.

1308.0012	star formation and black hole growth at z=4.8	we report herschel spitzer and wise observations of 44 z=4.8 opticallyselected active galactic nuclei (agns). this sample contains the highest massblack holes (bhs) at this redshift. ten of the objects were detected byherschel and five show emission that is not associated with the agns. the starformation (sf) luminosity (lsf) obtained by fitting the spectral energydistribution (sed) with standard sf templates is in the range 10^(46.62-47.21)erg/s corresponding to sf rates of 1090-4240 msun/yr. fitting with luminoussubmillimeter galaxy seds gives sf rates that are smaller by 0.05 dex whenusing all bands and 0.1 dex when ignoring the 250-mic band. a 40k gray-bodyfits to only the 500-mic fluxes reduce lsf by about a factor two. stackinganalysis of 29 undetected sources give significant signals in all three bands.a sf template fit indicates lsf=10^(46.19-46.23) erg/s depending on the assumeagn contribution. a 40k fit to the stacked 500-mic flux gives lsf=10^(45.95)erg/s. the mean bh mass (mbh) and agn luminosity (lagn) of the detected sourcesare significantly higher than those of the undetected ones. the spectraldifferences are seen all the way from uv to far infrared wavelengths. the meanoptical-uv spectra are similar to the ones predicted for thin accretion disksaround bhs with the measured masses and accretion rates. we suggest twoalternative explanations to the correlation of lsf, lagn and mbh, one involvingno agn feedback and the second a moderate feedback that affects, but nottotally quench sf in 3/4 of the sources. we compare our lsf and lagn to lowerredshift samples and show a new correlation between lsf and mbh. we alsoexamine several rather speculative ideas about the host galaxy propertiesincluding the possibility that the detected sources are above the sf masssequence (ms) at z=4.8, perhaps in mergers, and most of the undetected sourcesare on the ms.

1311.4215	bolometric luminosity black-hole growth time and slim accretion discs in  active galactic nuclei	we investigate the accretion rate, bolometric luminosity, black hole (bh)growth time and bh spin in a large agn sample under the assumption that allsuch objects are powered via thin or slim accretion discs (ads). we use directestimates of the mass accretion rate, mdot, to show that many currently usedvalues of lbol and ledd are either under estimated or over estimated becausethey are based on bolometric correction factors that are adjusted to theproperties of moderately accreting active galactic nuclei (agn) and do not takeinto account the correct combination of bh mass, spin and accretion rate. theconsistent application of ad physics to our sample of sloan digital sky survey(sdss) agn leads to the following findings: 1. even the most conservativeassumption about the radiative efficiency of fast accreting bhs shows that manyof these sources must contain slim ads. we illustrate this by estimating thefraction of such objects at various redshifts. 2. many previously estimated bhgrowth times are inconsistent with the ad theory. in particular, the growthtimes of the fastest accreting bhs were over estimated in the past by largefactors with important consequences to agn evolution. 3. currently usedbolometric correction factors for low accretion rate very massive sdss bhs, areinconsistent with the ad theory. applying the ad set of assumptions to suchobjects, combined with standard photoionization calculations of broad emissionlines, leads to the conclusion that many such objects must contain fastspinning bhs.

1408.2337	supermassive black holes with high accretion rates in active galactic  nuclei: ii. the most luminous standard candles in the universe	this is the second in a series of papers reporting on a large reverberationmapping (rm) campaign to measure black hole (bh) mass in high accretion rateactive galactic nuclei (agns). the goal is to identify super-eddingtonaccreting massive black holes (seambhs) and to use their unique properties toconstruct a new method for measuring cosmological distances. based ontheoretical models, the saturated bolometric luminosity of such sources isproportional to the bh mass which can be used to obtain their distance. here wereport on five new rm measurements and show that in four of the cases we canmeasure the bh mass and three of these sources are seambhs. together with thethree sources from our earlier work, we now have six new sources of this type.we use a novel method based on a minimal radiation efficiency to identify nineadditional seambhs from earlier rm-based mass measurements. we use a bayesiananalysis to determine the parameters of the new distance expression, and themethod uncertainties, from the observed properties of the objects in thesample. the ratio of the newly measured distances to the standard cosmologicalones has a mean scatter of 0.14 dex, indicating that seambhs can be use ascosmological distance probes. with their high luminosity, long period ofactivity and large numbers at high redshifts, seambhs have a potential toextend the cosmic distance ladder beyond the range now explored by type iasupernovae.

1410.8137	active galactic nuclei at z ~ 1.5: i. spectral energy distribution and  accretion discs	the physics of active super massive black holes (bhs) is governed by theirmass (m_bh), spin (a*) and accretion rate ($\dot{m}$). this work is the firstin a series of papers with the aim of testing how these parameters determinethe observable attributes of active galactic nuclei (agn). we have selected asample in a narrow redshift range, centered on z~1.55, that covers a wide rangein m_bh and $\dot{m}$, and are observing them with x-shooter, covering restwavelengths ~1200-9800 \aa. the current work covers 30 such objects and focuseson the origin of the agn spectral energy distribution (sed). after estimatingm_bh and $\dot{m}$ based on each observed sed, we use thin ad models and abayesian analysis to fit the observed seds in our sample. we are able to fit22/30 of the seds. out of the remaining 8 seds, 3 can be fit by the thin admodel by correcting the observed sed for reddening within the host galaxy and 4can be fit by adding a disc wind to the model. in four of these 8 sources,milky way-type extinction, with the strong 2175\aa\ feature, provides the bestreddening correction. the distribution in spin parameter covers the entirerange, from -1 to 0.998, and the most massive bhs have spin parameters greaterthan 0.7. this is consistent with the "spin-up" model of bh evolution.altogether, these results indicate that thin ads are indeed the main powerhouses of agn, and earlier claims to the contrary are likely affected byvariability and a limited observed wavelength range.

0804.0803	the hard x-ray spectrum as a probe for black-hole growth in radio-quiet  active galactic nuclei	we study the hard-x-ray spectral properties of ten highly luminousradio-quiet (rq) active galactic nuclei (agns) at z=1.3-3.2, including newxmm-newton observations of four of these sources. we find a significantcorrelation between the normalized accretion rate (l/l_edd) and the hard-x-rayphoton index (gamma) for 35 moderate-high luminosity rq agns including our tenhighly luminous sources. within the limits of our sample, we show that ameasurement of gamma and l_x can provide an estimate of l/l_edd and black-hole(bh) mass (m_bh) with a mean uncertainty of a factor of &lt;~3 on the predictedvalues of these properties. this may provide a useful probe for tracing thehistory of bh growth in the universe, utilizing samples of x-ray-selected agnsfor which l/l_edd and m_bh have not yet been determined systematically. it mayprove to be a useful way to probe bh growth in distant compton-thin type 2agns. we also find that the optical-x-ray spectral slope (a_ox) dependsprimarily on optical-uv luminosity rather than on l/l_edd in a sample of rqagns spanning five orders of magnitude in luminosity and over two orders ofmagnitude in l/l_edd. we detect a significant compton-reflection continuum intwo of our highly luminous sources, and in the stacked x-ray spectrum of sevenother sources with similar luminosities, we obtain a mean relative comptonreflection of r=0.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} and an upper limit on the rest-frameequivalent width of a neutral fe ka line of 105 ev. we do not detect asignificant steepening of the x-ray power-law spectrum below rest-frame 2 kevin any of our highly luminous sources, suggesting that a soft-excess feature,commonly observed in local agns, either does not depend strongly on l/l_edd, oris not accessible at high redshifts using current x-ray detectors.

1502.06363	growing black holes and galaxies: black hole accretion versus star  formation rate	we present a new suite of hydrodynamical simulations and use it to study, indetail, black hole and galaxy properties. the high time, spatial and massresolution, and realistic orbits and mass ratios, down to 1:6 and 1:10, enableus to meaningfully compare star formation rate (sfr) and bh accretion rate(bhar) timescales, temporal behaviour and relative magnitude. we find that (i)bhar and galaxy-wide sfr are typically temporally uncorrelated, and havedifferent variability timescales, except during the merger proper, lasting~0.2-0.3 gyr. bhar and nuclear (&lt;100 pc) sfr are better correlated, and theirvariability are similar. averaging over time, the merger phase leads typicallyto an increase by a factor of a few in the bhar/sfr ratio. (ii) bhar andnuclear sfr are intrinsically proportional, but the correlation lessens if thelong-term sfr is measured. (iii) galaxies in the remnant phase are the onesmost likely to be selected as systems dominated by an active galactic nucleus(agn), because of the long time spent in this phase. (iv) the timescale overwhich a given diagnostic probes the sfr has a profound impact on the recoveredcorrelations with bhar, and on the interpretation of observational data.

1502.07076	black hole accretion versus star formation rate: theory confronts  observations	we use a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers to comparestar formation rate (sfr) and black hole accretion rate (bhar) for galaxiesbefore the interaction ('stochastic' phase), during the `merger' proper,lasting ~0.2-0.3 gyr, and in the `remnant' phase. we calculate the bi-variatedistribution of sfr and bhar and define the regions in the sfr-bhar plane thatthe three phases occupy. no strong correlation between bhar and galaxy-wide sfris found. a possible exception are galaxies with the highest sfr and thehighest bhar. we also bin the data in the same way used in severalobservational studies, by either measuring the mean sfr for agn in differentluminosity bins, or the mean bhar for galaxies in bins of sfr. we find that theapparent contradiction or sfr versus bhar for observed samples of agn and starforming galaxies is actually caused by binning effects. the two types ofsamples use different projections of the full bi-variate distribution, and thefull information would lead to unambiguous interpretation. we also find that agalaxy can be classified as agn-dominated up to 1.5 gyr after the merger-drivenstarburst took place. our study is consistent with the suggestion that mostlow-luminosity agn hosts do not show morphological disturbances.

1504.01844	supermassive black holes with high accretion rates in active galactic  nuclei. iv. h$\beta$ time lags and implications for super-eddington accretion	we have completed two years of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of alarge number of active galactic nuclei (agns) with very high accretion rates.in this paper, we report on the result of the second phase of the campaign,during 2013--2014, and the measurements of five new h$\beta$ time lags out ofeight monitored agns. all five objects were identified as super-eddingtonaccreting massive black holes (seambhs). the highest measured accretion ratesfor the objects in this campaign are $\dot{\mathscr{m}}\gtrsim 200$, where$\dot{\mathscr{m}}= \dot{m}_{\bullet}/l_{\rm edd}c^{-2}$, $\dot{m}_{\bullet}$is the mass accretion rates, $l_{\rm edd}$ is the eddington luminosity and $c$is the speed of light. we find that the h$\beta$ time lags in seambhs aresignificantly shorter than those measured in sub-eddington agns, and thedeviations increase with increasing accretion rates. thus, the relationshipbetween broad-line region size ($r_{_{\rm h\beta}}$) and optical luminosity at5100\aa, $r_{_{\rm h\beta}}-l_{5100}$, requires accretion rate as an additionalparameter. we propose that much of the effect may be due to the stronganisotropy of the emitted slim-disk radiation. scaling $r_{_{\rm h\beta}}$ bythe gravitational radius of the black hole, we define a new radius-massparameter ($y$) and show that it saturates at a critical accretion rate of$\dot{\mathscr{m}}_c=6\sim 30$, indicating a transition from thin to slimaccretion disk and a saturated luminosity of the slim disks. the parameter $y$is a very useful probe for understanding the various types of accretion ontomassive black holes. we briefly comment on implications to the generalpopulation of super-eddington agns in the universe and applications tocosmology.

1505.00811	revisiting the unified model of active galactic nuclei	this review describes recent developments related to the unified model ofactive galactic nuclei (agn). it focuses on new ideas about the origin andproperties of the central obscurer (torus), and the connection with itssurrounding. the review does not address radio unification. agn tori must beclumpy but the uncertainties about their properties are still large. todaysmost promising models involve disk winds of various types and hydrodynamicalsimulations that link the large scale galactic disk to the inner accretionflow. ir studies greatly improved the understanding of the spectral energydistribution of agns but they are hindered by various selection effects. x-raysamples are more complete. a basic relationship which is still unexplained isthe dependence of the torus covering factor on luminosity. there is also muchconfusion regarding "real type-ii agns" that do not fit into a simpleunification scheme. the most impressive recent results are due to irinterferometry, which is not in accord with most torus models, and the accuratemapping of central ionization cones. agn unification may not apply to mergingsystems and is possibly restricted to secularly evolving galaxies.

astro-ph;0002108	the nature of associated absorption and the uv-x-ray connection in 3c  288.1	we discuss new hubble space telescope spectroscopy of the radio-loud quasar,3c 288.1. the data cover ~590 a to ~1610 a in the quasar rest frame. theyreveal a wealth of associated absorption lines (aals) with no accompanyinglyman-limit absorption. the metallic aals range in ionization from c iii and niii to ne viii and mg x. we use these data and photoionization models to derivethe following properties of the aal gas: 1) there are multiple ionization zoneswithin the aal region, spanning a factor of at least ~50 in ionizationparameter. 2) the overall ionization is consistent with the ``warm'' x-raycontinuum absorbers measured in seyfert 1 nuclei and other qsos. however, 3)the column densities implied by the aals in 3c 288.1 are too low to producesignificant bound-free absorption at any uv-x-ray wavelengths. substantialx-ray absorption would require yet another zone, having a much higherionization or a much lower velocity dispersion than the main aal region. 4) thetotal hydrogen column density in the aal gas is log n_h (cm-2)= 20.2. 5) themetallicity is roughly half solar. 6) the aals have deconvolved widths of ~900km/s and their centroids are consistent with no shift from the quasar systemicvelocity (conservatively within +/-1000 km/s). 7) there are no directindicators of the absorber's location in our data, but the high ionization andhigh metallicity both suggest a close physical relationship to the quasar/hostgalaxy environment. finally, the uv continuum shape gives no indication of a``blue bump'' at higher energies. there is a distinct break of unknown originat ~1030 a, and the decline toward higher energies (with spectral index alpha =-1.73, for f_nu ~ nu^alpha) is even steeper than a single power-lawinterpolation from 1030 a to soft x-rays.

astro-ph;0004050	discovery of narrow x-ray absorption lines from ngc 3783 with the  chandra hetgs	we present the first grating-resolution x-ray spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxyngc 3783, obtained with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer onthe chandra x-ray observatory. these spectra reveal many narrow absorptionlines from the h-like and he-like ions of o, ne, mg, si, s and ar, as well asfexvii-fexxi l-shell lines. we have also identified several weak emissionlines, mainly from o and ne. the absorption lines are blueshifted by a meanvelocity of approximately 440\pm200 km/s and are not resolved, indicating avelocity dispersion within the absorbing gas of a few hundred km/s or less. wemeasure the lines' equivalent widths and compare them with the predictions ofphotoionization models. the best-fitting model has a microturbulence velocityof 150 km/s and a hydrogen column density of 1.3\times10^22 cm^-2. the measuredblueshifts and inferred velocity dispersions of the x-ray absorption lines areconsistent with those of the strongest uv absorption lines observed in thisobject. however, simple models that propose to strictly unify the x-ray and uvabsorbers have difficulty explaining simultaneously the x-ray and uv absorptionline strengths.

astro-ph;0101540	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy and modeling of the absorbing and  emitting outflow in ngc 3783	(abridged) the high-resolution x-ray spectrum of ngc 3783 shows several dozenabsorption lines and a few emission lines from the h-like and he-like ions ofo, ne, mg, si, and s as well as from fe xvii - fe xxiii l-shell transitions. wehave reanalyzed the chandra hetgs spectrum using better flux and wavelengthcalibrations along with more robust methods. combining several lines from eachelement, we clearly demonstrate the existence of the absorption lines anddetermine they are blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity by -610+/-130km/s. we find the ne absorption lines in the high energy grating spectrum to beresolved with fwhm=840{+490}{-360} km/s. we have used regions in the spectrumwhere no lines are expected to determine the x-ray continuum, and we model theabsorption and emission lines using photoionized-plasma calculations. the modelconsists of two absorption components which have an order of magnitudedifference in their ionization parameters. the two components are sphericallyoutflowing from the agn and thus contribute to both the absorption and theemission via p cygni profiles. the model also clearly requires o vii and o viiiabsorption edges. the low-ionization component of our model can plausiblyproduce uv absorption lines with equivalent widths consistent with thoseobserved from ngc 3783. however, we note that this result is highly sensitiveto the unobservable uv-to-x-ray continuum, and the available uv and x-rayobservations cannot firmly establish the relationship between the uv and x-rayabsorbers. we find good agreement between the chandra spectrum and simultaneousasca and rxte observations. we set an upper limit on the fwhm of the narrow fek\alpha emission line of 3250 km/s. this is consistent with this lineoriginating outside the broad line region, possibly from a torus.

astro-ph;0104260	radiation pressure acceleration by x-rays in active galactic nuclei	we present calculations of the dynamics of highly ionized gas clouds that areconfined by external pressure, and are ionized by agn continuum. we focus onthe gas that is seen in absorption in the x-ray spectrum of many agn and showthat such gas can reach hydrostatic equilibrium under various conditions. theprincipal conclusion is that the clouds can be accelerated to high velocitiesby the central x-ray source. the dynamical problem can be reduced to thecalculation of a single parameter, the average force multiplier, &lt;m&gt;. thetypical value of &lt;m&gt; is ~10 suggesting that radiation pressure acceleration byx-rays is efficient for l/l_edd&gt;0.1. the terminal velocity scales with theescape velocity at the base of the flow and can exceed it by a large factor.the typical velocity for a hig flow that originates at r=1e17 cm in a sourcewith l_x=1e44 erg/s is ~1000 km/s, i.e. similar to the velocities observed inseveral x-ray and uv absorption systems.  highly ionized agn clouds are driven mainly by bound-free absorption andbound-bound processes are less important unless the lines are significantlybroadened or the column density is very small. pressure laws that result inconstant or outward decreasing ionization parameters are most effective inaccelerating the flow.

astro-ph;0201182	observational requirements for high-fidelity reverberation mapping	we present a series of simulations to demonstrate that high-fidelityvelocity-delay maps of the emission-line regions in active galactic nuclei canbe obtained from time-resolved spectrophotometric data sets like those thatwill arise from the proposed kronos satellite. while previousreverberation-mapping experiments have established the size scale r of thebroad emission-line regions from the mean time delay t = r/c between the lineand continuum variations and have provided strong evidence for supermassiveblack holes, the detailed structure and kinematics of the broad-line regionremain ambiguous and poorly constrained. here we outline the technicalimprovements that will be required to successfully map broad-line regions byreverberation techniques. for typical agn continuum light curves, characterizedby power-law power spectra p(f) ~ f^{-a} with a = -1.5 +/- 0.5, our simulationsshow that a small uv/optical spectrometer like kronos will clearly distinguishbetween currently viable alternative kinematic models. from spectra sampling attime intervals t_res and sustained for a total duration t_dur, we canreconstruct high-fidelity velocity-delay maps with velocity resolutioncomparable to that of the spectra, and delay resolution ~2 t_res, providedt_dur exceeds the blr crossing time by at least a factor of three. even verycomplicated kinematical models, such as a keplerian flow with superimposedspiral wave pattern, are cleanly resolved in maps from our simulated kronosdatasets. reverberation mapping with kronos data is therefore likely deliverthe first clear maps of the geometry and kinematics in the broad emission-lineregions 1-100 microarcseconds from supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0201437	is there a metallicity--luminosity relationship in agn? the case of  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	the well known relationship between metallicity and luminosity in agn isaddressed by introducing new metallicity measurements (based on the method ofhamann &amp; ferland 1993; hf93) for a sample of narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxies. our new results, based on a sample of 162 agn, including 9 nls1s,indicate that, while broad-line agn trace a metallicity--luminosity power lawwith an index of ~0.2, nls1s deviate significantly from this relationship atlow luminosities. adopting the hf93 method based on the n v/c iv line ratio, wefind that nls1 metallicities are similar to those of some high-redshifthigh-luminosity quasars. we also examined the n iv]/c iv line ratio andcompared it with n v/c iv in a sample of 30 sources including several nls1s. wefind that the two do not give a consistent answer regarding the n/c abundanceratio. this result is marginal because of the quality of the data. we suggesttwo alternative explanations to these results: 1) the hf93metallicity--luminosity dependence is not a simple two-parameter dependence andthere is an additional hidden variable in this relationship that has not yetbeen discovered. the additional parameter may be the accretion rate, the age ofthe central stellar cluster or, perhaps, something else. 2) the strong lineratios involving n v 1240a suggested by hf93 are not adequate metallicityindicators for nls1s and perhaps also other agn for reasons that are not yetfully understood.

astro-ph;0210361	extreme slim accretion disks and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies: the  nature of the soft x-ray hump	we present a detailed model of an extreme slim disk (esd) with a hot coronaaround a massive black hole with dimensionless accretion rate $\dotm$ in therange $2.5\ll \dotm\leq 100$. we assume that a fraction $f$ of thegravitational energy is released in the hot corona and the rest is released inthe esd. the energy equation of the esd is dominated by advection and thespectrum shows a broad ``hump'' caused by saturated comptonization withmonochromatic luminosity given by $\nu l_{\nu}\propto \nu^0$. this relationshipenables us to estimate the black hole mass from the esd luminosity. thespectrum of the hot corona is sensitive to the parameter $f\dotm$ and theviscosity and shows a comptonized power-law with a high-energy cutoff. themodel is used to explain the spectral properties of narrow line seyfert 1galaxies (nls1s). in particular, it can explain the spectrum of extreme nls1slike nls1 re j1034+396. our spectral estimate of the black hole mass in thissource is in good agreement with the mass obtained by applying thereververation mapping correlation. we also examine the eddington ratios in alarge nls1 sample and find that most objects show super-eddington accretionrates. we argue that soft x-ray humps in nls1s are natural consequences ofsuper-eddington accretion in such objects.

astro-ph;0306512	non-sobolev modelling of radiation pressure driven flows in active  galactic nuclei	we present a new general scheme for calculating the structure and dynamics ofradiation pressure driven, photoionized flows. the new method goes one stepbeyond the sobolev approximation. it involves a numerical solution of theradiative transfer in absorption lines including the effects of differentialexpansion and line interactions such as line locking and blanketing. we alsopresent a new scheme for calculating the radiation pressure due to trapped linephotons in finite, differentially expanding flows. we compare our results forthe radiation pressure force with those obtained using the sobolevapproximation and show the limitations of the latter. in particular, wedemonstrate that the sobolev method gives a poor approximation neardiscontinuity surfaces and its neglect of line blanketing can lead to erroneousresults in high velocity flows. we combine the newly calculated radiationpressure force with self-consistent photoionization and thermal calculations tostudy the dynamics and spectral features of broad absorption line flows andhighly ionized gas flows in agn. a comparison with sobolev-type calculationsshows that the latter over estimates the flow's terminal velocity and,conversely, under estimates its opacity. we also show that line locking onbroad emission lines can have a significant effect on the dynamics and spectralfeatures of agn flows.

astro-ph;0306513	continuum shielding and flow dynamics in active galactic nuclei	we study the ionization, thermal structure, and dynamics of agn flows whichare partially shielded from the central continuum. we utilize detailed non-ltephotoionization and radiative transfer code using exact (non-sobolev)calculations. we find that shielding has a pronounced effect on the ionization,thermal structure, and the dynamics of such flows. moderate shielding isespecially efficient in accelerating flows to high velocities since itsuppresses the ionization level of the gas. the ionization structure ofshielded gas tends to be distributed uniformly over a wide range of ionizationlevels. in such gas, radiation pressure due to trapped line photons candominate over the thermal gas pressure and have a significant effect on thethermal stability of the flow. heavily shielded flows are driven mainly by lineradiation pressure, and so line locking has a large effect on the flowdynamics. we show that the observed ``l_\alpha ghost'' is a natural outcome inhighly ionized flows that are shielded beyond the lyman limit. we suggest thathigh velocity agn flows occupy only a small fraction of the volume and thattheir density depends only weakly on the velocity field.

astro-ph;0502272	dynamical and spectral modeling of the ionized gas and nuclear  environment in ngc 3783	we present a new approach for calculating the physical properties of highlyionized x-ray flows in active galactic nuclei (agn). our method relies on adetailed treatment of the structure, dynamics and spectrum of the gas. aquantitative comparison of our model predictions with the 900 ksec chandra/hetgx-ray spectrum of ngc 3783 shows that: (1) the highly ionized outflow is drivenby thermal pressure gradients and radiation pressure force is less important.(2) a full featured dynamical model that provides a very good fit to the highresolution x-ray spectrum requires a multi-phased flow with a density powerspectrum reminiscent of the interstellar medium. (3) adiabatic cooling is animportant factor and so is an additional heating source that may be related tothe apparent multi-phase and turbulent nature of the flow. (4) the base of theflow is ~1pc from the central object, in agreement with some, but not allprevious estimates. (5) the mass loss rate is in the range 0.01-0.1 solarmasses per year which is smaller than previous estimates and of the same orderof the mass accretion rate in this object.

astro-ph;0504484	the relationship between luminosity and broad-line region size in active  galactic nuclei	we reinvestigate the relationship between the characteristic broad-lineregion size (r_blr) and the balmer emission-line, x-ray, uv, and opticalcontinuum luminosities. our study makes use of the best availabledeterminations of r_blr for a large number of active galactic nuclei (agns)from peterson et al. using their determinations of r_blr for a large sample ofagns and two different regression methods, we investigate the robustness of ourcorrelation results as a function of data sub-sample and regression technique.though small systematic differences were found depending on the method ofanalysis, our results are generally consistent. assuming a power-law relationr_blr \propto l^\alpha, we find the mean best-fitting \alpha is about0.67+/-0.05 for the optical continuum and the broad h\beta luminosity, about0.56+/-0.05 for the uv continuum luminosity, and about 0.70+/-0.14 for thex-ray luminosity. we also find an intrinsic scatter of about 40% in theserelations. the disagreement of our results with the theoretical expected slopeof 0.5 indicates that the simple assumption of all agns having on average sameionization parameter, blr density, column density, and ionizing spectral energydistribution, is not valid and there is likely some evolution of a few of thesecharacteristics along the luminosity scale.

astro-ph;0505016	xmm-newton spectroscopy of the starburst dominated ultra luminous  infrared galaxy ngc 6240	we present new xmm-newton observation of the ultra luminous infrared galaxy(ulirg) ngc 6240. we analyze the reflecting grating spectrometer (rgs) data,and data from the other instruments, and find a starburst dominated 0.5-3 kevspectrum with global properties resembling those observed in m82 but with amuch higher luminosity. we show that the starburst region can be divided intoan outer zone, beyond a radius of about 2.1 kpc, with a gas temperature ofabout 10^7 k and a central region with temperatures in the range (2-6) x 10^7k. the gas in the outer region emits most of the observed oviii lyman-alphaline and the gas in the inner region the emission lines of higher ionizationions, including a strong fexxv line. we also identify a small inner part, veryclose to the active nuclei, with typical seyfert 2 properties including a largeamount of photoionized gas producing a strong fe k-alpha 6.4 kev line. thecombined abundance, temperature and emission measure analysis indicates supersolar ne/o, mg/o, si/o, s/o and possibly also fe/o. the analysis suggestsdensities in the range of (0.07-0.28) x epsilon^(-1/2) cm^(-3) and a totalthermal gas mass of about 4 x 10^8 x epsilon^(1/2) solar masses, where epsilonis the volume filling factor. we used a simple model to argue that a massivestarburst with an age of about 2 x 10^7 years can explain most of the observedproperties of the source. ngc 6240 is perhaps the clearest case of an x-raybright luminous agn, in a merger, whose soft x-ray spectrum is dominated by apowerful starburst.

astro-ph;0603712	the correlation of narrow line emission and x-ray luminosity in active  galactic nuclei	we combine emission line and x-ray luminosities for 45 sources from thechandra deep field south (cdf-s), and seven hellas sources, to obtain a newsample of 52 x-ray selected type-ii active galactic nuclei (agns). eighteen ofour sources are very luminous with a typical, absorption-corrected 2-10 kevluminosity of few 10^{44} erg/sec (type-ii qsos). we compare the emission lineproperties of the new sources with emission line and x-ray luminosities ofknown low redshift, mostly lower luminosity agns by using a composite spectrum.we find that ${\rm l_{[oiii]}}$/${\rm l_{2-10}}$ and ${\rm l_{[oii]}}$/${\rml_{2-10}}$ decrease with l(2-10 kev) such that ${\rm l_{[oiii]}}/{\rm l_{2-10}}\propto {\rm l_{2-10}}^{-0.42}$. the trend was already evident, yet neglectedin past low redshift samples. this lead to erroneous calibration of theline-to-x-ray luminosity in earlier agn samples. the analysis of several type-isamples shows the same trend with a similar slope but a median ${\rml_{[oiii]}}$/${\rm l_{2-10}}$ which is larger by a factor of about two comparedwith optically selected type-ii samples. we interpret this shift as due toadditional reddening in type-ii sources and comment in general on the verylarge extinction in many type-ii objects and the significantly smaller averagereddening of the sdss type-ii agns. the decrease of ${\rm l_{[oiii]}}$/${\rml_{2-10}}$ with l(2--10 kev) is large enough to suggest that a significantfraction of high luminosity high redshift type-ii agns have very weak emissionlines that may have escaped detection in large samples. a related decrease ofew([oiii]) with optical continuum luminosity is demonstrated by an analysis of12,000 type-i sdss agns.

astro-ph;9404075	bloated stars as agn broad line clouds: the emission line spectrum	the bloated stars scenario proposes that agn broad line emission originatesin the winds or envelopes of bloated stars (bs). its main advantage over blrcloud models is the gravitational confinement of the gas and its majordifficulty the large estimated number of bss and resulting high mass loss rate.we calculate the emission line spectrum by a detailed numerical photoionizationcode for a wide range of wind structures and a detailed qso nucleus model withl(ion)=7e45 erg/s, m(bh)=8e7 mo. the size and boundary density of the wind aredetermined by various processes: comptonization by the central ionizing source(calculated self consistently), tidal disruption by the black hole and thelimit set by the wind's finite mass. we find that the emission spectrum ismainly determined by the conditions at the boundary of the line emittingfraction of the wind rather than by its internal structure. comptonizationresults in very high ionization parameters at the boundary which produces anexcess of unobserved broad high excitation forbidden lines. the finite massconstraint limits the wind size, increases the boundary density and thusimproves the results. slow decelerating mass-constrained flows with high gasdensities (1e8-1e12 cm^-3) are as success- ful as clouds in reproducing theobserved lines. only 5e4 dense wind bss are required in the inner 1/3 pc. thissmall fraction approaches that of super- giants (sg) in the solar neighborhoodand the mass loss is consistent with the observational constraints. the bsnumber is a very sensitive function of the wind structure. sg-like bss areruled out by their high mass loss. bss with dense winds can reproduce the blrline spectrum and be supported by the stellar population without excessive massloss and collisional destruction rates.

(ii) thebroad line region size is limited by some cutoff mechanism. (iii) the fractionof the bss in the stellar population falls off roughly as r^-2.

astro-ph;9706189	x-ray lines and gas composition in ngc 1068	previous x-ray and ultraviolet spectroscopy suggested that the fe/o abundanceratio in ngc 1068 may be abnormally high. we have measured some 15 x-ray linesin ngc 1068, to an accuracy better than a factor 2, and modeled the continuumin two different ways. the first assumes that the hard x-ray continuum is thereflection of the nuclear source by two, extended, photoionized gas components;a warm (t$\sim 1.5 \times 10^5$ k) gas and a hot (t$\sim 3 \times 10^6$ k) gas.all the observed emission lines are produced in this gas and there is anadditional, extended 0.6--3 kev pure continuum component. the second model is acombination of a hard reflected continuum with a soft thermal plasma component.the calculations show that the emission lines in the photoionized gas model arein very good agreement with the observed ones assuming solar metallicity forall elements except for iron, which is more than twice solar, and oxygen, whichis less than 0.25 solar. models with solar oxygen are possible if the 0.5--1kev continuum is weaker but they do not explain the magnesium and siliconlines. the thermal model fit requires extremely low metallicity (0.04 solar)for all elements. we discuss these findings and compare them with the ascaspectra of recently observed starburst galaxies. given the strong h-like andhe-like lines, as well as the prominent fe-l emission features, the origin ofthe soft x-ray lines in this source is more likely photoionized gas. we compareour model with the recent iwasawa etal (1997) paper. we also show thatfluorescence lines of low-z element lines in agn is likely to be larger thanpreviously assumed.

astro-ph;9708046	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: iii. the evidence for  absorption &amp; emission due to photoionized gas	(abridged) we present the results from a detailed analysis of the 0.6 - 10kev spectra of 23 asca observations of 18 objects. we find that in most casesthe underlying continuum can be well-represented by a powerlaw with a photonindex gamma approx 2. however we find strong evidence for photoionized gas inthe line-of-sight to 13/18 objects. we present detailed modelling of this gasbased upon the ion photoionization code. we find the x-ray ionization parameterfor the ionized material is strongly peaked at ux approx 0.1. the columndensities of ionized material are typically in the range n_{h,z} approx10^{21}--10^{23} cm^{-2}, although highly ionized column densities up to10^{24} cm^{-2} cannot be excluded in some cases. we also investigate theimportance of the emission-spectrum from the ionized gas, finding that itsignificantly improves the fit to many sources with an intensity consistentwith material subtending a large solid angle at the central source. a deficitof counts is observed at approx 1 kev in the sources exhibiting the strongestabsorption features. we suggest this is likely to be the signature of a secondzone of (more highly) ionized gas, which might have been seen previously in thedeep fe k-shell edges observed in some ginga observations. we find evidencethat the ionized material in ngc 3227 and mcg-6-30-15 contains embedded dust,whilst there is no such evidence in the other sources

astro-ph;9809094	infrared spectroscopy of ngc4151: probing the obscured ionizing agn  continuum	the iso-sws infrared spectroscopic observations of the nucleus of seyfertgalaxy ngc4151, which are described in a companion paper, are used togetherwith a compilation of uv to ir narrow emission line data to determine thespectral shape of the obscured extreme-uv continuum that photoionizes thenarrow line emitting gas in the active galactic nucleus. we present a newmethod to determine the best fitting photoionizing continuum and emission linecloud model from a heterogeneous set of emission line data.  for ngc4151, we find a best-fit model that reproduces the observed linefluxes to within a factor of 2 on average, and which is consistent with theobserved geometry of the optical narrow line region (nlr). our model consistsof a clumpy, optically thick (ionization bounded) gas distribution, with ahydrogen gas density of ~1000 cm^-3 and a volume filling factor of 6.5*10^-4.  our best fitting spectral energy distribution (sed) falls sharply beyond thelyman limit and then rises sharply again towards 100 ev. in particular, it doesnot display a `big blue bump' signature of a hot accretion disk. we find thatthis sed, which best reproduces the nlr line emission on the 100--500 pc scale,does not have enough uv photons to produce the observed blr recombinationemission from the inner 1 pc. this suggests that the blr is photoionized by theintrinsic continuum source, which does have a strong uv component (perhaps abig blue bump), but that this uv component is absorbed by material locatedbetween the nlr and blr. our analysis suggests that the absorber consists of\~5*10^19 cm^-2 of neutral hydrogen. such an absorber was independentlydetected by uv absorption lines (kriss et al. 1992, 1995).

astro-ph;9811161	blr modeling: a new approach	we present a new scheme for modeling the broad line region in active galacticnuclei. it involves photoionization calculations applied to a number ofvariable emission lines at {\it all times}. we demonstrate how fitting alllines simultaneously provide strong constraints on several of the moreimportant parameters, such as the density and column density, and the radialdistribution of the emission line clouds.  when applying the model to the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548, we are able toreconstruct the light curves of four emission-lines, in time and in absoluteflux. we argue that the balmer line light curves, and possibly also the mgiilight curve, do not fit this scheme because of the limitations of present-dayphotoionization codes. we rule out models where the particle density scales asr^{-2} and favor models where it scales as r^{-(1-1.5)}. we can place lowerlimits on the column density at a distance of 10 ld, of n_{col}(r=10)&gt;10^{22}cm^{-2}, and limit the particle density to be in the range of10^{11}&gt;n(r=10)&gt;10^{9.5} cm^{-3}.

astro-ph;9902254	long-term optical variability properties of the palomar-green quasars	we present results from a monitoring program of 42 quasars from the palomargreen sample. the objects were observed for 7 years at the wise observatory, aspart of a long term effort to monitor agn of various types. this is the mostextensive program of its kind carried out to date on a well-defined opticallyselected quasar sample. the typical sampling interval is ~40 days. one third ofthe quasars were observed at ~60 epochs and the rest at ~30 epochs in two bands(b&amp;r) with photometric accuracy of ~0.01 mag. we present lightcurves for all ofthe sources and discuss the sample variability properties. all of the quasarsin the sample varied during the campaign with intrinsic rms amplitudes of5%&lt;sigma_b&lt;34% and 4%&lt;sigma_r&lt;26%. the rms amplitude and colour for the entiresample are sigma_b=14%, sigma_r=12%, and sigma_{b-r}=5%. on time scales of 100-1000 days the power spectra of the sources have a power-law shape with indexapproximately 2.0 and a spread &lt;0.6. at least half of the quasars, particularlythose that are most variable, become bluer when they brighten, and the rest donot show this behaviour. we quantify this phenomenon, which has been observedpreviously mainly in seyfert galaxies. the quasars which are most variable tendalso to exhibit asymmetry in their variations, in the sense that thebrightening phases last longer than the fading phases. we have searched forcorrelations between the measured variability properties and other parametersof the quasars, such as luminosity, redshift, radio loudness, and x-ray slope.we find several new correlations, and reproduce some of the correlationsreported by previous studies.

astro-ph;9905241	modeling variable emission lines in agns: method and application to ngc  5548	we present a new scheme for modeling the broad line region in active galacticnuclei (agns). it involves photoionization calculations of a large number ofclouds, in several pre-determined geometries, and a comparison of thecalculated line intensities with observed emission line light curves. fittingseveral observed light curves simultaneously provides strong constraints onmodel parameters such as the run of density and column density across thenucleus, the shape of the ionizing continuum, and the radial distribution ofthe emission line clouds. when applying the model to the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548, we were able to reconstruct the light curves of four ultravioletemission-lines, in time and in absolute flux. this has not been achieved by anyprevious work. we argue that the balmer lines light curves, and possibly alsothe mgii2798 light curve, cannot be tested in this scheme because of thelimitations of present-day photoionization codes. our fit procedure can be usedto rule out models where the particle density scales as r^{-2}, where r is thedistance from the central source. the best models are those where the densityscales as r^{-1} or r^{-1.5}. we can place a lower limit on the column densityat a distance of 1 ld, of n_{col}(r=1) &gt;~ 10^{23} cm^{-2} and limit theparticle density to be in the range of 10^{12.5}&gt;n(r=1)&gt;10^{11} cm^{-3}. wehave also tested the idea that the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theionizing continuum is changing with continuum luminosity. none of thevariable-shape sed tried resulted in real improvement over a constant sed casealthough models with harder continuum during phases of higher luminosity seemto fit better the observed spectrum. reddening and/or different compositionseem to play a minor role, at least to the extent tested in this work.

astro-ph;9906294	akn 564: an unusual component in the x-ray spectra of nlsy1 galaxies	we present an asca observation of the nlsy1 ark 564. the x-ray light curveshows rapid variability, but no evidence for energy-dependence to thesevariations, within the 0.6 -- 10 kev bandpass. a strong (ew ~ 70 ev) spectralfeature is observed close to 1 kev. a similar feature has been observed in tons180 (another nlsy1) but has not been observed in broad-line seyfert galaxies.the feature energy suggests a large contribution from fe l-shell lines but itsintensity is difficult to explain in terms of emission and/or absorption fromphotoionized gas. models based on gas in thermal equilibrium with kt ~1 kevprovide an alternative parameterization of the soft spectrum. the latter may beinterpreted as the hot intercloud medium, undergoing rapid cooling andproducing strong fe l-shell recombination lines. in all cases the physicalconditions are rather different from those observed in broad-line seyferts. thehard x-ray spectrum shows a broad and asymmetric fe kalpha line of largeequivalent width (~550 ev) which can be explained by a neutral disk viewed at ~60 degrees to the line-of-sight, contrary to the hypothesis that nlsy1s areviewed pole-on. the large ew of this line, the strong 1 kev emission and thestrong optical fe emission lines all suggest an extreme fe abundance in thisand perhaps other nlsy1s.

astro-ph;9911476	reverberation measurements for 17 quasars and the size-mass-luminosity  relations in active galactic nuclei	(abridged) we have spectrophotometrically monitored a well-defined sample of28 palomar-green quasars in order to obtain measurements of their blrs and toinvestigate the relationships between quasar luminosity, central black holemass, and broad emission line region (blr) size in active galactic nuclei(agn). spectrophotometry was obtained every 1-4 months for 7.5 years, yielding20-70 observing epochs per object. both the continuum and emission line fluxesof all of the quasars were observed to change during the duration of theobserving program. seventeen of the 28 objects were observed with adequatesampling to search for correlated variations between the balmer emission linesand the continuum flux. for each of these 17 objects, a significant correlationwas observed, with the balmer line variations lagging those of the continuum by\~100 days (rest frame). our work increases the available luminosity range forstudying the size-mass-luminosity relations in agn by two orders of magnitudeand doubles the number of objects suitable for such studies. combining ourresults with comparable published data available for seyfert 1 galaxies, wefind the blr size scales with the rest-frame 5100 a luminosity asl^{0.70+-0.03}. this determination of the scaling of the size of the blr as afunction of luminosity is significantly different from those previouslypublished, and suggests that the effective ionization parameter in agn may be adecreasing function of luminosity. we are also able to constrain, subject toour assumption that gravity dominates the motions of the blr gas, the scalingrelationship between the mass of the central black holes and the luminosity inagn: m \propto l^{0.5+-0.1}. this is inconsistent with all agn having opticalluminosity that is a constant fraction of the eddington luminosity.

0811.3251	radiation pressure force and black hole mass determination in low  redshift type-i and type-ii active galactic nuclei	the distributions of l(oiii 5007), black hole (bh) mass and l/l(edd) in twolarge samples of type-i and type-ii active galactic nuclei (agns) are comparedin order to test the suggestion that radiation pressure force is affecting thegas velocity in the broad line region and hence the bh mass determination. thesamples are drawn from the sdss archive and are modified to represent the sameparent distribution at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2. bh masses in type-i sources arecalculated in two different ways, one using a simple virial mass assumption andthe other by taking into account the effect of radiation pressure force on thegas. the simple virial mass estimate results in good agreement with thesigma*-based bh mass and l/l(edd) estimates in type-ii sources. in contrast,there is a clear disagreement in the l/l(edd) distributions when radiationpressure-based estimates are used. this indicates that radiation pressure forceis not important in 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 agns with l(5100)=10^{42.8-44.8} erg/s. thishas important implications to the physics of the gas producing the broademission lines in agns, in particular the existence of extremely large (about10^24 cm^(-2)) column density clouds.

0706.0818	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest): ii. the spectral  energy distributions of palomar-green quasars	this is the second paper studying the qsos in the spitzer quest sample.previously we presented new pah measurements and argued that most of theobserved far infrared (fir) radiation is due to star-forming activity. here wepresent spectral energy distributions (seds) by supplementing our data withoptical, nir and fir observations. we define two sub-groups of ``weak fir'' and``strong fir'' qsos, and a third group of fir non-detections. assuming astarburst origin for the fir, we obtain ``intrinsic'' agn seds by subtracting astarburst template from the mean seds. the resulting seds are remarkablysimilar for all groups. they show three distinct peaks corresponding to twosilicate emission features and a 3mic bump that we interpret as the signatureof the hottest agn dust. they also display drops beyond 20mic that we interpretas the signature of the minimum temperature (about 200k) dust. this componentmust be optically thin to explain the silicate emission and the slope of thelong wavelength continuum. we discuss the merits of an alternative model wheremost of the fir emission is due to agn heating. such models are unlikely toexplain the properties of our qsos but they cannot be ruled out for moreluminous objects. we also find correlations between the luminosity at 5100a andtwo infrared starburst indicators: l(60mic) and l(pah 7.7mic). the correlationof l(5100a) with l(60mic) can be used to measure the relative growth rates andlifetimes of the black hole and the new stars.
