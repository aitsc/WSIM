hep-th;0002239	the generalized abel-plana formula. applications to bessel functions and  casimir effect	one of the most efficient methods to obtain the vacuum expectation values forthe physical observables in the casimir effect is based on the using theabel-plana summation formula. this allows to derive the regularized quantitiesby manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the form ofstrongly converging integrals. however the applications of abel- plana formulain usual form is restricted by simple geometries when the eigenmodes have asimple dependence on quantum numbers. the author generalized the abel-planaformula which essentially enlarges its application range. based on thisgeneralization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series overthe zeros of some combinations of bessel functions and for integrals involvingthese functions. it have been shown that these results generalize the specialcases existing in literature. further the derived summation formulae have beenused to summarize series arising in the mode summation approach to the casimireffect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries. this allows toextract the divergent parts from the vacuum expectation values for the localphysical observables in the manifestly cutoff independent way. the presentpaper reviews these results. some new considerations are added as well.

0711.4673	on features of the radiation from an electron moving along a helix  inside a cylindrical hole in a homogeneous dielectric	the radiation from a charge moving along a helical trajectory inside acylindrical hole in homogeneous dielectric medium is investigated. prompted byavailability of materials with large dielectric permittivity $\epsilon $ andsmall absorption, we discuss the features of this type of radiation for mediawith $\epsilon \gg 1$. it is shown that there are high peaks in the angulardistribution of radiation intensity at well-defined harmonics. the conditionsare specified for the cavity-to-helix radii ratio, $\rho_{1}/\rho_{0}$, underwhich the angle-integrated radiation intensity on some harmonics exceeds thatin the empty space. though the amplification of radiation intensity increaseswith increasing $\epsilon $, the corresponding "resonant" values of $\rho_{1}/\rho_{0}$ ratio are practically independent of the dielectric permittivityof surrounding medium. it is shown that an analogous amplification of radiationtakes place essentially for the same values of $\rho_{1}/\rho_{0}$ also for theradiation in a cylindrical waveguide with conducting walls. an explanation ofthis phenomenon is given.

1502.05397	vacuum densities for a brane intersecting the ads boundary	we investigate the wightman function, the mean field squared and the vacuumexpectation values of energy-momentum tensor for a scalar field in adsspacetime, in the presence of a brane perpendicular to the ads boundary. on thebrane the field operator obeys robin boundary condition. the vacuum expectationvalues are decomposed into the boundary-free ads and brane-inducedcontributions. in this way, for points away from the brane, the renormalizationis reduced to the one in pure ads spacetime. it is shown that at properdistances from the brane larger than the ads curvature radius the brane-inducedexpectation values decay as power-law for both massless and massive scalars.this behavior is in contrast to that for a plane boundary in minkowskispacetime, with an exponential decay for massive fields. for robin boundaryconditions different from dirichlet and neumann ones, the brane-induced part inthe energy density is positive near the brane and negative at large distances.for dirichlet/neumann boundary condition the corresponding energy density isnegative/positive everywhere. we show that, for a fixed value of the properdistance from the brane, near the ads boundary, the neumann boundary conditionis an "attractor" in the general class of robin boundary conditions, whereasdirichlet boundary condition is an "attractor" near the horizon.

0705.2245	wightman function and vacuum densities for a z_2-symmetric thick brane  in ads spacetime	positive frequency wightman function, vacuum expectation values of the fieldsquare and the energy-momentum tensor induced by a z_{2}-symmetric brane withfinite thickness located on (d+1)- dimensional ads background are evaluated fora massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter. for thegeneral case of static plane symmetric interior structure the expectationvalues in the region outside the brane are presented as the sum of free ads andbrane induced parts. for a conformally coupled massless scalar the braneinduced part in the vacuum energy-momentum tensor vanishes. in the limit ofstrong gravitational fields the brane induced parts are exponentiallysuppressed for points not too close to the brane boundary. as an application ofgeneral results a special model is considered in which the geometry inside thebrane is a slice of the minkowski spacetime orbifolded along the directionperpendicular to the brane. for this model the wightman function, vacuumexpectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor insidethe brane are evaluated as well and their behavior is discussed in variousasymptotic regions of the parameters. it is shown that for both minimally andconformally coupled scalar fields the interior vacuum forces acting on thebrane boundaries tend to decrease the brane thickness.

1507.08832	casimir effect for scalar current densities in topologically nontrivial  spaces	we evaluate the hadamard function and the vacuum expectation value (vev) ofthe current density for a charged scalar field, induced by flat boundaries inspacetimes with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatialdimensions. the field operator obeys the robin conditions on the boundaries andquasiperiodicity conditions with general phases along compact dimensions. inaddition, the presence of a constant gauge field is assumed. the latter inducesaharonov-bohm-type effect on the vevs. there is a region in the space of theparameters in robin boundary conditions where the vacuum state becomesunstable. the stability condition depends on the lengths of compact dimensionsand is less restrictive than that for background with trivial topology. thevacuum current density is a periodic function of the magnetic flux, enclosed bycompact dimensions, with the period equal to the flux quantum. it is explicitlydecomposed into the boundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. in sharpcontrast to the vevs of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor, thecurrent density does not contain surface divergences. moreover, for dirichletcondition it vanishes on the boundaries. the normal derivative of the currentdensity on the boundaries vanish for both dirichlet and neumann conditions andis nonzero for general robin conditions. when the separation between the platesis smaller than other length scales, the behavior of the current density isessentially different for non-neumann and neumann boundary conditions. in theformer case, the total current density in the region between the plates tendsto zero. for neumann boundary condition on both plates, the current density isdominated by the interference part and is inversely proportional to theseparation.

0806.0859	summation formula over the zeros of the associated legendre function  with a physical application	associated legendre functions arise in many problems of mathematical physics.by using the generalized abel-plana formula, in this paper we derive asummation formula for the series over the zeros of the associated legendrefunction of the first kind with respect to the degree. the summation formulafor the series over the zeros of the bessel function, previously discussed inthe literature, is obtained as a limiting case. the wightman function for ascalar field with general curvature coupling parameter is considered inside aspherical boundary on background of constant negative curvature space. thecorresponding mode sum contains series over the zeros of the associatedlegendre function. the application of the summation formula allows us topresent the wightman function in the form of the sum of two integrals. thefirst one corresponds to the wightman function for the bulk geometry withoutboundaries and the second one is induced by the presence of the sphericalshell. for points away from the boundary the latter is finite in thecoincidence limit. in this way the renormalization of the vacuum expectationvalue of the field squared is reduced to that for the boundary-free part.

0806.1944	fermionic vacuum polarization by a composite topological defect in  higher-dimensional space-time	we investigate the vacuum polarization effects associated with a chargedmassless spin-1/2 field in a higher-dimensional space-time, induced by acomposite topological defect. the defect is constituted by a global monopoleliving on a three-brane and two-dimensional conical space transverse to thelatter. in addition, we assume the presence of an extra magnetic flux along thecore of the conical space. the heat kernel and the feynman green function arepresented in the form of a sum of two terms. the first one corresponds to thecontribution coming from the bulk with global monopole in the absence ofconical structure of the orthogonal two-space, and the second one is induced bythis structure and the magnetic flux. we explicitly evaluate the part in thevacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor induced by the fluxcarrying conical structure. as in pure cosmic string geometries, only thefractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux to flux quantum leads tonon-trivial effects. the vacuum energy-momentum tensor is an even function ofthis parameter. we show that for strong gravitational fields corresponding tolarge values of the solid angle deficit, the effects induced by the conicalstructure and flux are exponentially suppressed.

1512.06569	hadamard function and the vacuum currents in braneworlds with compact  dimensions: two-branes geometry	we evaluate the hadamard function and the vacuum expectation value (vev) ofthe current density for a charged scalar field in the region between twoco-dimension one branes on the background of locally ads spacetime with anarbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. along compactdimensions periodicity conditions are considered with general values of thephases and on the branes robin boundary conditions are imposed for the fieldoperator. in addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge field. thelatter gives rise to aharonov-bohm type effect on the vacuum currents. thereexists a range in the space of the robin coefficients for separate branes wherethe vacuum state becomes unstable. compared to the case of the standard adsbulk, in models with compact dimensions the stability condition imposed on theparameters is less restrictive. the current density has nonzero componentsalong compact dimensions only. these components are decomposed into thebrane-free and brane-induced contributions. the component along a given compactdimension is a periodic function of the gauge field flux, enclosed by thatdimension, with the period of the flux quantum. an important feature, thatdistinguishes the current density from the expectation values of the fieldsquared and energy-momentum tensor, is its finiteness on the branes. inparticular, for dirichlet boundary condition the current density vanishes onthe branes. we show that, depending on the constants in the boundaryconditions, the presence of the branes may either increase or decrease thecurrent density compared with that for the brane-free geometry. applicationsare given to the randall--sundrum 2-brane model with extra compact dimensions.

0808.0614	fermionic vacuum densities in higher-dimensional de sitter spacetime	fermionic condensate and the vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentumtensor are investigated for twisted and untwisted massive spinor fields inhigher-dimensional de sitter spacetime with toroidally compactified spatialdimensions. the expectation values are presented in the form of the sum ofcorresponding quantities in the uncompactified de sitter spacetime and theparts induced by non-trivial topology. the latter are finite and therenormalization is needed for the first parts only. closed formulae are derivedfor the renormalized fermionic vacuum densities in uncompactifiedodd-dimensional de sitter spacetimes. it is shown that, unlike to the case of4-dimensional spacetime, for large values of the mass, these densities aresuppressed exponentially. asymptotic behavior of the topological parts in theexpectation values is investigated in the early and late stages of thecosmological expansion. when the comoving lengths of compactified dimensionsare much smaller than the de sitter curvature radius, to the leading order thetopological parts coincide with the corresponding quantities for a masslessfermionic field and are conformally related to the corresponding flat spacetimeresults. in this limit the topological parts dominate the uncompactified desitter part and the back-reaction effects should be taken into account. in theopposite limit, for a massive field the asymptotic behavior of the topologicalparts is damping oscillatory.

0808.2378	synchrotron radiation from a charge moving along a helix around a  dielectric cylinder	in this paper we investigate the radiation emitted by a charged particlemoving along a helical orbit around a dielectric cylinder immersed into ahomogeneous medium. formulae are derived for the electromagnetic potentials,electric and magnetic fields, and for the spectral-angular distribution of theradiation in the exterior medium. it is shown that under the cherenkovcondition for dielectric permittivity of the cylinder and the velocity of theparticle image on the cylinder surface, strong narrow peaks appear in theangular distribution for the number of quanta radiated on a given harmonic. atthese peaks the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding quantity for ahomogeneous medium by several dozens of times. simple analytic estimates aregiven for the heights and widths of these peaks. the results of numericalcalculations for the angular distribution of the radiated quanta are presentedand they are compared with the corresponding quantities for the radiation froma charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a dielectric cylinder.

0809.0844	fermionic vacuum polarization by a cylindrical boundary in the cosmic  string spacetime	the vacuum expectation values of the energy--momentum tensor and thefermionic condensate are analyzed for a massive spinor field obeying the mitbag boundary condition on a cylindrical shell in the cosmic string spacetime.both regions inside and outside the shell are considered. by applying to thecorresponding mode-sums a variant of the generalized abel--plana formula, weexplicitly extract the parts in the expectation values corresponding to thecosmic string geometry without boundaries. in this way the renormalizationprocedure is reduced to that for the boundary-free cosmic string spacetime. theparts induced by the cylindrical shell are presented in terms of integralsrapidly convergent for points away from the boundary. the behavior of thevacuum densities is investigated in various asymptotic regions of theparameters. in the limit of large values of the planar angle deficit, theboundary-induced expectation values are exponentially suppressed. as a specialcase, we discuss the fermionic vacuum densities for the cylindrical shell onthe background of the minkowski spacetime.

0809.1013	fermionic casimir effect in de sitter spacetime	the casimir densities are investigated for a massive spinor field in desitter spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatialdimensions. the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor ispresented in the form of the sum of corresponding quantity in theuncompactified de sitter spacetime and the part induced by the non-trivialtopology. the latter is finite and the renormalization is needed for the firstpart only. the asymptotic behavior of the topological term is investigated inthe early and late stages of the cosmological expansion. when the comovinglengths of the compactified dimensions are much smaller than the de sittercurvature radius, to the leading order the topological part coincides with thecorresponding quantity for a massless fermionic field and is conformallyrelated to the corresponding flat spacetime result with the same topology. inthis limit the topological term dominates the uncompactified de sitter part andthe back-reaction effects should be taken into account. in the opposite limit,for a massive field the asymptotic behavior of the topological part is dampingoscillatory.
