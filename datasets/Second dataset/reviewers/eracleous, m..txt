0906.0019	a chandra view of ngc 3621: a bulgeless galaxy hosting an agn in its  early phase?	we report the detection of a weak x-ray point source coincident with thenucleus of the bulgeless disk galaxy ngc 3621, recently discovered by spitzerto display high ionization mid-infrared lines typically associated with agn.these chandra observations provide confirmation for the presence of an agn inthis galaxy, adding to the growing evidence that black holes do form and growin isolated bulgeless disk galaxies. although the low signal-to-noise ratio ofthe x-ray spectrum prevents us from carrying out a detailed spectral analysisof the nuclear source, the x-ray results, combined with the ir and opticalspectroscopic results, suggests that ngc 3621 harbors a heavily absorbed agn,with a supermassive black hole of relatively small mass accreting at a highrate. chandra also reveals the presence of two bright sources straddling thenucleus located almost symmetrically at 20" from the center. both sources havex-ray spectra that are well-fitted by an absorbed power-law model. assumingthey are at the distance of ngc 3621, these two sources have luminosities ofthe order of 1.e39 erg/s, which make them ulxs and suggest that they are blackhole systems. estimates of the black hole mass based on the x-ray spectralanalysis and scaling laws of black hole systems suggest that the 2 brightsources might be intermediate mass black holes with m_bh of the order of a fewthousand solar masses. however, higher quality x-ray data combined withmulti-wavelength observations are necessary to confirm these conclusions.

0906.0799	structure of the accretion flow in broad-line radio galaxies: the case  of 3c390.3	we present xmm and suzaku observations of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg)3c390.3. the fe ka line has a width fwhm ~ 8,800 km/s, consistent within afactor two with the width of the double-peaked h_alpha line, suggesting anorigin from the broad line region. the data show for the first time a weak,broad bump extending from 5 to 7 kev. when fitted with a gaussian, its centroidenergy is 6.6 kev in the source's rest-frame with fwhm of 43,000 km/s and ew of50 ev; its most likely interpretation is emission from he-like fe (fe xxv),suggesting the presence of an ionized medium in the inner regions of 3c390.3.the broad-band 0.5-100 kev continuum is well described by a single power lawwith photon index gamma=1.6 and cutoff energy 157 kev, plus cold reflectionwith strength r=0.5. in addition, ionized reflection is required to account forthe 6.6 kev bump in the broad-band continuum, yielding an ionization parameterxi ~ 2700 ergs cm s^-1; the inner radius of the ionized reflector isconstrained to be larger than 20 r_g, although this result depends on theassumed emissivity profile of the disk. if true, we argue that the lack ofbroad fe k emission from within 20 r_g indicates that the innermost regions ofthe disk in 3c390.3 are obscured and/or poorly illuminated. while the sed of3c390.3 is generally dominated by accretion-related continuum, during accretionlow states the jet can significantly contribute in the optical to x-ray bandsvia synchrotron self-compton emission.

0907.3464	high velocity outflows in narrow absorption line quasars	the current paradigm for the agn phenomenon is a central engine that consistsof an inflow of material accreting in the form of a disk onto a supermassiveblack hole. observations in the uv and optical find high velocity ionizedmaterial outflowing from the black hole. we present results from suzaku andxmm-newton observations of a sample of intrinsic nal quasars with high velocityoutflows. our derived values of the intrinsic column densities of the x-rayabsorbers are consistent with an outflow scenario in which nal quasars areviewed at smaller inclination angles than bal quasars. we find that thedistributions of alpha_ox and dalpha_ox of the nal quasars of our sample differsignificantly from those of bal quasars and sdss radio-quiet quasars. the nalquasars are not significantly absorbed in the x-ray band and the positivevalues of dalpha_ox suggest absorption in the uv band. the positive values ofdalpha_ox of the intrinsic nal quasars can be explained in a geometric scenariowhere our lines of sight towards the compact x-ray hot coronae of nal quasarsdo not traverse the absorbing wind whereas lines of sight towards their uvemitting accretion disks do intercept the outflowing absorbers.

0908.0716	short-term variability and psd analysis of the radio-loud agn 3c 390.3	we investigate the short-term variability properties and the power spectraldensity (psd) of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 390.3 using observationsmade by xmm, rxte, and suzaku on several occasions between october 2004 anddecember 2006. the main aim of this work is to derive model-independentconstraints on the origin of the x-ray emission and on the nature of thecentral engine in 3c 390.3. on timescales of the order of few hours, probed byuninterrupted xmm light curves, the flux of 3c 390.3 is consistent with beingconstant in all energy bands. on longer timescales, probed by the 2-day rxteand suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. the latterobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3c 390.3 isconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet seyfertgalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. the correlatedvariability between soft and hard x-rays, observed during the suzaku exposureand between the 2 xmm pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarioscharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10kev x-ray band. a detailed psd analysis carried out over five decades infrequency suggests the presence of a break at t_br~43 days at a 92% confidencelevel. this is the second tentative detection of a psd break in a radio-loud,non-jet dominated agn, after the blrg 3c120, and appears to be in generalagreement with the relation between t_br, m_bh, and l_bol, followed by seyfertgalaxies. our results indicate that the x-ray variability properties of 3c390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet agn, suggesting that thex-ray emission mechanism in 3c 390.3 is similar to that of nearby seyfertgalaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.

1007.0448	a spectropolarimetric test of the structure of the intrinsic absorbers  in the quasar hs1603+3820	we report the results of a spectropolarimetric observation of the c ivmini-bal in the quasar hs1603+3820. the observations were carried out with thefocas instrument on the subaru telescope and yielded an extremely highpolarization sensitivity of 0.1%, at a resolving power of 1500. hs1603+3820 hasbeen the target of a high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring campaign for morethan four years, aimed at studying its highly variable c iv mini-bal profile.using the monitoring observations, in an earlier paper we were able to narrowdown the causes of the variability to the following two scenarios: (1)scattering material of variable optical depth redirecting photons around theabsorber, and (2) a variable, highly-ionized screen between the continuumsource and the absorber which modulates the uv continuum incident on theabsorber. the observations presented here provide a crucial test of thescattering scenario and lead us to disfavor it because (a) the polarizationlevel is very small (p~0.6%) throughout the spectrum, and (b) the polarizationlevel does not increase across the mini-bal trough. thus, the variable screenscenario emerges as our favored explanation of the c iv mini-bal variability.our conclusion is bolstered by recent x-ray observations of nearby mini-balquasars, which show a rapidly variable soft x-ray continuum that appears to bethe result of transmission through an ionized absorber of variable ionizationparameter and optical depth.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

0704.2756	the nature of a broad line radio galaxy: simultaneous rxte and chandra  hetg observations of 3c 382	we present the results from simultaneous chandra and rxte observations of thex-ray bright broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 382. the long (120 ks) exposurewith chandra hetg allows a detailed study of the soft x-ray continuum and ofthe narrow component of the fe kalpha line. the rxte pca data are used to putan upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard x-raycontinuum. a strong soft excess below 1 kev is observed in the time-averagedhetg spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermalmodel. the flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of thesoft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission,detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). a narrow (sigma&lt;90ev) fe kalpha line (with ew&lt; 100 ev) is observed by the chandra heg. similarvalues for the line parameters are measured by the rxte pca, suggesting thatthe contribution from a broad line component is negligible. the fact that theexposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us toinvestigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on differenttimescales. significant flux variability associated with spectral changes isobserved on timescales of hours and days. the spectral variability is similarto that observed in radio-quiet agn ruling out a jet-dominated origin of thex-rays.

1110.0501	the merger history, agn and dwarf galaxies of hickson compact group 59	compact group galaxies often appear unaffected by their unusually denseenvironment. closer examination can, however, reveal the subtle, cumulativeeffects of multiple galaxy interactions. hickson compact group (hcg) 59 is anexcellent example of this situation. we present a photometric study of thisgroup in the optical (hst), infrared (spitzer) and x-ray (chandra) regimesaimed at characterizing the star formation and nuclear activity in itsconstituent galaxies and intra-group medium. we associate five dwarf galaxieswith the group and update the velocity dispersion, leading to an increase inthe dynamical mass of the group of up to a factor of 10 (to 2.8e13 msun), and asubsequent revision of its evolutionary stage. star formation is proceeding ata level consistent with the morphological types of the four main galaxies, ofwhich two are star-forming and the other two quiescent. unlike in some othercompact groups, star-forming complexes across hcg 59 closely follow mass-radiusscaling relations typical of nearby galaxies. in contrast, the ancient globularcluster populations in galaxies hcg 59a and b show intriguing irregularities,and two extragalactic hii regions are found just west of b. we age-date a faintstellar stream in the intra-group medium at ~1 gyr to examine recentinteractions. we detect a likely low-luminosity agn in hcg 59a by its ~10e40erg/s x-ray emission; the active nucleus rather than star formation can accountfor the uv+ir sed. we discuss the implications of our findings in the contextof galaxy evolution in dense environments.

1211.4033	x-ray and multiwavelength insights into the inner structure of  high-luminosity disc-like emitters	we present x-ray and multiwavelength studies of a sample of eighthigh-luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) with disc-like h\betaemission-line profiles selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release7. these sources have higher redshift (z~0.6) than the majority of the knowndisc-like emitters, and they occupy a largely unexplored space in theluminosity-redshift plane. seven sources have typical agn x-ray spectra withpower-law photon indices of \gamma~1.4-2.0; two of them show some x-rayabsorption (column density n_h~10^{21}-10^{22} cm^{-2}$ for neutral gas). theother source, j0850+4451, has only three hard x-ray photons detected and isprobably heavily obscured (n_h&gt;3x10^{23} cm^{-2}). this object is alsoidentified as a low-ionization broad absorption line (bal) quasar based on mgii \lambda2799 absorption; it is the first disc-like emitter reported that isalso a bal quasar. the ir-to-uv spectral energy distributions (seds) of theseeight sources are similar to the mean seds of typical quasars with a uv "bump",suggestive of standard accretion discs radiating with high efficiency, whichdiffers from low-luminosity disc-like emitters. studies of the x-ray-to-opticalpower-law slope parameters (\alpha_{ox}) indicate that there is no significantexcess x-ray emission in these high-luminosity disc-like emitters. energybudget analysis suggests that for disc-like emitters in general, the inner discmust illuminate and ionize the outer disc efficiently (~15% of the nuclearionizing radiation is required on average) via direct illumination and/orscattering. warped accretion discs are probably needed for direct illuminationto work in high-luminosity objects, as their geometrically thin inner discsdecrease the amount of direct illumination possible for a flat disc.

1212.2188	the chandra local volume survey: the x-ray point source population of  ngc 404	we present a comprehensive x-ray point source catalog of ngc 404 obtained aspart of the chandra local volume survey. a new, 97 ks chandra acis-sobservation of ngc 404 was combined with archival observations for a totalexposure of ~123 ks. our survey yields 74 highly significant x-ray pointsources and is sensitive to a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of ~6x10^35 ergs^-1 in the 0.35-8 kev band. to constrain the nature of each x-ray source,cross-correlations with multi-wavelength data were generated. we searchedoverlapping hst observations for optical counterparts to our x-ray detections,but find only two x-ray sources with candidate optical counterparts. we find 21likely low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), although this number is a lower limitdue to the difficulties in separating lmxbs from background agn. the x-rayluminosity functions (xlfs) in both the soft and hard energy bands arepresented. the xlfs in the soft band (0.5-2 kev) and the hard band (2-8 kev)have a limiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 10^35 erg s^-1 and10^36 erg s^-1, respectively, significantly lower than previous x-ray studiesof ngc 404. we find the xlfs to be consistent with those of other x-raypopulations dominated by lmxbs. however, the number of luminous (&gt;10^37 ergs^-1) x-ray sources per unit stellar mass in ngc 404 is lower than is observedfor other galaxies. the relative lack of luminous xrbs may be due to apopulation of lmxbs with main sequence companions formed during an epoch ofelevated star formation ~0.5 gyr ago.

1311.1978	locating star-forming regions in quasar host galaxies	we present a study of the morphology and intensity of star formation in thehost galaxies of eight palomar-green quasars using observations with the hubblespace telescope. our observations are motivated by recent evidence for a closerelationship between black hole growth and the stellar mass evolution in itshost galaxy. we use narrow-band [o ii] $\lambda$3727, h$\beta$, [o iii]$\lambda$5007 and pa$\alpha$ images, taken with the wfpc2 and nicmosinstruments, to map the morphology of line-emitting regions, and, afterextinction corrections, diagnose the excitation mechanism and inferstar-formation rates. significant challenges in this type of work are theseparation of the quasar light from the stellar continuum and thequasar-excited gas from the star-forming regions. to this end, we present anovel technique for image decomposition and subtraction of quasar light. ourprimary result is the detection of extended line-emitting regions with sizesranging from 0.5 to 5 kpc and distributed symmetrically around the nucleus,powered primarily by star formation. we determine star-formation rates of ordera few tens of m$_\odot$/yr. the host galaxies of our target quasars havestellar masses of order $10^{11}$ m$_\odot$ and specific star formation rateson a par with those of m82 and luminous infrared galaxies. as such they fall atthe upper envelope or just above the star-formation mass sequence in thespecific star formation vs stellar mass diagram. we see a clear trend ofincreasing star formation rate with quasar luminosity, reinforcing the linkbetween the growth of the stellar mass of the host and the black hole massfound by other authors.

1401.4486	magnified views of the ultrafast outflow of the z = 1.51 agn hs  0810+2554	we present results from an observation of the gravitationally lensed z=1.51narrow absorption line agn hs 0810+2554 performed with the chandra x-rayobservatory. the factor of ~100 lensing magnification of hs 0810+2554 makesthis source exceptionally bright. absorption lines are detected at rest-frameenergies of ~ 7.7 kev and ~11.0 kev at &gt;97% significance. by interpreting theselines to arise from highly ionized iron the implied outflow velocities of thex-ray absorbing gas corresponding to these lines are 0.13c and 0.41c,respectively. the presence of these relativistic outflows and the absence ofany significant low-energy x-ray absorption suggest that a shielding gas is notrequired for the generation of the relativistic x-ray absorbing winds in hs0810+2554. uv spectroscopic observations with vlt/uves indicate that the uvabsorbing material is outflowing at v_uv ~0.065c. our analysis indicates thatthe fraction of the total bolometric energy released by hs 0810+2554 into theigm in the form of kinetic energy is epsilon_k = 1.0(-0.6,+0.8). an efficiencyof greater than unity implies that magnetic driving is likely a significantcontributor to the acceleration of this x-ray absorbing wind. we also estimatethe mass-outflow rate of the strongest absorption component to bemdot_abs=1.1(-0.7,+0.9) m_solar yr^-1. assuming that the energetic outflowdetected in the nal agn hs 0810+2554 is a common property of most agn it wouldsuggest that the x-ray absorbing wind may have a larger opening angle thanpreviously thought. this has important consequences for estimating the feedbackcontribution of x-ray absorbing winds to the surrounding igm.

0806.0624	observing white dwarfs orbiting massive black holes in the gravitational  wave and electro-magnetic window	we consider a potentially new class of gravitational wave sources consistingof a white dwarf coalescing into a massive black hole in the mass range~10^4-10^5\msun. these sources are of particular interest because thegravitational wave signal produced during the inspiral phase can be detected bythe laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) and is promptly followed, in anextended portion of the black hole and white dwarf mass parameter space, by anelectro-magnetic signal generated by the tidal disruption of the star,detectable with x-ray, optical and uv telescopes. this class of sources couldtherefore yield a considerable number of scientific payoffs, that includeprecise cosmography at low redshift, demographics of black holes in the massrange ~10^4-10^5\msun, insights into dynamical interactions and populations ofwhite dwarfs in the cores of dwarf galaxies, as well as a new probe into thestructure and equation of state of white dwarfs. by modelling the gravitationaland electromagnetic radiation produced by these events, we find them detectablein both observational windows at a distance ~200 mpc, and possibly beyond forselected regions of the parameter space. we also estimate the detection ratefor a number of model assumptions about black hole and white dwarf massfunctions and dynamical interactions: the rate is (not surprisingly) highlyuncertain, ranging from ~0.01 yr^-1 to ~100 yr^-1. this is due to the currentlimited theoretical understanding and minimal observational constraints forthese objects and processes. however, capture rate scaling arguments favor thehigh end of the above range, making likely the detection of several eventsduring the lisa lifetime.

astro-ph;0006206	grb 991216 joins the jet set: discovery and monitoring of its optical  afterglow	the optical light curve of the energetic gamma-ray burst grb 991216 isconsistent with jet-like behavior in which a power-law decay steepens fromt**(-1.22 +/- 0.04) at early times to t**(-1.53 +/- 0.05) in a gradualtransition at around 2 d. the derivation of the late-time decay slope takesinto account the constant contribution of a host or intervening galaxy whichwas measured 110 d after the event at r = 24.56 +/- 0.14, although the lightcurve deviates from a single power law whether or not a constant term isincluded. the early-time spectral energy distribution of the afterglow can bedescribed as f_nu ~ nu**(-0.74 +/- 0.05) or flatter between optical and x-ray,which, together with the slow initial decay, is characteristic of standardadiabatic evolution in a uniformly dense medium. assuming that a reportedabsorption-line redshift of 1.02 is correct, the apparent isotropic energy of6.7 x 10**53 erg is reduced by a factor of ~ 200 in the jet model, and theinitial half-opening angle is ~ 6 deg. grb 991216 is the third good example ofa jet-like afterglow (following grb 990123 and grb 990510), supporting a trendin which the apparently most energetic gamma-ray events have the narrowestcollimation and a uniform ism environment. this, plus the absence of evidencefor supernovae associated with jet-like afterglows, suggests that these eventsmay originate from a progenitor in which angular momentum plays an importantrole but a massive stellar envelope or wind does not, e.g., the coalescence ofa compact binary.

astro-ph;0006335	the transient x-ray source sax j2239.3+6116 and its optical counterpart	we have discovered with the wide field cameras on board bepposax the weaktransient x-ray source saxj2239.3+6116 whose position coincides with that of4u2238+60/3a2237+608 and is close to that of the fast transient at2238+60 andthe unidentified egret source 3eg2227+6122. the data suggest that the sourceexhibits outbursts that last for a few weeks and peak to a flux of 4e-10erg/s/cm2 (2-10 kev) at maximum. during the peak the x-ray spectrum is hardwith a photon index of -1.1+/-0.1. follow-up observations with the narrow-fieldinstruments on the same platform revealed a quiescent emission level that is1e+3 times less. searches through the data archive of the all-sky monitor onrxte result in the recognition of five outbursts in total from this sourceduring 1996-1999, with a regular interval time of 262 days. opticalobservations with the kpno 2.1 m telescope provide a likely opticalcounterpart. it is a b0 v to b2 iii star with broadened emission lines at anapproximate distance of 4.4 kpc. the distance implies a 2-10 kev luminosity inthe range from 1e+33 to 1e+36 erg/s. the evidence suggests that saxj2239.3+6116is a be x-ray binary with an orbital period of 262 days.

astro-ph;0209341	the asca x-ray spectrum of arp 102b and evaluation of simple models for  its associated, metastable fe ii absorber	we have observed the broad-line radio galaxy arp 102b with asca in order todetermine the absorbing column density towards its x-ray source and measure itsx-ray spectrum. the ultimate goal was to constrain the properties of the mediumresponsible for the metastable fe ii absorption lines observed in its uvspectrum. the 0.5-10 kev x-ray spectrum is described by a simple power-lawmodel of photon index 1.58+/-0.04 modified by photoelectric absorption with ancolumn density of (2.8+/-0.3)x10^{21} cm^{-2}. an fe k-alpha line is notdetected with an upper limit to its equivalent width of 200 ev (assuming fwhm =60,000 km/s. using the above column density the observed s.e.d. as constraints,we explore simple photoionization models for the absorber for a wide range ofdensities and ionization parameters in an effort to reproduce the strengths ofthe uv absorption lines. we find that densities of at least 1x10^{11} cm^{-3}are needed. however, a single ionization parameter cannot explain all of theobserved lines. an ionization parameter between 10^{-2.5} and 10^{-3.5} isneeded for the mg and fe lines and the soft x-ray absorption, but lines fromsi, c, al, and h require different density-ionization parameter combinations.according to the models, such an absorbing medium must be located very close tothe source of ionizing radiation (within 5,000 gravitational radii) and must bevery compact. as such, the properties of this absorbing medium differ fromthose of more luminous quasars, but are reminiscent of the absorber in theseyfert galaxy ngc 4151. we suggest that the absorber is in the form of thinsheets or filaments embedded in a wind wind that overlays the accretion disk ofarp 102b. this picture is consistent with all of the available constraints onthe central engine of this object.

astro-ph;0210300	long-term, continuous monitoring of the broad line radio galaxies 3c  390.3 and 3c 120 with the rossi x-ray timing explorer	we present a study of the flux and spectral variability of the two broad-lineradio galaxies (blrgs) 3c 390.3 and 3c 120, observed almost daily with rxte fornearly two months each in 1996 and 1997, respectively. our original motivationfor this study was to search for systematic differences between blrgs and theirradio-quiet counterparts, the seyfert galaxies, whose temporal and spectralbehavior is better studied. we find that both 3c 390.3 and 3c 120 are highlyvariable, but in a different way, and quantify this difference by means of astructure function analysis. 3c 390.3 is significantly more variable than 3c120, despite its jet larger inclination angle, implying either that the x-rayvariability is not dominated by the jet or that two different variabilityprocesses are simultaneously at work in 3c 390.3. we performed anenergy-selected and time-resolved analysis based on the fractional variabilityamplitude and found that the variability amplitude of both objects is stronglyanticorrelated with the energy. this last result, along with the correlatedchange of the photon index with the x-ray continuum flux, can be qualitativelyexplained within the scenario of thermal comptonization, generally invoked forradio-quiet active galaxies. moreover, the time-resolved and energy-selectedfractional variability analyses show a trend opposite to that observed injet-dominated agn (blazars), suggesting only a minor contribution of the jet tothe x-ray properties of blrgs. time-averaged spectral analysis indicates thepresence of a strong, resolved iron line with centroid at 6.4 kev and a weakreflection component in both objects. the overall pca+hexte spectra are bestfitted with the constant density ionization model of ross &amp; fabian, but with amodest ionization parameter(abridged).

astro-ph;0211122	evolution of the accretion disk in the nucleus of ngc 1097	we discuss the long-term evolution of the broad double-peaked h alpha profileof the liner/seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc 1097. besides the previously knownvariation of the relative intensities of the blue and red peaks, the profilehas recently shown an increasing separation between the two peaks, at the sametime as the integrated flux has decreased. we successfully model thesevariations using a precessing asymmetric accretion disk with a varyingemissivity law. we interpret the emissivity variation as due to the fact thatthe source of ionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximumemission to drift inwards (and thus to regions of higher velocities). inaddition, in the last 3 yrs of observations, the central wavelength of thedouble-peaked line has shifted to bluer wavelengths, which may be due to a windfrom the disk. it is the first time that such evolution is observed so clearly,giving additional support for an accretion disk as the origin of thedouble-peaked profile in ngc 1097.

(2) a second shell producesabsorption lines with a relative velocity of 560 km/s, and this is associatedwith the shell created by the fast massive star wind blowing a bubble in thepreceding slow wind at a radial distance of order 10 pc. (3) more distantclouds within the host galaxy lie between 30-2500 pc, where they have beenionized by the burst. (4-6) the massive star wind has clumps with radii andover-densities of 0.022, 0.063, and 0.12 parsecs and 50%, 10%, and 10%respectively. the immediate progenitor of the burster could either be a wc-typewolf-rayet star or a highly evolved star whose original mass was just too smallfor it to become a wn-type wolf-rayet star.

astro-ph;0308077	simulating the early evolution of the hard x-ray properties of a young  stellar population	we present an x-ray binary population synthesis model, and use it to simulatethe evolution of x-ray binaries formed in a burst of star formation of duration20 myr and star-formation rate 10 m_sun/yr. our goal is to explain the hard(2-10 kev) x-ray properties of populations of extragalactic x-ray binariesrecently observed by the chandra x-ray observatory, especially those associatedwith recent or ongoing episodes of vigorous star formation. our simulated x-raybinary population reaches a maximum 2-10 kev luminosity of ~4e40 erg/s afterapproximately 20 myr. the x-ray luminous phase is sustained for a period ofseveral hundreds of myr by succeeding populations of systems with lightersecondary stars, i.e., it persists long after the star-formation episode hasended. these results are insensitive to the poorly-constrained values of theinitial mass function and the average mass ratio between accreting and donorstars. the computed peak x-ray luminosity is consistent withobservationally-derived correlations between the star-formation rate and theobserved hard x-ray luminosity. model cumulative luminosity functions at theearliest times have power-law indices in agreement with those derived fromobservations of actively star-forming galaxies. the model cumulative luminosityfunctions become increasingly steeper with time as the most luminous systemsdie off, which offers an explanation for the difference in the slopes ofobserved cumulative luminosity functions of young and old stellar populations.

astro-ph;0409685	non-stationary variability in agn: the case of 3c 390.3	we use data from a two-year intensive rxte monitoring campaign of thebroad-line radio galaxy 3c 390.3 to investigate its stationarity. in order toexploit the potential information contained in a time series more efficiently,we use a multi-technique approach. specifically, the temporal properties arefirst studied with a technique borrowed from non-linear dynamics. then weutilize traditional linear techniques both in the fourier domain, by estimatingthe power spectral density, and in the time domain with a structure functionanalysis. finally we investigate directly the probability density functionassociated with the physical process underlying the signal. all the methodsdemonstrate the presence of non-stationarity. the structure function analysis,and (at a somewhat lower significance level) the power spectral density suggestthat 3c 390.3 is not even second order stationarity. this result indicates, forthe first time, that the variability properties of the active galactic nucleilight curves may also vary with time, in the same way as they do in galacticblack holes, strengthening the analogy between the x-ray variability propertiesof the two types of objects.

astro-ph;0604487	the central engines of 19 liners as viewed by chandra	using archival chandra observations of 19 liners we explore the x-rayproperties of their inner kiloparsec to determine the origin of their nuclearx-ray emission, to investigate the presence of an agn, and to identify thepower source of the optical emission lines. the relative numbers of liner typesin our sample are similar to those in optical spectroscopic surveys. we findthat diffuse, thermal emission is very common and is concentrated within thecentral few hundred parsec. the average spectra of the hot gas in spirals andellipticals are very similar to those of normal galaxies. they can be fittedwith a thermal plasma (kt~0.5 kev) plus a power law (photon index of 1.3-1.5)model. there are on average 3 detected point sources in their inner kiloparsecwith l(0.5-10 kev)~10^37-10^40 erg/s. the average cumulative luminosityfunctions for sources in spirals and ellipticals are identical to those ofnormal galaxies. in the innermost circle of 2.5" radius in each galaxy we findan agn in 12 of the 19 galaxies. the agns contribute a median of 60% of the0.5-10 kev luminosity of the central 2.5" region, they have luminosities of10^37-10^39 erg/s (eddington ratios 10^-8 to 10^-5). the ionizing luminosity ofthe agns is not enough to power the observed optical emission lines in thisparticular sample. thus, we suggest that the lines are powered either by themechanical interaction of an agn jet (or wind) with the circumnuclear gas, orby stellar processes, e.g. photoionization by post-agb stars or young stars.

astro-ph;0607226	the x-ray properties of active galactic nuclei with double-peaked balmer  lines	double-peaked balmer-line profiles originate in the accretion disks of a fewpercent of optically selected agn. the reasons behind the strong low-ionizationline emission from the accretion disks of these objects is still uncertain. inthis paper, we characterize the x-ray properties of 39 double-peaked balmerline agn, 29 from the sloan digital sky survey and 10 low optical-luminositydouble-peaked emitters from earlier radio-selected samples. we find that theuv-to-x-ray slope of radio-quiet (rq) double-peaked emitters as a class doesnot differ substantially from that of normal rq agn with similar uvmonochromatic luminosity. the radio-loud (rl) double-peaked emitters, with theexception of liner galaxies, are more luminous in the x-rays than rq agn, ashas been observed for other rl agn with single-peaked profiles. the x-rayspectral shapes of double-peaked emitters, measured by their hardness ratios orpower-law photon indices, are also largely consistent with those of normal agnof similar radio-loudness. in practically all cases studied here, externalillumination of the accretion disk is necessary to produce the balmer-lineemission, as the gravitational energy released locally in the disk by viscousstresses is insufficient to produce lines of the observed strength. in theappendix we study the variability of mrk 926, a double-peaked emitter withseveral observations in the optical and x-ray bands.

astro-ph;0612028	probing quasar outflows with intrinsic narrow absorption lines	we present statistical and monitoring results of narrow absorption lines thatare physically related to quasars (i.e., intrinsic nals). we use keck/hiresspectra of 37 optically bright quasars at z=2-4, and identify 150 nal systemsthat contain 124 c iv, 12 n v, and 50 si iv doublets. among them, 39 areclassified as intrinsic systems based on partial coverage analysis. at least50% of quasars host intrinsic nals. we identify two families of intrinsicsystems based on their ionization state. some intrinsic systems have detectablelow-ionization nals at similar velocities as higher-ionization nals, althoughsuch low-ionization lines are rare in broad absorption line (bal) systems. wealso have observed an optically bright quasar, hs1603+3820, eight times withsubaru/hds and het/mrs over an interval of 4.2 years (1.2 years in the quasarrest frame), for the purpose of monitoring a variable c iv mini-bal system. wefind that all the troughs of the system vary in concert. however, no othercorrelations are seen between the variations of different profile parameters.we propose that the observed variations are either (i) a result of rapidcontinuum fluctuations, caused by a clumpy screen of variable optical depthlocated between the continuum source and the mini-bal gas, or (ii) a result ofvariable scattering of continuum photons around the absorber.

astro-ph;0702101	a census of intrinsic narrow absorption lines in the spectra of quasars  at z=2-4	we use keck/hires spectra of 37 optically bright quasars at z=2-4 to studynarrow absorption lines that are intrinsic to the quasars (intrinsic nals,produced in gas that is physically associated with the quasar central engine).we identify 150 nal systems, that contain 124 c iv, 12 n v, and 50 si ivdoublets, of which 18 are associated systems (within 5,000 km/s of the quasarredshift). we use partial coverage analysis to separate intrinsic nals fromnals produced in cosmologically intervening structures. we find 39 candidateintrinsic systems, (28 reliable determinations and 11 that are possiblyintrinsic). we estimate that 10-17% of c iv systems at blueshifts of5,000-70,000 km/s relative to quasars are intrinsic. at least 32% of quasarscontain one or more intrinsic c iv nals. considering n v and si iv doubletsshowing partial coverage as well, at least 50% of quasars host intrinsic nals.this result constrains the solid angle subtended by the absorbers to thebackground source(s). we identify two families of intrinsic nal systems, thosewith strong n v absorption, and those with negligible absorption in n v, butwith partial coverage in the c iv doublet. we discuss the idea that these twofamilies represent different regions or conditions in accretion disk winds. ofthe 26 intrinsic c iv nal systems, 13 have detectable low-ionization absorptionlines at similar velocities, suggesting that these are two-phase structures inthe wind rather than absorbers in the host galaxy. we also compare possiblemodels for quasar outflows, including radiatively accelerated disk-drivenwinds, magnetocentrifugally accelerated winds, and pressure-driven winds, andwe discuss ways of distinguishing between these models observationally.

astro-ph;0702594	long-term profile variability of double peaked emission lines in active  galactic nuclei	we present up to two decades of spectroscopic monitoring of the double-peakedbroad halpha emission lines of seven broad-line radio galaxies. these extremelybroad, double-peaked lines are successfully modeled by emission from gas in theouter accretion disk, and their profiles vary on timescales of months to years.this variability is a valuable probe for understanding the structure anddynamics of the accretion disk. we characterize the long-term broad-lineprofile variability in detail, and compare the evolution of the line profileswith predictions from a few simple physical models for dynamical processes inthe accretion disk. we find no evidence for persistent, periodic variabilitythat would be indicative of a precessing elliptical disk, or a circular diskwith a long-lived, single-armed spiral or warp. we do find transient, periodicvariability on the orbital timescale, possibly resulting from shocks induced bytidal perturbations, and variability in the wings of the profile which suggestschanges in the emissivity of the inner accretion flow. dramatic but localizedprofile changes are observed during flares and high-states of broad-line flux.in 3c 332, these changes can be explained by a slow, smooth, secular change indisk illumination. in arp 102b and 3c 390.3, however, a simple disk modelcannot explain the asymmetric profile changes, suggesting a need for moresophisticated models. we also observe sharp, transient features that appear inthe blue peak of the objects, which require a well-organized velocity field.

astro-ph;0702742	discovery of probable relativistic fe emission and absorption in the  cloverleaf quasar h 1413+117	we present results from chandra and xmm-newton observations of thelow-ionization broad absorption line (lobal) quasar h 1413+117. our spatial andspectral analysis of a recent deep chandra observation confirms a microlensingevent in a previous chandra observation performed about 5 years earlier. wepresent constraints on the structure of the accretion flow in h 1413+117 basedon the time-scale of this microlensing event. our analysis of the combinedspectrum of all the images indicates the presence of two emission peaks atrest-frame energies of 5.35 kev and 6.32 kev detected at the &gt; 98% and &gt; 99%confidence levels, respectively. the double peaked fe emission line is fit wellwith an accretion-disk line model, however, the best-fitting model parametersare neither well constrained nor unique. additional observations are requiredto constrain the model parameters better and to confirm the relativisticinterpretation of the double peaked fe kalpha line. another possibleinterpretation of the fe emission is fluorescent fe emission from the back-sideof the wind. the spectra of images c and d show significant high-energy broadabsorption features that extend up to rest-frame energies of 9 kev and 15 kevrespectively. we propose that a likely cause of these differences issignificant variability of the outflow on time-scales that are shorter than thetime-delays between the images. the chandra observation of h 1413+117 has madepossible for the first time the detection of the inner regions of the accretiondisk and/or wind and the high ionization component of the outflowing wind of alobal quasar.

astro-ph;9705176	evidence for a precessing accretion disk in the nucleus of ngc 1097	we present new spectroscopic observations of the liner (and now seyfert 1)nucleus of ngc 1097, and discuss the evolution of its broad, double-peakedbalmer lines. when originally discovered in 1991, the red peak of thedouble-peaked h-alpha line was stronger than the blue, while by 1994 theh-alpha profile had become almost symmetric and the integrated line flux haddecreased to half its original value. our new spectrum, taken in 1996, showsthat the broad, double-peaked lines have returned to almost their originalstrengths, the profiles of h-beta and h-alpha are identical to within errors,and the broad-line emitting region is unreddened. however, the profile of thebalmer lines is now such that the blue peak is stronger than the red, oppositeto the asymmetry observed in 1991. various models are considered for theobserved behavior, all assuming that the emission lines originate in anaccretion disk. we present a refined version of the precessing, planar,elliptical accretion ring model proposed by storchi-bergmann et al. anderacleous et al. this model provides an acceptable fit to the line profiles. wealso consider the possibility that the line profile evolution results from aprecessing warp in the disk, induced by irradiation from the center, and showthat the range of radii and precession time scales expected in this model areconsistent with the observations. the sudden appearance of the "disk-like"broad line profiles in ngc 1097 could have resulted from the formation of a newaccretion disk due to, for example, the tidal disruption of a star, or theillumination of a pre-existing disk by a transient ionizing source at thecenter of the disk.

astro-ph;9706222	rejection of the binary broad-line region interpretation of  double-peaked emission lines in three active galactic nuclei	it has been suggested that the peculiar double-peaked balmer lines of certainbroad-line radio galaxies come from individual broad-line regions associatedwith the black holes of a supermassive binary. we continue to search forevidence of the radial velocity variations characteristic of a double-linedspectroscopic binary that are required in such a model. after spectroscopicmonitoring of three suitable candidates (arp 102b, 3c 390.3, and 3c 332)spanning two decades, we find no such long-term systematic changes in radialvelocity. a trend noticed by gaskell in one of the balmer-line peaks of 3c390.3 before 1988 did not continue after that year, invalidating his inferredorbital period and mass. instead, we find lower limits on the plausible orbitalperiods that would require the assumed supermassive binaries in all threeobjects to have total masses in excess of 10^10 solar masses. in the case of 3c390.3 the total binary mass must exceed 10^11 solar masses to satisfyadditional observational constraints on the inclination angle. such largebinary black hole masses are difficult to reconcile with other observations andwith theory. in addition, there are peculiar properties of the line profilesand flux ratios in these objects that are not explained by ordinary broad-lineregion cloud models. we therefore doubt that the double-peaked line profiles ofthe three objects arise in a pair of broad-line regions. rather, they are muchmore likely to be intimately associated with a single black hole.

astro-ph;9801173	optical identification of the hardest x-ray source in the asca large sky  survey	we report the optical identification of the hardest x-ray source (axj131501+3141) detected in an unbiased wide-area survey in the 0.5--10 kev band,the asca large sky survey. the x-ray spectrum of the source is very hard and iswell reproduced by a power-law component (gamma = 1.5^+0.7_-0.6) with n_h =6^+4_-2 *10^22 cm^-2 (sakano et al. 1998). we have found a galaxy with r=15.62mag near the center of the error circle for the x-ray source. the opticalspectrum of the galaxy shows only narrow emission lines whose ratios correspondto those of a type 2 seyfert galaxy at z = 0.072, implying anabsorption-corrected x-ray luminosity of 2*10^43 erg sec^-1 (2--10 kev) and m_b= -20.93 mag. a radio point source is also associated with the center of thegalaxy. we thus identify the x-ray source with this galaxy as an obscured agn.the hidden nature of the nucleus of the galaxy in the optical band isconsistent with the x-ray spectrum. these results support the idea that theobscured agns/qsos contribute significantly to the cosmic x-ray background inthe hard band at the faint flux level.

astro-ph;9809174	euve j0425.6-5714: a newly discovered am herculis star	we detected a new am her star serendipitously in a 25 day observation withthe euve satellite. a coherent period of 85.82 min is present in the euve deepsurvey imager light curve of this source. a spectroscopic identification ismade with a 19th magnitude blue star that has h and he emission lines, andbroad cyclotron humps typical of a magnetic cataclysmic variable. a lower limitto the polar magnetic field of 46 mg is estimated from the spacing of thecyclotron harmonics. euve j0425.6-5714 is also detected in archival rosat hriobservations spanning two months, and its stable and highly structured lightcurve permits us to fit a coherent ephemeris linking the rosat and euve dataover a 1.3 yr gap. the derived period is 85.82107 +/- 0.00020 min, and theephemeris should be accurate to 0.1 cycles until the year 2005. a narrow butpartial x-ray eclipse suggests that this object belongs to the group of am herstars whose viewing geometry is such that the accretion stream periodicallyoccults the soft x-ray emitting accretion spot on the surface of the whitedwarf. a non-detection of hard x-rays from asca observations that arecontemporaneous with the rosat hri shows that the soft x-rays must dominate byat least an order of magnitude, which is consistent with a known trend among amher stars with large magnetic field. this object should not be confused withthe seyfert galaxy 1h 0419-577 (= lb 1727), another x-ray/euv source which liesonly 4' away, and was the principal target of these monitoring observations.

astro-ph;9905365	an x-ray spectral survey of radio-loud agn with asca	we present a uniform and systematic analysis of the 0.6-10 kev x-ray spectraof radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) observed by asca. the sample 10blrgs, 5 qsrs, 9 nlrgs, and 10 rgs. at soft x-rays, about half of the nlrgs andall of the rgs exhibit a thermal plasma component, with a bimodal distributionof temperatures and luminosities, suggesting an origin either in a surroundingcluster or loose group or in a hot corona. at energies above 2 kev, a hardpower-law component is detected in 90% of cases. the power-law photon indicesand luminosities in blrgs, qsrs, and nlrgs are similar, consistent withorientation-based unification schemes. significant excess cold absorption isdetected in most nlrgs, but also in some blrgs and qsrs, which was somewhatunexpected. in contrast to seyfert galaxies, only one object showss thesignature of a warm absorber. the nuclear x-ray luminosity is correlated withthe luminosity of the [o iii] emission line, the fir emission at 12 microns,and the lobe radio power at 5 ghz. the fe k line is detected in 50% of blrgs,one qsr, and a handful of nlrgs. this sample also includes 6 weak line radiogalaxies (wlrgs). their spectra wlrgs can be generally decomposed into a softthermal component with hard absrorbed power-law component, which issignificantly flatter than any other radio-loud agns. their intrinsicluminosities are two orders of magnitude lower than in other sources of thesample. an interesting possibility is that wlrgs represent an extremepopulation of radio galaxies in which the central black hole is accreting at arate well below the eddington rate.

astro-ph;9910375	the narrow-line regions of liners as resolved with the hubble space  telescope	liners exist in the nuclei of a large fraction of luminous galaxies, buttheir connection with the agn phenomenon has remained elusive. we presenthubble space telescope narrowband [o iii]5007 and h-alpha+[n ii] emission-lineimages of the central regions of 14 galaxies with liner nuclei. the compact, ~1arcsec-scale, unresolved emission that dominates the line flux in ground-basedobservations is mostly resolved by hst. the bulk of this emission comes fromregions with sizes of tens to hundreds of parsecs that are resolved into knots,filaments, and diffuse gas whose morphology differs from galaxy to galaxy. mostof the galaxies do not show clear linear structures or ionization conesanalogous to those often seen in seyfert galaxies. an exception is ngc 1052,the prototypical liner, in which we find a 3 arcsec-long (~ 250 pc) biconicalstructure that is oriented on the sky along the galaxy's radio jet axis. sevenof the galaxies have been shown in previously published hst images to have abright compact ultraviolet nuclear source, while the other seven do not have acentral uv source. our images find evidence of dust in the nuclear regions ofall 14 galaxies, with clear indications of nuclear obscuration in most of the"uv-dark" cases. the data suggest that the line-emitting gas in most liners isphotoionized by a central source (which may be stellar, nonstellar, or acombination thereof) but that this source is often hidden from direct view. wefind no obvious morphological differences between liners with detected weakbroad h-alpha wings in their spectra and those with only narrow lines.likewise, there is no clear morphological distinction between objects whose uvspectra are dominated by hot stars (e.g., ngc 4569) and those that are agn-like(e.g., ngc 4579).
