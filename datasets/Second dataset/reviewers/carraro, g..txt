0904.3199	an investigation of chromospheric activity spanning the vaughan--preston  gap: impact on stellar ages	chromospheric activity is widely used as an age indicator for solar-typestars based on the early evidence that there is a smooth evolution from youngand active to old and inactive stars. we analysed chromospheric activity infive solar-type stars in two open clusters, in order to study how chromosphericactivity evolves with time. we took uves high-resolution, high s/n ratiospectra of 3 stars in ic 4756 and 2 in ngc 5822, which were combined with apreviously studied data-set and reanalysed here. the emission core of the deep,photospheric ca ii k line was used as a probe of the chromospheric activity.all of the 5 stars in the new sample, including those in the 1.2 gyr-old ngc5822, have activity levels comparable to those of hyades and praesepe. a likelyinterpretation of our data is that solar-type-star chromospheric activity, fromthe age of the hyades until that of the sun, does not evolve smoothly. starschange from active to inactive on a short timescale. evolution before and aftersuch a transition is much less significant than cyclical and long-termvariations. we show that data presented in the literature to support acorrelation between age and activity could be also interpreted differently inthe light of our results.

0906.3014	a study of the galactic plane towards l = 305	we present optical ($ubvi_c$) observations of a rich and complex field in thegalactic plane towards $l \sim 305^{\circ}$ and $b \sim 0^{\circ}$. ouranalysis reveals a significantly high interstellar absorbtion ($a_v \sim 10$)and an abnormal extinction law in this line of sight. availing a considerablenumber of color combinations, the photometric diagrams allow us to derive newestimates of the fundamental parameters of the two open clusters danks~1 anddanks~2. due to the derived abnormal reddening law in this line of sight, bothclusters appear much closer (to the sun) than previously thought. %additionally, we present the optical colors and magnitudes of the wr~48a starand its main parameters were estimated. the properties of the two embeddedclusters dbs2003~130 and 131, are also addressed. we identify a number of youngstellar objects which are probable members of these clusters. this new materialis then used to revisit the spiral structure in this sector of the galaxyshowing evidence of populations associated with the inner galaxy scutum-cruxarm.

1002.2547	abundances and physical parameters for stars in the open clusters ngc  5822 and ic 4756	classical chemical analyses may be affected by systematic errors that wouldcause observed abundance differences between dwarfs and giants. for someelements, however, the abundance difference could be real. we address the issueby observing 2 solar--type dwarfs in ngc 5822 and 3 in ic 4756, and comparingtheir composition with that of 3 giants in either of the aforementionedclusters. we determine iron abundance and stellar parameters of the dwarfstars, and the abundances of calcium, sodium, nickel, titanium, aluminium,chromium, silicon and oxygen for both the giants and dwarfs. we acquired uveshigh-resolution, of high signal--to--noise ratio (s/n) spectra. the width ofthe cross correlation profiles was used to measure rotation velocities. forabundance determinations, the standard equivalent width analysis was performeddifferentially with respect to the sun. for lithium and oxygen, we derivedabundances by comparing synthetic spectra with observed line features. we findan iron abundance for dwarf stars equal to solar to within the margins of errorfor ic 4756, and slightly above for ngc 5822 ([fe/h]= 0.01 and 0.05 dexrespectively). the 3 stars in ng 4756 have lithium abundances between log n(li)2.6 and 2.8 dex, the two stars in ngc 5822 have log n(li) ~ 2.8 and 2.5,respectively. for sodium, silicon, and titanium, we show that abundances ofgiants are significantly higher than those of the dwarfs of the same cluster(about 0.15, 0.15, and 0.35 dex).

1008.3526	testing newtonian gravity with distant globular clusters: ngc1851 and  ngc1904	globular clusters are useful to test the validity of newtonian dynamics inthe low acceleration regime typical of galaxies, without the complications ofnon-baryonic dark matter. specifically, in absence of disturbing effects, e.g.tidal heating, their velocity dispersion is expected to vanish at large radii.if such behaviour is not observed, and in particular if, as observed inelliptical galaxies, the dispersion is found constant at large radii below acertain threshold acceleration, this might indicate a break down of newtoniandynamics.  to minimise the effects of tidal heating in this paper we study the velocitydispersion profile of two distant globular clusters, ngc 1851 and ngc 1904.  the velocity dispersion profile is derived from accurate radial velocitiesmeasurements, obtained at the eso 8m vlt telescope. reliable data for 184 and146 bona fide cluster star members, respectively for ngc 1851 and ngc 1904,were obtained.  these data allow to trace the velocity dispersion profile up to ~2r0, wherer0 is the radius at which the cluster internal acceleration of gravity is a0 =10e-8 cm/s/s. it is found that in both clusters the velocity dispersion becomesconstant beyond ~r0. these new results are fully in agreement with those foundfor other five globular clusters previously investigated as part of thisproject. taken all together, these 7 clusters support the claim that thevelocity dispersion is constant beyond r0, irrespectively of the specificphysical properties of the clusters: mass, size, dynamical history, anddistance from the milky way. the strong similarly with the constant velocitydispersion observed in elliptical galaxies beyond r0 is suggestive of a commonorigin for this phenomenon in the two class of objects, and might indicate abreakdown of newtonian dynamics below a0.

1011.1289	no evidence for a dark matter disk within 4 kpc from the galactic plane	we estimated the dynamical surface mass density (sigma) at the solargalactocentric distance between 2 and 4 kpc from the galactic plane, asinferred from the observed kinematics of the thick disk. we find sigma(z=2kpc)=57.6+-5.8 mo pc^-2, and it shows only a tiny increase in the z-rangeconsidered by our investigation. we compared our results with the expectationsfor the visible mass, adopting the most recent estimates in the literature forcontributions of the galactic stellar disk and interstellar medium, andproposed models of the dark matter distribution. our results match theexpectation for the visible mass alone, never differing from it by more than0.8 $mo pc^-2 at any z, and thus we find little evidence for any darkcomponent. we assume that the dark halo could be undetectable with our method,but the dark disk, recently proposed as a natural expectation of the lambdacdmmodels, should be detected. given the good agreement with the visible massalone, models including a dark disk are less likely, but within errors itsexistence cannot be excluded. in any case, these results put constraints on itsproperties: thinner models (scale height lower than 4 kpc) reconcile betterwith our results and, for any scale height, the lower-density models arepreferred. we believe that successfully predicting the stellar thick diskproperties and a dark disk in agreement with our observations could be achallenging theoretical task.

1011.6156	optical atmospheric extinction over cerro paranal	aims: the present study was conducted to determine the optical extinctioncurve for cerro paranal under typical clear-sky observing conditions, with anaccuracy of 0.01 mag/airmass. methods: the extinction curve of paranal wasobtained through low-resolution spectroscopy of 8 spectrophotometric standardstars observed with fors1 mounted at the 8.2 m very large telescope, covering aspectral range 3300-8000 a. a total of 600 spectra were collected on more than40 nights distributed over six months, from october 2008 to march 2009. theaverage extinction curve was derived using a global fit algorithm, whichallowed us to simultaneously combine all the available data. the mainatmospheric parameters were retrieved using the lblrtm radiative transfer code,which was also utilised to study the impact of variability of the mainmolecular bands of o2, o3, and h2o, and to estimate their column densities.results: in general, the extinction curve of paranal appears to conform tothose derived for other astronomical sites in the atacama desert, like la sillaand cerro tololo. however, a systematic deficit with respect to the extinctioncurve derived for cerro tololo before the el chichon eruption is detected below4000 a. we attribute this downturn to a non standard aerosol composition,probably revealing the presence of volcanic pollutants above the atacamadesert. an analysis of all spectroscopic extinction curves obtained since 1974shows that the aerosol composition has been evolving during the last 35 years.the persistence of traces of non meteorologic haze suggests the effect ofvolcanic eruptions, like those of el chichon and pinatubo, lasts severaldecades. the usage of the standard ctio and la silla extinction curvesimplemented in iraf and midas produce systematic over/under-estimates of theabsolute flux.

1106.3137	overlapping abundance gradients and azimuthal gradients related to the  spiral structure of the galaxy	the connection between some features of the metallicity gradient in thegalactic disk, best revealed by open clusters and cepheids, and the spiralstructure, is explored. the step-like abrupt decrease in metallicity at 8.5 kpc(with r_0= 7.5 kpc, or at 9.5 kpc if r_0 = 8.5 kpc is adopted) is wellexplained by the corotation ring-shaped gap in the density of gas, whichisolates the internal and external regions of the disk one from the other. thissolves a long standing problem of understanding the different chemicalcharacteristics of the inner and outer parts of the disk. the time required tobuild up the metallicity difference between the two sides of the step is ameasure of the minimal life-time of the present grand-design spiral patternstructure, of the order of 3 gyr. the plateaux observed on each side of thestep are interpreted in terms of the large scale radial motion of the stars andof the gas flow induced by the spiral structure. the star-formation raterevealed by the density of open clusters is maximum in the galactic radialrange from 6 to 12 kpc (with an exception of a narrow gap at corotation),coinciding with the region where the 4-arms mode is allowed to exist. we arguethat most of the old open clusters situated at large galactocentric radii wereborn in this inner region where conditions more favorable to star-formation arefound. the ratio of $\alpha$-elements to fe of the sample of cepheids does notvary appreciably with the galactic radius, which reveals an homogeneous historyof star formation. different arguments are given showing that usualapproximations of chemical evolution models, which assume fast mixing ofmetallicity in the azimuthal direction and ignore the existence of the spiralarms, are a poor ones.

1203.0546	the origin and orbit of the old, metal-rich, open cluster ngc 6791:  insights from kinematics	ngc 6791 is a unique stellar system among galactic open clusters being at thesame time one of the oldest open clusters and the most metal rich. combinationof its properties is puzzling and poses question of its origin. one possiblescenario is that the cluster formed close to the galactic center and latermigrated outwards to its current location. in this work we study the cluster'sorbit and investigate the possible migration processes which might havedisplaced ngc 6791 to its present-day position, under the assumption that itactually formed in the inner disk. to this aim we performed integrations of ngc6791's orbit in a potential consistent with the main milky way parameters. inaddition to analytical expressions for halo, bulge and disk, we also considerthe effect of bar and spiral arm perturbations, which are expected to be veryimportant for the disk dynamical evolution, especially inside the solar circle.starting from state-of-the art initial conditions for ngc 6791, we calculate1000 orbits back in time for about 1 gyr turning on and off differentnon-axisymmetric components of the global potential. we then comparestatistical estimates of the cluster's recent orbital parameters with theorbital parameters of 10^4 test-particles originating close to the galacticcenter (having initial galocentric radii in the range of 3-5 kpc) andundergoing radial migration during 8 gyr of forward integration. we find that amodel which incorporates a strong bar and spiral arm perturbations can indeedbe responsible for the migration of ngc 6791 from the inner disk (galocentricradii of 3-5 kpc) to its present-day location. such a model can provide orbitalparameters which are close enough to the observed ones. however, theprobability of this scenario as it results from our investigations is very low.

1207.3328	the unique na:o abundance distribution in ngc 6791: the first open(?)  cluster with multiple populations	almost all globular clusters investigated exhibit a spread in their lightelement abundances, the most studied being a na:o anticorrelation. in contrast,open clusters show a homogeneous composition and are still regarded as simplestellar populations. the most probable reason for this difference is thatglobulars had an initial mass high enough to retain primordial gas and ejectafrom the first stellar generation and thus formed a second generation with adistinct composition, an initial mass exceeding that of open clusters. ngc 6791is a massive open cluster, and warrants a detailed search for chemicalinhomogeneities. we collected high resolution, high s/n spectra of 21 memberscovering a wide range of evolutionary status and measured their na, o and fecontent. we found [fe/h]=+0.42$\pm 0.01$, in good agreement with previousvalues, and no evidence for a spread. however, the na:o distribution iscompletely unprecedented. it becomes the first open cluster to show intrinsicabundance variations that cannot be explained by mixing, and thus the firstdiscovered to host multiple populations. it is also the first star cluster toexhibit two subpopulations in the na:o diagram with one being chemicallyhomogeneous while the second has an intrinsic spread that follows theanticorrelation so far displayed only by globular clusters. ngc 6791 is uniquein many aspects, displaying certain characteristics typical of open clusters,others more reminiscent of globulars, and yet others, in particular its na:obehavior investigated here, that are totally unprecedented. it clearly had acomplex and fascinating history.

1310.5900	ruprecht 106: the first single population globular cluster?	all old galactic globular clusters studied in detail to date host at leasttwo generations of stars, where the second is formed from gas polluted byprocessed material produced by massive stars of the first. this process canhappen if the initial mass of the cluster exceeds a threshold above whichejecta are retained and a second generation is formed. a determination of thismass-threshold is mandatory in order to understand how gcs form. we analyzed 9rgb stars belonging to the cluster ruprecht 106. targets were observed with theuves@vlt2 spectrograph. spectra cover a wide range and allowed us to measureabundances for light (o,na,mg,al), alpha (si,ca,ti), iron-peak(sc,v,cr,mn,fe,co,ni,cu,zn) and neutron-capture(y,zr,ba,la,ce,pr,nd,sm,eu,dy,pb) elements. based on these abundances we showthat ruprecht 106 is the first convincing example of a single population gc(i.e. a true simple stellar population), although the sample is relativelysmall. this result is supported also by an independent photometric test and bythe hb morphology and the dynamical state. it is old (~12 gyrs) and, at oddswith other gcs, has no alpha-enhancement. the material it formed from wascontaminated by both s- and r- process elements. the abundance pattern pointstoward an extragalactic origin. its present day mass (m=10^4.83 msun) can beassumed as a strong lower limit for the initial mass threshold below which nosecond generation is formed. clearly, its initial mass must have beensignificantly greater but we have no current constraints on the amount of massloss during its evolution.

1402.1687	age determination of fifteen old to intermediate-age small magellanic  cloud star clusters	we present cmds in the v and i bands for fifteen star clusters in the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) based on data taken with the very large telescope (vlt,chile). we selected these clusters from our previous work, wherein we derivedcluster radial velocities and metallicities from calcium ii infrared triplet(cat) spectra also taken with the vlt. we discovered that the ages of six ofour clusters have been appreciably underestimated by previous studies, whichused comparatively small telescopes, graphically illustrating the need forlarge apertures to obtain reliable ages of old and intermediate-age smc starclusters. in particular, three of these clusters, l4, l6 and l110, turn out tobe amongst the oldest smc clusters known, with ages of 7.9 +- 1.1, 8.7 +- 1.2and 7.6 +- 1.0 gyr, respectively, helping to fill a possible "smc cluster agegap" (glatt et al. 2008). using the present ages and metallicities from parisiet al. (2009), we analyze the age distribution, age gradient and agemetallicity relation (amr) of a sample of smc clusters measured homogeneously.there is a suggestion of bimodality in the age distribution but it does notshow a constant slope for the first 4 gyr (piatti 2011), and we find noevidence for an age gradient. due to the improved ages of our cluster sample,we find that our amr is now better represented in the intermediate/old periodthan that we derived in parisi et al. (2009), where we simply took agesavailable in the literature. additionally, clusters younger than aprox. 4 gyrnow show better agreement with the bursting model, but we confirm that thismodel is not a good representation of the amr during the intermediate-age/oldperiod. a more complicated model is needed to explain the smc chemicalevolution in that period.

[ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1406.0550	uncovering multiple populations with washington photometry: i. the  globular cluster ngc 1851	the analysis of multiple populations (mps) in globular clusters (gcs) hasbecome a forefront area of research in astronomy. multiple red giant branches(rgbs), subgiant branches (sgbs), and even main sequences (mss) have now beenobserved photometrically in many gcs. uv photometry has been crucial indiscovering and analyzing these mps, but the johnson u and the stromgren andsloan u filters that have generally been used are relatively inefficient andvery sensitive to reddening and atmospheric extinction. in contrast, thewashington c filter is much broader and redder than these competing uv filters.here we investigate the use of the washington system to uncover mps using onlya 1-meter telescope. our analysis of the well-studied gc ngc 1851 finds thatthe c filter is both very efficient and effective at detecting its previouslydiscovered mps in the rgb and sgb. remarkably, we have also detected anintrinsically broad ms best characterized by two distinct but heavilyoverlapping populations that cannot be explained by binaries, field stars, orphotometric errors. the ms distribution is in very good agreement with thatseen on the rgb, with ~30% of the stars belonging to the second population.there is also evidence for two sequences in the red horizontal branch, but thisappears to be unrelated to the mps in this cluster. neither of these latterphenomena have been observed previously in this cluster. the redder ms starsare also more centrally concentrated than the blue ms. this is the first timemps in a ms have been discovered from the ground, and using only a 1-metertelescope. the washington system thus proves to be a very powerful tool forinvestigating mps, and holds particular promise for extragalactic objects wherephotons are limited.

1407.0485	clues on the galactic evolution of sulphur from star clusters	(abridged) the abundances of alpha-elements are a powerful diagnostic of thestar formation history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. sulphur, beingmoderately volatile, can be reliably measured in the interstellar medium (ism)of damped ly-alpha galaxies and extragalactic hii regions. measurements instars of different metallicity in our galaxy can then be readily compared tothe abundances in external galaxies. such a comparison is not possible for sior ca that suffer depletion onto dust in the ism. furthermore, studying sulphuris interesting because it probes nucleosynthetic conditions that are verydifferent from those of o or mg. the measurements in star clusters are areliable tracers of the galactic evolution of sulphur. we find&lt;a(s)&gt;nlte=6.11+/-0.04 for m 4, &lt;a(s)&gt;nlte=7.17+/-0.02 for ngc 2477, and&lt;a(s)&gt;nlte=7.13+/-0.06 for ngc 5822. for the only star studied in trumpler 5 wefind a(s)nlte=6.43+/-0.03 and a(s)lte=6.94+/-0.05. our measurements show that,by and large, the s abundances in galactic clusters trace reliably those infield stars. the only possible exception is trumpler 5, for which the nltesulphur abundance implies an [s/fe] ratio lower by roughly 0.4 dex thanobserved in field stars of comparable metallicity, even though its lte sulphurabundance is in line with abundances of field stars. moreover the lte sulphurabundance is consistent only with the abundance of another alpha-element, mg,in the same star, while the low nlte value is consistent with si and ca. the sabundances in our sample of stars in clusters imply that the clusters arechemically homogeneous for s within 0.05 dex.

1408.4163	the effect of spatial resolution on optical and near-ir studies of  stellar clusters: implications for the origin of the red excess	recent ground based near-ir studies of stellar clusters in nearby galaxieshave suggested that young clusters remain embedded for 7-10myr in theirprogenitor molecular cloud, in conflict with optical based studies which findthat clusters are exposed after 1-3myr. here, we investigate the role thatspatial resolution plays in this apparent conflict. we use a recent catalogueof young ($&lt;10$~myr) massive ($&gt;5000$~\msun) clusters in the nearby spiralgalaxy, m83, along with hubble space telescope (hst) imaging in the optical andnear-ir, and ground based near-ir imaging, to see how the colours (and henceestimated properties such as age and extinction) are affected by the aperturesize employed, in order to simulate studies of differing resolution. we findthat the near-ir is heavily affected by the resolution, and when aperture sizes$&gt;40$~pc are used, all young/blue clusters move red-ward in colour space, whichresults in their appearance as heavily extincted clusters. however, this is dueto contamination from nearby sources and nebular emission, and is not anextinction effect. optical colours are much less affected by resolution. due tothe larger affect of contamination in the near-ir, we find that, in some cases,clusters will appear to show near-ir excess when large ($&gt;20$~pc) apertures areused. our results explain why few young ($&lt;6$~myr), low extinction ($\av &lt;1$~mag) clusters have been found in recent ground based near-ir studies ofcluster populations, while many such clusters have been found in higherresolution hst based studies. additionally, resolution effects appear to (atleast partially) explain the origin of the near-ir excess that has been foundin a number of extragalactic ymcs.

(2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1411.1422	new insights on ba over-abundance in open clusters. evidence for the  intermediate neutron-capture process at play?	recently an increasing number of studies were devoted to measure theabundances of neutron-capture elements heavier than iron in stars belonging togalactic open clusters (ocs). ocs span a sizeable range in metallicity-0.6&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar to diskstars of the same age. a different pattern is observed for heavy elements. alarge scatter is observed for ba, with most ocs showing [ba/fe] and [ba/la]overabundant with respect to the sun. the origin of this overabundance is notclearly understood. with the goal of providing new observational insights wedetermined radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical compositionof 27 giant stars members of five ocs: cr 110, cr 261, ngc 2477, ngc 2506 andngc 5822. we used high-resolution spectra obtained with the uves spectrographat eso paranal. we perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of these stars tomeasure the abundance of up to 22 elements per star. we study the dependence ofelement abundance on metallicity and age with unprecedented detail,complementing our analysis with data culled from the literature. we confirm thetrend of ba overabundance in ocs, and show its large dispersion for clustersyounger than ~4 gyr. finally, the implications of our results for stellarnucleosynthesis are discussed. we show in this work that the ba enrichmentcompared to other neutron-capture elements in ocs cannot be explained by thecontributions from the slow neutron-capture process and the rapidneutron-capture process. instead, we argue that this anomalous signature can beexplained by assuming an additional contribution by the intermediateneutron-capture process.

1411.2625	on local dark matter density	in 2012, we applied a three-dimensional formulation to kinematic measurementsof the galactic thick disk and derived a surprisingly low dark matter densityat the solar position. this result was challenged by bovy &amp; tremaine (2012,apj, 756, 89), who claimed that the observational data are consistent with theexpected dark matter density if a one-dimensional approach is adopted. weanalyze the assumption at the bases of their formulation and their claim thatthis returns a lower limit for the local dark matter density, which is accuratewithin 20%. we find that the validity of their formulation depends on theunderlying mass distribution. we therefore analyze the predictions that theirhypothesis casts on the radial gradient of the azimuthal velocity dv/dr andcompare it with observational data as a testbed for the validity of theirformulation. we find that their hypothesis requires too steep a profile ofdv(z)/dr, which is inconsistent with the observational data both in the milkyway and in external galaxies. as a consequence, their results are biased andlargely overestimate the mass density. dynamical simulations also show that,contrary to their claims, low values of dv/dr are compatible with a milky waylike potential with radially constant circular velocity. we neverthelessconfirm that, according to their criticism, our assumption dv/dr=0 is only anapproximation. if this hypothesis is released, and the available informationabout dv/dr in the thick disk is used, the resulting local dark matter densityincreases by a tiny amount, from 0+-1 to 2+-3 mm_sun pc^(-3), with an upperlimit of ~3.5 mm_sun pc^(-3). hence, this approximation has negligibleinfluence on our results. our analysis shows that their criticism is not aviable explanation for the inferred lack of dark matter at the solar positiondetected by us. more studies are required to understand these unexpectedresults.

1411.4886	the gaia-eso survey: kinematics of seven galactic globular clusters	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed atinvestigating the origin and formation history of our galaxy by collectingspectroscopy of representative samples (about 10^5 milky way stars) of allgalactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. the survey usesglobular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellaratmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars inclusters, along with radial velocity determinations. we used precise radialvelocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (ngc 1851, ngc2808, ngc 4372, ngc 4833, ngc 5927, ngc 6752, and ngc 7078) to validatepipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internalkinematics. radial velocity measurements were extracted from flames/giraffespectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal datarelease of data products to eso. we complemented our sample with eso archivaldata obtained with different instrument configurations. reliable radialvelocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained intotal. we measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions,and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters,providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of thecentral velocity dispersion for the cluster ngc~5927. finally, we explore thepossible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. theanalysis we present here demonstrates that gaia-eso survey data aresufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systemsand stellar populations in the milky way.

1502.06632	evidence of tidal distortions and mass loss from the old open cluster  ngc 6791	we present the first evidence of clear signatures of tidal distortions in thedensity distribution of the fascinating open cluster ngc 6791. we used deep andwide-field data obtained with the canada-france-hawaii-telescope covering a 2x2square degrees area around the cluster. the two-dimensional density mapobtained with the optimal matched filter technique shows a clear elongation andan irregular distribution starting from ~300" from the cluster center. atlarger distances, two tails extending in opposite directions beyond the tidalradius are also visible. these features are aligned to both the absolute propermotion and to the galactic center directions. moreover, other overdensitiesappear to be stretched in a direction perpendicular to the galactic plane.accordingly to the behaviour observed in the density map, we find that both thesurface brightness and the star count density profiles reveal a departure froma king model starting from ~600" from the center. these observational evidencesuggest that ngc 6791 is currently experiencing mass loss likely due togravitational shocking and interactions with the tidal field. we use thisevidence to argue that ngc 6791 should have lost a significant fraction of itsoriginal mass. a larger initial mass would in fact explain why the clustersurvived so long. using available recipes based on analytic studies and n-bodysimulations, we derived the expected mass loss due to stellar evolution andtidal interactions and estimated the initial cluster mass to be m_ini=(1.5-4) x10^5 m_sun.

astro-ph;0511717	ngc 2401: a template of the norma-cygnus arm's young population in the  third galactic quadrant	based on a deep optical ccd (ubv(ri)_c) photometric survey and on thetwo-micron all-sky-survey (2mass) data we derived the main parameters of theopen cluster ngc 2401. we found this cluster is placed at 6.3 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc(v_o - m_v = 14.0 \pm 0.2) from the sun and is 25 myr old, what allows us toidentify ngc 2401 as a member of the young population belonging to theinnermost side of the extension of the norma-cygnus spiral--arm in the thirdgalactic quadrant. a spectroscopic study of the emission star lss 440 that liesin the cluster area revealed it is a b0ve star; however, we could not confirmit is a cluster member. we also constructed the cluster luminosity function(lf) down to $v \sim 22$ and the cluster initial mass function (imf) for allstars with masses above $m \sim 1-2 m_{\sun}$. it was found that the slope ofthe cluster imf is $x \approx 1.8 \pm 0.2$. the presence of a probable pms starpopulation associated to the cluster is weakly revealed.

astro-ph;0602493	spiral structure of the third galactic quadrant and the solution to the  canis major debate	with the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (ibata et al. 1994), agalaxy caught in the process of merging with the milky way, the hunt for othersuch accretion events has become a very active field of astrophysical research.the identification of a stellar ring-like structure in monoceros, spanning morethan 100 degrees (newberg et al. 2002), and the detection of an overdensity ofstars in the direction of the constellation of canis major (cma, martin et al.2004), apparently associated to the ring, has led to the widespread belief thata second galaxy being cannibalised by the milky way had been found. in thisscenario, the overdensity would be the remaining core of the disrupted galaxyand the ring would be the tidal debris left behind. however, unlike thesagittarius dwarf, which is well below the galactic plane and whose orbit, andthus tidal tail, is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the milky way, theputative cma galaxy and ring are nearly co-planar with the galactic disk. thisseverely complicates the interpretation of observations. in this letter, weshow that our new description of the milky way leads to a completely differentpicture. we argue that the norma-cygnus spiral arm defines a distant stellarring crossing monoceros and the overdensity is simply a projection effect oflooking along the nearby local arm. our perspective sheds new light on a verypoorly known region, the third galactic quadrant (3gq), where cma is located.

astro-ph;0603385	outer structure of the galactic warp and flare: explaining the canis  major over-density	(abridged) we derive the structure of the galactic stellar warp and flareusing 2mass rc and rgb stars, selected at mean heliocentric distances of 3, 7and 17 kpc.  our results are: (i) a clear stellar warp signature is derived for the 3selected rings; (ii) the derived stellar warp is consistent (both in amplitudeand phase-angle) with that for the galactic interstellar dust and hi gas; (iii)the sun seems not to fall on the line of nodes. the stellar warp phase-angleorientation (+15 degrees) is close to the orientation angle of the galactic barand this produces an asymmetric warp for the inner rings; (iv) anorthern/southern warp symmetry is observed only for the ring at 17 kpc; (v)treating a mixture of thin and thick disk populations we trace the disk flaringand derive a constant scale-height (~0.65 kpc) within r(gc)~15 kpc. furtherout, the disk flaring increase gradually reaching a mean scale-height of ~1.5kpc at r(gc)~23 kpc; and (vi) these results provide further robust evidencethat there is no disk radial truncation at r(gc)~14 kpc.  in the particular case of the canis major over-density we confirm itscoincidence with the southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l=240. wepresent evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density,radial velocities, proper motion etc) of cma are consistent with it being anormal milky way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for amore complex interpretations of its origin. the present analysis does notprovide a conclusive test of the structure or origin of the monoceros ring.nevertheless, we show that a warped flared milky way contributes significantlyat the locations of the monoceros ring.

astro-ph;0610140	new brown dwarfs in upper sco using ukidss galactic cluster survey  science verification data	we present first results from a deep (j = 18.7), wide-field (6.5 squaredegrees) infrared (zyjhk) survey in the upper sco association conducted withinthe science verification phase of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey galacticcluster survey (gcs). cluster members define a sequence well separated fromfield stars in the (z-j,z) colour-magnitude diagram. we have selected a totalof 164 candidates with j = 10.5-18.7 mag from the (z-j,z) and (y-j,y) diagrams.we further investigated the location of those candidates in the othercolour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams to weed out contaminants. thecross-correlation of the gcs catalogue with the 2mass database confirms themembership of 116 photometric candidates down to 20 jupiter masses as they liewithin a 2 sigma circle centred on the association mean motion. the final listof cluster members contains 129 sources with masses between 0.3 and 0.007 msun.we extracted a dozen new low-mass brown dwarfs below 20 mjup, the limit ofprevious surveys in the region. finally, we have derived the mass function inupper sco over the 0.3-0.01 msun mass range, best fit by a single segment witha slope of index alpha = 0.6+/-0.1, in agreement with previous determination inopen clusters.

astro-ph;0702534	two t dwarfs from the ukidss early data release	we report on the first ultracool dwarf discoveries from the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) large area survey early data release (las edr), inparticular the discovery of t dwarfs which are fainter and more distant thanthose found using the 2mass and sdss surveys. we aim to show that ourmethodologies for searching the ~27 sq degs of the las edr are successful forfinding both l and t dwarfs $via$ cross-correlation with the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) dr4 release. while the area searched so far is small, the numbersof objects found shows great promise for near-future releases of the las andgreat potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. ultracool dwarfs areselected by combinations of their yjh(k) ukidss colours and sdss dr4 z-j andi-z colours, or, lower limits on these red optical/infrared colours in the caseof dr4 dropouts. after passing visual inspection tests, candidates have beenfollowed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.our main result is the discovery following ch4 imaging and spectroscopy of at4.5 dwarf, ulasj 1452+0655, lying ~80pc distant. a further t dwarf candidate,ulasj 1301+0023, has very similar ch4 colours but has not yet been confirmedspectroscopically. we also report on the identification of a brighter l0 dwarf,and on the selection of a list of las objects designed to probe for t-likedwarfs to the survey j-band limit. our findings indicate that the combinationof the ukidss las and sdss surveys provide an excellent tool for identifying land t dwarfs down to much fainter limits than previously possible. ourdiscovery of one confirmed and one probable t dwarf in the edr is consistentwith expectations from the previously measured t dwarf density on the sky.

0809.2559	tombaugh 2: the first open cluster with a significant abundance spread  or embedded in a cold stellar stream?	we present new abundances and radial velocities for stars in the field of theopen cluster tombaugh 2, which has been suggested to be associated with thegalactic anticenter stellar structure (also known as the monoceros stream).using vlt/flames with the uves and giraffe spectrographs, we find a radialvelocity (rv) of &lt;v_{r}&gt; = 121 \pm 0.4 km/s using eighteen tombaugh 2 clusterstars. our abundance analysis of rv-selected members finds that tombaugh 2 ismore metal-rich than previous studies have found; moreover, unlike the previouswork, our larger sample also reveals that stars with the velocity of thecluster show a relatively large spread in chemical properties (e.g.,delta[fe/h] &gt; 0.2). this is the first time a possible abundance spread has beenobserved in an open cluster, though this is one of several possibleexplanations for our observations. while there is an apparent trend of[alpha/fe] with [fe/h], the distribution of abundances of these "rv clustermembers" also may hint at a possible division into two primary groups withdifferent mean chemical characteristics -- namely (&lt;[fe/h]&gt;,&lt;[ti/fe]&gt;) ~(-0.06, +0.02) and (-0.28, +0.36). based on position and kinematics tombaugh 2is a likely member of the gass/monoceros stream, which makes tombaugh 2 thesecond star cluster within the originally proposed gass/monoceros family.however, we explore other possible explanations for the observed spread inabundances and two possible sub-populations, with the most likely explanationbeing that the metal-poor ([fe/h] = -0.28), more centrally-concentratedpopulation being the true tombaugh 2 clusters stars and the metal-rich ([fe/h]= -0.06) population being an overlapping, and kinematically associated, but"cold" (sigma_v &lt; 2 km/s) stellar stream at r_{gc} &gt;= 15 kpc.

astro-ph;9707185	on the galactic disc age-metallicity relation	a comparison is made between the age-metallicity relation obtained from fourdifferent types of studies: f and g stars in the solar neighbourhood, analysisof open clusters, galactic structure studies with the stellar populationsynthesis technique, and chemical evolution models. metallicities of openclusters are corrected for the effects of the radial gradient, which we find tobe -0.09 dex/kpc and to be most likely constant in time. we do not correct forthe vertical gradient, since its existence and value are not firmlyestablished. stars and clusters trace a similar age-metallicity relation,showing an excess of rather metal-rich objects in the age range 5-9 gyr.galactic structure studies tend to give a more metal-poor relation thanchemical evolution models. both relations do not explain the presence of old,relatively metal-rich stars and clusters. this might be due to uncertainties inthe ages of the local stars, or to pre-enrichment of the disc with materialfrom the bulge, possibly as a result of a merger event in the early phases ofthe formation of our galaxy.
