0902.4694	increased complexity in interstellar chemistry: detection and chemical  modeling of ethyl formate and n-propyl cyanide in sgr b2(n)	in recent years, organic molecules of increasing complexity have been foundtoward the prolific galactic center source sagittarius b2. we wish to explorethe degree of complexity that the interstellar chemistry can reach instar-forming regions. we carried out a complete line survey of the hot coressgr b2(n) and (m) with the iram 30 m telescope in the 3 mm range. we analyzedthis spectral survey in the lte approximation. we modeled the emission of allknown molecules simultaneously, which allows us to search for less abundant,more complex molecules. we compared the derived column densities with thepredictions of a coupled gas-phase and grain-surface chemical code. we reportthe first detection in space of ethyl formate (c2h5ocho) and n-propyl cyanide(c3h7cn) toward sgr b2(n). the abundances of ethyl formate and n-propyl cyaniderelative to h2 are estimated to be 3.6e-9 and 1.0e-9, respectively. ourchemical modeling suggests that the sequential, piecewise construction of ethyland n-propyl cyanide from their constituent functional groups on the grainsurfaces is their most likely formation route. ethyl formate is primarilyformed on the grains by adding ch3 to functional-group radicals derived frommethyl formate, although ethanol may also be a precursor. the detection in sgrb2(n) of the next stage of complexity in two classes of complex molecule,esters and alkyl cyanides, suggests that greater complexity in other classes ofmolecule may be present in the interstellar medium. {abridged}

0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0908.3446	apex-champ+ high-j co observations of low-mass young stellar objects:  ii. distribution and origin of warm molecular gas	the origin and heating mechanisms of warm (50&lt;t&lt;200 k) molecular gas inlow-mass young stellar objects (ysos) are strongly debated. both passiveheating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as wellas active heating by shocks and by uv associated with the outflows or accretionhave been proposed. we aim to characterize the warm gas within protostellerobjects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolaroutflows and the quiescent cloud. high-j co maps (12co j=6--5 and 7--6) of theimmediate surroundings (up to 10,000 au) of eight low-mass ysos are obtainedwith the champ+ 650/850 ghz array receiver mounted on the apex telescope. inaddition, isotopologue observations of the 13co j=6--5 transition and [c i]3p_2-3p_1 line were taken. strong quiescent narrow-line 12co 6--5 and 7--6emission is seen toward all protostars. in the case of hh~46 and ced 110 irs 4,the on-source emission originates in material heated by uv photons scattered inthe outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. warmquiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by uv photons fromshocks. shock-heated warm gas is only detected for class 0 flows and the moremassive class i sources such as hh~46. outflow temperatures, estimated from theco 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 k, close to model predictions, with theexception of the l~1551 irs 5 and iras 12496-7650, for which temperatures &lt;50 kare found. apex-champ+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar'sfeedback on its accreting envelope gas in terms of heating, photodissociation,and outflow dispersal by mapping 1'x1' regions in high-j co and [c i] lines.

0909.4683	deuterium chemistry in the orion bar pdr - "warm" chemistry starring  ch2d+	high levels of deuterium fractionation in gas-phase molecules are usuallyassociated with cold regions, such as prestellar cores. significantfractionation ratios are also observed in hot environments such as hot cores orhot corinos, where they are believed to be produced by the evaporation of theicy mantles surrounding dust grains, and thus are remnants of a previous cold(either gas-phase or grain surface) chemistry. the recent detection of dcntowards the orion bar, in a clump at a characteristic temperature of 70k, hasshown that high deuterium fractionation can also be detected in pdrs. the orionbar clumps thus appear as a good environment for the observational study ofdeuterium fractionation in luke-warm gas, allowing to validate chemistry modelsin a different temperature range, where dominating fractionation processes arepredicted to be different than in cold gas (&lt; 20k). we aimed at studyingobservationally in detail the chemistry at work in the orion bar pdr, tounderstand if dcn is produced by ice mantle evaporation, or is the result ofwarm gas-phase chemistry, involving the ch2d+ precursor ion (which surviveshigher temperatures than the usual h2d+ precursor). using the apex and the iram30m telescopes, we targetted selected deuterated species towards two clumps inthe orion bar. we confirmed the detection of dcn and detected two newdeuterated molecules (dco+ and hdco) towards one clump in the orion bar pdr.significant deuterium fractionations are found for hcn and h2co, but a lowfractionation in hco+. we also give upper limits for other molecules relevantfor the deuterium chemistry.

0704.1617	high-resolution study of a star-forming cluster in the cep-a hw2 region	due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the cepheus a eaststar-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formationprocesses. based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattenedmolecular gas distribution around the yso hw2 may be a 350-au-radius massiveprotostellar disk. goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of thisstructure. we have employed the plateau de bure interferometer to acquire(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such asmethyl cyanide (ch3cn) and silicon monoxide (sio), towards the hw2 position. onthe 1-arcsecond (about 725 au) scale, the flattened distribution of moleculargas around hw2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the planeof the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one ispowering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line ofsight. the presence of a protostellar disk around hw2 is not ruled out, butsuch structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or usingdifferent molecular tracers.

1001.0894	h2co and ch3oh maps of the orion bar photodissociation region	a previous analysis of methanol and formaldehyde towards the orion barconcluded that the two molecular species may trace different physicalcomponents, methanol the clumpy material, and formaldehyde the interclumpmedium. to verify this hypothesis, we performed multi-line mapping observationsof the two molecules to study their spatial distributions. the observationswere performed with the iram-30m telescope at 218 and 241 ghz, with an angularresolution of ~11''. additional data for h2co from the plateau de bure arrayare also discussed. the data were analysed using an lvg approach.  both molecules are detected in our single-dish data. our data show that ch3ohpeaks towards the clumps of the bar, but its intensity decreases below thedetection threshold in the interclump material. when averaging over a largeregion of the interclump medium, the strongest ch3oh line is detected with apeak intensity of ~0.06k. formaldehyde also peaks on the clumps, but it is alsodetected in the interclump gas. we verified that the weak intensity of ch3oh inthe interclump medium is not caused by the different excitation conditions ofthe interclump material, but reflects a decrease in the column density ofmethanol. the abundance of ch3oh relative to h2co decreases by at least oneorder of magnitude from the dense clumps to the interclump medium.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1008.2513	the methanol lines and hot core of omc2-fir4, an intermediate-mass  protostar, with herschel-hifi	in contrast with numerous studies on the physical and chemical structure oflow- and high-mass protostars, much less is known about their intermediate-masscounterparts, a class of objects that could help to elucidate the mechanisms ofstar formation on both ends of the mass range. we present the first resultsfrom a rich hifi spectral dataset on an intermediate-mass protostar, omc2-fir4,obtained in the chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions) keyprogramme. the more than 100 methanol lines detected between 554 and 961 ghzcover a range in upper level energy of 40 to 540 k. our physical interpretationfocusses on the hot core, but likely the cold envelope and shocked regions alsoplay a role in reality, because an analysis of the line profiles suggests thepresence of multiple emission components. an upper limit of 10^-6 is placed onthe methanol abundance in the hot core, using a population diagram, large-scalesource model and other considerations. this value is consistent with abundancespreviously seen in low-mass hot cores. furthermore, the highest energy lines atthe highest frequencies display asymmetric profiles, which may arise frominfall around the hot core.

1104.0857	on the kinematics of massive star forming regions: the case of iras  17233-3606	direct observations of accretion disks around high-mass young stellar objectswould help to discriminate between different models of formation of massivestars. however, given the complexity of massive star forming regions, suchstudies are still limited in number. additionally, there is still no generalconsensus on the molecular tracers to be used for such investigations. becauseof its close distance and high luminosity, iras 17233-3606 is a potential goodlaboratory to search for traces of rotation in the inner gas around theprotostar(s). therefore, we selected the source for a detailed analysis of itsmolecular emission at 230 ghz with the sma. we systematically investigated thevelocity fields of transitions in the sma spectra which are not affected byoverlap with other transitions, and searched for coherent velocity gradients tocompare them to the distribution of outflows in the region. beside co emissionwe also used high-angular h2 images to trace the outflow motions driven by theiras 17233-3606 cluster. we find linear velocity gradients in many transitionsof the same molecular species and in several molecules. we report the firstdetection of hnco in molecular outflows from massive ysos. we discuss the ch3cnvelocity gradient taking into account various scenarios: rotation, presence ofmultiple unresolved sources with different velocities, and outflow(s). althoughother interpretations cannot be ruled out, we propose that the ch3cn emissionmight be affected by the outflows of the region. higher angular observationsare needed to discriminate between the different scenarios. the presentobservations, with the possible association of ch3cn with outflows in a fewthousands au around the ysos' cluster, (i) question the choice of the tracer toprobe rotating structures, and (ii) show the importance of the use of h2 imagesfor detailed studies of kinematics.

1104.2202	high-mass star formation at high luminosities: w31 at &gt;10^6 l_sun	context: high-mass star formation has been a very active field over the lastdecade, however, most studies targeted regions of luminosities between 10^4 and10^5 l_sun. methods: we selected the w31 star-forming complex with a totalluminosity of ~6x10^6 l_sun for a multi-wavelength spectral line and continuumstudy covering wavelengths from the near- and mid-infrared via (sub)mmwavelength observations to radio data in the cm regime. results: while theoverall structure of the multi-wavelength continuum data resembles each otherwell, there are several intriguing differences. the 24mum emission stemminglargely from small dust grains follows tightly the spatial structure of the cmemission tracing the ionized free-free emission. hence warm dust resides inregions that are spatially associated with the ionized hot gas (~10^4 k) of thehii regions. furthermore, we find several evolutionary stages within the samecomplexes, ranging from infrared-observable clusters, via deeply embeddedregions associated with active star formation traced by 24\,$\mu$m and cmemission, to at least one high-mass gas clump devoid of any such signature. the13co(2-1) and c18o(2-1) spectral line observations reveal a large kinematicbreadth in the entire region with a total velocity range of approximately 90km/s. while the average virial mass ratio for w31 is close to unity, the linewidth analysis indicates large-scale evolutionary differences between thesouthern and northern sub-regions (g10.2-0.3 and g10.3-0.1) of the whole w31complex. the clump mass function - tracing cluster scales and not scales ofindividual stars - derived from the 875mum continuum data has a slope of1.5+-0.3, consistent with previous cloud mass functions.

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

1404.4404	the formation of the w43 complex: constraining its atomic-to-molecular  transition and searching for colliding clouds	numerical simulations have explored the possibility to form molecular cloudsthrough either a quasi-static, self-gravitating mechanism or the collision ofgas streams or lower-density clouds. they also quantitatively predict thedistribution of matter at the transition from atomic to molecular gases. we aimto observationally test these models by studying the environment of w43, amolecular cloud complex near the tip of the galactic long bar. usinggalaxy-wide hi and 12co surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the w43molecular cloud complex. we also estimated the hi and h2 mass surface densitiesto constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within w43.we found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12co and higases. they are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the13co velocity structure of w43. since their velocity gradients are consistentwith free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,the w43 10^7msun potential well. we show that the hi surface density,sigma_hi=45-85msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases whenentering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. this suggeststhat an equilibrium between h2 formation and photodissociation has not yet beenreached. the h2-to-hi ratio measured over the w43 region and its surroundings,r_h2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular formin w43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along thescutum-centaurus arm. the w43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and infact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. already inthe molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from thescutum-centaurus arm. this is in clear disagreement with quasi-static andsteady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

0807.4208	sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations of the bullet cluster (1e  0657-56) with apex-sz	we present observations of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) in the bulletcluster (1e 0657--56) using the apex-sz instrument at 150 ghz with a resolutionof 1 arcmin. the main results are maps of the sze in this massive, merginggalaxy cluster. the cluster is detected with 23 sigma significance within thecentral 1 arcmin radius of the source position. the sze map has a broadlysimilar morphology to that in existing x-ray maps of this system, and we findno evidence for significant contamination of the sze emission by radio or irsources. in order to make simple quantitative comparisons with cluster gasmodels derived from x-ray observations, we fit our data to an isothermalelliptical beta model, despite the inadequacy of such a model for this complexmerging system. with an x-ray derived prior on the power-law index, beta = 1.04+0.16 -0.10, we find a core radius r_c =142 +/- 18 arcsec, an axial ratio of0.889 +/- 0.072, and a central temperature decrement of -771 +/- 71micro-k_cmb, including a +/-5.5% flux calibration uncertainty. combining theapex-sz map with a map of projected electron surface density from chandra x-rayobservations, we determine the mass-weighted temperature of the cluster gas tobe t_mg=10.8 +/- 0.9 kev, significantly lower than some previously reportedx-ray spectroscopic temperatures. under the assumption of an isothermal clustergas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium, we compute the gas mass fractionfor prolate and oblate spheroidal geometries and find it to be consistent withprevious results from x-ray and weak lensing observations. this work is thefirst result from the apex-sz experiment, and represents the first reportedscientific result from observations with a large array of multiplexedsuperconducting transition-edge sensor bolometers.

astro-ph;0006094	three high-redshift millimeter sources and their radio and near-infrared  identifications	we present millimeter wavelength detections of three faint sources that aremost likely high-redshift starburst galaxies. for one of the sources, which waspreviously discovered with scuba at 850 mu m, we present a detection with theiram interferometer at 240 ghz (1.25 mm) that shows the object unresolved at anangular resolution of 2.''5, and coincident within 1'' with a radio source anda galaxy detected in the near-infrared. the two other sources were discoveredin a deep 250 ghz (1.2 mm) survey with the max-planck millimeter bolometer(mambo) array at the iram 30m telescope. both have fluxes of ~4 mjy and radiocounterparts with a 1.4 ghz flux density of ~75 mujy. their radio-to-mm fluxratios suggest redshifts larger than 2. both sources are faint in the opticaland near-infrared, one showing a 20.5 mag k-band counterpart. from our data andthat available in the literature, we estimate the redshift distribution oftwenty-two faint mm and sub-mm sources and conclude that the majority of themare likely to be at z&gt;2.

astro-ph;0110370	high-mass proto-stellar candidates - ii : density structure from dust  continuum and cs emission	we present a detailed 1.2 mm continuum and cs spectral line study of a largesample of 69 massive star forming regions in very early stages of evolution,most of them prior to building up an ultracompact hii region. the continuumdata show a zoo of different morphologies and give detailed information on thespatial distributions, the masses, column densities and average densities ofthe whole sample. fitting the radial intensity profiles shows that threeparameters are needed to describe the spatial distribution of the sources:constant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by afirst power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into asecond power law distribution. the mean inner power law intensity index mi(i~r^(-mi)) is 1.2 corresponding to density indices p (n~r^(-p)) of 1.6. intotal the density distribution of our massive star formations sites seem to benot too different from their low-mass counterparts, but we show that settingtight constrains on the density indices is very difficult and subject to manypossible errors. the local densities we derive from cs calculations are higher(up to one order of magnitude) than the mean densities we find via themm-continuum. such inhomogeneous density distribution reflects most likely theubiquitous phenomenon of clumping and fragmentation in molecular clouds.linewidth-mass relations show a departure from virial equilibrium in the stagesof strongly collapsing cores.

astro-ph;0201311	detection of feo towards sgrb2	we have observed the j=5-4 ground state transition of feo at a frequency of153 ghz towards a selection of galactic sources.  towards the galactic center source sgrb2, we see weak absorption atapproximately the velocity of other features towards this source (62 kms$^{-1}$ lsr).  towards other sources, the results were negative as they were also formgoh(3-2) and fec(6-5). we tentatively conclude that the absorption seen towardsgrb2 is due to feo in the hot ($\sim $ 500 k) relatively low density absorbinggas known to be present in this line of sight.  this is the first (albeit tentative) detection of feo or any iron--containingmolecule in the interstellar gas. assuming the observed absorption to be due tofeo, we estimate [feo]/[sio] to be of order or less than 0.002 and[feo]/[h$_{2}$] of order $3 10^{-11}$. this is compatible with our negativeresults in other sources.  our results suggest that the iron liberated from grains in the shocksassociated with sgrb2 remains atomic and is not processed into molecular form.

astro-ph;0204448	triply deuterated ammonia in ngc 1333	the caltech submillimeter observatory has detected triply deuterated ammonia,nd3, through its 10a-00s transition near 310 ghz. emission is found in the ngc1333 region, both towards iras 4a and a position to the south-east where dco+peaks. in both cases, the hyperfine ratio indicates that the emission isoptically thin. column densities of nd3 are 3--6 x 10^11 cm^-2 for t_ex=10 kand twice as high for t_ex=5 k. using a monte carlo radiative transfer code anda model of the structure of the iras source with temperature and densitygradients, the estimated nd3 abundance is 3.2 x 10^-12 if nd3/h2 is constantthroughout the envelope. in the more likely case that nd3/h2d+ is constant,nd3/h2 peaks in the cold outer parts of the source at a value of 1.0 x 10^-11.to reproduce the observed nh3/nd3 abundance ratio of ~1000, grain surfacechemistry requires an atomic d/h ratio of ~0.15 in the gas phase, &gt;10 timeshigher than in recent chemical models. more likely, the deuteration of nh3occurs by ion-molecule reactions in the gas phase, in which case the dataindicate that deuteron transfer reactions are much faster than protontransfers.

astro-ph;0402563	massive molecular outflows at high spatial resolution	we present high-spatial resolution plateau de bure interferometer co(2-1) andsio(2-1) observations of one intermediate-mass and one high-mass star-formingregion. the intermediate-mass region iras20293+3952 exhibits four molecularoutflows, one being as collimated as the highly collimated jet-like outflowsobserved in low-mass star formation sources. furthermore, comparing the datawith additional infrared h2 and cm observations we see indications that thenearby ultracompact hii region triggers a shock wave interacting with theoutflow. the high-mass region iras19217+1651 exhibits a bipolar outflow as welland the region is dominated by the central driving source. adding two moresources from the literature, we compare position-velocity diagrams of theintermediate- to high-mass sources with previous studies in the low-massregime. we find similar kinematic signatures, some sources can be explained byjet-driven outflows whereas other are better constrained by wind-driven models.the data also allow to estimate accretion rates varying from a few times10^{-5}msun/yr for the intermediate-mass sources to a few times 10^{-4}msun/yrfor the high-mass source, consistent with models explaining star formation ofall masses via accretion processes.

astro-ph;0407384	high-spatial-resolution cn and cs observation of two regions of massive  star formation	molecular line cn, cs and mm continuum observations of two intermediate- tohigh-mass star-forming regions - iras20293+3952 and iras19410+2336 - obtainedwith the plateau de bure interferometer at high spatial resolution revealinteresting characteristics of the gas and dust emission. in spite of theexpectation that the cn and cs morphology might closely follow the dense gastraced by the dust continuum, both molecules avoid the most central cores.comparing the relative line strengths of various cn hyperfine components, thisappears not to be an opacity effect but to be due to chemical and physicaleffects. the cn data also indicate enhanced emission toward the differentmolecular outflows in the region. regarding cs, avoiding the central cores canbe due to high optical depth, but the data also show that the cs emission isnearly always associated with the outflows of the region. therefore, neither csnor cn appear well suited for dense gas and disk studies in these two sources,and we recommend the use of different molecules for future massive diskstudies. an analysis of the 1 and 3mm continuum fluxes toward iras20293+3952reveals that the dust opacity index beta is lower than the canonical value of2. tentatively, we identify a decreasing gradient of beta from the edge of thecore to the core center. this could be due to increasing optical depth towardthe core center and/or grain growth within the densest cores and potentialcentral disks. we detect 3mm continuum emission toward the collimated outflowemanating from iras20293+3952. the spectral index of alpha ~ 0.8 in this regionis consistent with standard models for collimated ionized winds.

astro-ph;0410619	hdo abundance in the envelope of the solar-type protostar iras16293-2422	we present iram 30m and jcmt observations of hdo lines towards the solar-typeprotostar iras 16293-2422. five hdo transitions have been detected on-source,and two were unfruitfully searched for towards a bright spot of the outflow ofiras 16293-2422. we interpret the data by means of the ceccarelli, hollenbachand tielens (1996) model, and derive the hdo abundance in the warm inner andcold outer parts of the envelope. the emission is well explained by a jumpmodel, with an inner abundance of 1e-7 and an outer abundance lower than 1e-9(3 sigma). this result is in favor of hdo enhancement due to ice evaporationfrom the grains in theinner envelope. the deuteration ratio hdo/h2o is found tobe f_in=3% and f_out &lt; 0.2% (3 sigma) in the inner and outer enveloperespectively and therefore, the fractionation also undergoes a jump in theinner part of the envelope. these results are consistent with the formation ofwater in the gas phase during the cold prestellar core phase and storage of themolecules on the grains, but do not explain why observations of h2o icesconsistently derive a h2o ice abundance of several 1e-5 to 1e-4, some twoorders of magnitude larger than the gas phase abundance of water in the hotcore around iras 16293-2422.

astro-ph;0508421	high mass starless cores	we report the identification of a sample of potential high-mass starlesscores (hmscs). the cores were discovered by comparing images of the fieldscontaining candidate high-mass protostellar objects (hmpos) at 1.2mm andmid-infrared (8.3um; mir) wavelengths. while the hmpos are detected at bothwavelengths, several cores emitting at 1.2mm in the same fields show absorptionor no emission at the mir wavelength. we argue that the absorption is caused bycold dust. the estimated masses of a few 10^2msun - 10^3 msun and the lack ofir emission suggests that they may be massive cold cores in a pre-stellarphase, which could presumably form massive stars eventually. ammonia (1,1) and(2,2) observations of the cores indicate smaller velocity dispersions and lowerrotation temperatures compared to hmpos and uchii regions suggesting aquiescent pre-stellar stage. we propose that these newly discovered cores aregood candidates for the hmsc stage in high-mass star-formation. this sample ofcores will allow us to study the high-mass star and cluster formation processesat the earliest evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0603201	discovery of interstellar cf+	we discuss the first astronomical detection of the cf+ (fluoromethylidynium)ion, obtained by observations of the j=1-0 (102.6 ghz), j=2-1 (205.2 ghz) andj=3-2 (307.7 ghz) rotational transitions toward the orion bar region. oursearch for cf+, carried out using the iram 30m and apex 12m telescopes, wasmotivated by recent theoretical models that predict cf+ abundances of a fewtimes 1.e-10 in uv-irradiated molecular regions where c+ is present. the cf+ion is produced by exothermic reactions of c+ with hf. because fluorine atomscan react exothermically with h2, hf is predicted to be the dominant reservoirof fluorine, not only in well-shielded regions but also in the surface layersof molecular clouds where the c+ abundance is large. the observed cf+ lineintensities imply the presence of cf+ column densities of at least 1.e+12 cm-2over a region of size at least ~ 1 arcmin, in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions. they provide support for our current theories of interstellarfluorine chemistry, which suggest that hydrogen fluoride should be ubiquitousin interstellar gas clouds and widely detectable in absorption by futuresatellite and airborne observatories.
