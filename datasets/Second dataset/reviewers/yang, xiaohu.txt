0901.1150	structural properties of central galaxies in groups and clusters	using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (cens) from the sdssdr4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members ingroups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (mstar), (2) dark matterhalo mass of the host group (mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. weestablish and thoroughly test a galfit-based pipeline to fit 2d sersic modelsto sdss data. we find that the fitting results are most sensitive to thebackground sky level determination and strongly recommend using the sdss globalvalue. we find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strongcovariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and sersic index(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. we find that n depends strongly onmstar for cens, but only weakly or not at all on mhalo. less (more) massivecens tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full mhalo range. likewise, thereis a clear r50-mstar relation for cens, with separate slopes for disks andspheroids. when comparing cens with satellite galaxies (sats), we find that lowmass (&lt;10e10.75 msun/h^2) sats have larger median n than cens of similar mstar.low mass, late-type sats have moderately smaller r50 than late-type cens of thesame mstar. however, we find no size differences between spheroid-like cens andsats, and no structural differences between cens and sats matched in both massand colour. the similarity of massive sats and cens shows that this distinctionhas no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. we conclude that mstaris the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.the lack of a clear n-mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass forproducing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processesmust occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

0906.1654	the spin and orientation of dark matter halos within cosmic filaments	clusters, filaments, sheets and voids are the building blocks of the cosmicweb. in this study, we present and compare two distinct algorithms for findingcosmic filaments and sheets, a task which is far less well established than theidentification of dark matter halos or voids. one method is based on thesmoothed dark matter density field, the other uses the halo distributionsdirectly. we apply both techniques to one high resolution n-body simulation andreconstruct the filamentary/sheet like network of the dark matter densityfield. we focus on investigating the properties of the dark matter halos insidethese structures, in particular on the directions of their spins and theorientation of their shapes with respect to the directions of the filaments andsheets. we find that both the spin and the major axes of filament-halos withmasses &lt;= 10^{13} m_sun/h are preferentially aligned with the direction of thefilaments. the spins and major axes of halos in sheets tend to lie parallel tothe sheets. there is an opposite mass dependence of the alignment strengths forthe spin (negative) and major (positive) axes, i.e. with increasing halo massthe major axis tends to be more strongly aligned with the direction of thefilament whereas the alignment between halo spin and filament becomes weakerwith increasing halo mass. the alignment strengths as a function of distance tothe most massive node halo indicate that there is a transit large scaleenvironment impact: from the 2-d collapse phase of the filament to the 3-dcollapse phase of the cluster/node halo at small separation. overall, the twoalgorithms for filament/sheet identification investigated here agree well witheach other. the method based on halos alone can be easily adapted for use withobservational data sets.

0912.1257	the stellar mass components of galaxies: comparing semi-analytical  models with observation	we compare the stellar masses of central and satellite galaxies predicted bythree independent semianalytical models with observational results obtainedfrom a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sloan digital skysurvey. in particular, we compare the stellar mass functions of centrals andsatellites, the relation between total stellar mass and halo mass, and theconditional stellar mass functions, which specify the average number ofgalaxies of stellar mass m_* that reside in a halo of mass m_h. thesemi-analytical models only predict the correct stellar masses of centralgalaxies within a limited mass range and all models fail to reproduce the sharpdecline of stellar mass with decreasing halo mass observed at the low mass end.in addition, all models over-predict the number of satellite galaxies byroughly a factor of two. the predicted stellar mass in satellite galaxies canbe made to match the data by assuming that a significant fraction of satellitegalaxies are tidally stripped and disrupted, giving rise to a population ofintra-cluster stars in their host halos. however, the amount of intra-clusterstars thus predicted is too large compared to observation. this suggests thatcurrent galaxy formation models still have serious problems in modeling starformation in low-mass halos.

0912.1853	stellar ages and metallicities of central and satellite galaxies:  implications for galaxy formation and evolution	using a large sdss galaxy group catalogue, we study how the stellar ages andmetallicities of central and satellite galaxies depend on stellar mass and halomass. we find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of thesame stellar mass. in addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass andmetallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denserenvironments. this is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity oflow mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which theyreside. a comparison with the semi-analytical model of wang et al. (2008) showsthat it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centralsof the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halomass of the satellite. this is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves thestellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged starformation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. the resultingage offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites wereaccreted earlier. the model fails, however, in reproducing the halo massdependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yieldsmetallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow,and predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals ofthe same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. we argue that thesediscrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of bothsupernova feedback and agn feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description ofstrangulation, and (iii) include a proper treatment of the tidal stripping,heating and destruction of satellite galaxies.

1001.4533	are brightest halo galaxies central galaxies?	it is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, thatis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightesthalo galaxy (bhg), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matterpotential well. this central galaxy paradigm (cgp) is an essential assumptionmade in various fields of astronomical research. in this paper we test thevalidity of the cgp using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from thesloan digital sky survey. for each group we compute two statistics, ${\cal r}$and ${\cal s}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities andprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other groupmembers. by comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\cal r}|$ and $|{\cals}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out thenull-hypothesis that the cgp is correct. rather, the data indicate that in anon-zero fraction $f_{\rm bnc}(m)$ of all haloes of mass $m$ the bhg is not thecentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. in particular, we find that$f_{\rm bnc}$ increases from $\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1}{\rm m_{\odot}} \leq m \lsim 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\rm m_{\odot}}$) to $\sim0.4$ in massive haloes ($m \gsim 5 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\rm m_{\odot}}$). weshow that these values of $f_{\rm bnc}$ are uncomfortably high compared topredictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation. we end by discussing various implications of a non-zero$f_{\rm bnc}(m)$, with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellitekinematics.

1001.5184	nonlinearities in modified gravity cosmology i: signatures of modified  gravity in the nonlinear matter power spectrum	a large fraction of cosmological information on dark energy and gravity isencoded in the nonlinear regime. precision cosmology thus requires precisionmodeling of nonlinearities in general dark energy and modified gravity models.we modify the gadget-2 code and run a series of n-body simulations on modifiedgravity cosmology to study the nonlinearities. the modified gravity model thatwe investigate in the present paper is characterized by a single parameter\zeta, which determines the enhancement of particle acceleration with respectto general relativity (gr), given the identical mass distribution (\zeta = 1 ingr). the first nonlinear statistics we investigate is the nonlinear matterpower spectrum at k &lt; 3h/mpc, which is the relevant range for robust weaklensing power spectrum modeling at l &lt; 2000. in this study, we focus on therelative difference in the nonlinear power spectra at corresponding redshiftswhere different gravity models have the same linear power spectra. thisparticular statistics highlights the imprint of modified gravity in thenonlinear regime and the importance to include the nonlinear regime in testinggr. by design, it is less susceptible to the sample variance and numericalartifacts. we adopt a mass assignment method based on wavelet to improve thepower spectrum measurement. we run a series of tests to determine the suitablesimulation specifications (particle number, box size and initial redshift). wefind that, the nonlinear power spectra can differ by ~30% for 10% deviationfrom gr (|\zeta-1| = 0.1) where the rms density fluctuations reach 10. thislarge difference, on one hand, shows the richness of information on gravity inthe corresponding scales, and on the other hand, invalidates simpleextrapolations of some existing fitting formulae to modified gravity cosmology.

0707.4640	galaxy groups in the sdss dr4: i. the catalogue and basic properties	we use a modified version of the halo-based group finder developed by yang etal. to select galaxy groups from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss dr4). inthe first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers ofpotential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. using aniterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the averagemass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assigna tentative mass to each group. this mass is then used to estimate the size andvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turnis used to determine group membership in redshift space. finally, eachindividual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on itscharacteristic luminosity, and the other based on its characteristic stellarmass. applying the group finder to the sdss dr4, we obtain 301237 groups in abroad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. we use detailedmock galaxy catalogues constructed for the sdss dr4 to test the performance ofour group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination byinterlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses. this paper is the first in aseries and focuses on the selection procedure, tests of the reliability of thegroup finder, and the basic properties of the group catalogue (e.g. themass-to-light ratios, the halo mass to stellar mass ratios, etc.). the groupcatalogues including the membership of the groups are available athttp://gax.shao.ac.cn/data/group.html andhttp://www.astro.umass.edu/~xhyang/group.html

1003.3203	satellite kinematics iii: halo masses of central galaxies in sdss	we use the kinematics of satellite galaxies that orbit around the centralgalaxy in a dark matter halo to infer the scaling relations between halo massand central galaxy properties. using galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (mlr) and the halomass-stellar mass relation (msr) of central galaxies. in particular, we focuson the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the centralgalaxy. we find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloesthan blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. however, at fixed stellarmass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red andblue centrals, especially for m* $\lsim$ 10^{10.5} h^{-2} msun. this indicatesthat stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity.nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass isnon-negligible for both red and blue centrals. it increases as a function ofstellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for bluecentrals. we compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with resultsfrom other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from asdss galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, andfrom subhalo abundance matching studies. overall, these different techniquesyield mlrs and msrs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically withina factor of two), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliabledescription of the galaxy-dark matter connection. we briefly discuss some ofthe remaining discrepancies among the various methods.

1006.3768	genus statistics using the delaunay tessellation field estimation  method: (i) tests with the millennium simulation and the sdss dr7	we study the topology of cosmic large-scale structure through the genusstatistics, using galaxy catalogues generated from the millennium simulationand observational data from the latest sloan digital sky survey data release(sdss dr7). we introduce a new method for constructing galaxy density fieldsand for measuring the genus statistics of its isodensity surfaces. it is basedon a delaunay tessellation field estimation (dtfe) technique that allows thedefinition of a piece-wise continuous density field and the exact computationof the topology of its polygonal isodensity contours, without introducing anyfree numerical parameter. besides this new approach, we also employ thetraditional approaches of smoothing the galaxy distribution with a gaussian offixed width, or by adaptively smoothing with a kernel that encloses a constantnumber of neighboring galaxies. our results show that the delaunay-based methodextracts the largest amount of topological information. unlike the traditionalapproach for genus statistics, it is able to discriminate between the differenttheoretical galaxy catalogues analyzed here, both in real space and in redshiftspace, even though they are based on the same underlying simulation model. inparticular, the dtfe approach detects with high confidence a discrepancy of oneof the semi-analytic models studied here compared with the sdss data, while theother models are found to be consistent.

1006.4760	probing hot gas in galaxy groups through the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	we investigate the potential of exploiting the sunyaev-zeldovich effect (sze)to study the properties of hot gas in galaxy groups. it is shown that, withupcoming sze surveys, one can stack sze maps around galaxy groups of similarhalo masses selected from large galaxy redshift surveys to study the hot gas inhalos represented by galaxy groups. we use various models for the hot halo gasto study how the expected sze signals are affected by gas fraction, equation ofstate, halo concentration, and cosmology. comparing the model predictions withthe sensitivities expected from the spt, act and planck surveys shows that aspt-like survey can provide stringent constraints on the hot gas properties forhalos with masses m ~&gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}msun. we also explore the idea of usingthe cross correlation between hot gas and galaxies of different luminosity toprobe the hot gas in dark matter halos without identifying galaxy groups torepresent dark halos. our results show that, with a galaxy survey as large asthe sloan digital sky survey and with the help of the conditional luminosityfunction (clf) model, one can obtain stringent constraints on the hot gasproperties in halos with masses down to 10^{13} h^{-1}msun. thus, the upcomingsze surveys should provide a very promising avenue to probe the hot gas inrelatively low-mass halos where the majority of l*-galaxies reside.

1007.0612	internal properties and environments of dark matter halos	we use seven high-resolution $n$-body simulations to study the correlationsamong different halo properties (assembly time, spin, shape and substructure),and how these halo properties are correlated with the large-scale environmentin which halos reside. the large-scale tidal field estimated from halos above amass threshold is used as our primary quantity to characterize the large-scaleenvironment, while other parameters, such as the local overdensity and themorphology of large-scale structure, are used for comparison. for halos at afixed mass, all the halo properties depend significantly on environment,particularly the tidal field. the environmental dependence of halo assemblytime is primarily driven by local tidal field. the mass of the unbound fractionin substructure is boosted in strong tidal force region, while the boundfraction is suppressed. halos have a tendency to spin faster in stronger tidalfield and the trend is stronger for more massive halos. the spin vectors showsignificant alignment with the intermediate axis of the tidal field, asexpected from the tidal torque theory. both the major and minor axes of halosare strongly aligned with the corresponding principal axes of the tidal field.in general, a halo that can accrete more material after the formation of itsmain halo on average is younger, is more elongated, spins faster, and containsa larger amount of substructure. higher density environments not only providemore material for halo to accrete, but also are places of stronger tidal fieldthat tends to suppress halo accretion. the environmental dependencies are theresults of these two competing effects. the tidal field based on halos can beestimated from observation, and we discuss the implications of our results forthe environmental dependence of galaxy properties.

1102.4269	properties of fossil groups in cosmological simulations and galaxy  formation models	it has been a long-standing question whether fossil groups are just samplingthe tail of the distribution of ordinary groups, or whether they are aphysically distinct class of objects, characterized by an unusual and specialformation history. to study this question, we here investigate fossil groupsidentified in the hydrodynamical simulations of the gimic project, whichconsists of resimulations of five regions in the millennium simulation (ms)that are characterized by different large-scale densities, ranging from a deepvoid to a proto-cluster region. for comparison, we also consider semi-analyticmodels built on top of the ms, as well as a conditional luminosity functionapproach. we identify galaxies in the gimic simulations as groups of stars anduse a spectral synthesis code to derive their optical properties. the x-rayluminosity of the groups is estimated in terms of the thermal bremsstrahlungemission of the gas in the host halos, neglecting metallicity effects. we focuson comparing the properties of fossil groups in the theoretical models andobservational results, highlighting the differences between them, and trying toidentify possible dependencies on environment for which our approach isparticularly well set-up. we find that the optical fossil fraction in all ofour theoretical models declines with increasing halo mass, and there is noclear environmental dependence. combining the optical and x-ray selectioncriteria for fossil groups, the halo mass dependence of the fossil groups seenin optical vanishes. over the gimic halo mass range we resolve best,9.0\times1012 \sim 4.0\times1013 h-1 m, the central galaxies in the fossilgroups show similar properties as those in ordinary groups, in terms of age,metallicity, color, concentration, and mass-to-light ratio.

1108.1008	reconstructing the cosmic velocity and tidal fields with galaxy groups  selected from the sloan digital sky survey	[abridge]cosmic velocity and tidal fields are important for the understandingof the cosmic web and the environments of galaxies, and can also be used toconstrain cosmology. in this paper, we reconstruct these two fields in sdssvolume from dark matter halos represented by galaxy groups. detailed mockcatalogues are used to test the reliability of our method against uncertaintiesarising from redshift distortions, survey boundaries, and false identificationsof groups by our group finder. we find that both the velocity and tidal fields,smoothed on a scale of ~2mpc/h, can be reliably reconstructed in the innerregion (~66%) of the survey volume. the reconstructed tidal field is used tosplit the cosmic web into clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids, depending onthe sign of the eigenvalues of tidal tensor. the reconstructed velocity fieldnicely shows how the flows are diverging from the centers of voids, andconverging onto clusters, while sheets and filaments have flows that areconvergent along one and two directions, respectively. we use the reconstructedvelocity field and the zel'dovich approximation to predict the mass densityfield in the sdss volume as function of redshift, and find that the massdistribution closely follows the galaxy distribution even on small scales. wefind a large-scale bulk flow of about 117km/s in a very large volume,equivalent to a sphere with a radius of ~170mpc/h, which seems to be producedby the massive structures associated with the sdss great wall. finally, wediscuss potential applications of our reconstruction to study the environmentaleffects of galaxy formation, to generate initial conditions for simulations ofthe local universe, and to constrain cosmological models. the velocity, tidaland density fields in the sdss volume, specified on a cartesian grid with aspatial resolution of ~700kpc/h, are available from the authors upon request.

1109.6328	measures of galaxy environment - i. what is "environment"?	the influence of a galaxy's environment on its evolution has been studied andcompared extensively in the literature, although differing techniques are oftenused to define environment. most methods fall into two broad groups: those thatuse nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that usefixed apertures. the differences between the two inhibit a clean comparisonbetween analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data,different properties are actually being measured. in this work we apply twentypublished environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrainedto look like the local universe. we find that nearest neighbour-based measuresbest probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses theinter-halo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local densityvariations. the resulting correlation also shows that nearest neighbour galaxyenvironment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. conversely,aperture-based methods that probe super-halo scales accurately identifyhigh-density regions corresponding to high mass haloes. both methods show howgalaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of thelargest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the backgrounddark matter environment. we also warn against using photometric redshifts todefine environment in all but the densest regions. when considering environmentthere are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measuredwith nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo bestmeasured with apertures. this leads to the conclusion that there is nouniversal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scalebeing probed.

0710.3164	the importance of satellite quenching for the build-up of the red  sequence of present day galaxies	in the current paradigm, red sequence galaxies are believed to have formed asblue disk galaxies that subsequently had their star formation quenched. sincered-sequence galaxies typically have an early-type morphology, the transitionfrom the blue to the red sequence also involves a morphological transformation.in this paper we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operateonly on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from thesdss, we compare the colors and concentrations of satellites galaxies to thoseof central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that thelatter are the progenitors of the former. on average, satellites are redder andmore concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass.central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and color,however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that thetransformation mechanisms affect color more than morphology. the color andconcentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completelyindependent of the halo mass of the satellite galaxy, indicating thatsatellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in haloes ofall masses. this strongly favors strangulation as the main quenching mechanismfor satellite galaxies. finally, we determine the relative importance ofsatellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. we find that roughly70 percent of red sequence satellite galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^9 msunhad their star formation quenched as satellites. this drops rapidly to zerowith increasing stellar mass, indicating that a significant fraction of redsatellites were already quenched before they became a satellite.

1204.0786	the galaxy-dark matter connection: a cosmological perspective	we present a method that uses observations of galaxies to simultaneouslyconstrain cosmological parameters and the galaxy-dark matter connection (akahalo occupation statistics). the latter describes how galaxies are distributedover dark matter haloes, and is an imprint of the poorly understood physics ofgalaxy formation. a generic problem of using galaxies to constrain cosmology isthat galaxies are a biased tracer of the mass distribution, and this bias isgenerally unknown. the great advantage of simultaneously constraining cosmologyand halo occupation statistics is that this effectively allows cosmologicalconstraints marginalized over the uncertainties regarding galaxy bias. not onlythat, it also yields constraints on the galaxy-dark matter connection, thistime properly marginalized over cosmology, which is of great value to informtheoretical models of galaxy formation. we use a combination of the analyticalhalo model and the conditional luminosity function to describe the galaxy-darkmatter connection, which we use to model the abundance, clustering andgalaxy-galaxy lensing properties of the galaxy population. we use a fishermatrix analysis to gauge the complementarity of these different observables,and present some preliminary results from an analysis based on data from thesloan digital sky survey. our results are complementary to and perfectlyconsistent with the results from the 7 year data release of the wmap mission,strengthening the case for a true 'concordance' cosmology.

1206.3566	internal kinematics of groups of galaxies in the sloan digital sky  survey data release 7	we present measurements of the velocity dispersion profile (vdp) for galaxygroups in the final data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). forgroups of given mass we estimate the redshift-space cross-correlation function(ccf) with respect to a reference galaxy sample, xi(r_p, pi), the projectedccf, w_p(r_p), and the real-space ccf, xi(r). the vdp is then extracted fromthe redshift distortion in xi(r_p, pi), by comparing xi(r_p, pi) with xi(r). wefind that the velocity dispersion (vd) within virial radius (r_200) shows aroughly flat profile, with a slight increase at radii below ~0.3 r_200 for highmass systems. the average vd within the virial radius, sigma_v, is a stronglyincreasing function of central galaxy mass. we apply the same methodology ton-body simulations with the concordance lambda cold dark matter cosmology butdifferent values of the density fluctuation parameter sigma_8, and we comparethe results to the sdss results. we show that the sigma_v-m_* relation from thedata provides stringent constraints on both sigma_8 and sigma_ms, thedispersion in log m_* of central galaxies at fixed halo mass. our best-fittingmodel suggests sigma_8 = 0.86 +/- 0.03 and sigma_ms = 0.16 +/- 0.03. theslightly higher value of sigma_8 compared to the wmap7 result might be due to asmaller matter density parameter assumed in our simulations. our vdmeasurements also provide a direct measure of the dark matter halo mass forcentral galaxies of different luminosities and masses, in good agreement withthe results obtained by mandelbaum et al. (2006) from stacking thegravitational lensing signals of the sdss galaxies.

1206.6890	cosmological constraints from a combination of galaxy clustering and  lensing -- i. theoretical framework	we present a new method that simultaneously solves for cosmology and galaxybias on non-linear scales. the method uses the halo model to analyticallydescribe the (non-linear) matter distribution, and the conditional luminosityfunction (clf) to specify the halo occupation statistics. for a given choice ofcosmological parameters, this model can be used to predict the galaxyluminosity function, as well as the two-point correlation functions ofgalaxies, and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, both as function of scale andluminosity. in this paper, the first in a series, we present the detailed,analytical model, which we test against mock galaxy redshift surveysconstructed from high-resolution numerical $n$-body simulations. we demonstratethat our model, which includes scale-dependence of the halo bias and a propertreatment of halo exclusion, reproduces the 3-dimensional galaxy-galaxycorrelation and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation (which can be projected topredict the observables) with an accuracy better than 10 (in most cases 5)percent. ignoring either of these effects, as is often done, results insystematic errors that easily exceed 40 percent on scales of $\sim 1h^{-1}\mpc$, where the data is typically most accurate. finally, since theprojected correlation functions of galaxies are never obtained by integratingthe redshift space correlation function along the line-of-sight out toinfinity, simply because the data only cover a finite volume, they are stillaffected by residual redshift space distortions (rrsds). ignoring these, asdone in numerous studies in the past, results in systematic errors that easilyexceed 20 perent on large scales ($r_\rmp \gta 10 h^{-1}\mpc$). we show that itis fairly straightforward to correct for these rrsds, to an accuracy betterthan $\sim 2$ percent, using a mildly modified version of the linear kaiserformalism.

1207.0004	cosmological constraints from a combination of galaxy clustering &amp;  lensing -- ii. fisher matrix analysis	we quantify the accuracy with which the cosmological parameterscharacterizing the energy density of matter (\omega_m), the amplitude of thepower spectrum of matter fluctuations (\sigma_8), the energy density ofneutrinos (\omega_{\nu}) and the dark energy equation of state (w_0) can beconstrained using data from large galaxy redshift surveys. we advocate a jointanalysis of the abundance of galaxies, galaxy clustering, and the galaxy-galaxyweak lensing signal in order to simultaneously constrain the halo occupationstatistics (i.e., galaxy bias) and the cosmological parameters of interest. weparameterize the halo occupation distribution of galaxies in terms of theconditional luminosity function and use the analytical framework of the halomodel described in our companion paper (van den bosch et al. 2012), to predictthe relevant observables. by performing a fisher matrix analysis, we show thata joint analysis of these observables, even with the precision with which theyare currently measured from the sloan digital sky survey, can be used to obtaintight constraints on the cosmological parameters, fully marginalized overuncertainties in galaxy bias. we demonstrate that the cosmological constraintsfrom such an analysis are nearly uncorrelated with the halo occupationdistribution constraints, thus, minimizing the systematic impact of anyimperfections in modeling the halo occupation statistics on the cosmologicalconstraints. in fact, we demonstrate that the constraints from such an analysisare both complementary to and competitive with existing constraints on theseparameters from a number of other techniques, such as cluster abundances,cosmic shear and/or baryon acoustic oscillations, thus paving the way to testthe concordance cosmological model.

1207.0503	cosmological constraints from a combination of galaxy clustering and  lensing -- iii. application to sdss data	we simultaneously constrain cosmology and galaxy bias using measurements ofgalaxy abundances, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing taken from thesloan digital sky survey. we use the conditional luminosity function (whichdescribes the halo occupation statistics as function of galaxy luminosity)combined with the halo model (which describes the non-linear matter field interms of its halo building blocks) to describe the galaxy-dark matterconnection. we explicitly account for residual redshift space distortions inthe projected galaxy-galaxy correlation functions, and marginalize overuncertainties in the scale dependence of the halo bias and the detailedstructure of dark matter haloes. under the assumption of a spatially flat,vanilla {\lambda}cdm cosmology, we focus on constraining the matter density,{\omega}m, and the normalization of the matter power spectrum, {\sigma}8, andwe adopt wmap7 priors for the spectral index, the hubble parameter, and thebaryon density. we obtain that \omegam = 0.278_{-0.026}^{+0.023} and {\sigma}8= 0.763_{-0.049}^{+0.064} (95% cl). these results are robust to uncertaintiesin the radial number density distribution of satellite galaxies, while allowingfor non-poisson satellite occupation distributions results in a slightly lowervalue for {\sigma}8 (0.744_{-0.047}^{+0.056}). these constraints are inexcellent agreement (at the 1{\sigma} level) with the cosmic microwavebackground constraints from wmap. this demonstrates that the use of a realisticand accurate model for galaxy bias, down to the smallest non-linear scalescurrently observed in galaxy surveys, leads to results perfectly consistentwith the vanilla {\lambda}cdm cosmology.

1207.5338	bulk flow of halos in \lambda cdm simulation	analysis of the pangu n-body simulation validates that the bulk flow of halosfollows a maxwellian distribution which variance is consistent with theprediction of the linear theory of structure formation. we propose that theconsistency between the observed bulk velocity and theories should be examinedat the effective scale of the radius of a spherical top-hat window functionyielding the same smoothed velocity variance in linear theory as the samplewindow function does. we compared some recently estimated bulk flows fromobservational samples with the prediction of the \lambda cdm model we used;some results deviate from expectation at a level of ~ 3\sigma but thediscrepancy is not as severe as previously claimed. we show that bulk flow isonly weakly correlated with the dipole of the internal mass distribution, thealignment angle between the mass dipole and the bulk flow has a broaddistribution peaked at ~ 30-50 deg., and also that the bulk flow shows littledependence on the mass of the halos used in the estimation. in a simulation ofbox size 1gpc/h, for a cell of radius 100 mpc/h the maximal bulk velocity is&gt;500 km/s, dipoles of the environmental mass outside the cell are not tightlyaligned with the bulk flow, but are rather located randomly around it withseparation angles ~ 20-40 deg. in the fastest cell there is a slightly smallernumber of low-mass halos; however halos inside are clustered more strongly atscales &gt; ~ 20 mpc/h, which might be a significant feature since the correlationbetween bulk flow and halo clustering actually increases in significance beyondsuch scales.

0711.4431	the clustering of sdss galaxy groups: mass and color dependence	we use a sample of galaxy groups selected from the sdss dr 4 with an adaptivehalo-based group finder to probe how the clustering strength of groups dependson their masses and colors. in particular, we determine the relative biases ofgroups of different masses, as well as that of groups with the same mass butwith different colors. in agreement with previous studies, we find that moremassive groups are more strongly clustered, and the inferred mass dependence ofthe halo bias is in good agreement with predictions for the $\lambda$cdmcosmology. regarding the color dependence, we find that groups with redcentrals are more strongly clustered than groups of the same mass but with bluecentrals. similar results are obtained when the color of a group is defined tobe the total color of its member galaxies. the color dependence is moreprominent in less massive groups and becomes insignificant in groups withmasses $\gta 10^{14}\msunh$. we construct a mock galaxy redshift surveyconstructed from the large millenium simulation that is populated with galaxiesaccording to the semi-analytical model of croton et al. applying our groupfinder to this mock survey, and analyzing the mock data in exactly the same wayas the true data, we are able to accurately recover the intrinsic mass andcolor dependencies of the halo bias in the model. this suggests that our groupfinding algorithm and our method of assigning group masses do not inducespurious mass and/or color dependencies in the group-galaxy correlationfunction. the semi-analytical model reveals the same color dependence of thehalo bias as we find in our group catalogue. in halos with $m\sim10^{12}\msunh$, though, the strength of the color dependence is much strongerin the model than in the data.

1211.4195	simulation of relativistically colliding laser-generated electron flows	the plasma dynamics resulting from the simultaneous impact, of two equal,ultra-intense laser pulses, in two spatially separated spots, onto a densetarget is studied via particle-in-cell (pic) simulations. the simulations showthat electrons accelerated to relativistic speeds, cross the target and exit atits rear surface. most energetic electrons are bound to the rear surface by theambipolar electric field and expand along it. their current is closed by areturn current in the target, and this current configuration generates strongsurface magnetic fields. the two electron sheaths collide at the midplanebetween the laser impact points. the magnetic repulsion between thecounter-streaming electron beams separates them along the surface normaldirection, before they can thermalize through other beam instabilities. thismagnetic repulsion is also the driving mechanism for the beam-weibel(filamentation) instability, which is thought to be responsible for magneticfield growth close to the internal shocks of gamma-ray burst (grb) jets. therelative strength of this repulsion compared to the competing electrostaticinteractions, which is evidenced by the simulations, suggests that thefilamentation instability can be examined in an experimental setting.

1301.1348	reconstructing the initial density field of the local universe: method  and test with mock catalogs	our research objective in this paper is to reconstruct an initial lineardensity field, which follows the multivariate gaussian distribution withvariances given by the linear power spectrum of the current cdm model andevolves through gravitational instability to the present-day density field inthe local universe. for this purpose, we develop a hamiltonian markov chainmonte carlo method to obtain the linear density field from a posteriorprobability function that consists of two components: a prior of a gaussiandensity field with a given linear spectrum, and a likelihood term that is givenby the current density field. the present-day density field can bereconstructed from galaxy groups using the method developed in wang et al.(2009a). using a realistic mock sdss dr7, obtained by populating dark matterhaloes in the millennium simulation with galaxies, we show that our method caneffectively and accurately recover both the amplitudes and phases of theinitial, linear density field. to examine the accuracy of our method, we use$n$-body simulations to evolve these reconstructed initial conditions to thepresent day. the resimulated density field thus obtained accurately matches theoriginal density field of the millennium simulation in the density range 0.3 &lt;=rho/rho_mean &lt;= 20 without any significant bias. especially, the fourier phasesof the resimulated density fields are tightly correlated with those of theoriginal simulation down to a scale corresponding to a wavenumber of ~ 1 h/mpc,much smaller than the translinear scale, which corresponds to a wavenumber of ~0.15 h\mpc.

1301.3255	nonlinearities in modified gravity cosmology. ii. impacts of modified  gravity on the halo properties	the statistics of dark matter halos is an essential component ofunderstanding the nonlinear evolution in modified gravity cosmology. based on aseries of modified gravity n-body simulations, we investigate the halo massfunction, concentration and bias. we model the impact of modified gravity by asingle parameter \zeta, which determines the enhancement of particleacceleration with respect to gr, given the identical mass distribution (\zeta=1in gr). we select snapshot redshifts such that the linear matter power spectraof different gravity models are identical, in order to isolate the impact ofgravity beyond modifying the linear growth rate. at the baseline redshiftcorresponding to z_s=1.2 in the standard \lambda cdm, for a 10% deviation fromgr(|\zeta-1|=0.1), the measured halo mass function can differ by about 5-10%,the halo concentration by about 10-20%, while the halo bias differssignificantly less. these results demonstrate that the halo mass functionand/or the halo concentration are sensitive to the nature of gravity and may beused to make interesting constraints along this line.

1302.1265	constraining the star formation histories in dark matter halos: i.  central galaxies	using the self-consistent modeling of the conditional stellar mass functionsacross cosmic time by yang et al. (2012), we make model predictions for thestar formation histories (sfhs) of {\it central} galaxies in halos of differentmasses. the model requires the following two key ingredients: (i) mass assemblyhistories of central and satellite galaxies, and (ii) local observationalconstraints of the star formation rates of central galaxies as function of halomass. we obtain a universal fitting formula that describes the (median) sfh ofcentral galaxies as function of halo mass, galaxy stellar mass and redshift. weuse this model to make predictions for various aspects of the star formationrates of central galaxies across cosmic time. our main findings are thefollowing. (1) the specific star formation rate (ssfr) at high $z$ increasesrapidly with increasing redshift [$\propto (1+z)^{2.5}$] for halos of a givenmass and only slowly with halo mass ($\propto m_h^{0.12}$) at a given $z$, inalmost perfect agreement with the specific mass accretion rate of dark matterhalos. (2) the ratio between the star formation rate (sfr) in the main-branchprogenitor and the final stellar mass of a galaxy peaks roughly at a constantvalue, $\sim 10^{-9.3} h^2 {\rm yr}^{-1}$, independent of halo mass or thefinal stellar mass of the galaxy. however, the redshift at which the sfr peaksincreases rapidly with halo mass. (3) more than half of the stars in thepresent-day universe were formed in halos with $10^{11.1}\msunh &lt; m_h &lt;10^{12.3}\msunh$ in the redshift range $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.9$. (4) ... [abridged]

1303.2746	bsg alignment of sdss galaxy groups	we study the alignment signal between the distribution of brightest satellitegalaxies (bsgs) and the major axis of their host groups using sdss groupcatalog constructed by yang et al. (2007). after correcting for the effect ofgroup ellipticity, a statistically significant (~ 5\sigma) major-axis alignmentis detected and the alignment angle is found to be 43.0 \pm 0.4 degrees. moremassive and richer groups show stronger bsg alignment. the bsg alignment aroundblue bcgs is slightly stronger than that around red bcgs. and red bsgs havemuch stronger major-axis alignment than blue bsgs. unlike bsgs, othersatellites do not show very significant alignment with group major axis. wefurther explore the bsg alignment in semi-analytic model (sam) constructed byguo et al. (2011). we found general good agreement with observations: bsgs insam show strong major-axis alignment which depends on group mass and richnessin the same way as observations; and none of other satellites exhibit prominentalignment. however, discrepancy also exists in that the sam shows opposite bsgcolor dependence, which is most probably induced by the missing of large scaleenvironment ingredient in sam. the combination of two popular scenarios canexplain the detected bsg alignment. the first one: satellites merged into thegroup preferentially along the surrounding filaments, which is strongly alignedwith the major axis of the group. the second one: bsgs enter their host groupmore recently than other satellites, then will preserve more information aboutthe assembling history and so the major-axis alignment. in sam, we foundpositive evidence for the second scenario by the fact that bsgs merged intogroups statistically more recently than other satellites. on the other hand,although is opposite in sam, the bsg color dependence in observation mightindicate the first scenario as well.

1305.0350	detection of galaxy assembly bias	assembly bias describes the finding that the clustering of dark matter haloesdepends on halo formation time at fixed halo mass. in this paper, we analysethe influence of assembly bias on galaxy clustering using both semi-analyticalmodels (sams) and observational data. at fixed stellar mass, sams predict thatthe clustering of {\it central} galaxies depends on the specific star formationrate (ssfr), with more passive galaxies having a higher clustering amplitude.we find similar trends using sdss group catalogues, and verify that these arenot affected by possible biases due to the group finding algorithm. low masscentral galaxies reside in narrow bins of halo mass, so the observed trends ofhigher clustering amplitude for galaxies with lower ssfr is not driven byvariations of the parent halo mass. we argue that the clustering dependence onssfr represent a direct detection of assembly bias. in addition, contrary towhat expected based on clustering of dark matter haloes, we find that low-masscentral galaxies in sams with larger host halo mass have a {\it lower}clustering amplitude than their counter-parts residing in lower mass haloes.this results from the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, assembly bias has astronger influence on clustering than the dependence on the parent halo mass.

1306.0650	an empirical model for the star formation history in dark matter halos	we develop an empirical approach to infer the star formation rate in darkmatter halos from the galaxy stellar mass function (smf) at different redshiftsand the local cluster galaxy luminosity function (cglf), which has a steeperfaint end relative to the smf of local galaxies. as satellites are typicallyold galaxies which have been accreted earlier, this feature can cast importantconstraint on the formation of low-mass galaxies at high-redshift. theevolution of the smfs suggests the star formation in high mass halos($&gt;10^{12}m_{\odot}h^{-1}$) has to be boosted at high redshift beyond what isexpected from a simple scaling of the dynamical time. the faint end of the cglfimplies a characteristic redshift $z_c\approx2$ above which the star formationrate in low mass halos with masses $&lt; 10^{11}m_{\odot}h^{-1}$ must be enhancedrelative to that at lower z. this is not directly expected from the standardstellar feedback models. also, this enhancement leads to some interestingpredictions, for instance, a significant old stellar population in present-daydwarf galaxies with $m_* &lt; 10^8 m_{\odot}h^{-2}$ and steep slopes of highredshift stellar mass and star formation rate functions.

1307.5107	the statistical nature of the brightest group galaxies	we examine the statistical properties of the brightest group galaxies (bggs)using a complete spectroscopic sample of groups/clusters of galaxies selectedfrom the data release 7 of the sloan digital sky survey. we test whether bggsand other bright members of groups are consistent with an ordered populationamong the total population of group galaxies. we find that the luminositydistributions of bggs do not follow the predictions from the order statistics(os). the average luminosities of bggs are systematically brighter than ospredictions. on the other hand, by properly taking into account the brighteningeffect of the bggs, the luminosity distributions of the second brightestgalaxies are in excellent agreement with the expectations of os. thebrightening of bggs relative to the os expectation is consistent with ascenario that the bggs on average have over-grown about 20 percent massesrelative to the other member galaxies. the growth ($\delta m$) is notstochastic but correlated with the magnitude gap ($g_{1,2}$) between thebrightest and the second brightest galaxy. the growth ($\delta m$) is largerfor the groups having more prominent bggs (larger $g_{1,2}$) and averagelycontributes about 30 percent of the final $g_{1,2}$ of the groups of galaxies.

1309.3847	alignments of galaxies within cosmic filaments from sdss dr7	using a sample of galaxy groups selected from the sloan digital sky surveydata release 7 (sdss dr7), we examine the alignment between the orientation ofgalaxies and their surrounding large scale structure in the context of thecosmic web. the latter is quantified using the large-scale tidal field,reconstructed from the data using galaxy groups above a certain mass threshold.we find that the major axes of galaxies in filaments tend to be preferentiallyaligned with the directions of the filaments, while galaxies in sheets havetheir major axes preferentially aligned parallel to the plane of the sheets.the strength of this alignment signal is strongest for red, central galaxies,and in good agreement with that of dark matter halos in n-body simulations.this suggests that red, central galaxies are well aligned with their hosthalos, in quantitative agreement with previous studies based on the spatialdistribution of satellite galaxies. there is a luminosity and mass dependencethat brighter and more massive galaxies in filaments and sheets have strongeralignment signals. we also find that the orientation of galaxies is alignedwith the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the tidaltensor. these observational results indicate that galaxy formation is affectedby large-scale environments, and strongly suggests that galaxies are alignedwith each other over scales comparable to those of sheets and filaments in thecosmic web.

1406.5068	star formation and stellar mass assembly in dark matter halos: from  giants to dwarfs	the empirical model of lu et al. 2014 is updated with recent data and used tostudy galaxy star formation and assembly histories. at $z &gt; 2$, the predictedgalaxy stellar mass functions are steep, and a significant amount of starformation is hosted by low-mass haloes that may be missed in currentobservations. most of the stars in cluster centrals formed earlier than$z\approx 2$ but have been assembled much later. milky way mass galaxies havehad on-going star formation without significant mergers since $z\approx 2$, andare thus free of significant (classic) bulges produced by major mergers. inmassive clusters, stars bound in galaxies and scattered in the halo form ahomogeneous population that is old and with solar metallicity. in contrast, inmilky way mass systems the two components form two distinct populations, withhalo stars being older and poorer in metals by a factor of $\approx 3$. dwarfgalaxies in haloes with $m_{\rm h} &lt; 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ have experienced astar formation burst accompanied by major mergers at $z &gt; 2$, followed by anearly constant star formation rate after $z = 1$. the early burst leaves asignificant old stellar population that is distributed in spheroids.

0804.0070	an ideal mass assignment scheme for measuring the power spectrum with  ffts	in measuring the power spectrum of the distribution of large numbers of darkmatter particles in simulations, or galaxies in observations, one has to usefast fourier transforms (fft) for calculational efficiency. however, because ofthe required mass assignment onto grid points in this method, the measuredpower spectrum $\la |\delta^f(k)|^2\ra$ obtained with an fft is not the truepower spectrum $p(k)$ but instead one that is convolved with a window function$|w(\vec k)|^2$ in fourier space. in a recent paper, jing (2005) proposed anelegant algorithm to deconvolve the sampling effects of the window function andto extract the true power spectrum, and tests using n-body simulations showthat this algorithm works very well for the three most commonly used massassignment functions, i.e., the nearest grid point (ngp), the cloud in cell(cic) and the triangular shaped cloud (tsc) methods. in this paper, rather thantrying to deconvolve the sampling effects of the window function, we propose toselect a particular function in performing the mass assignment that canminimize these effects. an ideal window function should fulfill the followingcriteria: (i) compact top-hat like support in fourier space to minimize thesampling effects; (ii) compact support in real space to allow a fast andcomputationally feasible mass assignment onto grids. we find that the scalefunctions of daubechies wavelet transformations are good candidates for such apurpose. our tests using data from the millennium simulation show that the truepower spectrum of dark matter can be accurately measured at a level better than2% up to $k=0.7k_n$, without applying any deconvolution processes. the newscheme is especially valuable for measurements of higher order statistics, e.g.the bi-spectrum,........

1502.01256	an observational proxy of halo assembly time and its correlation with  galaxy properties	we show that the ratio between the stellar mass of central galaxy and themass of its host halo, $f_c \equiv m_{*,c}/m_{\rm h}$, can be used as anobservable proxy of halo assembly time, in that galaxy groups with higher $f_c$assembled their masses earlier. using sdss groups of yang et al., we study how$f_c$ correlates with galaxy properties such as color, star formation rate,metallicity, bulge to disk ratio, and size. central galaxies of a given stellarmass in groups with $f_c&gt;0.02$ tend to be redder in color, more quenched instar formation, smaller in size, and more bulge dominated, as $f_c$ increases.the trends in color and star formation appear to reverse at $f_c&lt;0.02$,reflecting a down-sizing effect that galaxies in massive halos formed theirstars earlier although the host halos themselves assembled later (lower $f_c$).no such reversal is seen in the size of elliptical galaxies, suggesting thattheir assembly follows halo growth more closely than their star formation.satellite galaxies of a given stellar mass in groups of a given halo mass tendto be redder in color, more quenched in star formation and smaller in size as$f_c$ increases. for a given stellar mass, satellites also tend to be smallerthan centrals. the trends are stronger for lower mass groups. for groups moremassive than $\sim 10^{13}{\rm m}_\odot$, a weak reversed trend is seen incolor and star formation. the observed trends in star formation arequalitatively reproduced by an empirical model based on halo age abundancematching, but not by a semi-analytical model tested here.

1503.01860	using member galaxy luminosities as halo mass proxies of galaxy groups	reliable halo mass estimation for a given galaxy system plays an importantrole both in cosmology and galaxy formation studies. here we set out to findthe way that can improve the halo mass estimation for those galaxy systems withlimited brightest member galaxies been observed. using four mock galaxy samplesconstructed from semi-analytical formation models, the subhalo abundancematching method and the conditional luminosity functions, respectively, we findthat the luminosity gap between the brightest and the subsequent brightestmember galaxies in a halo (group) can be used to significantly reduce thescatter in the halo mass estimation based on the luminosity of the brightestgalaxy alone. tests show that these corrections can significantly reduce thescatter in the halo mass estimations by $\sim 50\%$ to $\sim 70\%$ in massivehalos depending on which member galaxies are considered. comparing to thetraditional ranking method, we find that this method works better for groupswith less than five members, or in observations with very bright magnitude cut.

(2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellitegalaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and(iii) their group-centric radius. we find that the colours and concentrationsof satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass.in particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations ofsatellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius.we find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes ofall masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centricradii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. in addition, the weakcolour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass issimply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, moremassive satellites. combining these results with the fact that satellitegalaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than centralgalaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxiesbecome redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo(i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). this is a clear manifestation ofenvironment dependence. however, there is no indication that the magnitude ofthe transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxyundergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matterwhether it becomes a satellite of a small (milky way sized) halo, or of amassive cluster. we discuss the implication of this `dearth' of environmentdependence for the physical processes responsible for transforming satellitegalaxies.

1505.04798	assessing colour-dependent occupation statistics inferred from galaxy  group catalogues	we investigate the ability of current implementations of galaxy group findersto recover colour-dependent halo occupation statistics. to test the fidelity ofgroup catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders usedin the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realisticmanner. overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar,and most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.however, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequenceof correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellitedesignation, and halo mass assignment. we introduce a new statistic, the halotransition probability (htp), which captures the combined impact of all theseerrors. as a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinctgalaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), andto result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for redgalaxies than for blue galaxies. a statistic that is particularly poorlyrecovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies asfunction of halo mass. group finders do a good job in recovering galacticconformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none ispresent. we conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics fromgroup catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running groupfinders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on thehtp, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.

0807.4178	the rise and fall of galaxy activity in dark matter haloes	we use a sdss galaxy group catalogue to study the dependence of galaxyactivity on stellar mass, halo mass, and group hierarchy (centrals vs.satellites). we split our galaxy sample in star-forming galaxies, galaxies withoptical agn activity and radio sources. we find a smooth transition in halomass as the activity of central galaxies changes from star formation to opticalagn activity to radio emission. star-forming centrals preferentially reside inhaloes with m&lt;10^{12} msun, central galaxies with optical-agn activitytypically inhabit haloes with m \sim 10^{13} msun, and centrals emitting in theradio mainly reside in haloes more massive than 10^{14} msun. although thisseems to suggest that the environment (halo mass) determines the type ofactivity of its central galaxy, we find a similar trend with stellar mass:central star formers typically have stellar masses below 10^{10} msun, whileoptical-agn hosts and central radio sources have characteristic stellar massesof 10^{10.8} msun and 10^{11.6} msun, respectively. since more massive haloestypically host more massive centrals, it is unclear whether the activity of acentral galaxy is causally connected to its stellar mass or to its halo mass.in general, satellite galaxies have their activity suppressed wrt centralgalaxies of the same stellar mass. at fixed stellar mass, we find that theactivity of satellite galaxies depends only weakly on halo mass. in fact, forsatellite galaxies the dependence of galaxy activity on halo mass is more thanfour times weaker than the dependence on stellar mass. as we discuss, all theseresults are consistent with a picture in which low mass haloes accrete coldgas, while massive haloes have coronae of hot gas that promote radio activityof their central galaxies.

0807.4532	satellite kinematics ii: the halo mass-luminosity relation of central  galaxies in sdss	the kinematics of satellite galaxies reflect the masses of the extended darkmatter haloes in which they orbit, and thus shed light on the mass-luminosityrelation (mlr) of their corresponding central galaxies. in this paper we selecta large sample of centrals and satellites from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellitegalaxies as a function of the $r$-band luminosity of the central galaxies.using the analytical framework presented in paper i, we use these data to infer{\it both} the mean and the scatter of the mlr of central galaxies, carefullytaking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stackingprocedure. as expected, brighter centrals on average reside in more massivehaloes. in addition, we find that the scatter in halo masses for centrals of agiven luminosity, $\sigma_{\log m}$, also increases with increasing luminosity.as we demonstrate, this is consistent with $\sigma_{\log l}$, which reflectsthe scatter in the conditional probability function $p(l_c|m)$, beingindependent of halo mass. our analysis of the satellite kinematics yields$\sigma_{\log l}=0.16\pm0.04$, in excellent agreement with constraints fromclustering and group catalogues, and with predictions from a semi-analyticalmodel of galaxy formation. we thus conclude that the amount of stochasticity ingalaxy formation, which is characterized by $\sigma_{\log l}$, is wellconstrained, is independent of halo mass, and is in good agreement with currentmodels of galaxy formation.

0807.4932	galaxy clustering &amp; galaxy-galaxy lensing: a promising union to  constrain cosmological parameters	galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing probe the connection betweengalaxies and their dark matter haloes in complementary ways. on one hand, thehalo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties ofgalaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. consequently, differentcosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. on theother hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actualmass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus toconstrain cosmological parameters. in this paper we establish the link betweengalaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosityfunction (clf). we constrain the clf parameters using the galaxy luminosityfunction and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies.the resulting clf models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.for a cosmology with $(\omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.238,0.734)$, the modelaccurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the sdss. for acomparison cosmology with $(\omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.3,0.9)$, however, wecan accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of thegalaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are toohigh, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.we conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensingis a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential toyield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. since this method mainlyprobes the mass distribution on non-linear scales, it is complementary toconstraints obtained from the galaxy power-spectrum, which mainly probes thelarge-scale (linear) matter distribution.

0808.0539	galaxy groups in the sdss dr4: iii. the luminosity and stellar mass  functions	using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sloan digital skysurvey data release 4 (sdss dr4) with an adaptive halo-based group finder, weinvestigate the luminosity and stellar mass functions for different populationsof galaxies (central versus satellite; red versus blue; and galaxies in groupsof different masses) and for groups themselves. the conditional stellar massfunction (csmf), which describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halosof a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with alog-normal distribution and a modified schechter form, respectively. onaverage, there are about 3 times as many central galaxies as satellites. amongthe satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blueones. for the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by redgalaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low mass end. at thevery low-mass end ($m_\ast \la 10^9 h^{-2}\msun$), however, there is a markedincrease in the number of red centrals. we speculate that these galaxies arelocated close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by thelarge-scale environments. the stellar-mass function of galaxy groups is welldescribed by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at $\sim4\times 10^{10}h^{-2}\msun$. finally, we use the observed stellar mass functionof central galaxies to constrain the stellar mass - halo mass relation for lowmass halos, and obtain $m_{\ast, c}\propto m_h^{4.9}$ for $m_h \ll 10^{11}\msunh$.

astro-ph;0205546	understanding the results of galaxy-galaxy lensing using galaxy-mass  correlation in numerical simulations	mckay et al. (2002) have recently used measurements of weak galaxy-galaxylensing in the sloan digital sky survey to estimate the cross correlationbetween galaxies and the projected dark matter density field. they derive arelation between aperture mass within a radius of $260\kpch$, $m_{260}$, andlens galaxy luminosity, that does not depend on galaxy luminosity, type orenvironment. in this paper, we study the cross-correlation between galaxies anddark matter using galaxy catalogs constructed from a high-resolution n-bodysimulation of a $\lambda$cdm universe. we show that our simulations reproducethe mckay et al. results reasonably well. in the simulation, $m_{260}$ isapproximately equal to the halo virial mass for $l_*$ galaxies. $m_{260}$overestimates the virial mass for fainter galaxies and underestimates it forbrighter galaxies. we use the simulations to show that under certaincircumstances the halo virial mass may be recovered by fitting an nfw profileto the projected galaxy-mass correlation function. if we apply our method tothe observations, we find that $l_*$ galaxies typically reside in halos of$\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1} \msun$, consistent with halo masses estimated fromthe observed tully-fisher relation. in the simulations, the halo virial massscales with galaxy luminosity as $l^{1.5}$ for central galaxies in halos andfor galaxies in low-density regions. for satellite galaxies, and for galaxiesin high-density regions, there is no simple relation between galaxy luminosityand halo mass and care must be exercised when interpreting the lensing results.

astro-ph;0207019	constraining galaxy formation and cosmology with the conditional  luminosity function of galaxies	we use the conditional luminosity function (clf), which gives the number ofgalaxies with luminosities in the range [l, l+dl] that reside in a halo of massm, to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. we seekthe clf that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminositydependence of the galaxy clustering strength and test the models by comparingthe resulting mass-to-light ratios (m/l) with constraints from the tully-fisher(tf) relation. we obtain a number of stringent constraints on both galaxyformation and cosmology. in particular, this method can break the degeneracybetween omega_0 and the power-spectrum normalization sigma_8, inherent incurrent weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. for flat lcdm cosmogonieswith sigma_8 normalized by recent weak lensing observations, the best resultsare obtained for omega_0~0.3; omega_0 &lt; 0.2 leads to too large galaxycorrelation lengths, while omega_0 &gt; 0.4 gives too high m/l. the best-fit modelfor the lcdm concordance cosmology (omega_0=0.3) predicts m/l that are slightlytoo high. we discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy thisproblem, including small modification of cosmological parameters, warm in steadof cold dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and theexistence of dark galaxies. finally we use the clf to predict severalstatistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local universe.

0808.2526	the subhalo - satellite connection and the fate of disrupted satellite  galaxies	in the standard paradigm, satellite galaxies are believed to be associatedwith the population of dark matter subhalos. in this paper, we use theconditional stellar mass functions of {\it satellite galaxies} obtained from alarge galaxy group catalogue together with models of the subhalo mass functionsto explore the fraction and fate of stripped stars from satellites in galaxygroups and clusters of different masses. the majority of the stripped stars inmassive halos are predicted to end up as intra-cluster stars, and the predictedamounts of the intra-cluster component as a function of the velocity dispersionof galaxy system match well the observational results obtained by gonzalez etal. (2007). the fraction of the mass in the stripped stars to that remain boundin the central and satellite galaxies is the highest ($\sim 40%$ of the totalstellar mass) in halos with masses $m_h\sim 10^{14}\msunh$. if all these starsend up in the intra-cluster component (max), or maximum of them are accretedinto the central galaxy (min), then we can predict that a maximum $\sim 19%$and a minimum $\sim 5%$ of the total stars in the whole universe are in termsof the diffused intra-cluster component. in the former case, in massive haloswith $m_h \sim 10^{15} \msunh$, the stellar mass of the intra-cluster componentis roughly 6 times as large as that of the central galaxy. this factordecreases to $\sim 2$, 1 and 0.1 in halos with $m_h \sim 10^{14}$, $10^{13}$,and $10^{12} \msunh$, respectively. the total amount of stars stripped fromsatellite galaxies is insufficient to build up the central galaxies in haloswith masses $\la 10^{12.5}\msunh$, and so the quenching of star formation mustoccur in halos with higher masses. abridged.

astro-ph;0210495	linking early and late type galaxies to their dark matter haloes	(abridged) using data from the 2dfgrs we compute the conditional luminosityfunctions (clfs) of early- and late-type galaxies. these functions give theaverage number of galaxies with luminosity l that reside in a halo of mass m,and are a powerful statistical tool to link the distribution of galaxies tothat of dark matter haloes. we find that the average mass-to-light ratios ofdark matter haloes have a minimum of about 100 msun/lsun around a halo mass ofabout 3x10^{11} msun. in addition, haloes with m &lt; 10^{10} msun are virtuallydevoid of galaxies, while clusters have b_j band mass-to-light ratios in therange 500-1000 msun/lsun. finally, the fact that early-type galaxies are morestrongly clustered than late-type galaxies requires that the fraction oflate-type galaxies is a strongly declining function of halo mass. we alsocompute two-point correlation functions as function of both luminosity andgalaxy type, and find a weak (strong) luminosity dependence for the late(early) type galaxies. finally we compare our clfs with predictions fromseveral semi-analytical models for galaxy formation. as long as these modelsaccurately fit the 2dfgrs luminosity function the agreement with ourpredictions is remarkably good. this indicates that we have recovered astatistical description of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes which fitsnicely within the standard framework for galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0301104	towards cosmological concordance on galactic scales	we use the observed abundance and clustering of galaxies from the 2dfgrs todetermine the matter density omega_m and the linear amplitude of massfluctuations sigma_8. we use a method based on the conditional luminosityfunction, which allows straightforward computation of the luminosity dependentbias of galaxies. in addition, it allows the inclusion of constraints on theredshift space distortion parameter beta=omega_m^{0.6}/b, and yields averagemass-to-light ratios as function of halo mass. using only the luminosityfunction and the correlation lengths as function of luminosity we obtainconstraints on omega_m and sigma_8 that are in good agreement with cobe. usingadditional constraints on the mass-to-light ratios of clusters and on the valueof beta as determined from the 2dfgrs yields omega_m = (0.27 +/- 0.06) andsigma_8 = (0.77 +/- 0.06). adding further constraints from current cmb data, weobtain omega_m = (0.25 +/- 0.04) and sigma_8 = (0.78 +/- 0.06). thus, we findstrong indications that both omega_m and sigma_8 are significantly lower thantheir ``standard'' concordance values of 0.3 and 0.9, respectively. finally, weshow that the cosmologies favored here predict dark matter haloes that aresignificantly less centrally concentrated than for the standard lcdmconcordance model. this may solve both the problem with the rotation curves ofdwarf and lsb galaxies, as well as the problem of simultaneously matching thegalaxy luminosity function and the tully-fisher zero-point.

astro-ph;0303524	populating dark matter haloes with galaxies: comparing the 2dfgrs with  mock galaxy redshift surveys	in two recent papers, we developed a powerful technique to link thedistribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes by considering halooccupation numbers as function of galaxy luminosity and type. in this paper weuse these distribution functions to populate dark matter haloes inhigh-resolution n-body simulations of the standard lcdm cosmogony withomega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.9. stacking simulation boxes of 100 mpc/h and 300mpc/h with 512^3 cdm particles each we construct mock galaxy redshift surveysout to a redshift of z=0.2. we use these mock surveys to investigate variousclustering statistics. the projected correlation functions for galaxies withdifferent luminosities and types match the observations well on scales largerthan about 3 mpc/h. on smaller scales, however, the model overpredicts theclustering power by about a factor two. furthermore, the model predictspairwise velocity dispersions (pvd) that are about 400 km/s too high atprojected pair separations of ~1 mpc/h. a strong velocity bias in massivehaloes can reduce the predicted pvd to the observed level, but does not help toresolve the over-prediction of clustering power on small scales. consistentresults can be obtained within the standard lcdm model only when themass-to-light ratio of clusters is almost twice the observed value.alternatively, a lcdm model with sigma_8=0.75 can also reproduce theobservational results.

astro-ph;0310147	the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on large-scale  environment	a basic assumption in current halo occupation model is that the properties ofa galaxy depend only on the mass of its dark matter halo. an importantconsequence of this is that the segregation of the galaxy population bylarge-scale environment is entirely due to the environmental dependence of thehalo population. in this paper we use such a model to predict how the galaxyluminosity function depends on large-scale environment. the latter isrepresented by the density contrast (delta) averaged over a spherical volume ofradius r=8mpc/h. the model predicts that the schechter function is a goodapproximation to the luminosity functions of galaxies brighter than ~10^9h^{-2}l_sun (b_j-band) in virtually all environments. the characteristicluminosity, l^{\star}, increases moderately with \delta. the faint-end slope,\alpha, on the other hand, is quite independent of $\delta$. however, whensplitting the galaxy population into early and late types, it is found that forlate-types \alpha is virtually constant, whereas for early-types \alphaincreases from ~-0.3 in underdense regions (\delta~-0.5) to ~-0.8 in highlyoverdense regions with \delta ~ 10. the luminosity function at l_{b_j}&lt;10^9h^{-2} l_sun is significantly steeper than the extrapolation of the schechterfunction that fits the brighter galaxies. this steepening is more significantfor early-types and in low-density environments. the model also predicts thatthe luminosity density and mass density are closely correlated. the relationbetween the two is monotonic but highly non-linear. this suggests that one canuse the luminosity density, averaged over a large volume, to rank the massdensity. this, in turn, allows the environmental effects predicted here to betested by observations.

astro-ph;0404033	probing dark matter haloes with satellite kinematics	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys we investigate to what extent thekinematics of large samples of satellites galaxies extracted from flux-limitedsurveys can be used to constrain halo masses. previous host-satellite selectioncriteria yield relatively large fractions of interlopers and with a velocitydistribution that, contrary to what has typically been assumed, differsstrongly from uniform. a new adaptive selection criterion is proposed whichyields much larger host-satellite samples and with strongly reduced interloperfractions. we show that satellite weighting, which occurs naturally whenstacking many host-satellite pairs, introduces a bias towards higher velocitydispersions compared to the true, host-averaged mean. a further bias, in thesame direction, is introduced when using flux-limited, rather thanvolume-limited surveys. we apply our adaptive selection criterion to the 2dfgrsand obtain a sample of 12613 satellite galaxies and 8004 host galaxies. thesatellite kinematics are in excellent agreement with predictions based on theconditional luminosity function (clf), providing independent, dynamicalconfirmation of the average mass-to-light ratios predicted by the clfformalism.

astro-ph;0404143	the three-point correlation function of galaxies: comparing halo  occupation models with observations	we present models for the three-point correlation function (3pcf) of bothdark matter and galaxies. we show that models based on the halo model canreasonably match the dark matter 3pcf obtained from high-resolution $n$-bodysimulations. on small scales ($r\la 0.5\mpch$) the 3pcf is sensitive to detailsregarding the density distributions of dark matter haloes. on larger scales ($r\ga 2.0\mpch$) the results are very sensitive to the abundance of the few mostprominant haloes. using the conditional luminosity function, we also constructmodels for the 3pcf of galaxies, which we test against large mock galaxysamples. the bias of the galaxy distrubution with respect to the dark matter,and the finite number of galaxies that can be hosted by individual haloes,significantly reduce the normalized three-point correlation function withrespect to that of dark matter. contrary to the 3pcf of the dark matter, thegalaxy 3pcf is much less sensitive to details regarding the spatial numberdensity distribution of galaxies in individual haloes or to the abundance ofthe few most massive systems. finally, we show that our model based on theconditional luminosity function is in good agreement with results obtained fromthe 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey. in particular, the model nicelyreproduces the observational finding that the 3pcf for early-type galaxies isslightly higher than that of late-type galaxies, and that there is nosignificant dependence of the 3pcf on galaxy luminosity.

astro-ph;0405234	a halo-based galaxy group finder: calibration and application to the  2dfgrs	we use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders inmagnitude-limited redshift surveys. since, according to the current scenario ofstructure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter halos,we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our groupfinder. the method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign atentative mass to each group. this mass is used to estimate the size andvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turnis used to determine group membership (in redshift space). this procedure isrepeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. we find that thefinal groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratioassumed. we use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosityfunction (clf), to test the performance of our group finder in terms ofcompleteness of true members and contamination by interlopers. our group finderis more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends group finder inassigning galaxies in common dark matter halos to a single group. we apply ourgroup finder to the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey and compare theresulting group properties with model predictions based on the clf. for the$\lambda$cdm `concordance' cosmology we find a clear discrepancy between themodel and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. inorder to match the observational results we have to either increase themass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher thancurrent observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma_8 \simeq 0.7$, comparedto the `concordance' value of 0.9.

astro-ph;0406246	the abundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (mgrss) we investigate theabundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies. the mock surveys areconstructed using the conditional luminosity function (clf), and are comparedagainst data from the 2dfgrs. we use monte carlo markov chains to explore thefull posterior distribution of the clf parameter space, and show that theaverage relation between light and mass is tightly constrained. the radialnumber density distribution of satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs reveals apronounced absence of satellites at small projected separations from their hostgalaxies. this is (at least partially) due to the overlap and merging of galaxyimages in the apm catalogue. because of the resulting close-pair incompletenesswe are unfortunately unable to put meaningful constraints on the radialdistribution of satellite galaxies. marginalizing over the full clf parameterspace, we show that in a lcdm concordance cosmology the observed abundances ofhost and satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs indicate a power spectrumnormalization of sigma_8=0.7. the same cosmology but with sigma_8=0.9 is unableto simultanously match the abundances of host and satellite galaxies. thisconfirms our previous conclusions based on the pairwise peculiar velocitydispersions and the group multipliticy function.

astro-ph;0406593	the two-point correlation of galaxy groups: probing the clustering of  dark matter haloes	we analyze the 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of galaxy groupsidentified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey with the halo basedgroup finder recently developed by yang et al (2004b). with this groupcatalogue we are able to estimate the 2pcfs for systems ranging from isolatedgalaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. the real-space correlation lengthobtained for these systems ranges from $\sim 4\mpch$ to $\sim 15\mpch$,respectively. the observed correlation amplitude (and the corresponding biasfactor) as a function of group abundance is well reproduced by associatinggalaxy groups with dark matter haloes in the standard $\lambda$cdm model.redshift distortions are clearly detected in the redshift-space correlationfunction, the degree of which is consistent with the assumption ofgravitational clustering and halo bias in the cosmic density field. inagreement with previous studies we find a strong increase of the correlationlength with the mean inter-group separation. although well determinedobservationally, we show that current theoretical predictions are not yetaccurate enough to allow for stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.finally, we use our results to explore the power-law nature of the 2pcf ofgalaxies. we split the 2pcf in 1-group and 2-group terms, equivalent to the1-halo and 2-halo terms in halo occupation models, and show that the power-lawform of the 2pcf is broken, when only including galaxies in the more massivesystems.

astro-ph;0410114	galaxy occupation statistics of dark matter haloes: observational  results	we study the occupation statistics of galaxies in dark matter haloes usinggalaxy groups identified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey withthe halo-based group finder of yang et al. the occupation distribution isconsidered separately for early and late type galaxies, as well as in terms ofcentral and satellite galaxies. the mean luminosity of the central galaxiesscales with halo mass approximately as $l_c\propto m^{2/3}$ for haloes withmasses $m&lt;10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$, and as $l_c\propto m^{1/4}$ for more massivehaloes. the characteristic mass of $10^{13} h^{-1} \msun$ is consistent withthe mass scale where galaxy formation models suggest a transition fromefficient to inefficient cooling. another characteristic halo mass scale,$m\sim 10^{11} h^{-1}\msun$, which cannot be probed directly by our groups, isinferred from the conditional luminosity function (clf) that matches theobserved galaxy luminosity function and clustering. for a halo of given mass,the distribution of $l_c$ is rather narrow. the satellite galaxies are found tofollow a poissonian number distribution. the central galaxies in low-masshaloes are mostly late type galaxies, while those in massive haloes are almostall early types. we also measure the clf of galaxies in haloes of given mass.over the mass range that can be reliably probed with the present data ($13.3\lta {\rm log}[m/(h^{-1}\msun)] \lta 14.7$), the clf is reasonably well fit bya schechter function. contrary to recent claims based on semi-analytical modelsof galaxy formation, the presence of central galaxies does not show up as astrong peak at the bright end of the clf.

astro-ph;0412018	the galaxy dark matter connection	what galaxy lives in what halo? the answer to this simple question holdsimportant information regarding galaxy formation and evolution. we describe anew statistical technique to link galaxies to their dark matter haloes, orlight to mass, using the clustering properties of galaxies as function of theirluminosity. the galaxy-dark matter connection thus established, andparameterized through the conditional luminosity function, indicates thepresence of two characteristic scales in galaxy formation: one at ~10^{11}msun, where galaxy formation is most efficient, and another at ~10^{13} msun,where a transition occurs from systems dominated by one brightest, centralgalaxy to systems with several dominant galaxies of comparable luminosity. weshow that the relation between light and mass established from galaxyclustering alone is in excellent agreement with the dynamical masses inferredfrom satellite kinematics. we also present a new (halo-based) galaxy-groupfinder, and show that the multiplicity function of galaxy groups identified inthe 2dfgrs suggests a relatively high mass-to-light ratio on the scales ofgalaxy clusters, or, alternatively, a relatively low value of sigma_8. thesefindings are also supported by our studies of pairwise peculiar velocities andsatellite abundances.

astro-ph;0502466	the phase-space parameters of brightest halo galaxies	the brightest galaxy in a dark matter halo is expected to reside at rest atthe center of the halo. in this paper we test this `central galaxy paradigm'using group catalogues extracted from the 2dfgrs and the sdss. for each groupwe compute a parameter, r, defined as the difference between the velocity ofthe brightest group galaxy and the average velocity of the other group members(hereafter satellites), normalized by the unbiased estimator of the velocitydispersion of the satellite galaxies. using detailed mock galaxy redshiftsurveys, we show that the central galaxy paradigm is inconsistent with the dataat high confidence, and that instead the brightest halo galaxies have aspecific kinetic energy that is about 25 percent of that of the satellites.this indicates that either central galaxies reside at the minimum of the darkmatter potential, but that the halo itself is not yet fully relaxed, or, thatthe halo is relaxed, but that the central galaxy oscillates in its potentialwell. the former is consistent with the fact that we find a weak hint that thevelocity bias of brightest halo galaxies is larger in more massive haloes,while the latter may be indicative of cored, rather than cusped, dark matterhaloes. we discuss several implications of these findings, including massestimates based on satellite kinematics, strong gravitational lensing, halooccupation models, and the frequency and longevity of lopsidedness in diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0504477	the cross-correlation between galaxies and groups: probing the galaxy  distribution in and around dark matter haloes	we determine the cross-correlation function between galaxies and galaxygroups, using both the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we study the cross-correlation as a functionof group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. all thesecross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups inconsideration. on scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlationfunctions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. inparticular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massivegroups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. in the `1-halo' regime, thecross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the groupcenter. we consider both a luminosity-weighted center (lwc) and a centerdefined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (bgc). with the firstdefinition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to bemore centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. using thebgc, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, weonly find significant segregation in massive groups ($m \gta10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours orspecific star formation rates). in haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. comparing theresults from the 2dfgrs with those obtained from realistic mock samples, wefind that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated thandark matter haloes predicted by the current $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;0506516	preheating by previrialization and its impact on galaxy formation	we use recent observations of the hi-mass function to constrain galaxyformation. the data conflicts with the standard model where most of the gas ina low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas thatis depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the diskbecomes gravitationally stable. a consistent model can be found if low-masshaloes are embedded in a preheated medium, with a specific gas entropy ~ 10kevcm^2. such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxyluminosity function. we propose a preheating model where the medium aroundlow-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking. since gravitationaltidal fields suppress the formation of low-mass haloes while promoting that ofpancakes, the formation of massive pancakes precedes that of the low-masshaloes within them. we demonstrate that the progenitors of present-day darkmatter haloes with m&lt;10^{12}h^{-1}\msun were embedded in pancakes of masses$~5x10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$ at z~2. the formation of such pancakes heats the gas toa temperature of 5x10^5k and compresses it to an overdensity of ~10. such gashas a cooling time that exceeds the age of the universe at z~2, and has aspecific entropy of ~15kev cm^2, almost exactly the amount required to explainthe stellar and hi mass functions.

astro-ph;0509147	properties of galaxy groups in the sdss: i.-- the dependence of colour,  star formation, and morphology on halo mass	using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sdss, weinvestigate the correlation between various galaxy properties and halo mass. wesplit the population of galaxies in early types, late types, and intermediatetypes, based on their colour and specific star formation rate. at fixedluminosity, the early type fraction increases with increasing halo mass. mostimportantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire massrange probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. we argue that theprevious claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is anartefact of the environment estimators used. at fixed halo mass, the luminositydependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends morestrongly on halo mass than on luminosity. we also find that the early typefraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. contrary to previousstudies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low masshaloes. the properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with thoseof their central galaxy. in particular, the early type fraction of satellitesis significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in ahalo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. this phenomenon,which we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and forsatellites of all luminosities. finally, the fraction of intermediate typegalaxies is always ~20 percent, independent of luminosity, independent of halomass, independent of halo-centric radius, and independent of whether the galaxyis a central galaxy or a satellite galaxy. we discuss the implications of allthese findings for galaxy formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0601040	the alignment between the distribution of satellites and the orientation  of their central galaxy	we use galaxy groups selected from the sloan digital sky survey to examinethe alignment between the orientation of the central galaxy (defined as thebrightest group member) and the distribution of satellite galaxies. byconstruction, we therefore only address the alignment on scales smaller thanthe halo virial radius. we find a highly significant alignment of satelliteswith the major axis of their central galaxy. this is in qualitative agreementwith the recent study of brainerd (2005), but inconsistent with severalprevious studies who detected a preferential minor axis alignment. thealignment strength in our sample is strongest between red central galaxies andred satellites. on the contrary, the satellite distribution in systems with ablue central galaxy is consistent with isotropic. we also find that thealignment strength is stronger in more massive haloes and at smaller projectedradii from the central galaxy. in addition, there is a weak indication thatfainter (relative to the central galaxy) satellites are more strongly aligned.we present a detailed comparison with previous studies, and discuss theimplications of our findings for galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0606458	properties of galaxy groups in the sdss: ii.- agn feedback and star  formation truncation	successfully reproducing the galaxy luminosity function and the bimodality inthe galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that can truncate star formationin massive haloes. current models of galaxy formation consider two suchtruncation mechanisms: strangulation, which acts on satellite galaxies, and agnfeedback, which predominantly affects central galaxies. the efficiencies ofthese processes set the blue fraction of galaxies as function of galaxyluminosity and halo mass. in this paper we use a galaxy group catalogueextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to determine thesefractions. to demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark forgalaxy formation models, we compare the results to the semi-analytical modelfor galaxy formation of croton et al. (2006). although this model accuratelyfits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape ofthe conditional luminosity function, there are significant discrepancies whenthe blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is comparedbetween the observations and the model. in particular, the model predicts (i)too many faint satellite galaxies in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction ofsatellites that is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of centrals that istoo high and with an inverted luminosity dependence. in the same order, weargue that these discrepancies owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in thesemi-analytical model, (ii) the oversimplified treatment of strangulation, and(iii) improper modeling of dust extinction and/or agn feedback. the datapresented here will prove useful to test and calibrate future models of galaxyformation and in particular to discriminate between various models for agnfeedback and other star formation truncation mechanisms.

astro-ph;0607552	weak lensing by galaxies in groups and clusters: i.--theoretical  expectations	galaxy-galaxy lensing is rapidly becoming one of the most promising means toaccurately measure the average relation between galaxy properties and halomass. in order to obtain a signal of sufficient signal-to-noise, one needs tostack many lens galaxies according to their property of interest, such asluminosity or stellar mass. since such a stack consists of both central andsatellite galaxies, which contribute very different lensing signals, theresulting shear measurements can be difficult to interpret. in the past,galaxy-galaxy lensing studies have either completely ignored this problem, haveapplied rough isolation criteria in an attempt to preferentially select`central' galaxies, or have tried to model the contribution of satellitesexplicitely. however, if one is able to {\it a priori} split the galaxypopulation in central and satellite galaxies, one can measure their lensingsignals separately. this not only allows a much cleaner measurement of therelation between halo mass and their galaxy populations, but also allows adirect measurement of the sub-halo masses around satellite galaxies. in thispaper, we use a realistic mock galaxy redshift survey to show that galaxygroups, properly selected from large galaxy surveys, can be used to accuratelysplit the galaxy population in centrals and satellites. stacking the resultingcentrals according to their group mass, estimated from the total groupluminosity, allows a remarkably accurate recovery of the masses and densityprofiles of their host haloes. in addition, stacking the correspondingsatellite galaxies according to their projected distance from the group centeryields a lensing signal that can be used to accurate measure the masses of bothsub-haloes and host haloes.

astro-ph;0610686	towards a concordant model of halo occupation statistics	we use the conditional luminosity function (clf) and data from the 2dfgrs toconstrain the average relation between light and mass in a lcdm cosmology withomega_m=0.23 and sigma_8=0.74 (hereafter wmap3 cosmology). reproducing theobserved luminosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation functionresults in average mass-to-light ratios that are about 35 percent lower than ina lcdm cosmology with omega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.9 (hereafter wmap1 cosmology).this removes an important problem with previous halo occupation models whichhad a tendency to predict cluster mass-to-light ratios that were too high. forthe wmap3 cosmology our model yields average mass-to-light ratios, centralgalaxy luminosities, halo occupation numbers, satellite fractions, andluminosity-gap statistics, that are all in excellent agreement with thoseobtained from a 2dfgrs group catalogue and from other independent studies. wealso use our clf model to compute the probability distribution p(m|l_cen), thata central galaxy of luminosity l_cen resides in a halo of mass m. we find thisdistribution to be much broader than what is typically assumed in hod models,which has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy-galaxylensing data. finally, reproducing the luminosity dependence of the pairwisevelocity dispersions in the 2dfgrs requires relatively low mass-to-light ratiosfor clusters and a satellite fraction that decreases strongly with increasingluminosity. this is only marginally consistent with our clf constraints. weargue that a cosmology with parameters between those of the wmap1 and wmap3cosmologies is likely to yield results with a higher level of consistency.

astro-ph;0701130	the alignment between satellites and central galaxies: theory vs.  observations	recent studies have shown that the distribution of satellite galaxies ispreferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy. thestrength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours ofthe satellite and central galaxies, and only weakly on the mass of the halo inwhich the galaxies reside. in this paper we study whether these alignmentsignals, and their dependence on galaxy and halo properties, can be reproducedin a hierarchical structure formation model of a $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. to that extent we use a large $n$-body simulation which we populatewith galaxies following a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. we findthat if the orientation of the central galaxy is perfectly aligned with that ofits dark matter halo, then the predicted central-satellite alignment signal ismuch stronger than observed. if, however, the minor axis of a central galaxy isperfectly aligned with the angular momentum vector of its dark matter halo, wecan accurately reproduce the observed alignment strength as function of halomass and galaxy color. although this suggests that the orientation of centralgalaxies is governed by the angular momentum of their dark matter haloes, weemphasize that any other scenario in which the minor axes of central galaxy andhalo are misaligned by $\sim 40^{\circ}$ (on average) will match the dataequally well. finally, we show that dependence of the alignment strength on thecolor of the central galaxy is most likely an artefact due to interlopers inthe group catalogue. the dependence on the color of the satellite galaxies, onthe other hand, is real and owes to the fact that red satellites are associatedwith subhaloes that were more massive at their time of accretion.

astro-ph;0703253	the cross-correlation between galaxies of different luminosities and  colors	we study the cross-correlation between galaxies of different luminosities andcolors, using a sample selected from the sdss dr 4. galaxies are divided into 6samples according to luminosity, and each of these samples is divided into redand blue subsamples. projected auto-correlation and cross-correlation isestimated for these subsample. at projected separations r_p &gt; 1\mpch, allcorrelation functions are roughly parallel, although the correlation amplitudedepends systematically on luminosity and color. on r_p &lt; 1\mpch, the auto- andcross-correlation functions of red galaxies are significantly enhanced relativeto the corresponding power laws obtained on larger scales. such enhancement isabsent for blue galaxies and in the cross-correlation between red and bluegalaxies. we esimate the relative bias factor on scales r &gt; 1\mpch for eachsubsample using its auto-correlation function and cross-correlation functions.the relative bias factors obtained from different methods are similar. for bluegalaxies the luminosity-dependence of the relative bias is strong over theluminosity range probed (-23.0&lt;m_r &lt; -18.0),but for red galaxies the dependenceis weaker and becomes insignificant for luminosities below l^*. to examinewhether a significant stochastic/nonlinear component exists in the biasrelation, we study the ratio r_ij= w_{ii}w_{jj}/w_{ij}^2, where w_{ij} is theprojected correlation between subsample i and j. we find that the values ofr_ij are all consistent with 1 for all-all, red-red and blue-blue samples,however significantly larger than 1 for red-blue samples. for faint red - faintblue samples the values of r_{ij} are as high as ~ 2 on small scales r_p &lt; 1\mpch and decrease with increasing r_p.

0809.2283	environmental effects on satellite galaxies: the link between  concentration, size and colour profile	using the sdss dr4 group catalogue of yang et al. (2007), we investigatesizes, concentrations, colour gradients and surface brightness profiles ofcentral and satellite galaxies. we compare central and satellite galaxies atfixed stellar mass, in order to disentangle environmental from stellar massdependencies. early and late type galaxies are defined according toconcentration. we find that at fixed stellar mass, late type satellite galaxieshave smaller radii and larger concentrations than late type central galaxies.no such differences are found for early-type galaxies. we have also constructedsurface brightness and colour profiles for the central and satellite galaxiesin our sample. we find that late-type satellite galaxies have a lower surfacebrightness and redder colours than late-type central galaxies. we show that allobserved differences between satellite and central galaxies can be explained bya simple fading model, in which the star formation in the disk decreases overtimescales of 2-3 gyr after a galaxy becomes a satellite. processes that inducestrong morphological changes (e.g. harassment) and processes that strip thegalaxy of its entire ism need not to be invoked in order to explain theenvironmental dependencies we find.

0810.2794	the correlation of star formation quenching with internal galaxy  properties and environment	we investigate the correlation of star formation quenching with internalgalaxy properties and large scale environment (halo mass) in empirical data andtheoretical models. we make use of the halo-based group catalog of yang andcollaborators, which is based on the sloan digital sky survey. data from thegalaxy evolution explorer (galex) are also used to extract the recent starformation rate. in order to investigate the environmental effects, we examinethe properties of "central" and "satellite" galaxies separately. for centralgalaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching isprimarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these twoquantities are themselves strongly correlated. for satellite galaxies, a nearlyequally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. we make thesame comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on threeindependently developed codes. we find that the models with agn feedbackreproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red andpassive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. however, for satellitegalaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passivegalaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halomass. this {\em satellite overquenching problem} is caused by the too-rapidstripping of the satellites' hot gas halos, which leads to rapid strangulationof star formation.

0810.3359	alignments of group galaxies with neighboring groups	using a sample of galaxy groups found in the sloan digital  sky survey data release 4, we measure the following four types of alignmentsignals: (1) the alignment between the distributions of the satellites of eachgroup relative to the direction of the nearest neighbor group (nng); (2) thealignment between the major axis direction of the central galaxy of the hostgroup (hg) and the direction of the nng; (3) the alignment between the majoraxes of the central galaxies of the hg and the nng; and (4) the alignmentbetween the major axes of the satellites of the hg and the direction of thenng. we find strong signal of alignment between the satellite distribution andthe orientation of central galaxy relative to the direction of the nng, evenwhen the nng is located beyond $3r_{\rm vir}$ of the host group. the major axisof the central galaxy of the hg is aligned with the direction of the nng. thealignment signals are more prominent for groups that are more massive and withearly type central galaxies. we also find that there is a preference for thetwo major axis of the central galaxies of the hg and nng to be parallel for thesystem with both early central galaxies, however not for the systems with bothlate type central galaxies. for the orientation of satellite galaxies, we donot find any significant alignment signals relative to the direction of thenng. from these four types of alignment measurements, we conclude that thelarge scale environment traced by the nearby group affects primarily the shapeof the host dark matter halo, and hence also affects the distribution ofsatellite galaxies and the orientation of central galaxies.

0812.3723	the nature of red dwarf galaxies	using dark matter halos traced by galaxy groups selected from the sloandigital sky survey data release 4, we find that about 1/4 of the faint galaxies($\rmag &gt;-17.05$, hereafter dwarfs) that are the central galaxies in their ownhalo are not blue and star forming, as expected in standard models of galaxyformation, but are red. in contrast, this fraction is about 1/2 for dwarfsatellite galaxies. many red dwarf galaxies are physically associated with moremassive halos. in total, about $\sim 45$% of red dwarf galaxies reside inmassive halos as satellites, while another $\sim 25$% have a spatialdistribution that is much more concentrated towards their nearest massivehaloes than other dwarf galaxies. we use mock catalogs to show that the reddestpopulation of non-satellite dwarf galaxies are distributed within about 3 timesthe virial radii of their nearest massive halos. we suggest that thispopulation of dwarf galaxies are hosted by low-mass halos that have passedthrough their massive neighbors, and that the same environmental effects thatcause satellite galaxies to become red are also responsible for the red colorsof this population of galaxies. we do not find any significant radialdependence of the population of dwarf galaxies with the highest concentrations,suggesting that the mechanisms operating on these galaxies affect color morethan structure. however, over 30% of dwarf galaxies are red and isolated andtheir origin remains unknown.
