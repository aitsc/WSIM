0901.1138	the acs fornax cluster survey. v. measurement and recalibration of  surface brightness fluctuations and a precise value of the fornax--virgo  relative distance	we present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster imaged withhst/acs. these are combined with measurements for virgo cluster galaxies toderive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band sbf absolute magnitude asa function of g-z. in all, we tabulate recalibrated sbf distances for 134galaxies in virgo, fornax, the virgo w' group, and ngc4697 in the virgosouthern extension. the calibration procedure yields a precise relativedistance modulus for fornax with respect to virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or adistance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. the resulting fornax distance modulus is 31.51+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 mpc, where the second set of error barsreflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed virgo distance of 16.5 mpc.the rms distance scatter for the early-type fornax galaxies is0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.this translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or "cosmic",scatter sigma_cosmic in the sbf calibration, unlike in virgo. as a result, weare able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic&lt;0.08 mag, atleast for galaxies with g-z&gt;1.02. we also present an alternative sbfcalibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter nbar, a proxy for galaxymass, which gives a consistent relative distance. finally, we find no evidencefor systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,no current infall); the fornax cluster appears both compact and wellvirialized.[abridged]

0907.2524	the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor globular clusters in m87:  confirmation from deep hst/acs imaging	metal-poor globular clusters (gcs) are our local link to the earliest epochsof star formation and galaxy building. studies of extragalactic gc systemsusing deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope tothe color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs in a number of galaxies. wepresent a study of the m87 gc system using deep, archival hst/acs imaging withthe f606w and f814w filters, in which we find a significant color-magnituderelation for the metal-poor gcs. the slope of this relation in the i vs. v-icolor-magnitude diagram ($\gamma_i=-0.024\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistentwith expectations based on previously published results using data from the acsvirgo cluster survey. the relation is driven by the most luminous gcs, thosewith $m_i&lt;-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor gcsbrighter than $m_i=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fittedgaussian mean for the luminosity function (lf) of blue, metal-poor gcs (~0.8mag fainter than the mean for all gcs). these results indicate that there is amass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenariowhere self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. we show thatpreviously measured half-light radii of m87 gcs from best-fit psf-convolvedking models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study,and we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs is realand cannot be an artifact of the photometry. we fit gaussian and evolvedschechter functions to the luminosity distribution of gcs across all colors, aswell as divided into blue and red subpopulations, finding that the blue gcshave a brighter mean luminosity and a narrower distribution than the red gcs.finally, we present a catalog of astrometry and photometry for 2250 m87 gcs.

0909.0398	the remnants of galaxy formation from a panoramic survey of the region  around m31	in hierarchical cosmological models, galaxies grow in mass through thecontinual accretion of smaller ones. the tidal disruption of these systems isexpected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distancesthat reach $10 - 100$ times the radius of the central disk. the number,luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significantclues to galaxy formation history, but obtaining a comprehensive survey ofthese components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vastextent. here we report a panoramic survey of the andromeda galaxy (m31). wedetect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants ofdwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of m31. an improved census of theirsurviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of m31's satellites brighterthan $m_v &lt; -6$ await discovery. the brightest companion, triangulum (m33), issurrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for arecent encounter with m31. this panorama of galaxy structure directly confirmsthe basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals theshared history of m31 and m33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies.

1003.3450	the acs fornax cluster survey vii. half-light radii of globular clusters  in early-type galaxies	we measure the half-light radii of globular clusters (gcs) in 43 galaxiesfrom the acs fornax cluster survey (acsfcs). we use these data to extendprevious work in which the environmental dependencies of the half-light radiiof gcs in early type galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey (acsvcs) werestudied, and a corrected mean half-light radius (corrected for the observedenvironmental trends) was suggested as a reliable distance indicator. this workboth increases the sample size for the study of the environmental dependencies,and adds leverage to the study of the corrected half-light radius as a possibledistance indicator (since fornax lies at a larger distance than the virgocluster). we study the environmental dependencies of the size of gcs using botha principal component analysis as well as 2d scaling relations. we largelyconfirm the environmental dependencies shown in jordan et al. (2005), but findevidence that there is a residual correlation in the mean half-light radius ofgc systems with galaxy magnitude, and subtle differences in the othercorrelations - so there may not be a universal correction for the half-lightradii of lower luminosity galaxy gc systems. the main factor determining thesize of a gc in an early type galaxy is the gc color. red gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; =2.8+/-0.3 pc, while blue gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; = 3.4+/-0.3 pc. we show that for brightearly-type galaxies (m_b &lt; -19 mag), the uncorrected mean half-light radius ofthe gc system is by itself an excellent distance indicator (with error ~11%),having the potential to reach cosmologically interesting distances in the eraof high angular resolution adaptive optics on large optical telescopes.

1004.2883	the acs fornax cluster survey. viii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in virgo and fornax early-type galaxies and its use as a distance  indicator	we use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globularcluster luminosity function (gclf). the globular cluster system of each galaxywas studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic gclfafter accounting for contamination and completeness effects. the resultspresented here update our virgo measurements and confirm our previous resultsshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the gclf and the absolutemagnitude of the parent galaxy. regarding the use of the gclf as a standardcandle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the virgo andfornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distanceestimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived fromsurface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. fromnumerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the valueof the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsicdispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for virgo and fornaxrespectively. all in all, our study shows that the gclf properties varysystematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy betweengiant and dwarf early-type galaxies. these properties may be influenced by thecluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.

1009.4205	revisiting the influence of unidentified binaries on velocity dispersion  measurements in ultra-faint stellar systems	velocity dispersion measurements of recently discovered milky way satelliteswith $m_v\gtrsim-7$ imply they posses high mass-to-light ratios. the expectedvelocity dispersions due to their baryonic mass are $\sim0.2$\,km\,s$^{-1}$,but values $\gtrsim3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ are measured. we perform monte carlosimulations of mock radial velocity measurements of these systems assuming theyhave mass-to-light ratios similar to globular clusters and posses anunidentified binary star population, to determine if these stars could boostthe velocity dispersion to the observed values. we find that this hypothesis isunlikely to produce dispersions much in excess of $\sim 4.5$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, inagreement with previous work. however, for the systems with potentially thesmallest velocity dispersions, values consistent with observations are producedin 5-40% of our simulations for binary fractions in excess of$f_{bin}(p\le10$\,yrs$)\sim5%$. this sample includes the dwarf galaxycandidates that lie closest to classical globular clusters in $m_v-r_h$ space.considered as a population, it is unlikely that all of these dwarf galaxycandidates have mass-to-light ratios typical of globular clusters, but boostingof the observed dispersion by binaries from near-zero values cannot be ruledout at high confidence for several individual dwarf galaxy candidates. giventhe importance of obtaining accurate velocity dispersions and dynamical massesfor the faintest satellites, it is clearly desirable to exclude directly thepossible effect of binaries on these systems. this requires multi-epoch radialvelocity measurements with individual uncertainties of$\lesssim$1\,km\,s$^{-1}$ to identify spectroscopic binaries with orbitalvelocities of order the observed velocity dispersion.

1012.0306	the acs fornax cluster survey. iv. deprojection of the surface  brightness profiles of early-type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters:  investigating the "core/power-law dichotomy"	although early observations with the hubble space telescope (hst) pointed toa sharp dichotomy among early-type galaxies in terms of the logarithmic slopegamma' of their central surface brightness profiles, several studies in thepast few years have called this finding into question. in particular, recentimaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the virgo and fornaxclusters using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on board hst have notfound a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from centralluminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of thebest-fitting global sersic model. given that earlier studies also found thatthe dichotomy persisted when analyzing the deprojected density profile slopes,we investigate the distribution of the three-dimensional luminosity densityprofiles of the acs virgo and fornax cluster survey galaxies. having fitted thesurface brightness profiles with modified sersic models, we then deproject thegalaxies using an abel integral and measure the inner slopes gamma_3d of theresulting luminosity density profiles at various fractions of the effectiveradius r_e. we find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuousvariation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.we introduce a parameter, delta_3d, that measures the central deviation of thedeprojected luminosity profiles from the global sersic fit, showing that thisparameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.

1012.2634	the acs fornax cluster survey. x. color gradients of globular cluster  systems in early-type galaxies	we use the largest homogeneous sample of globular clusters (gcs), drawn fromthe acsvcs and acsfcs, to investigate the color gradients of gc systems in 76early-type galaxies. we find that most gc systems possess an obvious negativegradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). for gc systems displaying colorbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor gc subpopulations present shallowerbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these twosubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. the fov of acs mainly restrictsus to measuring the inner gradients of gc systems. these gradients, however,can introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of gcsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. inferred correctionsto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the meancolor of metal-poor gcs and their host galaxy luminosity. the gc colorgradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens areweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarfgalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar massof m_stellar~10^10m_sun. we also measure color gradients for field stars in thehost galaxies. we find that gc color gradients are systematically steeper thanfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is thesame for both. if gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse andweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner gcsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidlywith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. the lack ofstrong gradients in the gc systems of dwarfs, which probably have notexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos wereinefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of gc formation.

1101.5399	the globular cluster systems of abell 1185	we examine the properties of a previously discovered population of globularclusters in the heart of the rich galaxy cluster abell 1185 that might beintergalactic in nature. deep images obtained with the advanced camera forsurveys (acs) aboard hubble space telescope (hst) confirm the presence of ~1300 globular clusters brighter than i_{f814w} = 27.3 mag in a field devoid ofany large galaxies. the luminosities and colors of these objects are found tobe similar to those of metal-poor globular clusters observed in many galaxiesto date. although a significant fraction of the detected globular clustersundoubtedly reside in the outer halos of galaxies adjacent to this field,detailed modeling of their distribution suggests that the majority of theseobjects are likely to be intergalactic, in the sense that they are notgravitationally bound to any individual galaxy. we conclude that the truenature and origin of the globular cluster population in the core of a1185 --galactic residents or intergalactic wanderers -- remains uncertain, and suggesthow future observation could resolve this ambiguity.

1303.1210	the complex nature of the nuclear star cluster in fcc 277	recent observations have shown that compact nuclear star clusters (nscs) arepresent in up to 80% of galaxies. however, detailed studies of their dynamicaland chemical properties are confined mainly to spiral galaxy hosts, where theyare more easily observed. in this paper we present our study of the nsc in fcc277, a nucleated elliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster. we use a combinationof adaptive optics assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopy, hubblespace telescope imaging, and literature long slit data. we show that while thensc does not appear to rotate within our detection limit of ~6 km/s, rotationis detected at larger radii, where the isophotes appear to be disky, suggestingthe presence of a nuclear disk. we also observe a distinct central velocitydispersion drop that is indicative of a dynamically cold rotating sub-system.following the results of orbit-based dynamical modelling, co-rotating as wellas counter-rotating stellar orbits are simultaneously needed to reproduce theobserved kinematics. we find evidence for varying stellar populations, with thensc and nuclear disk hosting younger and more metal rich stars than the mainbody of the galaxy. we argue that gas dissipation and some level of merginghave likely played an important role in the formation of the nucleus of thisintermediate-mass galaxy. this is in contrast to nscs in low-mass early- typegalaxies, which may have been formed primarily through the infall of starclusters.

0803.0330	the acs virgo cluster survey xv. the formation efficiencies of globular  clusters in early-type galaxies: the effects of mass and environment	the fraction of stellar mass contained in globular clusters (gcs), alsomeasured by number as the specific frequency, is a fundamental quantity thatreflects both a galaxy's early star formation and its entire merging history.we present specific frequencies, luminosities, and mass fractions for theglobular cluster systems of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey, the largest homogeneous catalog of its kind. we find that 1) gc massfractions can be high in both giants and dwarfs, but are universally low ingalaxies with intermediate luminosities. 2) the behavior of specific frequencyacross galaxy mass is dominated by the blue gcs. 3) the gc fractions oflow-mass galaxies exhibit a dependence on environment. nearly all dwarfgalaxies with high gc fractions are within 1 mpc of the cd galaxy m87,presenting the first strong evidence that gc formation in dwarfs is biasedtoward dense environments. 4) gc formation in central dwarfs is biased becausetheir stars form earliest and most intensely. comparisons to the millenniumsimulation show that central dwarfs have older stellar populations and formmore stars at higher star formation rates (sfrs) and sfr surface densities. thesfr surface density in simulated dwarfs peaks before the total sfr, naturallyproducing gc populations that are older and more metal-poor than the fieldstars. 5) dwarfs within ~40 kpc of the giant ellipticals m87 and m49 are redand have few or no gcs, suggesting that they have been tidally stripped andhave contributed their gcs to the halos of their giant neighbors. the centraldwarfs with high gc mass fractions are thus likely to be the survivors mostsimilar to the protogalaxies that assembled the rich m87 globular clustersystem.(abridged)

1407.2263	the next generation virgo cluster survey. v. modelling the dynamics of  m87 with the made-to-measure method	we study the dynamics of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 from the central tothe outermost regions with the made-to-measure (m2m) method. we use a newcatalogue of 922 globular cluster line-of- sight velocities extending to aprojected radius of 180 kpc (equivalent to 25 m87 effective radii), and sauronintegral field unit data within the central 2.4 kpc. 263 globular clusters,mainly located beyond 40 kpc, are newly observed by the next generation virgosurvey (ngvs). for the m2m modelling, the gravitational potential is taken as acombination of a luminous matter potential with a constant stellarmass-to-light ratio and a dark matter potential modelled as a logarithmicpotential. our best dynamical model returns a stellar mass-to-light ratio inthe i band of m/li = 6.0(+ -0.3) m_sun/l_sun with a dark matter potential scalevelocity of 591(+ -50) km/s and scale radius of 42(+ -10) kpc. we determine thetotal mass of m87 within 180 kpc to be (1.5 + - 0.2) 10^13 m_sun. the masswithin 40 kpc is smaller than previous estimates determined using globularcluster kinematics that did not extend beyond 45 kpc. with our new globularcluster velocities at much larger radii, we see that globular clusters around40 kpc show an anomalously large velocity dispersion which affected previousresults. the mass we derived is in good agreement with that inferred from rosatx-ray observation out to 180 kpc. within 30 kpc our mass is also consistentwith that inferred from chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations, while within120 kpc it is about 20% smaller. the model velocity dispersion anisotropy betaparameter for the globular clusters in m87 is small, varying from -0.2 at thecentre to 0.2 at 40 kpc, and gradually decreasing to zero at 120 kpc.

1407.2996	the infrared imaging spectrograph (iris) for tmt: overview of innovative  science programs	iris (infrared imaging spectrograph) is a first light near-infrareddiffraction limited imager and integral field spectrograph being designed forthe future thirty meter telescope (tmt). iris is optimized to performastronomical studies across a significant fraction of cosmic time, from oursolar system to distant newly formed galaxies (barton et al. [1]). we present aselection of the innovative science cases that are unique to iris in the era ofupcoming space and ground-based telescopes. we focus on integral fieldspectroscopy of directly imaged exoplanet atmospheres, probing fundamentalphysics in the galactic center, measuring 10^4 to 10^10 msun supermassive blackhole masses, resolved spectroscopy of young star-forming galaxies (1 &lt; z &lt; 5)and first light galaxies (6 &lt; z &lt; 12), and resolved spectroscopy of stronggravitational lensed sources to measure dark matter substructure. for each ofthese science cases we use the iris simulator (wright et al.

1410.6291	globular cluster systems in brightest cluster galaxies: a near-universal  luminosity function?	we present the first results from our hst brightest cluster galaxy (bcg)survey of seven central supergiant cluster galaxies and their globular cluster(gc) systems. we measure a total of 48000 gcs in all seven galaxies,representing the largest single gc database. we find that a log-normal shapeaccurately matches the observed luminosity function (lf) of the gcs down to thegclf turnover point, which is near our photometric limit. in addition, the lfhas a virtually identical shape in all seven galaxies. our data underscore thesimilarity in the formation mechanism of massive star clusters in diversegalactic environments. at the highest luminosities (log l &gt; 10^7 l_sun) we findsmall numbers of "superluminous" objects in five of the galaxies; theirluminosity and color ranges are at least partly consistent with those of ucds(ultra-compact dwarfs). lastly, we find preliminary evidence that in the outerhalo (r &gt; 20 kpc), the lf turnover point shows a weak dependence on projecteddistance, scaling as l_0 ~ r^-0.2, while the lf dispersion remains nearlyconstant.

1504.00021	a megacam survey of outer halo satellites. iv. two foreground  populations possibly associated with the monoceros substructure in the  direction of ngc2419 and koposov2	the origin of the galactic halo stellar structure known as the monoceros ringis still under debate. in this work, we study that halo substructure using deepcfht wide-field photometry obtained for the globular clusters ngc2419 andkoposov2, where the presence of monoceros becomes significant because of theircoincident projected position. using sloan digital sky survey photometry andspectroscopy in the area surrounding these globulars and beyond, where the samemonoceros population is detected, we conclude that a second feature, not likelyto be associated with milky way disk stars along the line-of-sight, is presentas foreground population. our analysis suggests that the monoceros ring mightbe composed of an old stellar population of age t ~ 9gyr and a new component ~4gyr younger at the same heliocentric distance. alternatively, this detectionmight be associated with a second wrap of monoceros in that direction of thesky and also indicate a metallicity spread in the ring. the detection of such alow-density feature in other sections of this halo substructure will shed lighton its nature.

1507.02737	the next generation virgo cluster survey. ix. estimating the efficiency  of galaxy formation on the lowest-mass scales	the next generation virgo cluster survey has recently determined theluminosity function of galaxies in the core of the virgo cluster down tounprecedented magnitude and surface brightness limits. comparing simulations ofcluster formation to the derived central stellar mass function, we attempt toestimate the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio (shmr) for dwarf galaxies, as it wouldhave been before they fell into the cluster. this approach ignores severaldetails and complications, e.g., the contribution of ongoing star formation tothe present-day stellar mass of cluster members, and the effects of adiabaticcontraction and/or violent feedback on the subhalo and cluster potentials. thefinal results are startlingly simple, however; we find that the trends in theshmr determined previously for bright galaxies appear to extend down in ascale-invariant way to the faintest objects detected in the survey. theseresults extend measurements of the formation efficiency of field galaxies bytwo decades in halo mass, or five decades in stellar mass, down to some of theleast massive dwarf galaxies known, with stellar masses of $\sim 10^5 m_\odot$.

1508.07334	the next generation virgo cluster survey. x. properties of ultra-compact  dwarfs in the m87, m49 and m60 regions	we use imaging from the next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) topresent a comparative study of ultra-compact dwarf (ucd) galaxies associatedwith three prominent virgo sub-clusters: those centered on the massive,red-sequence galaxies m87, m49 and m60. we show how ucds can be selected withhigh completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location incolor-color diagrams ($u^*ik_s$ or $u^*gz$). although the central galaxies ineach of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellarmasses, we find large differences in the sizes of their ucd populations, withm87 containing ~3.5 and 7.8 times more ucds than m49 and m60, respectively. therelative abundance of ucds in the three regions scales in proportion tosub-cluster mass, as traced by x-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, numberof globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. we find that the ucds arepredominantly blue in color, with ~85% of the ucds having colors similar toblue gcs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. we present evidence that ucdssurrounding m87 and m49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by theprominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately mergingwith the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominencecorrelates with distance from either galaxy. our analysis provides evidencethat tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in theformation of ucds.

0806.0374	the nature of ucds: internal dynamics from an expanded sample and  homogeneous database	we have obtained high-resolution spectra of 23 ultra-compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) in the fornax cluster with -10.4&gt;m_v&gt;-13.5 mag (10^6&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8), usingflames/giraffe at the vlt. this is the largest homogeneous data set of ucdinternal dynamics assembled to date. we derive dynamical m/l ratios for 15 ucdscovered by hst imaging. in the m_v-sigma plane, ucds with m_v&lt;-12 mag areconsistent with the extrapolated faber-jackson relation for luminousellipticals, while fainter ucds are closer to the extrapolated globular cluster(gc) relation. at a given metallicity, fornax ucds have on average 30-40% lowerm/l ratios than virgo ucds, suggesting possible differences in age or darkmatter content between fornax and virgo ucds. for our sample of fornax ucds wefind no significant correlation between m/l ratio and mass. we combine our datawith available m/l ratio measurements of compact stellar systems with10^4&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8, and normalise all m/l estimates to solar metallicity. we findthat ucds (m &gt; 2*10^6 m_*) have m/l ratios twice as large as gcs (m &lt; 2*10^6m_*). we show that stellar population models tend to under-predict dynamicalm/l ratios of ucds and over-predict those of gcs. considering the scalingrelations of stellar spheroids, ucds align well along the 'fundamentalmanifold', constituting the small-scale end of the galaxy sequence. thealignment for ucds is especially clear for r_e &gt;~ 7 pc, which corresponds todynamical relaxation times that exceed a hubble time. in contrast, gcs exhibita broader scatter and do not appear to align along the manifold. we argue thatucds are the smallest dynamically un-relaxed stellar systems, with m &gt; 2*10^6m_* and 7&lt;r_e&lt;100 pc. future studies should aim at explaining the elevated m/lratios of ucds and the environmental dependence of their properties.

astro-ph;0009505	abundance patterns in the draco, sextans and ursa minor dwarf spheroidal  galaxies	the keck i telescope has been used to obtain hires spectra for red giantsbelonging to the draco, sextans and ursa minor dwarf spheroidal (dsph)galaxies. an analysis of these spectra is presented, along with abundanceratios for more than 20 elements. the resulting database of element abundancesfor 17 stars is the most extensive yet assembled for stars in dsphenvironments. our main findings are summarized as follows: (1) there isunambiguous evidence for a large internal spread in metallicity in all threegalaxies: our program stars span a range of [fe/h] = 1.53, 1.40 and 0.73 dex indraco, sextans and ursa minor, respectively. (2) the abundance patterns amongthe dsph stars are remarkably uniform, suggesting that all three galaxies havesimilar nucleosynthetic histories. (3) a comparison of the measured abundanceratios for our sample of dsph stars with published values for galactic halo anddisk field stars suggests that the dsph galaxies have 0.02 &lt; [alpha/fe] &lt; 0.13dex, whereas the halo field star sample has [alpha/fe] ~ 0.28 dex over the samerange in metallicity. (4) the most metal-rich dsph stars in our sample have[y/fe] abundances which are significantly lower than those measured for halofield stars of similar metallicity, while the measured [ba/eu] ratios for thedsph stars suggest that the early chemical evolution of these galaxies wasdominated by the r-process. taken together, these results suggest that thegalactic halo is unlikely to have assembled, in its entirety, through thedisruption of dwarf galaxies similar to the low-luminosity dsphs studied here.(abridged).

astro-ph;0010187	lensing in the hercules supercluster	we report keck lris observations of an arc-like background galaxy near thecenter of abell 2152 (z=0.043), one of the three clusters comprising thehercules supercluster. the background object has a redshift z=0.1423 and issituated 25 arcsec north of the primary component of the a2152 brightestcluster galaxy (bcg). the object is about 15 arcsec in total length and has areddening-corrected r-band magnitude of $m_r = 18.55\pm0.03$. its spectrumshows numerous strong emission lines, as well as absorption features. thestrength of the h-alpha emission would imply a star formation rate $\sfr\approx 3h^{-2} \msun $yr$^{-1}$ in the absence of any lensing. however, thecurved shaped of this object and its tangential orientation along the majoraxis of the bcg suggest lensing. we model the a2152 core mass distributionincluding the two bcg components and the cluster potential. we present velocityand velocity dispersion profile measurements for the two bcg components and usethese to help constrain the potential. the lens modeling indicates a likelymagnification factor of $\sim1.9$ for the lensed galaxy, making a2152 thenearest cluster in which such significant lensing of a background source hasbeen observed. finally, we see evidence for a concentration of early-typegalaxies at $z=0.13$ near the centroid of the x-ray emission previouslyattributed to a2152. we suggest that emission from this backgroundconcentration is the cause of the offset of the x-ray center from the a2152bcg. the background concentration and the dispersed mass of the herculessupercluster could add further to the lensing strength of the a2152 cluster.

astro-ph;0203410	palomar 13: an unusual stellar system in the galactic halo	we have measured keck/hires radial velocities for 30 candidate red giants inthe direction of palomar 13: an object traditionally cataloged as a compact,low-luminosity globular cluster. from a sample of 21 confirmed members, we finda systemic velocity of 24.1 km/s and a projected, intrinsic velocity dispersionof 2.2 km/s. although small, this dispersion is several times larger than thatexpected for a globular cluster of this luminosity and central concentration.taken at face value, this dispersion implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~ 40 (insolar units) based on the best-fit king-michie model. the surface densityprofile of palomar 13 also appears to be anomalous among galactic globularclusters -- depending upon the details of background subtraction andmodel-fitting, palomar 13 either contains a substantial population of"extra-tidal" stars, or it is far more spatially extended than previouslysuspected. the full surface density profile is equally well-fit by aking-michie model having a high concentration and large tidal radius, or by anfw model. we examine -- and tentatively reject -- a number of possibleexplanations for the observed characteristics of palomar 13 (e.g., velocity"jitter" among the red giants, spectroscopic binary stars, non-standard massfunctions, modified newtonian dynamics), and conclude that the two mostplausible scenarios are either catastrophic heating during a recentperigalacticon passage, or the presence of a massive dark halo. thus, theavailable evidence suggests that palomar 13 is either a globular cluster whichis now in the process of dissolving into the galactic halo, or a faint,dark-matter-dominated stellar system (abridged).

astro-ph;0303229	dynamics of the globular cluster system associated with m49 (ngc4472):  cluster orbital properties and the distribution of dark matter	we have measured radial velocities for 196 globular clusters (gcs) aroundm49, the brightest member of the virgo cluster. combined with published data,they bring the total number of gcs with measured radial velocities in thisgalaxy to 263. using this sample, we extract the projected kinematics of thefull sample of gcs, and of the separate metal-poor and metal-rich subsamples.in agreement with previous results for the global gc kinematics based onsmaller datasets, we find that the gc system as a whole exhibits a slow overallrotation that is due almost entirely to a net rotation of the metal-poor gcsubsystem alone. in a spatial average, the metal-rich gcs shows essentially norotation. we note, however, the presence of a well defined grouping of 10metal-rich gcs that are located at opposite poles along the galaxy's major axisand which appear to be rotating at nearly 300 km/s about the minor axis. thisgrouping may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event. using ajeans-equation analysis, we show that the gc radial velocities alone pointunequivocally (and independently of x-ray observations) to the need for amassive dark halo associated with m49 and the virgo b subcluster around it. wealso show that the gc system as a whole is consistent with an almost perfectlyisotropic velocity ellipsoid. m49 is now the second elliptical galaxy (afterm87) for which we have been able to demonstrate velocity isotropy in theglobular cluster system overall, when no division based on gc color ormetallicity is attempted. thus, the data for these two galaxies lend supportthe general assumption of isotropy when using gc kinematics to study thedark-matter distribution in early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0310006	hubble space telescope observations of novae in m49	a search for novae in m49 (ngc 4472) has been undertaken with the hubblespace telescope. a 55-day observing campaign in f555w (19 epochs) and f814w(five epochs) has led to the discovery of nine novae. we find that m49 may beunder-abundant in slow, faint novae relative to the milky way and m31. instead,the decline rates of the m49 novae are remarkably similar to those of novae inthe lmc. this fact argues against a simple classification of novae in "bulge"and "disk" sub-classes. we examine the maximum-magnitude versus rate of decline(mmrd) relation for novae in m49, finding only marginal agreement with thegalactic and m31 mmrd relations. a recalibration of the buscombe-de vaucouleursrelation gives an absolute magnitude 15 days past maximum of m_{v,15} =-6.36+/-0.19, which is substantially brighter than previous calibrations basedon galactic novae. monte carlo simulations yield a global nova rate for m49 of100{+35}{-30} per year, and a luminosity-specific nova rate in the range \nu_k= 1.7-2.5 per year per 10^{-10} l_k,solar. these rates are far lower than thosepredicted by current models of nova production in elliptical galaxies and maypoint to a relative scarity of novae progenitors, or an increased recurrencetimescale, in early-type environments.

astro-ph;0501325	the acs virgo cluster survey iv: data reduction procedures for surface  brightness fluctuation measurements with the advanced camera for surveys	the advanced camera for surveys (acs) virgo cluster survey is a large programto image 100 early-type virgo galaxies using the f475w and f850lp bandpasses ofthe wide field channel of the acs instrument on the hubble space telescope(hst). the scientific goals of this survey include an exploration of thethree-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster and a critical examination ofthe usefulness of the globular cluster luminosity function as a distanceindicator. both of these issues require accurate distances for the full sampleof 100 program galaxies. in this paper, we describe our data reductionprocedures and examine the feasibility of accurate distance measurements usingthe method of surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) applied to the acs virgocluster survey f850lp imaging. the acs exhibits significant geometricaldistortions due to its off-axis location in the hst focal plane; correcting forthese distortions by resampling the pixel values onto an undistorted frameresults in pixel correlations that depend on the nature of the interpolationkernel used for the resampling. this poses a major challenge for the sbftechnique, which normally assumes a flat power spectrum for the noise. weinvestigate a number of different interpolation kernels and show through ananalysis of simulated galaxy images having realistic noise properties that itis possible, depending on the kernel, to measure sbf distances usingdistortion-corrected acs images without introducing significant additionalerror from the resampling. we conclude by showing examples of real image powerspectra from our survey.

astro-ph;0506314	the acs virgo cluster survey v: sbf calibration for giant and dwarf  early-type galaxies	as part of the advanced camera for survey (acs) virgo cluster survey, we havemeasured surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 100 early-typevirgo galaxies. distances derived from these measurements are needed to explorethe three-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster, study the intrinsicparameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, andcompare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosityfunctions. our sbf measurements have been performed in the f850lp bandpass ofthe wide field channel of the acs on the hubble space telescope. these are thefirst measurements of this kind, and we present the first sbf calibration forthis bandpass. the measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar populationvariations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 andz_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the f475w and f850lp acsfilters. we derive the following calibration for the absolute sbf magnitudem_850: m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in therange 1.3 &lt;(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.6, and m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 &lt;=(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.3. physically,the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giantellipticals and s0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. forthe first time in sbf studies, we are able to provide a firm empiricalcalibration of sbf in early-type dwarf galaxies. our results agree with stellarpopulation model predictions from bruzual &amp; charlot (2003).

astro-ph;0509654	the acs virgo cluster survey ix: the color distributions of globular  cluster systems in early-type galaxies	we present the color distributions of globular cluster (gc) systems for 100virgo cluster early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. thecolor distributions of individual gc systems are consistent with continuoustrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. on average, almostall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor gcs, with the average fractionof metal-rich gcs ranging from 15 to 60%. the colors of both subpopulationscorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red gcs having asteeper slope. to convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary(g-z)-[fe/h] relation calibrated to galactic, m49 and m87 gcs. this relation isnonlinear with a steeper slope for [fe/h] &lt; -0.8. as a result, themetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich gcs vary similarly with respectto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [fe/h]_mp ~ l^0.16 ~m_star^0.17 and [fe/h]_mr ~ l^0.26 ~ m_star^0.22, respectively. although theserelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by windmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to themass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. theoffset between the two gc populations varies slowly (~ m_star^0.05) and isapproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting anearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the twopopulations of gcs. we also find that although the metal-rich gcs show a largerdispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor gcs* that have an equal or largerdispersion in metallicity. like the color-magnitude relation, these relationsderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formationand evolution of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0511251	the acs virgo cluster survey xi. the nature of diffuse star clusters in  early-type galaxies	we use hst/acs imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (dscs). compared toglobular clusters (gcs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities(m_v &gt; -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 &lt; r_h &lt; 30 pc), but they areprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can bemore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical gc (mu_g &gt; 20 mag arcsec^-2).the median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 &lt; g-z &lt; 1.6,which is redder than metal-rich gcs and often as red as the galaxy itself. mostdsc systems thus have mean ages older than 5 gyr or else have super-solarmetallicities. we find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significantexcess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (s0s), andfive visibly contain dust. we also find a substantial population of dscs in thehalo of the giant elliptical m49, associated with the companion galaxy vcc1199. most dsc systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light andassociated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do nothost substantial dsc populations. diffuse star clusters in our sample sharesimilar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that dscs preferentially form, survive, andcoevolve with galactic disks. their properties are broadly consistent withthose of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5magnitudes brighter than dscs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surfacebrightnesses. the closest galactic analogs to the dscs are the old openclusters. we suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in thedisk of the milky way, it would be very difficult to find.

astro-ph;0602297	the acs virgo cluster survey. vi. isophotal analysis and the structure  of early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a detailed analysis of the morphology, isophotalparameters and surface brightness profiles for 100 early-type members of thevirgo cluster, from dwarfs (m_b = -15.1 mag) to giants (m_b = -21.8 mag). eachgalaxy has been imaged in two filters, closely resembling the sloan g and zpassbands, using the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble spacetelescope.  dust and complex morphological structures are common, with kiloparsec-scalestellar disks, bars, and nuclear stellar disks seen in 60% of galaxies withintermediate luminosity (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -17), and dust seen in 42% of galaxiesbrighter than m_b = -18.9 mag. dust morphologies range from faint wisps andpatches on tens of parsec scales, to regular, highly organized kpc-scale dustdisks, often showing evidence of recent star formation.  surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters are derived typicallywithin 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for thefaintest systems, with a resolution (fwhm) of 7 pc. based on a parametrizationof the surface brightness profiles in terms of a sersic or core-sersic model,we find that 1) there is no evidence of a bimodal behavior of the slope, gamma,of the profile in the innermost regions; 2) although the brightest galaxieshave shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles (lowest gamma values) arefound in faint dwarf systems; 3) the widely adopted separation of early-typegalaxies between "core" and "power-law" types, which had originally beenprompted by the claim of a clear bimodal distribution of gamma values, isuntenable; and 4) there is no evidence of a structural dichothomy between dwarfand regular ellipticals.

astro-ph;0603252	the acs virgo cluster survey. viii. the nuclei of early-type galaxies	(abridged) the acs virgo cluster survey is an hst program to obtainhigh-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the virgocluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. based on this large,homogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency ofnucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -15 (66 &lt; f_n &lt; 82%), andfind no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center ofvirgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. resolved stellar nuclei are notpresent in galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -20.5, however, there is no clearevidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence ofnucleation, for a change at m_b ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point betweendwarf and giant galaxies. on average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than atypical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. nuclearluminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than m_b ~-17.6, nuclear colors. comparing the nuclei to the "nuclear clusters" found inlate-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosityand overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is ratherinsensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. the meannuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the meansbh-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detectedsupermassive black holes (sbhs). we argue that compact stellar nuclei might bethe low-mass counterparts of the sbhs detected in the bright galaxies, and thatone should think in terms of "central massive objects" -- either sbhs orcompact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-typegalaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.

astro-ph;0603840	a fundamental relation between compact stellar nuclei, supermassive  black holes, and their host galaxies	imaging surveys with the hubble space telescope (hst) have shown that roughly50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellarnucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. wecombine hst imaging for early-type galaxies from the acs virgo cluster surveywith ground-based long-slit spectra from kpno to show that the masses ofcompact stellar nuclei in virgo cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation withthe masses of the host galaxies. the same correlation is obeyed by thesupermassive black holes (sbhs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. thecompact stellar nuclei in the local group galaxies m33 and ngc205 are alsofound to fall along this same scaling relation. these results indicate that ageneric by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a central massiveobject (cmo) -- either a sbh or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains amean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. in galaxies with massesgreater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, sbhs appear to be the dominantmode of cmo formation.

astro-ph;0609079	the acs virgo cluster survey. xiv. analysis of color-magnitude relations  in globular cluster systems	we examine the correlation between globular cluster (gc) color and magnitudeusing hst/acs imaging for a sample of 79 early-type galaxies (-21.7&lt;m_b&lt;-15.2mag) with accurate sbf distances from the acs virgo cluster survey. using thekmm mixture modeling algorithm, we find a highly significant correlation,d(g-z)/dz = -0.037 +- 0.004, between color and magnitude for the subpopulationof blue gcs in the co-added gc color-magnitude diagram of the three brightestvirgo galaxies (m49, m87 and m60): brighter gcs are redder than their faintercounterparts. for the single gc systems of m87 and m60, we find similarcorrelations; m49 does not appear to show a significant trend. there is nocorrelation between (g-z) and m_z for gcs of the red subpopulation. thecorrelation d(g-z)/dg for the blue subpopulation is much weaker than d(g-z)/dz.using monte carlo simulations, we attribute this to the fact that the bluesubpopulation in m_g extends to higher luminosities than the red subpopulation,which biases the kmm fits. the correlation between color and m_z thus is a realeffect. this conclusion is supported by biweight fits to the same colordistributions. we identify two environmental dependencies of thecolor-magnitude relation: (1) the slope decreases in significance withdecreasing galaxy luminosity; and (2) the slope is stronger for gcs at smallergalactocentric distances. we examine several mechanisms that might give rise tothe observed color-magnitude relation: (1) presence of contaminators; (2)accretion of gcs from low-mass galaxies; (3) stochastic effects; (4) capture offield stars by individual gcs; and (5) gc self-enrichment. we conclude thatself-enrichment and field-star capture, or a combination of these processes,offer the most promising means of explaining our observations.

astro-ph;0609371	trends in the globular cluster luminosity function of early-type  galaxies	we present results from a study of the globular cluster luminosity function(gclf) in a sample of 89 early-type galaxies observed as part of the acs virgocluster survey. using a gaussian parametrization of the gclf, we find a highlysignificant correlation between the gclf dispersion, sigma, and the galaxyluminosity, m_b, in the sense that the gc systems in fainter galaxies havenarrower luminosity functions. the gclf dispersions in the milky way and m31are fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation betweensigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions thatgclf shape is a function of galaxy hubble type. we show that the sigma - m_brelation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)cluster masses in fainter galaxies. we further show that this behavior ismirrored by a steepening of the gc mass function for relatively high masses, m&gt;~ 3 x 10^5 m_sun, a mass regime in which the shape of the gclf is not stronglyaffected by dynamical evolution over a hubble time. we argue that this trendarises from variations in initial conditions and requires explanation bytheories of cluster formation. finally, we confirm that in bright galaxies, thegclf "turns over" at the canonical mass scale of m_to ~ 2 x 10^5 m_sun.however, we find that m_to scatters to lower values (~1-2 x 10^5 m_sun) ingalaxies fainter than m_b &gt;~ -18.5, an important consideration if the gclf isto be used as a distance indicator for dwarf ellipticals.

astro-ph;0612139	the inner workings of early-type galaxies: cores, nuclei and  supermassive black holes (including a critical comparison of nuker and  core-sersic/sersic models)	recent years have seen dramatic progress in the study of the core and nuclearproperties of galaxies. the structure of the cores has been shown to varymethodically with global and nuclear properties, as cores respond to themechanisms by which galaxies form/evolve. the dynamical centers of galaxieshave been found capable of hosting two seemingly disparate objects:supermassive black holes (sbhs) and compact stellar nuclei. in a drasticdeparture from previous beliefs, it has been discovered that both structuresare common: galaxies lacking sbhs and/or stellar nuclei are the exception,rather than the norm. this review explores the connection between cores, sbhsand stellar nuclei in early-type galaxies, as revealed by the acs virgo clustersurvey. we find that, from parsec to kiloparsec scales, the surface brightnessprofiles of early-type galaxies are well described by a sersic model -- aparametrization that is shown to be preferable to the so called `nuker' model.relative to the inward extrapolation of the best fitting sersic model, theprofiles within the inner few tens of parsecs transition from luminosity`deficits', in the brightest (m_b &lt; ~-20) galaxies, to luminosity `excesses' inthe faintest. the compact stellar nuclei responsible for such luminosityexcesses comprise approximatively 0.2% of the total galactic mass. remarkably,this is the same fraction believed to reside in the sbhs, which arepredominantly found in the brightest galaxies showing luminosity deficits.

astro-ph;0702496	the acs virgo cluster survey. xii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in early type galaxies	we analyze the luminosity function of the globular clusters (gcs) belongingto the early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. we haveobtained estimates for a gaussian representation of the gc luminosity function(gclf) for 89 galaxies. we have also fit the gclfs with an "evolved schechterfunction", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-massgcs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initialschechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. we find asignificant trend of the gclf dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sensethat smaller galaxies have narrower gclfs. we show that this narrowing of thegclf in a gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the gc massfunction above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. weargue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the gc mass function is mostlikely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster massfunction. the gclf turnover mass m_to is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5m_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with m_b &gt;~ -18.we show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamicalfriction timescales in smaller galaxies. we probe the variation of the gclf toprojected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the virgo giants m49 and m87,finding that m_to is essentially constant over these spatial scales. our fitsof evolved schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (delta) overa hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10^5 &lt;~ (delta/m_sun) &lt; 10^6 per gc.we agree with previous suggestions that if the full gclf is to be understood inmore detail gclf models will have to include self-consistent treatments ofdynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials.

astro-ph;9506042	dynamics of the galactic globular cluster ngc 3201	b,v ccd frames have been used to derive surface brightness profiles for ngc3201 out to ~18 arcmin. a total of 857 radial velocities with median precision~1 km/s for 399 member giants have been used to trace the velocity dispersionprofile out to 32' (the approximate tidal radius from fits of single-mass,isotropic king-michie models to the cluster surface brightness profiles). themedian difference in radial velocity for stars on either side of an imaginaryaxis moved through the cluster in 1 degree steps shows a significant maximumamplitude of 1.22+/-0.25 km/s. we discuss possible explanations of this result,including: (1) cluster rotation; (2) preferential stripping of stars onprograde orbits near the limiting radius; (3) the projection of the clusterspace velocity onto the plane of the sky and (4) a slight drift in the velocityzero point. it is difficult to identify the primary cause of the observedvelocity field structure unambiguously, and we suspect that all of the aboveprocesses may play a role. the b,v surface brightness profiles and radialvelocities have been modeled with single- &amp; multi-mass king-michie models andnonparametric techniques. the density and m/l profiles show good agreement over1.5&lt;r&lt;10 pc, and both approaches suggest a steady rise in m/l with distancefrom the cluster center. due to the low cluster luminosity, we are unable toplace useful constraints on the anisotropy of the velocity dispersion profile,though the global mass-to-light ratio is well-constrained by the models as ~2.0+/-0.2 for the multi-mass and nonparametric models, compared to ~ 1.65 +/-0.15for models having equal-mass stars. our best-fit, multi-mass models have massfunction slopes of x~0.75 +/-0.25, consistent with findings that mass functiondepends on the position relative to the potential of the galaxy.

astro-ph;9701010	discovery of a probable ch star in the globular cluster m14 and  implications for the evolution of binaries in clusters	we report the discovery of a probable ch star in the core of the galacticglobular cluster m14, identified from an integrated-light spectrum of thecluster obtained with the mos spectrograph on the cfht. from a high- resolutionechelle spectrum of the same star obtained with the hydra fiber positioner andbench spectrograph on the wiyn telescope, we measure a radial velocity of$-53.0\pm1.2$ km s$^{-1}$. although this velocity is inconsistent withpublished estimates of the systemic radial velocity of m14 (eg, ${\bar {v_r}}\approx -123$ km s$^{-1}$), we use high-precision hydra velocities for 20 starsin the central 2.6 arcminutes of m14 to calculate improved values for thecluster mean velocity and one-dimensional velocity dispersion: $-59.5\pm1.9$ kms$^{-1}$ and $8.2\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. both the star's locationnear the tip of the red giant branch in the cluster color magnitude diagram andits radial velocity therefore argue for membership in m14. since theintermediate-resolution mos spectrum shows not only enhanced ch absorption butalso strong swan bands of c$_2$, m14 joins omega cen as the only globularclusters known to contain classical ch stars. although evidence for itsduplicity must await additional radial velocity measurements, the ch star inm14 is probably, like all field ch stars, a spectroscopic binary with adegenerate (white dwarf) secondary. the candidate and confirmed ch stars in m14and omega cen, and in a number of galactic dsph galaxies, may then owe theirexistence to the long timescales for the shrinking and coalescence of hardbinaries in low-concentration environments.

astro-ph;9804319	the formation of giant elliptical galaxies and their globular cluster  systems	the bimodal globular cluster (gc) metallicity distributions of many giantelliptical galaxies are often cited as evidence for the formation of suchgalaxies through mergers involving gas-rich spirals. in such models, the metal-rich gcs are assumed to have formed during the merger process. we explore analternative possibility: that these metal-rich clusters represent the galaxy'sintrinsic gc population and that the metal-poor component of the observed gcmetallicity distribution arises from the capture of gcs from other galaxies,either through mergers or through tidal stripping. starting with plausibleassumptions for the initial galaxy luminosity function and for the dependenceof gc metallicity on parent galaxy luminosity, we show that the growth of apre-existing seed galaxy through mergers and tidal stripping is accompanied bythe capture of metal-poor gcs whose properties are similar to those which areobserved to surround giant ellipticals. we describe a method of using theobserved number of metal-poor and metal-rich gcs to infer the merger historiesof individual elliptical galaxies, and use this technique to derive limits onthe number of galaxies and total luminosity accreted to date by m49. we arguethat although gc specific frequency is conserved in galaxy mergers, the samemay not be true of tidal stripping by the mean field of the host galaxycluster. comparisons of model gc metallicity distributions and specificfrequencies to those observed for the well-studied galaxies m49 and m87 showthat it is possible to explain their bimodal gc metallicity distributions anddiscordant specific frequencies without resorting to the formation of new gcsin mergers or by invoking multiple bursts of gc formation.

astro-ph;9906465	kinematics of the galactic globular cluster system: new radial  velocities for clusters in the direction of the inner galaxy	hires on the keck i telescope has been used to measure the first radialvelocities for stars belonging to eleven, heavily-reddened globular clusters inthe direction of the inner galaxy. the question of kinematic substructuringamong the galactic globular cluster system is investigated using an updatedcatalog of globular cluster distances, metallicities and velocities. it isfound that the population of metal-rich globular clusters shows significantrotation at all galactocentric radii. for the metal-rich clusters within 4 kpcof the galactic center, the measured rotation velocity and line-of-sightvelocity dispersion are similar to those of bulge field stars. we investigateclaims that the metal-rich clusters are associated with the central galacticbar by comparing the kinematics of the innermost clusters to that of the atomichydrogen in the inner galaxy. the longitude-velocity diagram of both metal-richand metal-poor clusters bears a remarkable similarity to that of the gas,including the same non-circular motions which have traditionally beeninterpreted as evidence for a galactic bar, or, alternatively, anon-axisymmetric bulge. however, uncertainties in the existingthree-dimensional galactocentric positions for most of the clusters do not yetallow an unambiguous discrimination between the competing scenarios ofmembership in a rigidly rotating bar, or in a bulge which is an oblateisotropic rotator. we conclude that the majority of metal-rich clusters withinthe central 4 kpc of the galaxy are probably associated with the bulge/bar, andnot the thick disk.

astro-ph;9907104	abundances of red giants in the andromeda ii dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we have obtained spectra for 50 candidate red giants in andromeda ii (a dwarfspheroidal companion of m31) using lris on the keck ii telescope. aftereliminating background galaxies and galactic foreground stars, we are left witha sample of 42 red giants for which membership in andromeda ii can beestablished unambiguously from radial velocities. line indices measured on thelick/ids system are combined with v and i photometry obtained with the keck iiand palomar 5m telescopes to investigate the age and metallicity distributionof these stars. based on a comparison of the measured line indices to those oflick/ids standard stars in globular and open clusters, we derive a meanmetallicity of [fe/h] = -1.47+/-0.19 dex. this confirms earlier conclusionsbased on thuan-gunn gr photometry that andromeda ii obeys the familiar relationbetween mean stellar metallicity and galaxy luminosity. there is also evidencefor a dispersion in metallicity of 0.35+/-0.10 dex based on the scatter in themeasured mgb line indices and the observed width of the galaxy's giant branch.although existing observations of local group dwarf galaxies indicate thattheir mean stellar metallicity depends rather sensitively on host galaxyabsolute magnitude, the internal spread in metallicity appears to be relativelyindependent of luminosity. finally, a small number of stars are found above thepopulation ii red giant branch, indicating the presence of a modestintermediate-age population in this galaxy.

astro-ph;9911527	evidence for the hierarchical formation of the galactic spheroid	the possibility that the galactic spheroid was assembled from numerouschemically-distinct, proto-galactic fragments is investigated using amonte-carlo technique designed to simulate the chemical evolution of the galaxyin hierarchical formation scenarios which involve no gas dissipation. bycomparing the observed and simulated metallicity distributions of galacticglobular clusters and halo field stars, we estimate the level of fragmentationin the collapsing proto-galaxy. although the formation process is highlystochastic, the simulations often show good agreement with the observedmetallicity distributions, provided the luminosity function of proto-galacticfragments had a power-law form with exponent ~ -2. while this steep slope isstrongly at odds with the presently observed luminosity function of the localgroup, it is in close agreement with the predictions of semi-analytic andnumerical models of hierarchical galaxy formation. we discuss a number ofpossible explanations for this discrepancy. these simulations suggest that thegalactic halo and its globular cluster system were assembled via the accretionand disruption of approximately 1000 metal-poor, proto-galactic fragments bythe dominant galactic building block: a proto-bulge whose own metal-richglobular clusters system has been preferentially eroded by dynamical processes.we argue that the same process (ie, hierarchical growth involving little gasdissipation) is responsible for the formation of both giant elliptical galaxiesand the bulge-halo components of spiral galaxies.
