0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0906.1446	observation of grbs with agile	since its early phases of operation, the agile satellite is observing gammaray bursts (grbs) over an energy range potentially spanning six orders ofmagnitude. in the hard x-ray band the superagile imager provides localizationof about one grb/month plus the detection of 1-2 grbs per month out of itsfield of view. the mini-calorimeter detects about one grb/week in the 350kev -100mev energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.in fact, the on-board mcal trigger logic, implemented for the first time ontime windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for veryshort bursts detection. the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid), sensitive in the30mev - 30gev range, firmly detected three grbs (grb080514b, grb090401b andgrb090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. moreover,all grbs localized by other spacecrafts inside the grid field of view arecurrently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided. inthis paper we review the status of the observation of grbs with agile, withparticular emphasis on high energy and short time scales detections.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

1001.5150	direct evidence for hadronic cosmic-ray acceleration in the supernova  renmant ic 443	the supernova remnant (snr) ic 443 is an intermediate-age remnant well knownfor its radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray energy emissions. in this letter westudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from ic 443 as obtained by the agilesatellite. a distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 mev-3gev is detected across the snr with its prominent maximum (source "a")localized in the northeastern shell with a flux f = (47 \pm 10) 10^{-8} photonscm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 mev. this location is the site of the strongest shockinteraction between the snr blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.source "a" is not coincident with the tev source located 0.4 degree away andassociated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the snr central region. fromour observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse tev emission from itsnortheastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters ofgamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 gev at the site of the strongest snr shock. theintensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominentgamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable tevemission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray accelerationin the snr. a high-density molecular cloud (cloud "e") provides a remarkable"target" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results showenhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shellinteraction site. ic 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-rayacceleration by snrs.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1106.5162	the brightest gamma-ray flaring blazar in the sky: agile and  multi-wavelength observations of 3c 454.3 during november 2010	since 2005, the blazar 3c 454.3 has shown remarkable flaring activity at allfrequencies, and during the last four years it has exhibited more than onegamma-ray flare per year, becoming the most active gamma-ray blazar in the sky.we present for the first time the multi-wavelength agile, swift, integral, andgasp-webt data collected in order to explain the extraordinary gamma-ray flareof 3c 454.3 which occurred in november 2010. on 2010 november 20 (mjd 55520),3c 454.3 reached a peak flux (e&gt;100 mev) of f_gamma(p) = (6.8+-1.0)e-5 ph/cm2/son a time scale of about 12 hours, more than a factor of 6 higher than the fluxof the brightest steady gamma-ray source, the vela pulsar, and more than afactor of 3 brighter than its previous super-flare on 2009 december 2-3. themulti-wavelength data make a thorough study of the present event possible: thecomparison with the previous outbursts indicates a close similarity to the onethat occurred in 2009. by comparing the broadband emission before, during, andafter the gamma-ray flare, we find that the radio, optical and x-ray emissionvaries within a factor 2-3, whereas the gamma-ray flux by a factor of 10. thisremarkable behavior is modeled by an external compton component driven by asubstantial local enhancement of soft seed photons.

1111.4868	neutral pion emission from accelerated protons in the supernova remnant  w44	we present the agile gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50 mev - 10gev of the supernova remnant (snr) w44, one of the most interesting systems forstudying cosmic-ray production. w44 is an intermediate-age snr (20, 000 years)and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell,nearby molecular clouds, and bright [sii] emitting regions. we extend ourgamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurementswhich could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. we findthat gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape ofthe inner snr shocked plasma. furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows aprominent peak near 1 gev with a clear decrement at energies below a fewhundreds of mev as expected from neutral pion decay. here we demonstrate that:(1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all w44 multiwavelengthconstraints derived from radio, optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2)ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously thewell-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellardensity much larger than the value derived from observations; (3) the hadronenergy spectrum is well described by a power-law (with index s = 3.0 \pm 0.1)and a low-energy cut-off at ec = 6 \pm 1 gev. direct evidence for pion emissionis then established in an snr for the first time.

0807.0518	imaging x-ray sources at a finite distance in coded mask instruments	we present a method we developed for the correction of the beam divergence infinite distance sources imaging through coded mask instruments. we discuss thedefocusing artifacts induced by the finite distance showing two differentapproaches to remove such spurious effects. we applied our method toone-dimensional coded-mask systems, although it is also applicable to 2dsystems as well. we provide a detailed mathematical description of the adoptedmethod and of the systematics introduced in the reconstructed image (e. g. thefraction of source flux collected in the reconstructed peak counts). theaccuracy of this method was tested by simulating point-like and extendedsources at finite distance with the instrumental set-up of the superagileexperiment, the one dimensional coded-mask x-ray imager on-board the agilemission. we obtained reconstructed images of good quality and high sourcelocation accuracy. finally, we show the results obtained by applying thismethod to real data collected during the calibration campaign of superagile.our method was demonstrated to be a powerful tool to investigate the imagingresponse of the experiment, particularly, the absorption due to the materialsintercepting the line of sight of the instrument and the conversion betweendetector pixel and sky direction.

astro-ph;0207440	x-ray astronomical polarimetry in the xeus era	x-ray polarimetry is almost as old as x-ray astronomy. since the firstdiscovery of x-ray sources theoretical analysis suggested that a high degree oflinear polarization could be expected due either to the, extremely non thermal,emission mechanism or to the transfer of radiation in highly asymmetricsystems. the actual implementation of this subtopic was, conversely, relativelydeceiving. this is mainly due to the limitation of the conventional techniquesbased on the bragg diffraction at 45deg, or on thomson scattering around 90deg.acually no x-ray polarimeter has been launched since 25 years. nevertheless theexpectations from such measurement on several astrophysical targets includinghigh and low mass x-ray binaries, isolated neutron stars, galactic andextragalactic black holes is extremely attractive. we developed a new techniqueto measure the linear polarization of x-ray sources. it is based on thevisualization of photoelectron tracks in a, finely subdivided, gas filleddetector (micropattern). the initial direction of the photoelectron is derivedand from the angular distribution of the tracks the amount and angle ofpolarization is computed. this technique can find an optimal exploitation inthe focus of xeus-1. even in a very conservative configuration (basically thealready existing prototype) the photoelectric polarimeter could performpolarimetry at % level on many agns. further significant improvements can beexpected from a technological development on the detector and with the use ofxeus-2 telescope.

0808.3464	long-term agile monitoring of the puzzling gamma-ray source 3eg  j1835+5918	we present the agile gamma-ray observations of the field containing thepuzzling gamma-ray source 3eg j1835+5918. this source is one of the mostremarkable unidentified egret sources. an unprecedentedly long agile monitoringof this source yields important information on the positional error box, fluxevolution, and spectrum. 3eg j1835+5918 has been in the agile field of viewseveral times in 2007 and 2008 for a total observing time of 138 days from 2007sept 04 to 2008 june 30 encompassing several weeks of continuous coverage. withan exposure time approximately twice that of egret, agile confirms theexistence of a prominent gamma-ray source (agl j1836+5926) at a positionconsistent with that of egret, although with a remarkably lower average fluxvalue for photon energies greater than 100 mev. a 5-day bin temporal analysisof the whole data set of agl j1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability ofthe gamma-ray flux. the source spectrum between 100 mev and 1 gev can be fittedwith a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent withthe egret value. the faint x-ray source rx j1836.2+5925 that has been proposedas a possible counterpart of 3eg j1835+5918 is well within the agile error box.future continuous monitoring (both by agile and glast) is needed to confirm thegamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that iscurrently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts.

0809.1230	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from grb 080514b	grb 080514b is the first gamma ray burst (grb), since the time of egret, forwhich individual photons of energy above several tens of mev have been detectedwith a pair-conversion tracker telescope. this burst was discovered with theitalian agile gamma-ray satellite. the grb was localized with a cooperation byagile and the interplanetary network (ipn). the gamma-ray imager (grid)estimate of the position, obtained before the superagile-ipn localization, isfound to be consistent with the burst position. the hard x-ray emissionobserved by superagile lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that theemission above 30 mev extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). similarbehavior was seen in the past from a few other grbs observed with egret.however, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, byinstrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burstintensity. thanks to the small dead time of the agile/grid we could assess thatin the case of grb 080514b the gamma-ray to x-ray flux ratio changessignificantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

0809.3917	gamma-ray burst detection with the agile mini-calorimeter	the mini-calorimeter (mcal) instrument on-board the agile satellite is anon-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300kev-100mevenergy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400cm^2. gamma-raybursts (grbs) are one of the main scientific targets of the agile mission andthe mcal design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuableall-sky monitor for grbs. furthermore mcal is one of the very few operativeinstruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the mev range. in thispaper the results of grb detections with mcal after one year of operation inspace are presented and discussed. a flexible trigger logic implemented in theagile payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of grbs. fortriggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on aphoton-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by countingstatistics only. when the trigger logic is not active, grbs can be detectedoffline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.between the end of june 2007 and june 2008 mcal detected 51 grbs, with adetection rate of about 1 grb/week, plus several other events at a fewmilliseconds timescales. since february 2008 the on-board trigger logic hasbeen fully active. comparison of mcal detected events and data provided byother space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective areaestimations. mcal also joined the 3rd inter-planetary network, to contribute togrb localization by means of triangulation.

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.
