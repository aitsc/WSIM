0912.3356	dust properties of protoplanetary disks in the taurus-auriga star  forming region from millimeter wavelengths	we present the most sensitive 3 mm-survey to date of protoplanetary diskscarried in the taurus-auriga star forming region (average rms of about 0.3mjy), using the iram pdbi. with our high detection rate of 17/19, we providethe first detections at wavelengths longer than about 1 mm for 12 sources. thisenables us to study statistically the mm sed slopes and dust properties offaint disks and compare them to brighter disks using a uniform analysis method.with these new data and literature measurements at sub-millimeter andmillimeter wavelengths, we analyze the dust properties of a sample of 21isolated disks around t tauri stars in the taurus-auriga star forming region.together with the information about the disks spatial extension from sub/mm-mminterferometric studies, we derive from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energydistribution constraints on the dust opacity law at these wavelengths, usingtwo-layer flared disk models and a self-consistent dust model that takesproperly into account the variation of the dust opacity with grain growth. wefind evidence for the presence in the disk midplane of dust particles that havegrown to sizes as large as at least 1 millimeter in all the disks of oursample, confirming what was previously observed on smaller brighter objects.this indicates that the dust coagulation from ism dust to mm-sized grains is avery fast process in protoplanetary disks, that appears to occur before a youngstellar object enters the class ii evolutionary stage. also, the amount ofthese large grains in the disk outer regions is stationary throughout all theclass ii evolutionary stage, indicating that mechanisms slowing down the dustinward migration are playing an important role in the taurus-aurigaprotoplanetary disks.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

"bullets" moving at &gt;50 km/s are seen in 4 class 0sources; 3 of these are new detections. in the outflow, the h2o/co abundanceratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasingfrom 10^-3 at &lt;5 km/s to &gt;10^-1 at &gt;10 km/s. the h2o abundance in the outerenvelope is low, ~10^-10. the different h2o profile components show a clearevolutionary trend: in the class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflowcomponents originating inside an infalling envelope. when the infall diminishesduring the class i phase, the outflow weakens and h2o emission disappears.

1208.4140	the chess survey of the l1157-b1 shock region: co spectral signatures of  jet-driven bowshocks	the unprecedented sensitivity of herschel coupled with the high resolution ofthe hifi spectrometer permits studies of the intensity-velocity relationshipi(v) in molecular outflows, over a higher excitation range than possible up tonow. in the course of the chess key program, we have observed toward the brightbowshock region l1157-b1 the co rotational transitions between j=5-4 andj=16-15 with hifi, and the j=1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 with the iram-30m and the csotelescopes. we find that all the line profiles i_{co}(v) are well fit by alinear combination of three exponential laws exp(-|v/v_0|) with v_0= 12.5, 4.4and 2.5km/s. the first component dominates the co emission at j_up &gt; 13, aswell as the high-excitation lines of sio and h2o. the second componentdominates for 3 &lt; j_up &lt; 10 and the third one for j_up &lt; 2. we show that theseexponentials are the signature of quasi-isothermal shocked gas components: theimpact of the jet against the l1157-b1 bowshock (t= 210k), the walls of theoutflow cavity associated with b1 (t= 64k) and the older cavity l1157-b2 (t=23k), respectively. analysis of the co line flux in the large-velocity gradientapproximation further shows that the emission arises from dense gas (n(h2) &gt;1e5-1e6 cm-3) close to lte up to j=20. we find that the co j=2-1intensity-velocity relation observed in various other molecular outflows issatisfactorily fit by similar exponential laws, which may hold an importantclue to their entrainment process.

1209.0294	h2o line mapping at high spatial and spectral resolution - herschel  observations of the vla1623 outflow	apart from being an important coolant, h2o is known to be a tracer ofhigh-velocity molecular gas. recent models predict relatively high abundancesbehind interstellar shockwaves. the dynamical and physical conditions of theh2o emitting gas, however, are not fully understood yet. we aim to determinethe abundance and distribution of h2o, its kinematics and the physicalconditions of the gas responsible for the h2o emission. the observed lineprofile shapes help us understand the dynamics in molecular outflows. we mappedthe vla1623 outflow, in the ground-state transitions of o-h2o, with the hifiand pacs instruments. we also present observations of higher energy transitionsof o-h2o and p-h2o obtained with hifi and pacs towards selected outflowpositions. from comparison with non-lte radiative transfer calculations, weestimate the physical parameters of the water emitting regions. the observedwater emission line profiles vary over the mapped area. spectral features andcomponents, tracing gas in different excitation conditions, allow us toconstrain the density and temperature of the gas. the h2o emission originatesin a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm h2 gas(t\gtrsim200k). thus, the h2o emission traces a gas component significantlywarmer than the gas responsible for the low-j co emission. the h2o columndensities at the co peak positions are low, i.e. n(h2o) \simeq (0.03-10)x10e14cm-2. the h2o abundance with respect to h2 in the extended outflow is estimatedat x(h2o)&lt;1x10e-6, significantly lower than what would be expected from mostrecent shock models. the h2o emission traces a gas component moving atrelatively high velocity compared to the low-j co emitting gas. however, otherdynamical quantities such as the momentum rate, energy and mechanicalluminosity are estimated to be the same, independent of the molecular tracerused, co or h2o.

1210.7178	mapping water in protostellar outflows with herschel: pacs and hifi  observations of l1448-c	we investigate on the spatial and velocity distribution of h2o along thel1448 outflow, its relationship with other tracers, and its abundancevariations, using maps of the o-h2o 1_{10}-1_{01} and 2_{12}-1_{01} transitionstaken with the herschel-hifi and pacs instruments, respectively. water emissionappears clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along theoutflow. the bulk of the 557 ghz line is confined to radial velocities in therange \pm 10-50 km/s but extended emission associated with the l1448-c extremehigh velocity (ehv) jet is also detected. the h2o 1_{10}-1_{01}/co(3-2) ratioshows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect differentand changing physical conditions in the gas responsible for the emissions fromthe two species. in the ehv jet, a low h2o/sio abundance ratio is inferred,that could indicate molecular formation from dust free gas directly ejectedfrom the proto-stellar wind. we derive averaged tkin and n(h2) values of about300-500 k and 5 10^6 cm-3 respectively, while a water abundance with respect toh2 of the order of 0.5-1 10^{-6} along the outflow is estimated. the fairlyconstant conditions found all along the outflow implies that evolutionaryeffects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role inthe h2o chemistry. the results of our analysis show that the bulk of theobserved h2o lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after beingheated to high temperatures, has been already cooled down to a few hundred k.the relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism todiminish the h2o gas in the post-shock region. among the possible scenarios, wefavor h2o photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low velocitynon-dissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a fuvfield of sufficient strength.

0712.1330	discovery of a bipolar x-ray jet from the t tauri star dg tau	we have obtained and analyzed chandra acis-s observations of the stronglyaccreting classical t tauri star dg tau. our principal goals are to map theimmediate environment of the star to characterize possible extended x-raysformed in the jet, and to re-visit the anomalous, doubly absorbed x-rayspectrum of dg tau itself. we combine our new acis-s data with a data setpreviously obtained. the data are superimposed to obtain flux and hardnessimages. separate x-ray spectra are extracted for dg tau and areas outside itspoint spread function. we detect a prominent x-ray jet at a position angle ofpa ~225 deg (tentatively suggested by guedel et al. 2005), coincident with theoptical jet axis. we also identify a counter jet at pa = 45 deg. the x-ray jetsare detected out to a distance of ~5" from the star, their sources beingextended at the acis-s resolution. the jet spectra are soft, with a best-fitelectron temperature of 3.4 mk. we find evidence for excess absorption of thecounter jet. the spectrum of the dg tau point source shows two components withlargely different temperatures and absorption column densities. the similartemperatures and small absorbing gas columns of the jet sources and the softcomponent of the "stellar" source suggest that these sources are related,produced either by shocks or by magnetic heating in the jets. cooling estimatessuggest that the pressure in the hot gas contributes to jet expansion. the hard"stellar" component, on the other hand, is associated with a stellar corona ormagnetosphere. the excessive photoelectric absorption of this componentsuggests the presence of dust-depleted accretion streams above coronal magneticfields.

1302.1410	water vapor in the protoplanetary disk of dg tau	water is key in the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation ofcomets and icy/water planets. while high excitation water lines originating inthe hot inner disk have been detected in several t tauri stars (ttss), watervapor from the outer disk, where most of water ice reservoir is stored, wasonly reported in the closeby tts tw hya. we present spectrally resolvedherschel/hifi observations of the young tts dg tau in the ortho- and para-water ground-state transitions at 557, 1113 ghz. the lines show a narrowdouble-peaked profile, consistent with an origin in the outer disk, and are~19-26 times brighter than in tw hya. in contrast, co and [c ii] lines aredominated by emission from the envelope/outflow, which makes h2o lines a uniquetracer of the disk of dg tau. disk modeling with the thermo-chemical codeprodimo indicates that the strong uv field, due to the young age and strongaccretion of dg tau, irradiates a disk upper layer at 10-90 au from the star,heating it up to temperatures of 600 k and producing the observed bright waterlines. the models suggest a disk mass of 0.015-0.1 msun, consistent with theestimated minimum mass of the solar nebula before planet formation, and a waterreservoir of ~1e2-1e3 earth oceans in vapour, and ~100 times larger in the formof ice. hence, this detection supports the scenario of ocean delivery onterrestrial planets by impact of icy bodies forming in the outer disk.

1310.7365	deuterated water in the solar-type protostars ngc 1333 iras 4a and iras  4b	aims. the aim of this paper is to study deuterated water in the solar-typeprotostars ngc1333 iras4a and iras4b, to compare their hdo abundancedistribution with other star-forming regions, and to constrain their hdo/h2oratios. methods. using the herschel/hifi instrument as well as ground-basedtelescopes, we observed several hdo lines covering a large excitation range(eup/k=22-168 k) towards these protostars and an outflow position. non-lteradiative transfer codes were then used to determine the hdo abundance profilesin these sources. results. the hdo fundamental line profiles show a very broadcomponent, tracing the molecular outflows, in addition to a narrower emissioncomponent and a narrow absorbing component. in the protostellar envelope ofngc1333 iras4a, the hdo inner (t&gt;100 k) and outer (t&lt;100 k) abundances withrespect to h2 are estimated at 7.5x10^{-9} and 1.2x10^{-11}, respectively,whereas, in ngc1333 iras4b, they are 1.0x10^{-8} and 1.2x10^{-10},respectively. similarly to the low-mass protostar iras16293-2422, an absorbingouter layer with an enhanced abundance of deuterated water is required toreproduce the absorbing components seen in the fundamental lines at 465 and 894ghz in both sources. this water-rich layer is probably extended enough toencompass the two sources as well as parts of the outflows. in the outflowsemanating from ngc1333 iras4a, the hdo column density is estimated at about(2-4)x10^{13} cm^{-2}, leading to an abundance of about (0.7-1.9)x10^{-9}. anhdo/h2o ratio between 7x10^{-4} and 9x10^{-2} is derived in the outflows. inthe warm inner regions of these two sources, we estimate the hdo/h2o ratios atabout 1x10^{-4}-4x10^{-3}. this ratio seems higher (a few %) in the coldenvelope of iras4a, whose possible origin is discussed in relation to formationprocesses of hdo and h2o.

1311.2840	the chess survey of the l1157-b1 bow-shock: high and low excitation  water vapor	molecular outflows powered by young protostars strongly affect the kinematicsand chemistry of the natal molecular cloud through strong shocks resulting insubstantial modifications of the abundance of several species. as part of the"chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions" guaranteed time keyprogram, we aim at investigating the physical and chemical conditions of h20 inthe brightest shock region b1 of the l1157 molecular outflow. we observedseveral ortho- and para-h2o transitions using hifi and pacs instruments onboard herschel, providing a detailed picture of the kinematics and spatialdistribution of the gas. we performed a lvg analysis to derive the physicalconditions of h2o shocked material, and ultimately obtain its abundance. wedetected 13 h2o lines probing a wide range of excitation conditions. pacs mapsreveal that h2o traces weak and extended emission associated with the outflowidentified also with hifi in the o-h2o line at 556.9 ghz, and a compact (~10")bright, higher-excitation region. the lvg analysis of h2o lines in thebow-shock show the presence of two gas components with different excitationconditions: a warm (tkin~200-300 k) and dense (n(h2)~(1-3)x10^6 cm-3) componentwith an assumed extent of 10" and a compact (~2"-5") and hot, tenuous(tkin~900-1400 k, n(h2)~10^3-10^4 cm-3) gas component, which is needed toaccount for the line fluxes of high eu transitions. the fractional abundance ofthe warm and hot h2o gas components is estimated to be (0.7-2)x10^{-6} and(1-3)x10^{-4}, respectively. finally, we identified an additional component inabsorption in the hifi spectra of h2o lines connecting with the ground statelevel, probably arising from the photodesorption of icy mantles of awater-enriched layer at the edges of the cloud.

1401.3744	relating jet structure to photometric variability: the herbig ae star hd  163296	herbig ae/be stars are intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars surroundedby circumstellar dust disks. some are observed to produce jets, whoseappearance as a sequence of shock fronts (knots) suggests a past episodicoutflow variability. this "jet fossil record" can be used to reconstruct theoutflow history. we present the first optical to near-infrared (nir)vlt/x-shooter spectra of the jet from the herbig ae star hd 163296. wedetermine physical conditions in the knots, as well as their kinematic "launchepochs". knots are formed simultaneously on either side of the disk, with aregular interval of ~16 yr. the velocity dispersion versus jet velocity and theenergy input are comparable in both lobes. however, the mass loss rate,velocity, and shock conditions are asymmetric. we find mjet/macc ~ 0.01-0.1,consistent with magneto-centrifugal jet launching models. no evidence for dustis found in the high-velocity jet, suggesting it is launched within thesublimation radius (&lt;0.5 au). the jet inclination measured from proper motionsand radial velocities confirms it is perpendicular to the disk. a tentativerelation is found between the structure of the jet and the photometricvariability of the source. episodes of nir brightening were previously detectedand attributed to a dusty disk wind. we report for the first time significantoptical fadings lasting from a few days up to a year, coinciding with the nirbrightenings. these are likely caused by dust lifted high above the disk plane;this supports the disk wind scenario. the disk wind is launched at a largerradius than the high-velocity atomic jet, although their outflow variabilitymay have a common origin. no significant relation between outflow and accretionvariability could be established. our findings confirm that this sourceundergoes periodic ejection events, which may be coupled with dust ejectionsabove the disk plane.

1401.6672	first results from the calypso iram-pdbi survey - iii. monopolar jets  driven by a proto-binary system in ngc1333-iras2a	context: the earliest evolutionary stages of low-mass protostars arecharacterised by hot and fast jets which remove angular momentum from thecircumstellar disk, thus allowing mass accretion onto the central object.however, the launch mechanism is still being debated. aims: we would like toexploit high-angular (~ 0.8") resolution and high-sensitivity images toinvestigate the origin of protostellar jets using typical molecular tracers ofshocked regions, such as sio and so. methods: we mapped the inner 22" of thengc1333-iras2a protostar in sio(5-4), so(65-54), and the continuum emission at1.4 mm using the iram plateau de bure interferometer in the framework of thecalypso iram large program. results: for the first time, we disentangle thengc1333-iras2a class 0 object into a proto-binary system revealing twoprotostars (mm1, mm2) separated by ~ 560 au, each of them driving their ownjet, while past work considered a single protostar with a quadrupolar outflow.we reveal (i) a clumpy, fast (up to |v-vlsr| &gt; 50 km/s), and blueshifted jetemerging from the brightest mm1 source, and (ii) a slower redshifted jet,driven by mm2. silicon monoxide emission is a powerful tracer ofhigh-excitation (tkin &gt; 100 k; n(h2) &gt; 10^5 cm-3) jets close to the launchingregion. at the highest velocities, so appears to mimic sio tracing the jets,whereas at velocities close to the systemic one, so is dominated by extendedemission, tracing the cavity opened by the jet. conclusions: both jets areintrinsically monopolar, and intermittent in time. the dynamical time of thesio clumps is &lt; 30-90 yr, indicating that one-sided ejections from protostarscan take place on these timescales.

1401.6998	first results from the calypso iram-pdbi survey. ii. resolving the hot  corino in the class 0 protostar ngc 1333-iras2a	we investigate the origin of complex organic molecules (coms) in the gasphase around the low-mass class~0 protostar ngc1333-iras2a, to determine if thecom emission lines trace an embedded disk, shocks from the protostellar jet, orthe warm inner parts of the protostellar envelope. in the framework of thecalypso (continuum and lines in young protostellar objects) iram plateau debure survey, we obtained large bandwidth spectra at sub-arcsecond resolutiontowards ngc 1333-iras2a. we identify the emission lines towards the centralprotostar and perform gaussian fits to constrain the size of the emittingregion for each of these lines, tracing various physical conditions and scales.the emission of numerous coms such as methanol, ethylene glycol, and methylformate is spatially resolved by our observations. this allows us to measure,for the first time, the size of the com emission inside the protostellarenvelope, finding that it originates from a region of radius 40-100 au,centered on the ngc 1333-iras2a protostellar object. our analysis shows nopreferential elongation of the com emission along the jet axis, and thereforedoes not support the hypothesis that com emission arises from shocked envelopematerial at the base of the jet. down to similar sizes, the dust continuumemission is well reproduced with a single envelope model, and therefore doesnot favor the hypothesis that com emission arises from the thermal sublimationof grains embedded in a circumstellar disk. finally, the typical scale $\sim$60au observed for com emission is consistent with the size of the inner envelopewhere $t_{\rm{dust}} &gt; 100$ k is expected. our data therefore strongly suggestthat the com emission traces the hot corino in iras2a, i.e., the warm innerenvelope material where the icy mantles of dust grains evaporate because theyare passively heated by the central protostellar object.

1402.3553	jets and outflows from star to cloud: observations confront theory	in this review we focus on the role jets and outflows play in the star andplanet formation process. our essential question can be posed as follows: arejets/outflows merely an epiphenomenon associated with star formation or do theyplay an important role in mediating the physics of assembling stars bothindividually and globally? we address this question by reviewing the currentstate of observations and their key points of contact with theory. our reviewof jet/outflow phenomena is organized into three length-scale domains: sourceand disk scales ($0.1-10^2$ au) where the connection with protostellar and diskevolution theories is paramount; envelope scales ($10^2-10^5$ au) where thechemistry and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, itsvariability and its impact on the infalling envelope; parent cloud scales($10^5-10^6$ au) where global momentum injection into cluster/cloudenvironments become relevant. issues of feedback are of particular importanceon the smallest scales where planet formation regions in a disk may be impactedby the presence of disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks or shielding by thewinds. feedback on envelope scales may determine the final stellar mass(core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. feedback also plays animportant role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulentsupport within clusters including alteration of cluster star formationefficiencies (feedback on larger scales currently appears unlikely). aparticularly novel dimension of our review is that we consider results on jetdynamics from the emerging field of high energy density laboratory astrophysics(hedla). hedla is now providing direct insights into the 3-d dynamics of fullymagnetized, hypersonic, radiative outflows.

1409.2779	first spectrally-resolved h$_2$ observations towards hh 54 / low h$_2$o  abundance in shocks	context: herschel observations suggest that the h$_2$o distribution inoutflows from low-mass stars resembles the h$_2$ emission. it is still unclearwhich of the different excitation components that characterise the mid- andnear-ir h$_2$ distribution is associated with h$_2$o. aim: the aim is tospectrally resolve the different excitation components observed in the h$_2$emission. this will allow us to identify the h$_2$ counterpart associated withh$_2$o and finally derive directly an h$_2$o abundance estimate with respect toh$_2$. methods: we present new high spectral resolution observations of h$_2$0-0 s(4), 0-0 s(9), and 1-0 s(1) towards hh 54, a bright nearby shock region inthe southern sky. in addition, new herschel-hifi h$_2$o (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{01}$)observations at 1670~ghz are presented. results: our observations show for thefirst time a clear separation in velocity of the different h$_2$ lines: the 0-0s(4) line at the lowest excitation peaks at $-$7~km~s$^{-1}$, while the moreexcited 0-0 s(9) and 1-0 s(1) lines peak at $-$15~km~s$^{-1}$. h$_2$o andhigh-$j$ co appear to be associated with the h$_2$ 0-0 s(4) emission, whichtraces a gas component with a temperature of 700$-$1000 k. the h$_2$o abundancewith respect to h$_2$ 0-0 s(4) is estimated to be$x$(h$_2$o)$&lt;$1.4$\times$10$^{-5}$ in the shocked gas over an area of13$^{\prime\prime}$. conclusions: we resolve two distinct gas componentsassociated with the hh 54 shock region at different velocities and excitations.this allows us to constrain the temperature of the h$_2$o emitting gas($\leq$1000 k) and to derive correct estimates of h$_2$o abundance in theshocked gas, which is lower than what is expected from shock model predictions.

1409.4658	shockingly low water abundances in herschel / pacs observations of  low-mass protostars in perseus	protostars interact with their surroundings through jets and winds impactingon the envelope and creating shocks, but the nature of these shocks is stillpoorly understood. our aim is to survey far-infrared molecular line emissionfrom a uniform and significant sample of deeply-embedded low-mass young stellarobjects in order to characterize shocks and the possible role of ultravioletradiation in the immediate protostellar environment. herschel/pacs spectralmaps of 22 objects in the perseus molecular cloud were obtained as part of the`william herschel line legacy' survey. line emission from h$_\mathrm{2}$o, co,and oh is tested against shock models from the literature.  observed line ratios are remarkably similar and do not show variations withsource physical parameters. observations show good agreement with the shockmodels when line ratios of the same species are compared. ratios of varioush$_\mathrm{2}$o lines provide a particularly good diagnostic of pre-shock gasdensities, $n_\mathrm{h}\sim10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, in agreement with typicaldensities obtained from observations of the post-shock gas. the correspondingshock velocities, obtained from comparison with co line ratios, are above 20km\,s$^{-1}$. however, the observations consistently show one-to-two orders ofmagnitude lower h$_\mathrm{2}$o-to-co and h$_\mathrm{2}$o-to-oh line ratiosthan predicted by the existing shock models.  the overestimated model h$_\mathrm{2}$o fluxes are most likely caused by anoverabundance of h$_\mathrm{2}$o in the models since the excitation iswell-reproduced. illumination of the shocked material by ultraviolet photonsproduced either in the star-disk system or, more locally, in the shock, woulddecrease the h$_\mathrm{2}$o abundances and reconcile the models withobservations. detections of hot h$_\mathrm{2}$o and strong oh lines supportthis scenario.

1409.8111	resolving the shocked gas in hh54 with herschel: co line mapping at high  spatial and spectral resolution	the hh54 shock is a herbig-haro object, located in the nearby chamaeleon iicloud. observed co line profiles are due to a complex distribution in density,temperature, velocity, and geometry. resolving the hh54 shock wave in thefar-infrared cooling lines of co constrain the kinematics, morphology, andphysical conditions of the shocked region. we used the pacs and spireinstruments on board the herschel space observatory to map the full firspectrum in a region covering the hh54 shock wave. complementary herschel-hifi,apex, and spitzer data are used in the analysis as well. the observed featuresin the line profiles are reproduced using a 3d radiative transfer model of abow-shock, constructed with the line modeling engine code (lime). the firemission is confined to the hh54 region and a coherent displacement of thelocation of the emission maximum of co with increasing j is observed. the peakpositions of the high-j co lines are shifted upstream from the lower j co linesand coincide with the position of the spectral feature identified previously inco(10-9) profiles with hifi. this indicates a hotter molecular component in theupstream gas with distinct dynamics. the coherent displacement with increasingj for co is consistent with a scenario where iras12500-7658 is the excitingsource of the flow, and the 180 k bow-shock is accompanied by a hot (800 k)molecular component located upstream from the apex of the shock and blueshiftedby -7 km s$^{-1}$. the spatial proximity of this knot to the peaks of theatomic fine-structure emission lines observed with spitzer and pacs ([oi]63,145 $\mu$m) suggests that it may be associated with the dissociative shock asthe jet impacts slower moving gas in the hh54 bow-shock.

1501.03681	[oi]63micron jets in class 0 sources detected by herschel	we present herschel pacs mapping observations of the [oi]63 micron linetowards protostellar outflows in the l1448, ngc1333-iras4, hh46, bhr71 andvla1623 star forming regions. we detect emission spatially resolved along theoutflow direction, which can be associated with a low excitation atomic jet. inthe l1448-c, hh46 irs and bhr71 irs1 outflows this emission is kinematicallyresolved into blue- and red-shifted jet lobes, having radial velocities up to200 km/s. in the l1448-c atomic jet the velocity increases with the distancefrom the protostar, similarly to what observed in the sio jet associated withthis source. this suggests that [oi] and molecular gas are kinematicallyconnected and that this latter could represent the colder cocoon of a jet athigher excitation. mass flux rates (\.m$_{jet}$(oi)) have been measured fromthe [oi]63micron luminosity adopting two independent methods. we find values inthe range 1-4 10$^{-7}$ mo/yr for all sources but hh46, for which an order ofmagnitude higher value is estimated. \.m$_{jet}$(oi) are compared with massaccretion rates (\.m$_{acc}$) onto the protostar and with \.m$_{jet}$ derivedfrom ground-based co observations. \.m$_{jet}$(oi)/\.m$_{acc}$ ratios are inthe range 0.05-0.5, similar to the values for more evolved sources.\.m$_{jet}$(oi) in hh46 irs and iras4a are comparable to \.m$_{jet}$(co), whilethose of the remaining sources are significantly lower than the corresponding\.m$_{jet}$(co). we speculate that for these three sources most of the massflux is carried out by a molecular jet, while the warm atomic gas does notsignificantly contribute to the dynamics of the system.

1511.01428	jet multiplicity in the proto-binary system ngc1333-iras4a. the detailed  calypso iram-pdbi view	owing to the paucity of sub-arcsecond (sub)mm observations required to probethe innermost regions of newly forming protostars, several fundamentalquestions are still being debated, such as the existence and coevality of closemultiple systems. we study the physical and chemical properties of the jets andprotostellar sources in the ngc1333-iras4a proto-binary system using continuumemission and molecular tracers of shocked gas. we observed ngc1333-iras4a inthe sio(6-5), so(6_5-5_4), and co(2-1) lines and the continuum emission at 1.3,1.4, and 3 mm using the iram plateau de bure interferometer in the framework ofthe calypso large program. we clearly disentangle for the first time theoutflow emission from the two sources a1 and a2. the two protostellar jets havevery different properties: the a1 jet is faster, has a short dynamicaltimescale (&lt;10^3 yr), and is associated with h2 shocked emission, whereas thea2 jet, which dominates the large-scale emission, is associated with diffuseemission, bends, and emits at slower velocities. the observed bending of the a2jet is consistent with the change of propagation direction observed at largescale and suggests jet precession on very short timescales (~200-600 yr). inaddition, a chemically rich spectrum with emission from several coms (e.g.hcooh, ch3ocho, ch3och3) is only detected towards a2. finally, veryhigh-velocity shocked emission (~50 km s^-1) is observed along the a1 jet. anlte analysis shows that sio, so, and h2co abundances in the gas phase areenhanced up to (3-4)x10^{-7}, (1.4-1.7)x10^{-6}, and (3-7.9)x10^{-7},respectively. the intrinsic different properties of the jets and drivingsources in ngc1333-iras4a suggest different evolutionary stages for the twoprotostars, with a1 being younger than a2, in a very early stage of starformation previous to the hot-corino phase.

1511.03944	molecule survival in magnetized protostellar disk winds. ii. predicted  h2o line profiles versus herschel/hifi observations	we investigate whether the broad wings of h2o emission identified withherschel towards low-mass class 0 and class 1 protostars may be consistent withan origin in a dusty mhd disk wind, and the constraints it would set on theunderlying disk properties. we present synthetic h2o line profiles predictionsfor a typical mhd disk wind solution with various values of disk accretionrate, stellar mass, extension of the launching area, and view angle. we comparethem in terms of line shapes and intensities with the hifi profiles observed bythe wish key program. we find that a dusty mhd disk wind launched from 0.2--0.6au au to 3--25 au can reproduce to a remarkable degree the observed shapes andintensities of the broad h2o component, both in the fundamental 557 ghz lineand in more excited lines. such a model also readily reproduces the observedcorrelation of 557 ghz line luminosity with envelope density, if the infallrate at 1000 au is 1--3 times the disk accretion rate in the wind ejectionregion. it is also compatible with the typical disk size and bolometricluminosity in the observed targets. however, the narrower line profiles inclass 1 sources suggest that mhd disk winds in these sources, if present, wouldhave to be slower and/or less water rich than in class 0 sources. inconclusion, mhd disk winds appear as a valid (though not unique) option toconsider for the origin of the broad h2o component in low-mass protostars. almaappears ideally suited to further test this model by searching for resolvedsignatures of the warm and slow wide-angle molecular wind that would bepredicted.

astro-ph;0310467	near-ir [fe ii] emission diagnostics applied to cold disk winds in young  stars	we investigate the emissivity properties of the main near-ir transitions ofthe fe+ ion in the conditions prevailing in the inner regions of jets fromyoung stars, based on a simplified 16-level atom model. we present newdiagnostic diagrams involving prominent near-ir line ratios that allow us toconstrain the electronic density, temperature, and fe gas phase abundanceratio, independently of the heating process. comparison with recent near-irobservations of a sample of hh objects indicates gas phase fe abundancesranging from 15-50 % up to 100 % of the solar value in agreement with themoderate depletions previously derived from optical line ratios or shockmodels. hence, it appears that fe-bearing dust is efficiently destroyed instellar jets. we then use our fe+ emissivity model to predict near-ir [fe ii]emission maps for self-similar, cold mhd disk wind models. we show thatobservations in [fe ii] with amber on the vlti could severely constrain the mhdsolution and the inner launch radius of the jet. we also compare theoreticalpredictions with recent observations in the near-ir [fe ii] lines of thel1551-irs5 and dg tau jets. the cold disk wind model reproduces quite well thetwo velocity components observed at -100 and -300 km/s, although the highvelocity component appears overestimated by a factor of 1.5 in the dg tau jet.however, the model predicts too little emission at intermediate-velocity andinsufficient densities. denser disk winds with stronger heating at the jetbase, which have been invoked for optical jets, also appear needed in younger,embedded class i jet sources.

astro-ph;0403236	predicted rotation signatures in mhd disc winds and comparison to dg tau  observations	motivated by the first detections of rotation signatures in the dg tau jet(bacciotti et al. 2002), we examine possible biases affecting the relationbetween detected rotation signatures and true azimuthal velocity forself-similar mhd disc winds, taking into account projection, convolution aswell as excitation gradients effects. we find that computed velocity shifts aresystematically smaller than the true underlying rotation curve. when outerslower streamlines dominate the emission, we predict observed shifts increasingwith transverse distance to the jet axis, opposite to the true rotationprofile. determination of the full transverse rotation profile thus requireshigh angular resolution observations (&lt; 5 au) on an object with dominant innerfaster streamlines. comparison of our predictions with hst/stis observations ofdg tau clearly shows that self-similar, warm mhd disc wind models with lambda =13 and an outer radius of the disc ~ 3 au are able to reproduce detectedvelocity shifts, while cold disc wind models (lambda &gt; 50) are ruled out forthe medium-velocity component in the dg tau jet.

astro-ph;0407588	temporal evolution of magnetic molecular shocks ii. analytics of the  steady state and semi-analytical construction of intermediate ages	in the first paper of this series (paper i) we computed time dependentsimulations of multifluid shocks with chemistry and a transverse magnetic fieldfrozen in the ions, using an adaptive moving grid. in this paper, we presentnew analytical results on steady-state molecular shocks. relationships betweendensity and pressure in the neutral fluid are derived for the cold magneticprecursor, hot magnetic precursor, adiabatic shock front, and the followingcooling layer. the compression ratio and temperature behind a fullydissociative adiabatic shock is also derived. to prove that these results mayeven hold for intermediate ages, we design a test to locally characterise thevalidity of the steady state equations in a time-dependent shock simulation.applying this tool to the results of paper i, we show that most of these shocks(all the stable ones) are indeed in a quasi-steady state at all times, i.e. : agiven snapshot is composed of one or more truncated steady shock. finally, weuse this property to produce a construction method of any intermediate time oflow velocity shocks (u &lt; 20 km/s) with only a steady-state code. in particular,this method allows one to predict the occurrence of steady cj-type shocks moreaccurately than previously proposed criteria.

astro-ph;0607375	molecular line emission in hh54: a coherent view from near to far  infrared	aims. we present a detailed study of the infrared line emission (1-200micron) in the herbig-haro object hh54. our database comprises: high- (r~9000)and low- (r~600) resolution spectroscopic data in the near-infrared band (1-2.5micron); mid-infrared spectrophotometric images (5-12 micron); and, far-ir(45-200 micron, r~200) spectra acquired with the iso satellite. as a result, weprovide the detection of and the absolute fluxes for more than 60 molecularfeatures (mainly from h2 in the near- and mid-infrared and from h2o, co and ohin the far-infrared) and 23 ionic lines. methods. the h2 lines, coming fromlevels from v=0 to v=4 have been interpreted in the context of a state-of-artshock code, whose output parameters are adopted as input to a large velocitygradient computation in order to interpret the fir emission of co, h2o and oh.results. the h2 emission can be interpreted as originating in eithersteady-state j-type shocks or in quasi-steady j-type shocks with magneticprecursor. however, our multi-species analysis shows that only a model of aj-type shock with magnetic precursor (v_shock=18 km/s, n_h=10^4 cm^-3, b=100microg, age=400 yr) can account for both the observed h2 emission and the coand h2o lines. such a model predicts a h2o abundance of ~ 7 10^-5, in agreementwith estimations from other shock models for outflows associated with low massprotostars. we can exclude the possibility that the observed atomic lines arisein the same shock as the molecular lines, and give arguments in favour of thepresence of a further high-velocity, fully dissociative shock component in theregion. finally, in view of the forthcoming spectroscopic facilities on boardof the herschel satellite, we provide predictions for h2o lines considered tobe the most suitable for diagnostic purposes.
