0901.3592	empirical abundance scaling laws and implications for the gamma-process  in core-collapse supernovae	analyzing the solar system abundances, we have found two empirical abundancescaling laws concerning the p- and s-nuclei with the same atomic number. thefirst scaling is s/p ratios are almost constant over a wide range of the atomicnumber, where the p-nculei are lighter than the s-nuclei by two or fourneutrons. the second scaling is p/p ratios are almost constant, where thesecond $p$-nuclei are lighter than the first p-nucleus by two neutrons. thesescalings are a piece of evidence that most p-nuclei are dominantly synthesizedby the gamma-process in supernova explosions. the scalings lead to a novelconcept of "universality of gamma-process" that the s/p and p/p ratios ofnuclei produced by individual gamma-processes are almost constant,respectively. we have calculated the ratios by gamma-process based oncore-collapse supernova explosion models under various astrophysical conditionsand found that the scalings hold for materials produced by individualgamma-processes independent of the astrophysical conditions assumed. theuniversality originates from three mechanisms: the shifts of the gamma-processlayers to keep their peak temperature, the weak s-process in pre-supernovae,and the independence of the s/p ratios of the nuclear reactions. the resultsfurther suggest an extended universality that the s/p ratios in thegamma-process layers are not only constant but also centered on a specificvalue of 3. with this specific value and the first scaling, we estimate thatthe ratios of $s$-process abundance contributions from the agb stars to themassive stars are almost 6.7 for the $s$-nuclei of a &gt; 90. we find that largeenhancements of s/p ratios for ce, er, and w are a piece of evidence that theweak s-process actually occurred before sne.

0902.1440	the extremely luminous supernova 2006gy at late phase: detection of  optical emission from supernova	we performed optical spectroscopy and photometry of sn 2006gy at late time,~400 days after the explosion, with the subaru/focas in a good seeingcondition. we found that the sn faded by ~3 mag from ~200 to ~400 days afterthe explosion (i.e., by ~5 mag from peak to ~400 days) in r band. the overalllight curve is marginally consistent with the 56ni heating model, although theflattening around 200 days suggests the optical flux declined more steeplybetween ~200 and ~400 days. the late time spectrum was quite peculiar among alltypes of sne. it showed many intermediate width (~2000 km/s fwhm) emissionlines, e.g., [fe ii], [ca ii], and ca ii. the absence of the broad [o i] 6300,6364 line and weakness of [fe ii] and [ca ii] lines compared with ca ii irtriplet would be explained by a moderately high electron density in the lineemitting region. this high density assumption seems to be consistent with thelarge amount of ejecta and low expansion velocity of sn 2006gy. the h-alphaline luminosity was as small as ~1x10^39 erg/s, being comparable with those ofnormal type ii sne at similar epochs. our observation indicates that the strongcsm interaction had almost finished by ~400 days. if the late time optical fluxis purely powered by radioactive decay, at least m_ni ~ 3 m_sun should beproduced at the sn explosion. in the late phase spectrum, there were severalunusual emission lines at 7400--8800 aa and some of them might be due to ti orni synthesized at the explosion.

0902.4573	evolution of very massive population iii stars with mass accretion from  pre-main sequence to collapse	we calculate the evolution of zero-metallicity population iii (pop iii) starswhose mass grows from the initial mass of $\sim 1m_{\odot}$ by accreting thesurrounding gases. our calculations cover a whole evolutionary stages from thepre-main sequence, via various nuclear burning stages, through the final corecollapse or pair-creation instability phases. we adopt the following stellarmass-dependent accretion rates which are derived from cosmological simulationsof early structure formation based on the low mass dark matter halos atredshifts $z \sim 20$: (1) the accretion rates for the first generation (popiii.1) stars and (2) the rates for zero-metallicity but the second generation(pop iii.2) stars which are affected by radiation from the pop iii.1 stars. forcomparison, we also study the evolution with the mass-dependent accretion rateswhich are affected by radiatibe feedback. we show that the final mass of popiii.1 stars can be as large as $\sim 1000m_{\odot}$, beyond the mass range($140 - 300m_{\odot}$) for the pair-instability supernovae. such massive starsundergo core-collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes, which may be theseeds for merger trees to supermassive black holes. on the other hand, popiii.2 stars become less massive ($\lsim 40 - 60m_{\odot}$), being in the massrange of ordinary iron core-collapse stars. such stars explode and eject heavyelements to contribute to chemical enrichment of the early universe as observedin the abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars in the galactic halo.

0903.0217	dust in supernovae; formation and evolution	core--collapsed supernovae (ccsne) have been considered to be one of sourcesof dust in the universe. what kind and how much mass of dust are formed in theejecta and are injected into the interstellar medium (ism) depend on the typeof ccsne, through the difference in the thickness (mass) of outer envelope. inthis review, after summarizing the existing results of observations on dustformation in ccsne, we investigate formation of dust in the ejecta and itsevolution in the supernova remnants (snrs) of type ii--p and type iib sne.then, the time evolution of thermal emission from dust in the snr of type iibsn is demonstrated and compared with the observation of cas a. we find that thetotal dust mass formed in the ejecta does not so much depend on the type; $\sim0.3-0.7 m_{\odot}$ in type ii--p sne and $\sim 0.13 m_{\odot}$ in type iib sn.however the size of dust sensitively depends on the type, being affected by thedifference in the gas density in the ejecta: the dust mass is dominated bygrains with radii larger than 0.03 $\mu$m in type ii-p, and less than 0.006$\mu$m in type iib, which decides the fate of dust in the snr. the survivingdust mass is $\sim 0.04-0.2 m_{\odot}$ in the snrs of type ii--p sne for theambient hydrogen density of $n_{\rm h}=10.0-1.0$ cm$^{-3}$, while almost alldust grains are destroyed in the snr of type iib. the spectral energydistribution (sed) of thermal emission from dust in snr well reflects theevolution of dust grains in snr through erosion by sputtering and stochasticheating. the observed sed of cas a snr is reasonably reproduced by the model ofdust formation and evolution for type iib sn.

0906.1062	spectropolarimetry of the unique type ib supernova 2005bf: larger  asymmetry revealed by later-phase data	we present an optical spectropolarimetric observation of the unique type ibsupernova (sn) 2005bf at 8 days after the second maximum. the data, combinedwith the polarization spectrum taken at 6 days before the second maximum (maundet al. 2007a), enable us to closely examine the intrinsic properties of the sn.the polarization percentage is smaller at the later epoch over a widewavelength range, while the position angle is similar at the two epochs. wefind that an assumption of complete depolarization of strong lines at theemission peak is not necessarily correct. the intrinsic polarization of the snis larger, and thus, the ejecta of sn 2005bf would be more asymmetric thanpreviously expected. the axis ratio of the photosphere projected on the skydeviates from unity by at least 20 %. if the position angle of interstellarpolarization is aligned with the spiral arm of the host galaxy, the deviationis larger than 25 %. the line polarization at the he i, ca ii and fe ii linesis also smaller at the later epoch. the changes in the position angle acrossthese lines, which were observed at the earlier epoch, are still marginallypresent at the later epoch. the similar polarimetric behavior suggests that thedistributions of these ions are correlated. properties of polarization, as wellas the light curve and the spectra both at photospheric and nebular phases, canbe explained by an aspherical, possibly unipolar explosion of a wn star inwhich the blob of 56ni penetrates c+o core and stops within the he layer.

0908.1773	sn2003bg: a broad-lined type iib supernova with hydrogen	models for the spectra and the light curve, in the photospheric as well as inthe late nebular phase, are used to infer the properties of the veryradio-bright, broad-lined type iib supernova 2003bg. consistent fits to thelight curve and the spectral evolution are obtained with an explosion thatejected ~ 4 m_sun of material with a kinetic energy of ~ 5 10^51 erg. a thinlayer of hydrogen, comprising ~ 0.05 m_sun, is inferred to be present in theejecta at the highest velocities (v &gt;~ 9000 km/s), while a thicker heliumlayer, comprising ~ 1.25 m_sun, was ejected at velocities between 6500 and 9000km/s. at lower velocities, heavier elements are present, including ~ 0.2 m_sunof 56ni that shape the light curve and the late-time nebular spectra. thesevalues suggest that the progenitor star had a mass of ~ 20-25 m_sun (comparableto, but maybe somewhat smaller than that of the progenitor of the xrf/sn2008d). the rather broad-lined early spectra are the result of the presence ofa small amount of material (~ 0.03 m_sun) at velocities &gt; 0.1 c, which carries~ 10 % of the explosion kinetic energy. no clear signatures of a highlyaspherical explosion are detected.

0908.2057	spectropolarimetry of extremely luminous type ia supernova 2009dc:  nearly spherical explosion of super-chandrasekhar mass white dwarf	we present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a candidate ofsuper-chandrasekhar mass type ia supernova (sn): sn 2009dc. the observationswere performed at 5.6 and 89.5 days after the b-band maximum. the data taken atthe later epoch are used to determine the interstellar polarization. continuumpolarization is found to be small (&lt;0.3 %), indicating that the explosion isnearly spherically symmetric. this fact suggests that a very asphericalexplosion is not a likely scenario for sn 2009dc. polarization at the si ii andca ii lines clearly shows a loop in the q-u plane, indicating anon-axisymmetric, clumpy distribution of intermediate-mass elements. the degreeof line polarization at the si and ca line is moderate (0.5% +- 0.1% and 0.7%+- 0.1%, respectively), but it is higher than expected from the trend of othertype ia sne. this may suggest that there are thick enough, clumpy si-richlayers above the thick 56ni-rich layers (&gt;~ 1.2 msun). the observedspectropolarimetric properties, combined with the photometric and spectroscopicproperties, suggest that the progenitor of sn 2009dc has a super-chandrasekharmass, and that the explosion geometry is globally spherically symmetric, withclumpy distribution of intermediate-mass elements.

0707.2219	hypernovae and their gamma-ray bursts connection	the connection between long gamma ray bursts (grbs) and supernovae (sne),have been established through the well observed cases of grb980425/sn 1998bw,grb030329/sn 2003dh and grb031203/sn 2003lw. these events can be explained asthe prompt collapse to a black hole (bh) of the core of a massive star (m ~ 40msun) that had lost its outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. all these sneexhibited strong oxygen lines, and their energies were much larger than thoseof typical sne, thus these sne are called hypernovae (hne). the case of sn2006aj/grb060218 appears different: the grb was weak and soft (an x-ray flash,xrf); the sn is dimmer and has very weak oxygen lines. the explosion energy ofsn 2006aj was smaller, as was the ejected mass. in our model, the progenitorstar had a smaller mass than other grb/sne (m ~ 20 msun), suggesting that aneutron star (ns) rather than a black hole was formed. if the nascent neutronstar was strongly magnetized (a so-called magnetar) and rapidly spinning, itmay launch a weak grb or an xrf. the final fate of 20-30 msun stars showinteresting variety, as seen in the very peculiar type ib/c sn 2005bf. thismass range corresponds to the ns to bh transition. we also compare thenucleosynthesis feature of hne with the metal-poor stars and suggest thehypernova-first star connection.

0707.2255	the r-process in supersonic neutrino-driven winds: the roll of wind  termination shock	recent hydrodynamic studies of core-collapse supernovae imply that theneutrino-heated ejecta from a nascent neutron star develops to supersonicoutflows. these supersonic winds are influenced by the reverse shock from thepreceding supernova ejecta, forming the wind termination shock. we investigatethe effects of the termination shock in neutrino-driven winds and its roll onthe r-process. supersonic outflows are calculated with a semi-analyticneutrino-driven wind model. subsequent termination-shocked, subsonic outflowsare obtained by applying the rankine-hugoniot relations. we find a couple ofeffects that can be relevant for the r-process. first is the sudden slowdown ofthe temperature decrease by the wind termination. second is the entropy jump bytermination-shock heating, up to several 100nak. nucleosynthesis calculationsin the obtained winds are performed to examine these effects on the r-process.we find that 1) the slowdown of the temperature decrease plays a decisive rollto determine the r-process abundance curves. this is due to the strongdependences of the nucleosynthetic path on the temperature during the r-processfreezeout phase. our results suggest that only the termination-shocked windswith relatively small shock radii (~500km) are relevant for the bulk of thesolar r-process abundances (a~100-180). the heaviest part in the solarr-process curve (a~180-200), however, can be reproduced both in shocked andunshocked winds. these results may help to constrain the mass range ofsupernova progenitors relevant for the r-process. we find, on the other hand,2) negligible roles of the entropy jump on the r-process. this is a consequencethat the sizable entropy increase takes place only at a large shock radius(~10,000km) where the r-process has already ceased.

0707.2598	how much 56ni can be produced in core-collapse supernovae? : evolution  and explosions of 30 - 100 msun stars	motivated by the discovery of extremely bright supernovae sne1999as and2006gy, we have investigated how much 56ni mass can be synthesized incore-collapse massive supernovae (sne). we calculate the evolution of severalvery massive stars with initial masses m &lt;~ 100 msun from the main-sequence tothe beginning of the fe-core collapse and simulate their explosions andnucleosynthesis. in order to avoid complications associated with strongmass-loss, we only consider metal-poor stars with initial metallicity z =zsun/200. however, our results are applicable to higher metallicity models withsimilar c+o core masses. the c+o core mass for the 100msun model is m_co =42.6msun and this is the heaviest model in the literature for which fe-corecollapse sn is explored. the synthesized 56ni mass increases with theincreasing explosion energy and progenitor mass. for the explosion energy ofe_51 = e/10^{51} erg =30, for example, the 56ni masses of m(56ni) = 2.2, 2.3,5.0, and 6.6 msun can be produced for the progenitors with initial masses of30, 50, 80 and 100 msun (or c+o core masses m_co = 11.4, 19.3, 34.0 and 42.6msun), respectively. we find that producing m(56ni) ~ 4msun as seen in sn1999asis possible for m_co &gt;~ 34 msun and e_{51} &gt;~ 20. producing m(56ni) ~ 13msun assuggested for sn2006gy requires a too large explosion energy for m_co &lt;~43msun, but it may be possible with a reasonable explosion energy if m_co &gt;~60msun.

0911.5484	nebular spectra and explosion asymmetry of type ia supernovae	the spectral signatures of asymmetry in type ia supernova (sn ia) explosionsare investigated, using a sample of late-time nebular spectra. first, akinematical model is constructed for sn ia 2003hv, which can account for themain features in its optical, near-infrared (nir), and mid-infrared (mid-ir)late-time spectra. it is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explainthe observed characteristics of sn 2003hv. this model includes a relativelyhigh density, fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and arelatively low density, extended 56ni-rich region which is more sphericallydistributed. the high density region consists of the inner stable fe-ni regionand outer 56ni-rich region. such a distribution may be the result of adelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces theglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation canlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. this configuration, if viewed from thedirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of theemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in sn 2003hv. forthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and theimplications for sne ia in general. the model predicts that a variation of thecentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in somelines (e.g., [ni ii]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [fe iii] blend at4700a) will not show this effect. by examining optical nebular spectra of 12sne ia, we have found that such a variation indeed exists. we suggest that theglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, as likely imprint of the deflagrationflame propagation, is a generic feature of sne ia (abridged).

1001.0145	production of the p-process nuclei in the carbon-deflagration model for  type ia supernovae	we calculate nucleosynthesis of proton-rich isotopes in thecarbon-deflagration model for type ia supernovae (sne ia). the seed abundancesare obtained by calculating the s-process nucleosynthesis that is expected tooccur in the repeating helium shell flashes on the carbon-oxygen (co) whitedwarf (wd) during mass accretion from a binary companion. when the deflagrationwave passes through the outer layer of the co wd, p-nuclei are produced byphotodisintegration reactions on s-nuclei in a region with the peak temperatureranging from 1.9 to 3.6 x10^9 k. we confirm the sensitivity of the p-process onthe initial distribution of s-nuclei. we show that the initial c/o ratio in thewd does not much affect the yield of p-nuclei. on the other hand, the abundanceof 22ne left after the s-processing has a large influence on the p-process via22ne(alpha,n) reaction. we find that about 50% of p-nuclides are co-producedwhen normalized to their solar abundances in all adopted cases of seeddistribution. mo and ru, which are largely underproduced in type ii supernovae(sne ii), are produced more than in sne ii although they are underproduced withrespect to the yield levels of other p-nuclides. the ratios between p-nucleiand iron in the ejecta are larger than the solar ratios by a factor of 1.2. wealso compare the yields of oxygen, iron, and p-nuclides in sne ia and sne iiand suggest that sne ia could make a larger contribution than sne ii to thesolar system content of p-nuclei.

1006.5336	fallback supernovae: a possible origin of peculiar supernovae with  extremely low explosion energies	we perform hydrodynamical calculations of core-collapse supernovae (sne) withlow explosion energies. these sne do not have enough energy to eject the wholeprogenitor and most of the progenitor falls back to the central remnant. weshow that such fallback sne can have a variety of light curves (lcs) but theirphotospheric velocities can only have some limited values with lower limits. wealso perform calculations of nucleosynthesis and lcs of several fallback snmodel, and find that a fallback sn from the progenitor with a main-sequencemass of 13 msun can account for the properties of the peculiar type iasupernova sn 2008ha. the kinetic energy and ejecta mass of the model are1.2*10^{48} erg and 0.074 msun, respectively, and the ejected 56ni mass is0.003 msun. thus, sn 2008ha can be a core-collapse sn with a large amount offallback. we also suggest that sn 2008ha could have been accompanied with longgamma-ray bursts and long gamma-ray bursts without associated sne may beaccompanied with very faint sne with significant amount of fallback which aresimilar to sn 2008ha.

1010.5860	supersoft x-ray phase of single degenerate type ia supernova progenitors  in early type galaxies	in the single degenerate (sd) scenario for type ia supernova (sn ia)progenitors, an accreting white dwarf (wd) is expected to undergo a supersoftx-ray source (sss) phase. recently, gilfanov &amp; bogdan (2010, hereafter gb10)claimed that observed x-ray fluxes of early type galaxies would be too low tobe consistent with the prediction of the sd scenario based on rather simpleassumptions. we present realistic evolutionary models of sd systems andcalculate durations of sss phases. in most cases, accreting wds spend a largefraction of time in the optically thick wind phase and the recurrent nova phaserather than the sss phase. thus the sss phase lasts only for a few hundredthousand years. this is by a factor of ~10 shorter than those adopted by gb10where the sn~ia progenitor wd was assumed to spend most of its life as a sss.the theoretical x-ray luminosity of the sss has a large uncertainty because ofthe uncertain atmospheric model of mass-accreting wds and absorption of softx-rays by the companion star's cool wind material. we thus adopt an average ofthe observed fluxes of existing symbiotic ssss, i.e., ~0.4 x 10^{36} erg s^{-1}for 0.3--0.7 kev. using these sss duration and soft x-ray luminosity, we showthat the observed x-ray flux obtained by gb10 is rather consistent with ourestimated flux in early type galaxies based on the sd scenario. this is astrong support for the sd scenario as a main-contributor of sne ia in earlytype galaxies.

1104.0728	the role of dust in the early universe i : protogalaxy evolution	we develop one-zone galaxy formation models in the early universe, takinginto account dust formation and evolution by supernova (sn) explosions.especially we focus on the time evolution of dust size distribution, because${\rm h}_{2}$ formation on the dust surface plays a critical role in the starformation process in the early universe. in the model we assume that starformation rate (sfr) is proportional to the total amount of ${\rm h}_{2}$. weconsistently treat (i) the formation and size evolution of dust, (ii) thechemical reaction networks including ${\rm h}_{2}$ formation both on thesurface of dust and in gas phase, and (iii) the sfr in the model. first, wefind that, because of dust destruction due to both reverse and forward shocksdriven by sne, h$_{2}$ formation is more suppressed than that without dustdestruction. at the galaxy age of $sim0.8 {\rm gyr}$, for galaxy models withvirial mass $m_{\rm vir}=10^{9} m_{\odot}$ and formation redshift $z_{\rmvir}=10$, the molecular fraction is 2.5 orders of magnitude less in the modelwith dust destruction by both shocks than that in the model without dustdestruction. second, we show that the h$_{2}$ formation rate strongly dependson the ism density around sn progenitors. the sfr in higher ism density islower, since dust destruction by reverse shocks is more effective in higher ismdensity. we conclude that not only the amount but also the size distribution ofdust being related with the star formation activity strongly affects theevolution of galaxies in the early universe.

1105.0973	formation of dust in the ejecta of type ia supernovae	we investigate the formation of dust grains in the ejecta of type iasupernovae (sne ia), adopting the carbon-deflagration w7 model. in thecalculations of dust formation, we apply the nucleation and grain growth theoryand consider the two cases with and without formation of co and sio molecules.the results of the calculations show that for the sticking probability ofalpha_j=1, c, silicate, si, and fes grains can condense at early times of~100--300 days after the explosion, whereas fe and sic grains cannot formsubstantially. due to the low gas density in sne ia with no h-envelope, theaverage radii of the newly formed grains are generally below 0.01 micron, beingmuch smaller than those in type ii-p sne. this supports our previous conclusionthat the radius of dust formed in the ejecta is smaller in sne with lessmassive envelopes. the total dust mass ranges from 3x10^{-4} m_sun to 0.2 m_sunfor alpha_j=0.1--1, depending on whether or not co and sio molecules areformed. we also estimate the optical depths and thermal emission by the newlyformed dust and compare to the relevant observations of sne ia. we find thatthe formation of c grains in sne ia is suppressed to be consistent with theobservational constraints. this implies that energetic photons and electronsheavily depress the formation efficiency of c grains or that the outermost c-olayer of sne ia is almost fully burned. finally, we perform the calculations ofdust destruction in the sn remnants and find that dust grains formed in theejecta of sne ia are almost completely destroyed in the shocked gas beforebeing injected into the interstellar medium. this indicates that sne ia areunlikely to be the major sources of interstellar dust.

1105.4631	on the effects of microphysical grain properties on the yields of  carbonaceous dust from type ii sne	we study the role of the unknown microphysical properties of carbonaceousdust particles in determining the amount and size distribution of carbonaceousdust condensed in type ii supernova explosions. we parametrize themicrophysical properties in terms of the shape factor of the grain and thesticking coefficient of gas-phase carbon atoms onto the grain surfaces. we findthat the amount of dust formed is fairly independent of these properties,within the parameter range considered, though limited by the available amountof carbon atoms not locked in co molecules. however, we find that thecondensation times and size distributions of dust grains depend sensitively onthe microphysical parameters, with the mass distributions being weighted towardlarger effective radii for conditions considering grains with higher stickingcoefficients and/or more aspherical shapes. we discuss that this leads toimportant consequences on the predicted extinction law of sn dust and on thesurvival rate of the formed grains as they pass through the reverse shock ofthe sn. we conclude that a more detailed understanding of the dust formationprocess and of the microphysical properties of each dust species needs to beachieved before robust prediction on the sn dust yields can be performed.

1106.3510	a single degenerate progenitor model for type ia supernovae highly  exceeding the chandrasekhar mass limit	recent observations of type ia supernovae (sne ia) suggest that some of theprogenitor white dwarfs (wds) had masses up to 2.4-2.8 m_sun, highly exceedingthe chandrasekhar mass limit. we present a new single degenerate (sd) model forsn ia progenitors, in which the wd mass possibly reaches 2.3-2.7 m_sun. threebinary evolution processes are incorporated; optically thick winds frommass-accreting wds, mass-stripping from the binary companion star by the wdwinds, and wds being supported by differential rotation. the wd mass canincrease by accretion up to 2.3 (2.7) m_sun from the initial value of 1.1 (1.2)m_sun, being consistent with high luminosity sne ia such as sn 2003fg, sn2006gz, sn 2007if, and sn 2009dc. there are three characteristic mass ranges ofexploding wds. in an extreme massive case, differentially rotating wds explodeas an sn ia soon after the wd mass exceeds 2.4 m_sun because of a secularinstability at t/|w|\sim 0.14. for a mid mass range of m_wd=1.5-2.4 m_sun, ittakes some time (spinning-down time) until carbon is ignited to induce an sn iaexplosion after the wd mass has reached maximum, because it needs a loss orredistribution of angular momentum. for a lower mass case of rigidly rotatingwds, m_wd=1.38-1.5 m_sun, the spinning-down time depends on the timescale ofangular momentum loss from the wd. the difference in the spinning-down time mayproduce the "prompt" and "tardy" components. we also suggest the very brightsuper-chandrasekhar mass sne ia are born in a low metallicity environment.

0710.0319	young and massive binary progenitors of type ia supernovae and their  circumstellar matter	we present new evolutionary models for type ia supernova (sn ia) progenitors,introducing mass-stripping effect on a main-sequence (ms) or slightly evolvedcompanion star by winds from a mass-accreting white dwarf (wd). themass-stripping attenuates the rate of mass transfer from the companion to thewd. as a result, quite a massive ms companion can avoid forming a commonenvelope and increase the wd mass up to the sn ia explosion. including themass-stripping effect, we follow binary evolutions of various wd + ms systemsand obtain the parameter region in the initial donor mass - orbital periodplane where sne ia occur. the newly obtained sn ia region extends to donormasses of 6-7 m_\sun, although its extension depends on the efficiency ofmass-stripping effect. the stripped matter would mainly be distributed on theorbital plane and form very massive circumstellar matter (csm) around the sn iaprogenitor. it can explain massive csm around sne ia/iin(iia) 2002ic and 2005gjas well as tenuous csm around normal sn ia 2006x. our new model suggests thepresence of very young (\lesssim 10^8 yr) populations of sne ia, beingconsistent with recent observational indications of young population sne ia.

1110.3789	unburned material in the ejecta of type ia supernovae	(abridged) the presence of unburned material in the ejecta of normal type iasupernovae (sneia) is investigated using early-time spectroscopy obtained bythe csp. the tell-tale signature of pristine material from a c+o white dwarfprogenitor star is the presence of carbon. the most prominent carbon lines inoptical spectra of sneia are due to c ii. we find that at least 30% of theobjects in the sample show an absorption at ~6300 aa which is attributed to cii 6580. an association to h_alpha is considered to be unlikely. these findingsimply a larger incidence of carbon in sneia ejecta than previously noted. weshow how observational biases and physical conditions may hide these c iilines, and account for the scarcity of previous carbon detections. thisrelatively large frequency of carbon detections has crucial implications on ourunderstanding of the explosive process. the observations indicate that carbonis present merely ~1000 km s^-1 above the bulk of si ii. spectral modelingshows the detections are consistent with a mass of carbon of 10^-3--10^-2m_sun. this would imply substantial mixing, which may be related to asymmetriesof the flame propagation or clumps of unburned material along the line ofsight. however, the uniformity of the relation between c ii and si iivelocities is not consistent with the latter scenario. the observationalproperties of sneia with and without carbon signatures are compared. a trendtoward bluer color and lower luminosity is found for objects with carbon.

1204.6109	light curve modeling of superluminous supernova 2006gy: collision  between supernova ejecta and dense circumstellar medium	we show model light curves of superluminous supernova 2006gy on theassumption that the supernova is powered by the collision of supernova ejectaand its dense circumstellar medium. the initial conditions are constructedbased on the shock breakout condition, assuming that the circumstellar mediumis dense enough to cause the shock breakout within it. we perform a set ofnumerical light curve calculations by using a one-dimensional multigroupradiation hydrodynamics code stella. we succeeded in reproducing the overallfeatures of the early light curve of sn 2006gy with the circumstellar mediumwhose mass is about 15 msun (the average mass-loss rate ~ 0.1 msun/yr). thus,the progenitor of sn 2006gy is likely a very massive star. the density profileof the circumstellar medium is not well constrained by the light curve modelingonly, but our modeling disfavors the circumstellar medium formed by steady massloss. the ejecta mass is estimated to be comparable to or less than 15 msun andthe explosion energy is expected to be more than 4e51 erg. no 56ni is requiredto explain the early light curve. we find that the multidimensional effect,e.g., the rayleigh-taylor instability, which is expected to take place in thecool dense shell between the supernova ejecta and the dense circumstellarmedium, is important in understanding supernovae powered by the shockinteraction. we also show the evolution of the optical and near-infrared modellight curves of high-redshift superluminous supernovae. they can be potentiallyused to identify sn 2006gy-like superluminous supernovae in the future opticaland near-infrared transient surveys.

1207.2261	final fates of rotating white dwarfs and their companions in the single  degenerate model of type ia supernovae	taking into account the rotation of mass-accreting white dwarfs (wds) whosemasses exceed the chandrasekhar mass, we extend our new single degenerate modelfor the progenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia), accounting for two types ofbinary systems, those with a main sequence companion and those with a red-giant(rg) companion. we present a mass distribution of wds exploding as sne ia,where the wd mass ranges from 1.38 to 2.3 msun. these progenitor models areassigned to various types of sne ia. a lower mass range of wds (1.38 msun &lt;m_wd &lt;~ 1.5 msun), which are supported by rigid rotation, correspond to normalsne ia. a variety of spin-down time may lead to a variation of brightness. ahigher mass range of wds (m_wd &gt;~ 1.5 msun), which are supported bydifferential rotation, correspond to brighter sne ia such as sn 1991t. in thiscase, a variety of the wd mass may lead to a variation of brightness. we alsoshow the evolutionary states of the companion stars at sn ia explosions andpose constraints on the unseen companions. in the wd+rg systems, in particular,most of the rg companions have evolved to helium/carbon-oxygen wds in thespin-down phase before the sn ia explosions. in such a case, we do not expectany prominent signature of the companion immediately before and after theexplosion. we also compare our new models with the recent stringent constraintson the unseen progenitors of sne ia such as sn 2011fe.

1207.4648	super-chandrasekhar-mass light curve models for the highly luminous type  ia supernova 2009dc	several highly luminous type ia supernovae (sne ia) have been discovered.their high luminosities are difficult to explain with the thermonuclearexplosions of the chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (wds). in the present study,we estimate the progenitor mass of sn 2009dc, one of the extremely luminous sneia, using the hydrodynamical models as follows. explosion models ofsuper-chandrasekhar-mass (super-ch-mass) wds are constructed, and multi-colorlight curves (lcs) are calculated. the comparison between our calculations andthe observations of sn 2009dc suggests that the exploding wd has a super-chmass of 2.2-2.4 solar masses, producing 1.2-1.4 solar masses of ni-56, if theextinction by its host galaxy is negligible. if the extinction is significant,the exploding wd is as massive as \sim2.8 solar masses, and \sim1.8 solarmasses of ni-56 is necessary to account for the observations. whether thehost-galaxy extinction is significant or not, the progenitor wd must have athick carbon-oxygen layer in the outermost zone (20-30% of the wd mass), whichexplains the observed low expansion velocity of the ejecta and the presence ofcarbon. our estimate on the mass of the progenitor wd, especially for theextinction-corrected case, is challenging to the current scenarios of sne ia.implications on the progenitor scenarios are also discussed.

1208.0158	can the growth of dust grains in low-metallicity star-forming clouds  affect the formation of metal-poor low-mass stars?	the discovery of a low-mass star with such low metallicity as &lt; 4.5x10^{-5}z_sun reveals the critical role of dust in the formation of extremelymetal-poor stars. in this paper we explore the effect of the growth of dustgrains through accretion of gaseous refractory elements in very low-metallicitypre-stellar cores on the cloud fragmentation induced by the dust emissioncooling. employing a simple model of grain growth in a gravitationallycollapsing gas, we show that fe and si grains can grow efficiently at hydrogendensities of ~10^{10}-10^{14} cm^{-3} in the clouds with metal abundances of -5&lt;~ [fe, si/h] &lt;~ -3. the critical metal number abundances, above which thegrain growth could induce the fragmentation of the gas clouds, are estimated tobe a_{crit} ~ 10^{-9}-10^{-8}, unless the initial grain radius is too large (&gt;~1 um) or the sticking probability is too small (&lt;~ 0.01). we find that even ifthe initial dust-to-gas mass ratio is well below the minimum value required forthe dust-induced fragmentation, the grain growth increases the dust mass highenough to cause the gas fragmentation into sub-solar mass clumps. we suggestthat as long as the critical metal abundance is satisfied, the grain growthcould play an important role in the formation of low-mass stars withmetallicity as low as 10^{-5} z_sun.

(1) dd-subch: in the merging of double c+o white dwarfs (ddscenario), if the carbon detonation is induced near the white dwarf (wd)surface in the early dynamical phase, it could result in the (effectively)sub-chandrasekhar mass explosion. (2) dd-ch: if no surface c-detonation isignited, the wd could grow until the chandrasekhar mass is reached, but theoutcome depends on whether the quiescent carbon shell burning is ignited andburns c+o into o+ne+mg. (3) sd-subch: in the single degenerate (sd) scenario,if the he shell-flashes grow strong to induce a he detonation, it leads to thesub-chandra explosion. (4) sd-ch: if the he-shell flashes are not strongenough, they still produce interesting amount of si and s near the surface ofc+o wd before the explosion. in the chandra mass explosion, the central densityis high enough to produce electron capture elements, e.g., stable ni-58.observations of the emission lines of ni in the nebular spectra provides usefuldiagnostics of the sub-chandra vs. chandra issue. the recent observations ofrelatively low velocity carbon near the surface of sne ia provide alsointeresting constraint on the explosion models.

0801.0215	the role of type ia supernovae in chemical evolution i: lifetime of type  ia supernovae and galactic supernova rates	we construct a new model of type ia supernovae (sne ia), based on the singledegenerate scenario, taking account of the metallicity dependences of the whitedwarf (wd) wind and the mass-stripping effect on the binary companion star. ourmodel naturally predicts that the sn ia lifetime distribution spans a range of0.1-20 gyr with the double peaks at ~0.1 and 1 gyr. while the present sn iarate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of thered-giants+wd systems, the large sn ia rate in radio galaxies could beexplained with the young population of the main-sequence+wd systems. because ofthe metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from wds in thebinary systems, the sn ia rate in the systems with [fe/h]&lt;-1, e.g., high-zspiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small. our sn ia model can give betterreproduction of the [(alpha, mn, zn)/fe]-[fe/h] relations in the solarneighborhood than other models such as the double-degenerate scenario. themetallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the youngpopulation of sne ia. we also succeed in reproducing the galactic supernovarates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies, and thecosmic sn ia rate history with a peak at z~1. at z&gt;1, the predicted sn ia ratedecreases toward higher redshifts and sne ia will be observed only in thesystems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment. thissuggests that the evolution effect in the supernova cosmology can be small.

1309.6734	abundance profiling of extremely metal-poor stars and supernova  properties in the early universe	after the big bang nucleosynthesis, the first heavy element enrichment in theuniverse was made by a supernova (sn) explosion of a population (pop) iii star(pop iii sn). the abundance ratios of elements produced from pop iii sne arerecorded in abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor (emp) stars. theobservations of the increasing number of emp stars have made it possible tostatistically constrain the explosion properties of pop iii sne. we present popiii sn models whose nucleosynthesis yields well-reproduce individually theabundance patterns of 48 such metal-poor stars as [fe/h] $\mathrel{\rlap{\lower4pt \hbox{$\sim$}}\raise 1pt \hbox {$&lt;$}}-3.5$. we then derive relationsbetween the abundance ratios of emp stars and certain explosion properties ofpop iii sne: the higher [(c+n)/fe] and [(c+n)/mg] ratios correspond to thesmaller ejected fe mass and the larger compact remnant mass, respectively.using these relations, the distributions of the abundance ratios of emp starsare converted to those of the explosion properties of pop iii sne. suchdistributions are compared with those of the explosion properties of presentday sne: the distribution of the ejected fe mass of pop iii sne has the samepeak as that of the resent day sne but shows an extended tail down to$\sim10^{-2}-10^{-5}m_\odot$, and the distribution of the mass of the compactremnant of pop iii sne is as wide as that of the present day stellar-mass blackholes. our results demonstrate the importance of large samples of emp starsobtained by ongoing and future emp star surveys and subsequent high-dispersionspectroscopic observations in clarifying the nature of pop iii sne in the earlyuniverse.

1403.7288	iptf13bvn: the first evidence of a binary progenitor for a type ib  supernova	the recent detection in archival hst images of an object at the the locationof supernova (sn) iptf13bvn may represent the first direct evidence of theprogenitor of a type ib sn. the object's photometry was found to be compatiblewith a wolf-rayet pre-sn star mass of ~11 msun. however, based onhydrodynamical models we show that the progenitor had a pre-sn mass of ~3.5msun and that it could not be larger than ~8 msun. we propose an interactingbinary system as the sn progenitor and perform evolutionary calculations thatare able to self-consistently explain the light-curve shape, the absence ofhydrogen, and the pre-sn photometry. we further discuss the range of allowedbinary systems and predict that the remaining companion is a luminous o-typestar of significantly lower flux in the optical than the pre-sn object. afuture detection of such star may be possible and would provide the firstrobust identification of a progenitor system for a type ib sn.

1404.5391	dust production factories in the early universe: formation of carbon  grains in red-supergiant winds of very massive population iii stars	we investigate the formation of dust in a stellar wind during thered-supergiant (rsg) phase of a very massive population iii star with thezero-age main sequence mass of 500 m_sun. we show that, in a carbon-rich windwith a constant velocity, carbon grains can form with a lognormal-like sizedistribution, and that all of the carbon available for dust formation finallycondense into dust for wide ranges of the mass-loss rate ((0.1-3)x10^{-3} m_sunyr^{-1}) and wind velocity (1-100 km s^{-1}). we also find that theacceleration of the wind driven by newly formed dust suppresses the graingrowth but still allows more than half of gas-phase carbon to be finally lockedup in dust grains. these results indicate that at most 1.7 m_sun of carbongrains can form in total during the rsg phase of 500 m_sun population iiistars. such a high dust yield could place very massive primordial stars asimportant sources of dust at the very early epoch of the universe if theinitial mass function of population iii stars was top-heavy. we also brieflydiscuss a new formation scenario of carbon-rich ultra-metal-poor starsconsidering the feedback from very massive population iii stars.

1407.4563	electron-capture supernovae exploding within their progenitor wind	the most massive stars on the asymptotic giant branch (agb), so calledsuper-agb stars, are thought to produce supernovae (sne) triggered by electroncaptures in their degenerate o+ne+mg cores. super-agb stars are expected tohave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. theexplosions of super-agb stars are therefore presumed to occur in this densewind. we provide the first synthetic light curves (lcs) for such events byexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecsn) progenitors within theirsuper-agb winds. we find that the early lc, i.e. before the recombination wavereaches the bottom of the h-rich envelope of sn ejecta (the plateau phase), isnot affected by the dense wind. however, after the plateau phase, theluminosity remains higher when the super-agb wind is taken into account. wecompare our results to the historical lc of sn 1054, the progenitor of the crabnebula, and show that the explosion of an ecsn within an ordinary super-agbwind can explain the lc features. we conclude that sn 1054 could have been atype iin sn without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggestedto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. we also show that ourlcs match type iin sne with an early plateau phase (`type iin-p') and suggestthat they are ecsne within super-agb winds. although some ecsne can be brightin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their x-rayluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as othertype iin sne whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.thus, we suggest that optically-bright x-ray-faint type iin sne can emerge fromecsne. optically-faint type iin sne, such as sn 2008s, can also originate fromecsne if their h-rich envelope masses are small. some of them can be observedas `type iin-b' sne due to the small h-rich envelope mass.

1409.0116	abundance stratification in type ia supernovae - iv: the luminous,  peculiar sn 1991t	the abundance distribution of the elements in the ejecta of the peculiar,luminous type ia supernova (sn ia) 1991t is obtained modelling spectra frombefore maximum light until a year after the explosion, with the method of"abundance tomography". sn 1991t is different from other slowly declining sneia (e.g. sn 1999ee) in having a weaker si ii 6355 line and strong features ofiron group elements before maximum. the distance to the sn is investigatedalong with the abundances and the density profile. the ionization transitionthat happens around maximum sets a strict upper limit on the luminosity. bothw7 and the wdd3 delayed detonation model are tested. wdd3 is found to providemarginally better fits. in this model the core of the ejecta is dominated bystable fe with a mass of about 0.15 solar masses, as in most sne ia. the layerabove is mainly 56ni up to v~10000 km/s (~0.78 solar masses). a significantamount of 56ni (~3 %) is located in the outer layers. a narrow layer between10000 km/s and ~12000 km/s is dominated by intermediate mass elements (ime),~0.18 solar masses. this is small for a sn ia. the high luminosity and theconsequently high ionization, and the high 56ni abundance at high velocitiesexplain the peculiar early-time spectra of sn 1991t. the outer part is mainlyof oxygen, ~0.3 solar masses. carbon lines are never detected, yielding anupper limit of 0.01 solar masses for c. the abundances obtained with the w7density model are qualitatively similar to those of the wdd3 model. differentelements are stratified with moderate mixing, resembling a delayed detonation.

1411.1471	hybrid c-o-ne white dwarfs as progenitors of diverse sne ia	when carbon is ignited off-center in a co core of a super-agb star, itsburning in a convective shell tends to propagate to the center. whether the cflame will actually be able to reach the center depends on the efficiency ofextra mixing beneath the c convective shell. whereas thermohaline mixing is tooinefficient to interfere with the c-flame propagation, convective boundarymixing can prevent the c burning from reaching the center. as a result, ac-o-ne white dwarf (wd) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. such a"hybrid" wd has a small co core surrounded by a thick one zone. in our 1dstellar evolution computations the hybrid wd is allowed to accrete c-richmaterial, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted h-rich materialfrom its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted h wouldbe processed into he under stationary conditions, assuming that he could thenbe transformed into c. when the mass of the accreting wd approaches thechandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective urca shell flashesassociated with high abundances of 23na and 25mg. they are followed byoff-center c ignition leading to convection that occupies almost the entirestar. to model the urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved datafor their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. because of the emphasizeduncertainty of the convective urca process in our hybrid wd models of sn iaprogenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternativeinstances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase ofexplosive c ignition, either off or in the center. our hybrid sn ia progenitormodels have much lower c to o abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive cignition than their pure co counterparts, which may explain the observeddiversity of the sne ia.

1503.06739	subclasses of type ia supernovae as the origin of [\alpha/fe] ratios in  dwarf spheroidal galaxies	recent extensive observations of type ia supernovae (sne ia) have revealedthe existence of a diversity of sne ia, including sne iax. we introduce twopossible channels in the single degenerate scenario: 1) double detonations insub-chandrasekhar (ch) mass co white dwarfs (wds), where a thin he envelope isdeveloped with relatively low accretion rates after he novae even at lowmetallicities, and 2) carbon deflagrations in ch-mass possibly hybrid c+o+newds, where wd winds occur at [fe/h] ~ -2.5 at high accretion rates. thesesubclasses of sne ia are rarer than `normal' sne ia and do not affect thechemical evolution in the solar neighborhood, but can be very important inmetal-poor systems with stochastic star formation. in dwarf spheroidal galaxiesin the local group, the decrease of [\alpha/fe] ratios at [fe/h] ~ -2 to -1.5can be produced depending on the star formation history. sne iax give high[mn/fe], while sub-ch-mass sne ia give low [mn/fe], and thus a model includinga mix of the two is favoured by the available observations.

1504.06035	hydrodynamical evolution of merging carbon-oxygen white dwarfs: their  pre-supernova structure and observational counterparts	we perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations for mergingbinary carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) with masses of $1.1$ and $1.0$$m_\odot$, until the merger remnant reaches a dynamically steady state. usingthese results, we assess whether the binary could induce a thermonuclearexplosion, and whether the explosion could be observed as a type ia supernova(sn ia). we investigate three explosion mechanisms: a helium-ignition followingthe dynamical merger (`helium-ignited violent merger model'), a carbon-ignition(`carbon-ignited violent merger model'), and an explosion following theformation of the chandrasekhar mass wd (`chandrasekhar mass model'). anexplosion of the helium-ignited violent merger model is possible, while wepredict that the resulting sn ejecta are highly asymmetric since its companionstar is fully intact at the time of the explosion. the carbon-ignited violentmerger model can also lead to an explosion. however, the envelope of theexploding wd spreads out to $\sim 0.1r_\odot$; it is much larger than thatinferred for sn 2011fe ($&lt; 0.1r_\odot $) while much smaller than that for sn2014j ($\sim 1r_\odot$). for the particular combination of the wd massesstudied in this work, the chandrasekhar mass model is not successful to lead toan sn ia explosion. besides these assessments, we investigate the evolution ofunbound materials ejected through the merging process (`merger ejecta'),assuming a case where the sn ia explosion is not triggered by the helium- orcarbon-ignition during the merger. the merger ejecta interact with thesurrounding interstellar medium, and form a shell. the shell has a bolometricluminosity of more than $2 \times 10^{35}$ ergs$^{-1}$ lasting for $\sim 2\times 10^4$ yr. if this is the case, milky way should harbor about $10$ suchshells at any given time.

1505.01646	a systematic study of carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers: mass  combinations for type ia supernovae	mergers of two carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) have been considered asprogenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia). based on smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) simulations, previous studies claimed that mergers of cowds lead to an sn ia explosion either in the dynamical merger phase orstationary rotating merger remnant phase. however, the mass range of co wdsthat lead to an sn ia has not been clearly identified yet. in the present work,we perform systematic sph merger simulations for the wd masses ranging from$0.5~m_{\odot}$ to $1.1~m_{\odot}$ with higher resolutions than the previoussystematic surveys and examine whether or not carbon burning occurs dynamicallyor quiescently in each phase. we further study the possibility of sn iaexplosion and estimate the mass range of co wds that lead to an sn ia. we foundthat when the both wds are massive, i.e., in the mass range of $0.9~m_{\odot}{\le} m_{1,2} {\le} 1.1~m_{\odot}$, they can explode as an sn ia in the mergerphase. on the other hand, when the more massive wd is in the range of$0.7~m_{\odot} {\le} m_{1} {\le} 0.9~m_{\odot}$ and the total mass exceeds$1.38~m_{\odot}$, they can finally explode in the stationary rotating mergerremnant phase. we estimate the contribution of co wd mergers to the entire snia rate in our galaxy to be of ${\lt} 9\%$. so, it might be difficult toexplain all galactic sne ia by co wd mergers.

0805.2102	the delay time distribution of type ia supernovae and the single  degenerate model	we present a theoretical delay time distribution (dtd) of type ia supernovaeon the basis of our new evolutionary models of single degenerate (sd)progenitor systems. our model dtd has almost a featureless power law shape(\propto t^{-n} with n \approx 1) for the delay time from t \sim 0.1 to 10 gyr.this is in good agreement with the recent direct measurement of dtd. theobserved featureless property of the dtd has been suggested to be favorable forthe double degenerate (dd) scenario but not for the sd scenario. if the massrange of the companion star to the white dwarf (wd) were too narrow in the sdmodel, its dtd would be too limited around the companion's main-sequencelifetime to be consistent with the observed dtd. however, this is not the casein our sd model that consists of the two channels of wd + rg (red giant) and wd+ ms (main-sequence star). in these channels, the companion stars have a massrange of \sim 0.9-3 m_\sun (wd+rg) and \sim 2- 6 m_\sun (wd+ms). the combinedmass range is wide enough to yield the featureless dtd. we emphasize that thesd scenario should include two important processes: the optically thick windsfrom the mass-accreting wd and the mass-stripping from the companion star bythe wd wind.

1508.01921	final evolution and delayed explosions of spinning white dwarfs in  single degenerate models for type ia supernovae	we study the occurrence of delayed sne~ia in the single degenerate (sd)scenario. we assume that a massive carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarf (wd) accretesmatter coming from a companion star, making it to spin at the critical rate. weassume uniform rotation due to magnetic field coupling. the carbon ignitionmass for non-rotating wds is m_{ig}^{nr} \approx 1.38 m_{\odot}; while for thecase of uniformly rotating wds it is a few percent larger (m_{ig}^{r} \approx1.43 m_{\odot}). when accretion rate decreases, the wd begins to lose angularmomentum, shrinks, and spins up; however, it does not overflow its criticalrotation rate, avoiding mass shedding. thus, angular momentum losses can leadthe co wd interior to compression and carbon ignition, which would induce ansn~ia. the delay, largely due to the angular momentum losses timescale, may belarge enough to allow the companion star to evolve to a he wd, becomingundetectable at the moment of explosion. this scenario supports the occurrenceof delayed sne~ia if the final co wd mass is 1.38 m_{\odot} &lt; m &lt; 1.43m_{\odot}. we also find that if the delay is longer than ~3 gyr, the wd wouldbecome too cold to explode, rather undergoing collapse.

1510.00834	type i superluminous supernovae as explosions inside non-hydrogen  circumstellar envelopes	a number of type i (hydrogenless) superluminous supernova (slsn) events havebeen discovered recently. however, their nature remains debatable. one of themost promising ideas is the shock-interaction mechanism, but only simplifiedsemi-analytical models have been applied so far. we simulate light curves forseveral type~i slsn (slsn-i) models enshrouded by dense, non-hydrogencircumstellar envelopes, using a multi-group radiation hydrodynamics code thatpredicts not only bolometric, but also multicolor light curves. we demonstratethat the bulk of slsne-i including those with relatively narrow light curveslike sn~2010gx or broad ones like ptf09cnd can be explained by the interactionof the sn ejecta with circumstellar matter (csm), though the range ofparameters for these models is rather wide. moderate explosion energy ($\sim (2- 4)\cdot 10^{51}$~ergs) is sufficient to explain both narrow and broad slsn-ilight curves, but ejected mass and envelope mass differ for those two cases.only 5 to 10 $m_\odot$ of carbon and oxygen is needed to reproduce the lightcurve of sn~2010gx, while the best fit for the light curve of ptf09cndcorresponds to the model with almost $ 55 m_\odot $ situated mostly in theenvelope. the radius of the envelope in each case is $\sim 10^{16} $~cm. webriefly discuss possible ways to form such csm envelopes.

0808.0138	subaru and keck observations of the peculiar type ia supernova 2006gz at  late phases	recently, a few peculiar type ia supernovae (sne) that show exceptionallylarge peak luminosity have been discovered. their luminosity requires more than1 msun of 56ni ejected during the explosion, suggesting that they might haveoriginated from super-chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. however, the nature ofthese objects is not yet well understood. in particular, no data have beentaken at late phases, about one year after the explosion. we report on subaruand keck optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the sn ia2006gz, which had been classified as being one of these "overluminous" sne ia.the late-time behavior is distinctly different from that of normal sne ia,reinforcing the argument that sn 2006gz belongs to a different subclass thannormal sne ia. however, the peculiar features found at late times are notreadily connected to a large amount of 56ni; the sn is faint, and it lacks [feii] and [fe iii] emission. if the bulk of the radioactive energy escapes the snejecta as visual light, as is the case in normal sne ia, the mass of 56ni doesnot exceed ~ 0.3 msun. we discuss several possibilities to remedy the problem.with the limited observations, however, we are unable to conclusively identifywhich process is responsible. an interesting possibility is that the bulk ofthe emission might be shifted to longer wavelengths, unlike the case in othersne ia, which might be related to dense c-rich regions as indicated by theearly-phase data. alternatively, it might be the case that sn 2006gz, thoughpeculiar, was actually not substantially overluminous at early times.

astro-ph;0001333	numerical simulations of globular cluster formation	we examine various physical processes associated with the formation ofglobular clusters by using the three-dimensional smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) code. our code includes radiative cooling of gases, starformation, energy feedback from stars including stellar winds and supernovae,and chemical enrichment by stars. we assume that, in the collapsing galaxy,isothermal cold clouds form through thermal condensations and becomeproto-globular clouds. we calculate the size of proto-globular clouds bysolving the linearized equations for perturbation. we compute the evolution ofthe inner region of the proto-cloud with our sph code for various initialradius and initial composition of gases. when the initial gases contain noheavy elements, the evolution of proto-clouds sensitively depends on theinitial radius. for a smaller initial radius, the initial star burst is sointense that the subsequent star formation occurs in the central regions toform a dense star cluster as massive as the globular cluster. when the initialgases contain some heavy elements, the metallicity of gases affects theevolution and the final stellar mass. if the initial radius of theproto-globular clouds was relatively large, the formation of a star cluster asmassive as the globular clusters requires the initial metallicity as high as[fe/h] $\geq -2$. the self-enrichment of heavy elements in the star clusterdoes not occur in all cases.

astro-ph;0001464	the role of electron captures in chandrasekhar mass models for type ia  supernovae	the chandrasekhar mass model for type ia supernovae (sne ia) has receivedincreasing support from recent comparisons of observations with light curvepredictions and modeling of synthetic spectra. it explains sn ia events viathermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs in binary stellar systems,being caused by central carbon ignition when the white dwarf approaches thechandrasekhar mass. as the electron gas in white dwarfs is degenerate,characterized by high fermi energies for the high density regions in thecenter, electron capture on intermediate mass and fe-group nuclei plays animportant role in explosive burning. electron capture affects the centralelectron fraction y_e, which determines the composition of the ejecta from suchexplosions. up to the present, astrophysical tabulations based on shell modelmatrix elements were only available for light nuclei in the sd-shell. recentlynew shell model monte carlo (smmc) and large-scale shell model diagonalizationcalculations have also been performed for pf-shell nuclei. these lead ingeneral to a reduction of electron capture rates in comparison with previous,more phenomenological, approaches. making use of these new shell model basedrates, we present the first results for the composition of fe-group nucleiproduced in the central regions of sne ia and possible changes in theconstraints on model parameters like ignition densities and burning frontspeeds.

astro-ph;0003134	type ia supernovae: progenitors and evolution with redshift	relatively uniform light curves and spectral evolution of type ia supernovae(sne ia) have led to the use of sne ia as a ``standard candle'' to determinecosmological parameters. whether a statistically significant value of thecosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminositiesof sne ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galacticevolutions.  here we first review the single degenerate scenario for the chandrasekharmass white dwarf (wd) models of sne ia. we identify the progenitor's evolutionand population with two channels: (1) the wd+rg (red-giant) and (2) the wd+ms(near main-sequence he-rich star) channels. in these channels, the strong windfrom accreting wds plays a key role, which yields important age and metallicityeffects on the evolution.  we then address the questions whether the nature of sne ia dependssystematically on environmental properties such as metallicity and age of theprogenitor system and whether significant evolutionary effects exist. wesuggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $x$(c) in the c+o wd (orthe variation of the initial wd mass) causes the diversity of the brightness ofsne ia. this model can explain the observed dependences of sne ia brightness onthe galaxy types and the distance from the galactic center.  finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of sn iaprogenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as acomposite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.

astro-ph;0007222	a spectroscopic analysis of the energetic type ic `hypernova' sn 1997ef	the properties of the bright and energetic type ic sn 1997ef are investigatedusing a monte carlo spectrum synthesis code. analysis of the earliest spectrais used to determine the time of outburst. the changing features of thespectrum and the light curve are used to probe the ejecta and to determinetheir composition, verifying the results of explosion calculations. sincesynthetic spectra computed using our best explosion model co100 are onlymoderately good reproductions of the observations, the inverse approach isadopted, and a density structure is derived by demanding that it gives the bestpossible fit to the observed spectrum at every epoch analysed. it is found thatthe density structure of model co100 is adequate at intermediate velocities(5000--25000 km/s), but that a slower density decline ($\rho \propto r^{-4}$)is required to obtain the extensive line blending at high velocities(25000--50000 km/s). the `best fit' density distribution results in somewhatdifferent parameters for the sn, namely an ejecta mass of 9.6$m_\odot$ and anexplosion kinetic energy of 1.75 x 10^{52} erg. the modified density structureis used to compute a synthetic light curve, which is found to agree very wellwith the observed bolometric light curve around maximum. the amount ofradioactive $^{56}$ni produced by the sn is confirmed at 0.13$m_\odot$. in thecontext of an axisymmetric explosion, a somewhat smaller kinetic energy thanthat of sn 1998bw may have resulted from the non alignment of the symmetry axisof the sn and the line of sight. this might also explain the lack of evidencefor a gamma ray burst correlated with sn 1997ef.

astro-ph;0009490	can differences in the nickel abundance in chandrasekhar mass models  explain the relation between brightness and decline rate of normal type ia  supernovae?	the use of type ia supernovae as distance indicators relies on thedetermination of their brightness. this is not constant, but it can becalibrated using an observed relation between the brightness and the propertiesof the optical light curve (decline rate, width, shape), which indicates thatbrighter sne have broader, slower light curves. however, the physical basis forthis relation is not yet fully understood. among possible causes are differentmasses of the progenitor white dwarfs or different opacities inchandrasekhar-mass explosions. we parametrise the chandrasekhar-mass modelspresented by iwamoto et al (1999), which synthesize different amounts of ni,and compute bolometric light curves and spectra at various epochs. sinceopacity in sne ia is due mostly to spectral lines, it should depend on the massof fe-peak elements synthesized in the explosion, and on the temperature in theejecta. bolometric light curves computed using these prescriptions for theoptical opacity reproduce the relation between brightness and decline rate.furthermore, when spectra are calculated, the change in colour between maximumand two weeks later allows the observed relation between m_b(max) anddm_{15}(b) to be reproduced quite nicely. spectra computed at various epochscompare well with corresponding spectra of spectroscopically normal sneiaselected to cover a similar range of dm_{15}(b) values.

astro-ph;0110528	hypernova nucleosynthesis and early chemical evolution	we review the characteristics of nucleosynthesis in 'hypernovae', i.e.,supernovae with very large explosion energies ($ \gsim 10^{52} $ ergs). thehypernova yields compared to those of ordinary core-collapse supernovae showthe following characteristics: 1) complete si-burning takes place in moreextended region, so that the mass ratio between the complete and incomplete siburning regions is generally larger in hypernovae than normal supernovae. as aresult, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(zn, co)/fe], smaller[(mn, cr)/fe], and larger [fe/o], which could explain the trend observed invery metal-poor stars. 2) si-burning takes place in lower density regions, sothat the effects of $\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced. thus $^{44}$ca,$^{48}$ti, and $^{64}$zn are produced more abundantly than in normalsupernovae. the large [(ti, zn)/fe] ratios observed in very metal-poor starsstrongly suggest a significant contribution of hypernovae. 3) oxygen burningalso takes place in more extended regions for the larger explosion energy. thena larger amount of si, s, ar, and ca ("si") are synthesized, which makes the"si"/o ratio larger. the abundance pattern of the starburst galaxy m82 may beattributed to hypernova explosions. asphericity in the explosions strengthensthe nucleosynthesis properties of hypernovae except for "si"/o. we thus suggestthat hypernovae make important contribution to the early galactic (and cosmic)chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0301315	first-generation black-hole-forming supernovae and the metal abundance  pattern of a very iron-poor star	it has been proposed theoretically that the first generation of stars in theuniverse (population iii) would be as massive as 100 solar masses (100mo),because of inefficient cooling of the precursor gas clouds. recently, the mostiron-deficient (but still carbon-rich) low-mass star -- he0107-5240 -- wasdiscovered. if this is a population iii that gained its metals (elementsheavier than helium) after its formation, it would challenge the theoreticalpicture of the formation of the first stars. here we report that the patternsof elemental abundance in he0107-5240 (and other extremely metal-poor stars)are in good accord with the nucleosynthesis that occurs in stars with masses of20-130mo when they become supernovae if, during the explosions, the ejectaundergo substantial mixing and fall-back to form massive black holes. suchsupernovae have been observed. the abundance patterns are not, however,consistent with enrichment by supernovae from stars in the range 130-300 mo. weaccordingly infer that the first-generation supernovae came mostly fromexplosions of ~ 20-130mo stars; some of these produced iron-poor but carbon-and oxygen-rich ejecta. low-mass second-generation stars, like he0107-5240,could form because the carbon and oxygen provided pathways for gas to cool.

astro-ph;0301404	3-d simulations of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galactic  bulge	a three-dimensional hydrodynamical n-body model for the formation of thegalaxy is presented with special attention to the formation of the bulgecomponent. starting with cosmologically motivated initial conditions, we obtaina qualitatively similar stellar system to the galaxy. then we analyze thechemical and kinematic properties of the bulge stars in our model and findqualitative agreement with observational data. the early evolution of our modelhas revealed that most bulge stars form during the sub-galactic merger (mergercomponent of the bulge stars). because of the strong star burst induced by themerger, the metallicity distribution function of such stars becomes as wide asobserved. we find that another group of the bulge stars forms later in theinner region of the disk (non-merger component of the bulge stars). because ofthe difference in the formation epoch, the main source of iron for this groupof stars is different from the merger component. iron in the merger andnon-merger components comes mainly from type ii and type ia supernovae,respectively. since a type ia supernova ejects $\sim$ 10 times more iron than atype ii supernova, [fe/h] of the non-merger component tends to be higher thanthat of the merger component, which widens the metallicity distributionfunction. from these results, we suggest that the galactic bulge consists oftwo chemically different components; one has formed quickly through thesub-galactic clump merger in the proto-galaxy and the other has formedgradually in the inner disk.

astro-ph;0603516	models for the type ic hypernova sn 2003lw associated with grb 031203	the gamma-ray burst 031203 at a redshift z=0.1055 revealed a highly reddenedtype ic supernova, sn 2003lw, in its afterglow light. this is the third wellestablished case of a link between a long-duration grb and a type ic sn. the snlight curve is obtained subtracting the galaxy contribution and is modelledtogether with two spectra at near-maximum epochs. a red vlt grism 150i spectrumof the sn near peak is used to extend the spectral coverage, and in particularto constrain the uncertain reddening, the most likely value for which ise_{g+h}(b-v) about 1.07 +/- 0.05. accounting for reddening, sn 2003lw is about0.3 mag brighter than the prototypical grb-sn 1998bw. light curve models yielda 56ni mass of about 0.55 solar mass. the optimal explosion model is somewhatmore massive (ejecta mass about 13 solar mass) and energetic (kinetic energyabout 6 times 10^52 erg) than the model for sn 1998bw, implying a massiveprogenitor (40 - 50 solar mass). the mass at high velocity is not very large(1.4 solar mass above 30000 km/s, but only 0.1 solar mass above 60000 km/s),but is sufficient to cause the observed broad lines. the similarity of sne2003lw and 1998bw and the weakness of their related grbs, grb031203 andgrb980425, suggest that both grbs may be normal events viewed slightly off-axisor a weaker but possibly more frequent type of grb.

astro-ph;0603567	a neutron-star-driven x-ray flash associated with supernova sn 2006aj	supernovae connected with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) arehyper-energetic explosion resulting from the collapse of very massive stars(about 40mo, where mo is the mass of the sun) stripped of their outher hydrogenand helium envelopes. a very massive progenitor, collapsing to a black hole,was thought to be a requirement for the launch of a grb. here we report theresults of modelling the spectra and light curve of sn 2006aj, whichdemonstrate that the supernova had a much smaller explosion energy and ejectedmuch less mass than the other grb-sueprnovae, suggesting that it was producedby a star whose initial mass was only about 20mo. a star of this mass isexpected to form a neutron star rather than a black hole when its corecollapses. the smaller explosion energy of sn 2006aj is matched by the weaknessand softness of grb 060218 (an x-ray flash), and the weakness of the radio fluxof the supernova. our results indicate that the supernova-grb connectionextends to a much broader range of stellar masses than previously thought,possibly involving different physical mechanisms: a `collapsar' for the moremassive stars collapsing to a black hole, and magnetic activity of the nascentneutron star for the less massive stars.

astro-ph;0605725	nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse supernovae and hypernovae, and  galactic chemical evolution	we present new nucleosynthesis yields as functions of the stellar mass,metallicity, and explosion energy (corresponding to normal supernovae andhypernovae). we apply the results to the chemical evolution of the solarneighborhood. our new yields are based on the new developments in theobservational/theoretical studies of supernovae (sne) and extremely metal-poor(emp) stars in the halo, which have provided excellent opportunities to testthe explosion models and their nucleosynthesis. we use the light curve andspectra fitting of individual sn to estimate the mass of the progenitor,explosion energy, and produced 56ni mass. comparison with the abundancepatterns of emp stars has made it possible to determine the model parameters ofcore-collapse sne, such as mixing-fallback parameters.  more specifically, we take into account the two distinct new classes ofmassive sne: 1) very energetic hypernovae, whose kinetic energy (ke) is morethan 10 times the ke of normal core-collapse sne, and 2) very faint and lowenergy sne (faint sne). these two new classes of sne are likely to be``black-hole-forming'' sne with rotating or non-rotating black holes.nucleosynthesis in hypernovae is characterized by larger abundance ratios(zn,co,v,ti)/fe and smaller (mn,cr)/fe than normal sne, which can explain theobserved trends of these ratios in emp stars. nucleosynthesis in faint sne ischaracterized by a large amount of fall-back, which explains the abundancepattern of the most fe-poor stars. these comparisons suggest thatblack-hole-forming sne made important contributions to the early galactic (andcosmic) chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0607015	chemical abundances in the secondary star of the black hole binary v4641  sagittarii (sax j1819.3-2525)	we report on detailed spectroscopic studies performed for the secondary starin the black hole binary (micro-quasar) v4641 sgr in order to examine itssurface chemical composition and to see if its surface shows any signature ofpollution by ejecta from a supernova explosion. high-resolution spectra ofv4641 sgr observed in the quiescent state in the blue-visual region arecompared with those of the two bright well-studied b9 stars (14 cyg and $\nu$cap) observed with the same instrument. the effective temperature of v4641 sgr(10500 $\pm$ 200 k) is estimated from the strengths of he~{\sc i} lines, whileits rotational velocity, $\it v$ sin $\it i$ (95 $\pm$ 10 km s${}^{-1}$), isestimated from the profile of the mg~{\sc ii} line at 4481 \aa. we obtainabundances of 10 elements and find definite over-abundances of n (by 0.8 dex ormore) and na (by 0.8 dex) in v4641 sgr. from line-by-line comparisons of eightother elements (c, o, mg, al, si, ti, cr, and fe) between v4641 sgr and the tworeference stars, we conclude that there is no apparent difference in theabundances of these elements between v4641 sgr and the two normal late b-typestars, which have been reported to have solar abundances. an evolutionary modelof a massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the abundancesobserved in v4641 sgr. the model suggests that the progenitor of the black holeforming supernova was as massive as ~ 35 msun on the main-sequence and, afterbecoming a ~ 10 msun he star, underwent "dark" explosion which ejected only nand na-rich outer layer of the he star without radioactive $^{56}$ni.

astro-ph;0701381	supernova nucleosynthesis in population iii 13 -- 50 $m_{\odot}$ stars  and abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars	we perform hydrodynamical and nucleosynthesis calculations of core-collapsesupernovae (sne) and hypernovae (hne) of population (pop) iii stars. we providenew yields for the main-sequence mass of $m_{\rm ms}=13-50$ $m_{\odot}$ and theexplosion energy of $e=1-40\times10^{51}$ ergs to apply for chemical evolutionstudies. our hn yields based on the mixing-fallback model of explosionsreproduce the observed abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor (emp) stars($-4&lt; {\rm [fe/h]}&lt; -3$), while those of very metal-poor (vmp) stars ($-3&lt;{\rm[fe/h]} &lt; -2$) are reproduced by the normal sn yields integrated over thesalpeter initial mass function. moreover, the observed trends of abundanceratios [x/fe] against [fe/h] with small dispersions for the emp stars can bereproduced as a sequence resulting from the various combination of $m_{\rm ms}$and $e$. this is because we adopt the empirical relation that a larger amountof fe is ejected by more massive hne. our results imply that the observedtrends with small dispersions do not necessarily mean the rapid homogeneousmixing in the early galactic halo at [fe/h] $&lt; -3$, but can be reproduced bythe ``inhomogeneous'' chemical evolution model. in addition, we examine how themodifications of the distributions of the electron mole fraction $y_{\rm e}$and the density in the presupernova models improve the agreement withobservations. in this connection, we discuss possible contributions ofnucleosynthesis in the neutrino-driven wind and the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0702471	the connection between gamma-ray bursts and extremely metal-poor stars:  black hole-forming supernovae with relativistic jets	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are thought to be connected to luminousand energetic supernovae (sne), called hypernovae (hne), resulting from theblack-hole (bh) forming collapse of massive stars. for recent nearbygrbs~060505 and 060614, however, the expected sne have not been detected. theupper limits to the sn brightness are about 100 times fainter thangrb-associated hne (grb-hne), corresponding to the upper limits to the ejected$^{56}$ni masses of $m({\rm ^{56}ni})\sim 10^{-3}m_\odot$. sne with a smallamount of $^{56}$ni ejection are observed as faint type ii sne. hne and faintsne are thought to be responsible for the formation of extremely metal-poor(emp) stars. in this letter, a relativistic jet-induced bh forming explosion ofthe 40 $m_\odot$ star is investigated and hydrodynamic and nucleosyntheticmodels are presented. these models can explain both grb-hne and grbs withoutbright sne in a unified manner. their connection to emp stars is alsodiscussed. we suggest that grbs without bright sne are likely to synthesize$\mni\sim 10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}m_\odot$ or $\sim 10^{-6}m_\odot$.

astro-ph;9601032	nuclear and gamma-ray production by supernova ejecta	the fastest ejecta of supernova explosions propagate as a precursor to themain supernova shock wave, and can be quite energetic. the spectrum of suchfast ejecta is estimated based on recent analytic and numerical supernovamodels, and found to be a power law having a cutoff at an energy of order 10mev/nucl, the precise value of which depends on the supernova mass andenergetics. with cutoffs in this range there can be significant flux withenergies above the thresholds for $\gamma$-ray and li, be, and b production.these nuclear interactions should inevitably accompany the passage of promptsupernova ejecta through the surrounding medium. the fast particle compositionis that of the outermost layers of the progenitor; if the progenitorexperienced significant loss of its envelope to a companion or by mass loss,then the composition is nonsolar, and in particular, metal-rich. such acomposition and spectrum of fast particles is required to explain the recentcomptel observations of $\gamma$-ray emission in orion. supernova ejecta fromone progenitor having lost a large amount of mass are shown to quantitativelyaccount for the orion $\gamma$ rays, and to imply the presence of other, weakerlines and of a supernova explosion in orion in the last $\la 10^4$ years.implications for this mechanism as a mode of nucleosynthesis, and as apotential supernova diagnostic, are discussed. model dependences anduncertainties are noted, and the need is shown for accurate measurements of$\gamma$-ray and spallation production cross sections at energies nearthreshold.

astro-ph;9702205	a new approach to determine the initial mass function in the solar  neighborhood	oxygen to iron abundance ratios of metal-poor stars provide information onnucleosynthesis yields from massive stars which end in type ii supernovaexplosions. using a standard model of chemical evolution of the galaxy we havereproduced the solar neighborhood abundance data and estimated the oxygen andiron yields of genuine sn ii origin. the estimated yields are compared with thetheoretical yields to derive the relation between the lower and upper masslimits in each generation of stars and the imf slope. independently of thisrelation, we furthermore derive the relation between the lower mass limit andthe imf slope from the stellar mass to light ratio in the solar neighborhood.these independent relations unambiguously determine the upper mass limit of$m_u=50 \pm 10 m_sun$ and the imf slope index of 1.3 - 1.6 above 1 m_sun. thisupper mass limit corresponds to the mass beyond which stars end as black holeswithout ejecting processed matter into the interstellar medium. we also findthat the imf slope index below 0.5 m_sun cannot be much shallower than 0.8.

astro-ph;9806336	evolution of 3-9 mo stars for z=0.001 - 0.03 and metallicity effects on  type ia supernovae	recent observations have revealed that type ia supernovae (sne ia) are notperfect standard candles but show some variations in their absolute magnitudes,light curve shapes, and spectra. the c/o ratio in the sne ia progenitors (c-owhite dwarfs) may be related to this variation. in this work, we systematicallyinvestigate the effects of stellar mass (m) and metallicity (z) on the c/oratio and its distribution in the c-o white dwarfs by calculating stellarevolution from the main-sequence through the end of the second dredge-up form=3-9 mo and z=0.001-0.03. we find that the total carbon mass fraction justbefore sn ia explosion varies in the range 0.36 -- 0.5. we also calculate themetallicity dependence of the main-sequence-mass range of the sn ia progenitorwhite dwarfs. our results show that the maximum main-sequence mass to form c-owhite dwarfs decreases significantly toward lower metallicity, and the numberof sn ia progenitors may be underestimated if metallicity effectis neglected.we discuss the implications of these results on the variation of sne ia,determination of cosmological parameters, luminosity function of white dwarfs,and the galactic chemical evolution.

astro-ph;9809307	nucleosynthesis in type ii supernovae and the abundances in metal-poor  stars	we explore the effects on nucleosynthesis in type ii supernovae of variousparameters (mass cut, neutron excess, explosion energy, progenitor mass) inorder to explain the observed trends of the iron-peak element abundance ratios([cr/fe], [mn/fe], [co/fe] and [ni/fe]) in halo stars as a function ofmetallicity for the range $ -4 \le$ [fe/h] $\le -2.5$. [cr/fe] and [mn/fe]decrease with decreasing [fe/h], while [co/fe] behaves the opposite way andincreases. we show that such a behavior can be explained by a variation of masscuts in type ii supernovae as a function of progenitor mass, which provides achanging mix of nucleosynthesis from an alpha-rich freeze-out of si-burning andincomplete si-burning. this explanation is consistent with the amount ofejected $^{56}$ni determined from modeling the early light curves of individualsupernovae. we also suggest that the ratio [h/fe] of halo stars is mainlydetermined by the mass of interstellar hydrogen mixed with the ejecta of asingle supernova which is larger for larger explosion energy and the largerstr\"omgren radius of the progenitor.

astro-ph;9810422	the earliest phases of galaxy evolution	in this paper we study the very early phases of the evolution of our galaxyby means of a chemical evolution model which reproduces most of theobservational constraints in the solar vicinity and in the disk. we haverestricted our analysis to the solar neighborhood and present the predictedabundances of several elements (c, n, o, mg, si, s, ca, fe) over an extendedrange of metallicities $[fe/h] = -4.0$ to $[fe/h] = 0.0$ compared to previousmodels. we adopted the most recent yield calculations for massive stars takenfrom different authors (woosley &amp; weaver 1995 and thielemann et al. 1996) andcompared the results with a very large sample of data, one of the largest everused to this purpose. these data have been analysed with a new and powerfulstatistical method which allows us to quantify the observational spread inmeasured elemental abundances and obtain a more meaningful comparison with thepredictions from our chemical evolution model. our analysis shows that the``plateau'' observed for the [$\alpha$/fe] ratios at low metallicities ($-3.0&lt;[fe/h] &lt;-1.0$) is not perfectly constant but it shows a slope, especially foroxygen. this slope is very well reproduced by our model with both sets ofyields. this is not surprising since realistic chemical evolution models,taking into account in detail stellar lifetimes, never predicted a completelyflat plateau. this is due either to the fact that massive stars of differentmass produce a slightly different o/fe ratio or to the often forgotten factthat supernovae of type ia, originating from white dwarfs, start appearingalready at a galactic age of 30 million years and reach their maximum at 1 gyr.

astro-ph;9812282	dissipative process as a mechanism of differentiating internal  structures between dwarf and normal elliptical galaxies in a cdm universe	we simulate the dynamical, chemical, and spectro-photometric evolution ofdwarf and normal elliptical galaxies embedded in a dark matter halo, using athree-dimensional n-body/sph simulation code. for the forming dwarf ellipticalgalaxies, supernova-driven winds propagating outwards from inside the systemcollide with the infalling gas and produce the super-shell in which stars areformed. the resulting stellar system forms a loosely bound virialized systemdue to the significant mass loss and has a large velocity dispersion and alarge core. consequently the surface brightness distribution shows anexponential profile and the color distribution shows a positive gradient suchthat the colors become redder away from the galaxy center in agreement withobservations. on the other hand, for the normal elliptical galaxies with deepgravitational potential, the mass loss out of the system does not have asignificant dynamical effect on the stellar system. the resulting surfacebrightness distribution has a large central concentration like de vaucouleurs'$r^{1/4}$-profile and the color distribution shows a negative gradient asobserved. our simulation shows that different features between dwarf and normalelliptical galaxies stem from different cooling efficiencies for theirrespective protogalaxies in a standard cdm universe.

astro-ph;9902303	a new evolutionary path to type ia supernovae: helium-rich super-soft  x-ray source channel	we have found a new evolutionary path to type ia supernovae (sne ia) whichhas been overlooked in previous work. in this scenario, a carbon-oxygen whitedwarf (c+o wd) is originated, not from an asymptotic giant branch star with ac+o core, but from a red-giant star with a helium core of $\sim 0.8-2.0m_\odot$. the helium star, which is formed after the first common envelopeevolution, evolves to form a c+o wd of $\sim 0.8-1.1 m_\odot$ with transferringa part of the helium envelope onto the secondary main-sequence star. this newevolutionary path, together with the optically thick wind from mass-accretingwhite dwarf, provides a much wider channel to sne ia than previous scenarios. apart of the progenitor systems are identified as the luminous supersoft x-raysources or the recurrent novae like u sco, which are characterized by theaccretion of helium-rich matter. the white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich,helium-enhanced matter from a lobe-filling, slightly evolved companion at acritical rate and blows excess matter in the wind. the white dwarf grows inmass to the chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes as an sn ia. a theoreticalestimate indicates that this channel contributes a considerable part of theinferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy, i.e., the rate is about ten times largerthan the previous theoretical estimates for white dwarfs with slightly evolvedcompanions.

astro-ph;9902304	a wide symbiotic channel to type ia supernovae	as a promising channel to type ia supernovae (sne ia), we have proposed asymbiotic binary system consisting of a white dwarf (wd) and a low massred-giant (rg), where strong winds from the accreting wd play a key role toincrease the wd mass to the chandrasekhar mass limit. here we propose two newevolutionary processes which make the symbiotic channel to sne ia much wider.(1) we first show that the wd + rg close binary can form from a wide binaryeven with such a large initial separation as $a_i \lesssim 40000 r_\odot$. sucha binary consists of an agb star and a low mass main-sequence (ms) star, wherethe agb star is undergoing superwind before becoming a wd. if the superwind atthe end of agb evolution is as fast as or slower than the orbital velocity, thewind outflowing from the system takes away the orbital angular momentumeffectively. as a result the wide binary shrinks greatly to become a closebinary. therefore, the wd + rg binary can form from much wider binaries thanour earlier estimate. (2) when the rg fills its inner critical roche lobe, thewd undergoes rapid mass accretion and blows a strong optically thick wind. ourearlier analysis has shown that the mass transfer is stabilized by this windonly when the mass ratio of rg/wd is smaller than 1.15. our new finding is thatthe wd wind can strip mass from the rg envelope, which could be efficientenough to stabilize the mass transfer even if the rg/wd mass ratio exceeds1.15. with the above two new effects (1) and (2), the symbiotic channel canaccount for the inferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy.

astro-ph;9907386	type ia supernova progenitors, environmental effects, and cosmic  supernova rates	relatively uniform light curves and spectral evolution of type ia supernovae(sne ia) have led to the use of sne ia as a ``standard candle'' to determinecosmological parameters, such as the hubble constant, the density parameter,and the cosmological constant. whether a statistically significant value of thecosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminositiesof sne ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galacticevolutions. here we first review the single degenerate scenario for thechandrasekhar mass white dwarf (wd) models of sne ia. we identify theprogenitor's evolution and population with two channels: (1) the wd+rg(red-giant) and (2) the wd+ms (near main-sequence he-rich star) channels. inthese channels, the strong wind from accreting white dwarfs plays a key role,which yields important age and metallicity effects on the evolution. we thenaddress the questions whether the nature of sne ia depends systematically onenvironmental properties such as metallicity and age of the progenitor systemand whether significant evolutionary effects exist. we suggest that thevariation of the carbon mass fraction $x$(c) in the c+o wd (or the variation ofthe initial wd mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of sne ia. thismodel can explain the observed dependence of sne ia brighness on the galaxytypes. finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of sn iaprogenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as acomposite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.

astro-ph;9908005	the history of the comic supernova rate derived from the evolution of  the host galaxies	we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a composite ofthe supernova rates in spiral and elliptical galaxies. we include themetallicity effect on the evolution of type ia supernova (sn ia) progenitors,and construct detailed models for the evolutions of spiral and ellipticalgalaxies in clusters and field to meet the latest observational constraints. inthe cluster environment, the synthesized cosmic star formation rate (sfr) hasan excess at $z \gtsim 3$ corresponding to the early star burst in ellipticalsand a shallower slope from the present to the peak at the redshift of $z \sim1.4$ compared with madau's plot. in the field environment, we assume thatellipticals form over a wide range of redshifts as $1 \ltsim z \ltsim 4$. thesynthesized cosmic sfr has a broad peak around $z \sim 3$, which is in goodagreement with the observed one. the resultant cosmic sfrs lead to thefollowing predictions for the cosmic sn ia rate: 1) the sn ia rate in spiralshas a break at $z \sim 2$ due to the low-metallicity inhibition of sne ia,regardless of clusters or field. 2) at high redshifts, the sn ia rate has astrong peak around $z \sim 3$ in clusters, whereas in field much lower rate isexpected, reflecting the difference in the formation epochs of ellipticals.

astro-ph;9912248	evolution and nucleosynthesis of metal-free massive stars	we calculate presupernova evolutions and supernova explosions of massivestars (m=13-25 mo) for various metallicities. we find the followingcharacteristic abundance patterns of nucleosynthesis in the metal-free (popiii) stars. (1) the alpha-nuclei (from c to zn) are more efficiently producedthan other isotopes, and the abundance pattern of alpha-nuclei can be similarto the solar abundance. in particular, near solar ratios of alpha elements/femight be a signature of pop iii which could produce a large amount of fe. (2)the abundance ratios of odd z to even z elements such as na/mg and al/mg becomesmaller for lower metallicity. however, these ratios almost saturate below z &lt;~10^{-5}, and [na, al/mg] ~ - 1 for pop iii and low metal pop iinucleosynthesis. this result is consistent with abundance pattern of metal poorstars, in which these ratios also saturate around -1. we suggest that thesestars with the lowest [na/mg] or [al/mg] may contain the abundance pattern ofpop iii nucleosynthesis. (3) metal poor stars show interesting trends in theratios of [cr, mn, co/fe]. we discuss that these trends are not explained bythe differences in metallicity, but by the relative thickness between thecomplete and the incomplete si burning layers. large [co/fe] and small [cr,mn/fe] values found in the observations are explained if mass cut is deep or ifmatter is ejected from complete si burning layer in a form of a jet or bullets.(4) we also find that primary ^{14}n production occurs in the massive pop iiistars, because these stars have radiative h-rich envelopes so that theconvective layer in the he-shell burning region can reach the h-rich region.

0706.0383	evolution of dust in primordial supernova remnants: can dust grains  formed in the ejecta survive and be injected into the early interstellar  medium?	we investigate the evolution of dust that formed at population iii supernova(sn) explosions and its processing through the collisions with the reverseshocks resulting from the interaction of the sn ejecta with the ambient medium.in particular, we investigate the transport of the shocked dust within the snremnant (snr), and its effect on the chemical composition, the sizedistribution, and the total mass of dust surviving in snr. we find that theevolution of the reverse shock, and hence its effect on the processing of thedust depends on the thickness of the envelope retained by the progenitor star.furthermore, the transport and survival of the dust grains depend on theirinitial radius, a_{ini}, and composition: for type ii snrs expanding into theinterstellar medium (ism) with a density of n_{h,0}=1 cm^{-3}, small grainswith a_{ini} &lt; ~ 0.05 micron are completely destroyed by sputtering in thepostshock flow, while grains with a_{ini}= 0.05--0.2 micron are trapped intothe dense shell behind the forward shock. very large grains of a_{ini} &gt; ~ 0.2micron are ejected into the ism without decreasing their sizes significantly.we find that the total mass fraction of dust that is destroyed by the reverseshock ranges from 0.2 to 1.0, depending on the energy of the explosion and thedensity of the ambient ism. the results of our calculations have significantimpact on the abundance pattern of subsequent generation of stars that form inthe dense shell of primordial snrs.
