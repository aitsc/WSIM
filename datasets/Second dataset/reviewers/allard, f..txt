1001.0470	near-infrared integral-field spectra of the planet/brown dwarf companion  ab pic b	chauvin et al. 2005 imaged a co-moving companion at ~260 au from the youngstar ab pic a. evolutionary models predictions based on j h k photometry of abpic b suggested a mass of ~13 - 14 mjup, placing the object at thedeuterium-burning boundary. we used the adaptive-optics-fed integral fieldspectrograph sinfoni to obtain high quality medium-resolution spectra of ab picb (r = 1500-2000) over the 1.1 - 2.5 microns range. our analysis relies on thecomparison of our spectra to young standard templates and to the latestlibraries of synthetic spectra developed by the lyon's group. ab pic b isconfirmed to be a young early-l dwarf companion. we derive a spectral typel0-l1 and find several features indicative of intermediate gravity atmosphere.a comparison to synthetic spectra yields teff = 2000+100-300 k and log(g) = 4+- 0.5 dex. the determination of the derived atmospheric parameters of ab pic bis limited by a non-perfect match of current atmosphere spectra with ournear-infrared observations of ab pic b. the current treatment of dust settlingand missing molecular opacity lines in the atmosphere models could beresponsible. by combining the observed photometry, the surface fluxes fromatmosphere models and the known distance of the system, we derive new mass,luminosity and radius estimates of ab pic b. they confirm independently theevolutionary model predictions. we finally review the current methods used tocharacterize planetary mass companions and discuss them in the perspective offuture planet deep imaging surveys.

0708.0655	a very cool brown dwarf in ukidss dr1	(abridged) we report the discovery of a very cool brown dwarf, ulasj003402.77-005206.7 (ulas j0034-00), identified in ukidss dr1. we provideoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry of the source, and twonear-infrared spectra. comparing the spectral energy distribution of ulasj0034-00 to that of the t8 brown dwarf 2mass j0415-09, the latest-type andcoolest well-studied brown dwarf to date, with teff~750 k, we find evidencethat ulas j0034-00 is significantly cooler. first, the measured values of thenear-infrared absorption spectral indices imply a later classification, oft8.5. second, the h-[4.49] colour provides an empirical estimate of thetemperature of 540&lt;teff&lt;660 k (+/-2sig range). third, the j- and h-band peaksare somewhat narrower in ulas j0034-00, and detailed comparison againstspectral models calibrated to 2mass j0415-09 yields an estimated temperaturelower by 60-120 k relative to 2mass j0415-09 i.e. 630&lt;teff&lt;690 k (+/-2sig), andlower gravity or higher metallicity according to the degenerate combination-0.5&lt;delta(log g-2[m/h])&lt;-0.25 (+/-2sig). combining these estimates, andconsidering systematics, it is likely the temperature lies in the range600&lt;teff&lt;700 k. despite the low inferred teff we find no evidence for strongabsorption by nh3 over the wavelength range 1.51-1.56 um. evolutionary modelsimply that the mass and age are in the ranges 15-36 m(jup) and 0.5-8 gyr,respectively. the measured proper motion, of (0.37+/-0.07)arcsec/yr, combinedwith the photometrically estimated distance of 14-22 pc, implies a tangentialvelocity of ~30 km/s. ulas j0034-00 is significantly bluer than 2mass j0415-09in y-j, so future searches should allow for the possibility that cooler tdwarfs are bluer still.

1011.5405	model atmospheres from very low mass stars to brown dwarfs	since the discovery of brown dwarfs in 1994, and the discovery of dust cloudformation in the latest very low mass stars (vlms) and brown dwarfs (bds) in1996, the most important challenge in modeling their atmospheres as become theunderstanding of cloud formation and advective mixing. for this purpose, wehave developed radiation hydrodynamic 2d model atmosphere simulations to studythe formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, andsedimentation across the m-l-t vlms to bds sequence (teff = 2800 k to 900 k,freytag et al. 2010). we discovered the formation of gravity waves as a drivingmechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and derived a rulefor the velocity field versus atmospheric depth and teff , which is relativelyinsensitive to gravity. this rule has been used in the construction of the newmodel atmosphere grid, bt-settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, thediffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function ofdepth. this new model grid of atmospheres and synthetic spectra hasbeencomputedfor100,000k&gt;teff &gt;400k,5.5&gt;logg&gt;-0.5,and[m/h]=+0.5to -1.5, and thereference solar abundances of asplund et al. (2009). we found that the newsolar abundances allow an improved (close to perfect) reproduction of thephoto- metric and spectroscopic vlms properties, and, for the first time, asmooth transition between stellar and substellar regimes -- unlike thetransition between the nextgen models from hauschildt et al. 1999a,b, and theames-dusty models from allard et al. 2001). in the bds regime, the bt-settlmodels propose an improved explanation for the m-l-t spectral transition. inthis paper, we therefore present the new bt-settl model atmosphere grid, whichexplains the entire transition from the stellar to planetary mass regimes.

1104.1526	the discovery of the t8.5 dwarf ugps j0521+3640	we have carried out a search for late-type t dwarfs in the ukidss galacticplane survey 6th data release. the search yielded two persuasive candidates,both of which have been confirmed as t dwarfs. the brightest, ugps j0521+3640has been assigned the spectral type t8.5 and appears to lie at a distance of7-9 pc. the fainter of the two, ugps j0652+0324, is classified as a t5.5 dwarf,and lies at an estimated distance of 28-37 pc. warm-spitzer observations inirac channels 1 and 2, taken as part of the glimpse360 legacy survey, areavailable for ugps j0521+3640 and we used these data with the near-infraredspectroscopy to estimate its properties. we find best fitting solar metallicitybt-settl models for teff = 600k and 650k and log g = 4.5 and 5.0. theseparameters suggest a mass of between 14 and 32 mjup for an age between 1 and 5gyr. the proximity of this very cool t dwarf, and its location in the galacticplane makes it an ideal candidate for high resolution adaptive optics imagingto search for cool companions.

1110.2694	metallicity of m dwarfs ii. a comparative study of photometric  metallicity scales	stellar parameters are not easily derived from m dwarf spectra, which aredominated by complex bands of diatomic and triatomic molecules and not welldescribed at the line by line level by atmospheric models. m dwarfmetallicities are therefore most commonly derived through less directtechniques. several recent publications propose calibrations that provide themetallicity of an m dwarf from its ks band absolute magnitude and its v-kscolor, but disagree at the \pm0.1 dex level. we compare these calibrations on asample of 23 m dwarfs, which we select as wide (&gt; 5 arcsec) companions of f-,g- or k- dwarfs with metallicities measured on a homogeneous scale, and whichwe require to have v band photometry measured to better than \sim0.03magnitude. we find that the schlaufman &amp; laughlin (2010) calibration has lowestoffsets and residuals against our sample, and use our improved statistics tomarginally refine that calibration. with more strictly selected photometry thanin previous studies, the dispersion around the calibration is well in excess ofthe [fe/h] and photometric uncertainties. this suggests that the origin of theremaining dispersion is astrophysical rather than observational.

1302.1160	the near-infrared spectral energy distribution of {\beta} pictoris b	a gas giant planet has previously been directly seen orbiting at 8-10 auwithin the debris disk of the ~12 myr old star {\beta} pictoris. the {\beta}pictoris system offers the rare opportunity to study the physical andatmospheric properties of an exoplanet placed on a wide orbit and to establishits formation scenario. we obtained j (1.265 {\mu}m), h (1.66 {\mu}m), and m'(4.78 {\mu}m) band angular differential imaging of the system between 2011 and2012. we detect the planetary companion in our four-epoch observations. weestimate j = 14.0 +- 0.3, h = 13.5 +- 0.2, and m' = 11.0 +- 0.3 mag. our newastrometry consolidates previous semi-major axis (sma=8-10 au) and excentricity(e &lt;= 0.15) estimates of the planet. these constraints, and those derived fromradial velocities of the star provides independent upper limits on the mass of{\beta} pictoris b of 12 and 15.5 mjup for semi-major axis of 9 and 10 au. thelocation of {\beta} pictoris b in color-magnitude diagrams suggests it hasspectroscopic properties similar to l0-l4 dwarfs. this enables to derivelog10(l/lsun) = -3.87 +- 0.08 for the companion. the analysis with 7phoenix-based atmospheric models reveals the planet has a dusty atmosphere withteff = 1700 +- 100 k and log g = 4.0+- 0.5. "hot-start" evolutionary modelsgive a new mass of 10+3-2 mjup from teff and 9+3-2 mjup from luminosity.predictions of "cold-start" models are inconsistent with independentconstraints on the planet mass.

1401.2901	a high resolution spectroscopic atlas of m subdwarfs - effective  temperature and metallicity	context. m subdwarfs are metal poor and cool stars. they are important probesof the old galactic populations. however, they remain elusive due to their lowluminosity. observational and modeling efforts are required to fully understandtheir physics and to investigate the effects of metallicity in their coolatmospheres.  aims. we perform a detailed study of a sample of subdwarfs to determine theirstellar parameters and constrain the stat-of-the art atmospheric models.  methods. we present uves/vlt high resolution spectra of three late-ksubdwarfs and 18 m subdwarfs. our atlas covers the optical region from 6400 aaup to the near infrared at 8900 aa. we show spectral details of coolatmospheres at very high resolution (r= 40 000) and compare with syntheticspectra computed from the recent bt-settl atmosphere models.  results. our comparison shows that molecular features (tio, vo, cah), andatomic features (fe i, ti i, na i, k i) are well fitted by current models. weproduce an effective temperature versus spectral type relation all over thesubdwarf spectral sequence. thanks to the high resolution of our spectra, weperform a detailed comparison of line profiles of individual elements such asfe i, ca ii, ti i, and are able to determine accurate metallicities of thesestars. these determinations contribute to calibrate the relation betweenmetallicity and molecular band strength indices from low-resolution spectra.  conclusions. this work shows that the new generation of models are able toreproduce various spectral features of m subdwarfs. working with these highresolution spectra allowed us to disentangle the atmospheric parameters(effective temperature, gravity, metallicity), which is not possible when usinglow resolution spectroscopy or photometry.

1402.1584	new constraints on the formation and settling of dust in the atmospheres  of young m and l dwarfs	we obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra of seven young m9.5-l3dwarfs classified in the optical. we aim to confirm the low surface gravity ofthe objects in the nir. we also test whether atmospheric models correctlyrepresent the formation and the settling of dust clouds in the atmosphere ofyoung late-m and l dwarfs. we used isaac at vlt to obtain the spectra of thetargets. we compared them to those of mature and young bd, and young late-typecompanions to nearby stars with known ages, in order to identify and studygravity-sensitive features. we computed spectral indices weakly sensitive tothe surface gravity to derive near-infrared spectral types. finally, we foundthe best fit between each spectrum and synthetic spectra from the bt-settl 2010and 2013 models. using the best fit, we derived the atmospheric parameters ofthe objects and identify which spectral characteristics the models do notreproduce. we confirmed that our objects are young bd and we found nir spectraltypes in agreement with the ones determined at optical wavelengths. thespectrum of the l2-gamma dwarf 2massj2322-6151 reproduces well the spectrum ofthe planetary mass companion 1rxs j1609-2105b. bt-settl models fit the spectraand the 1-5 $\mu$m sed of the l0-l3 dwarfs for temperatures between 1600-2000k. but the models fail to reproduce the shape of the h band, and the nir slopeof some of our targets. this fact, and the best fit solutions found withsuper-solar metallicity are indicative of a lack of dust, in particular at highaltitude, in the cloud models. the modeling of the vertical mixing and of thegrain growth will be revised in the next version of the bt-settl models. theserevisions may suppress the remaining non-reproducibilities.

1407.0595	physical parameter determinations of young ms. taking advantage of the  virtual observatory to compare methodologies	one of the very first steps astronomers working in stellar physics perform toadvance in their studies, is to determine the most common/relevant physicalparameters of the objects of study (effective temperature, bolometricluminosity, surface gravity, etc.). different methodologies exist depending onthe nature of the data, intrinsic properties of the objects, etc. one commonapproach is to compare the observational data with theoretical models passedthrough some simulator that will leave in the synthetic data the same imprintthan the observational data carries, and see what set of parameters reproducethe observations best. even in this case, depending on the kind of data theastronomer has, the methodology changes slightly. after parameters arepublished, the community tend to quote, praise and criticize them, sometimespaying little attention on whether the possible discrepancies come from thetheoretical models, the data themselves or just the methodology used in theanalysis. in this work we perform the simple, yet interesting, exercise ofcomparing the effective temperatures obtained via sed and more detailedspectral fittings (to the same grid of models), of a sample of well known andcharacterized young m-type objects members to different star forming regionsand show how differences in temperature of up to 350 k can be expected justfrom the difference in methodology/data used. on the other hand we show howthese differences are smaller for colder objects even when the complexity ofthe fit increases like for example introducing differential extinction. toperform this exercise we benefit greatly from the framework offered by thevirtual observatory.

1407.4001	physical and orbital properties of beta pictoris b	the intermediate-mass star beta pictoris is known to be surrounded by astructured edge-on debris disk within which a gas giant planet was discoveredorbiting at 8-10 au. the physical properties of beta pic b were previouslyinferred from broad and narrow-band 0.9-4.8 microns photometry. we usedcommissioning data of the gemini planet imager (gpi) to obtain new astrometryand a low-resolution (r=35-39) j-band (1.12-1.35 microns) spectrum of theplanet. we find that the planet has passed the quadrature. we constrain itssemi-major axis to $\leq$ 10 au (90 % prob.) with a peak at 8.9+0.4-0.6 au. thejoint fit of the planet astrometry and the most recent radial velocitymeasurements of the star yields a planet's dynamical mass $\leq$ 20 mjup(greater than 96 % prob.). the extracted spectrum of beta pic b is similar tothose of young l1-1.5+1 dwarfs. we use the spectral type estimate to revise theplanet luminosity to log(l/lsun)=-3.90+-0.07. the 0.9-4.8 microns photometryand spectrum are reproduced for teff=1650+-150 k and a log g lower than 4.7 dexby 12 grids of phoenix-based and lesia atmospheric models. if we adopt the mostrecent system age estimate (21+-4 myr), the bolometric luminosity and theconstraints on the dynamical mass of beta pic b are only reproduced by warm-and hot-start tracks with initial entropies si greater than 10.5 kb/baryon.such initial conditions may result from an inefficient accretion shock and/or aplanetesimal density at formation higher than in the classical core accretionmodel. considering a younger age for the system or a conservative formationtime for beta pic b does not change these conclusions.

astro-ph;0404101	the effect of evaporation on the evolution of close-in giant planets	we include the effect of evaporation in our evolutionary calculations ofclose-in giant planets, based on a recent model for thermal evaporation takinginto account the xuv flux of the parent star (lammer et al. 2003). our analysisleads to the existence of a critical mass for a given orbital distance $m_{\rmcrit}(a)$ below which the evaporation timescale becomes shorter than thethermal timescale of the planet. for planets with initial masses below $m_{\rmcrit}$, evaporation leads to a rapid expansion of the outer layers and of thetotal planetary radius, speeding up the evaporation process. consequently, theplanet does not survive as long as estimated by a simple application of massloss rates without following consistently its evolution. we find out that thetransit planet hd 209458b might be in such a dramatic phase, although with anextremely small probability. as a consequence, we predict that, after a certaintime, only planets above a value $m_{\rm crit}(a)$ should be present at anorbital distance $a$ of a star. for planets with initial masses above $m_{\rmcrit}$, evaporation does not affect the evolution of the radius with time.

astro-ph;0405111	first determination of the dynamical mass of a binary l dwarf	we present here the results of astrometric, photometric and spectroscopicobservations leading to the determination of the orbit and dynamical masses ofthe binary l dwarf 2massw j0746425+2000321. high angular resolutionobservations spread over almost 4 years and obtained with the hubble spacetelescope (hst), the eso very large telescope (vlt), and a the w. m. keckobservatory (keck) allow us to cover 36% of the period, corresponding to 60% ofthe orbit, and, for the first time, to derive a precise estimate of the totaland individual masses of such a late-type object. we find an orbital period of3850.9$^{+904}_{-767}$ days. the corresponding total mass is0.146$^{+0.016}_{-0.006}$ m$_{\sun}$, with uncertainties depending on thedistance. spatially resolved low resolution optical (550--1025 nm) spectra havebeen obtained with hst/stis, allowing us to measure the spectral types of thetwo components (l0$\pm$0.5 for the primary and l1.5$\pm$0.5 for the secondary).we also present precise photometry of the individual components measured on thehigh angular resolution images obtained with hst/acs and wfpc2 (visible),vlt/naco (j, h and ks bands) and keck i (ks) band). these spectral andphotometric measurements enable us to estimate their effective temperatures andmass ratio, and to place the object accurately in a h--r diagram. the binarysystem is most likely formed by a primary with a mass of 0.085$\pm$0.010m$_{\sun}$ and a secondary with a mass of 0.066$\pm$0.006 m$_{\sun}$, thusclearly substellar, for an age of approximately 300$\pm$150 myr. h$\alpha$variability indicates chromospheric and/or magnetic activity.

astro-ph;0409389	spectral classification beyond m	significant populations of field l and t dwarfs are now known, and weanticipate the discovery of even cooler dwarfs by spitzer and ground-basedinfrared surveys. however, as the number of known l and t dwarfs increases sodoes the range in their observational properties, and difficulties have arisenin interpreting the observations. although modellers have made significantadvances, the complexity of the very low temperature, high pressure,photospheres means that problems remain such as the treatment of graincondensation as well as incomplete and non-equilibrium molecular chemistry.also, there are several parameters which control the observed spectral energydistribution - effective temperature, grain sedimentation efficiency,metallicity and gravity - and their effects are not well understood. in thispaper, based on a splinter session, we discuss classification schemes for l andt dwarfs, their dependency on wavelength, and the effects of the parameterst_eff, f_sed, [m/h] and log g on optical and infrared spectra. we will discussthe various hypotheses that have been presented for the transition from thedusty l types to the clear atmosphere t types. we conclude with a briefdiscussion of the spectral class beyond t. authors of each section areidentified by their initials.

astro-ph;0509798	review on low-mass stars and brown dwarfs	in this review, we examine the successes and weaknesses of modern low-massstar and brown dwarf theory.(1) we first focus on the mechanical (equation ofstate) and thermal (atmosphere) properties and on the evolution. we thenexamine the current shortcomings of the theory and we discuss recentobservational analysis which have suggested discrepancies between models andobservations.(2) we then examine the stellar and brown dwarf imf and suggestthat a power-law above the average thermal jeans mass (about 1 msol) rollingover a lognormal form below this limit adequately reproduces the observationsof field and young cluster stellar and brown dwarf distributions. this yields areasonably accurate estimate of the stellar and brown dwarf galactic census.finally (3) we argue that the combination of turbulence driven fragmentation atlarge scale and gravity at small scales provides an appealing solution for thegeneral star and brown dwarf formation mechanism. it also provides a physicalground for the aforementioned power-law + lognormal form for the imf, whereas aseries of different power laws lacks such a physical motivation. at last, weargue that the deuterium-burning limit as the distinction between stars andplanets has no physical foundation in this modern star formation scheme.opacity limited fragmentation extending down to a few (&lt; 10) jupiter masses,due to shocks, anisotropy or magnetic fields, provides a much more robustlimit, even though difficult to determine accurately. therefore, the various"direct" detections of exoplanets claimed recently in the literature are mostlikely regular low-mass brown dwarfs and the direct detection of an extrasolarplanet remains for now elusive.

astro-ph;0512354	photometric colors of late-type giants: theory versus observations	to assess the current status in the theoretical modeling of the spectralproperties of late-type giants, we provide a comparison of syntheticphotometric colors of late-type giants (calculated with phoenix, marcs andatlas model atmospheres) with observations, at [m/h]=0.0 and -2.0. overall,there is a good agreement between observed and synthetic colors, and syntheticcolors and published teff-color relations, both at [m/h]=0.0 and -2.0.deviations from the observed trends in teff-color planes are generally within\pm 150k (or less) in the effective temperature range teff=3500-4800k.synthetic colors calculated with different stellar atmosphere models typicallyagree to ~100k, within a large range of effective temperatures and gravities.some discrepancies are seen in the teff-(b-v) plane below teff~3800k at[m/h]=0.0, due to difficulties in reproducing the 'turn-off' to the bluercolors which is seen in the observed data at teff~3600k. note that at[m/h]=-2.0 effective temperatures given by the scale of alonso et al. (1999)are generally lower than those resulting from other teff-color relations basedboth on observed and synthetic colors.

astro-ph;0608264	energy transport, overshoot, and mixing in the atmospheres of m-type  main- and pre-main-sequence objects	we constructed hydrodynamical model atmospheres for mid m-type main-, as wellas pre-main-sequence (pms) objects. despite the complex chemistry encounteredin these cool atmospheres a reasonably accurate representation of the radiativetransfer is possible, even in the context of time-dependent andthree-dimensional models. the models provide detailed information about themorphology of m-type granulation and statistical properties of the convectivesurface flows. in particular, we determined the efficiency of the convectiveenergy transport, and the efficiency of mixing by convective overshoot. theconvective transport efficiency was expressed in terms of an equivalentmixing-length parameter alpha in the formulation of mixing-length theory (mlt)given by mihalas (1978). alpha amounts to values around 2 for matching theentropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified regions of the convectiveenvelope, and lies between 2.5 and 3.0 for matching the thermal structure ofthe deep photosphere. for current spectral analysis of pms objects this impliesthat mlt models based on alpha=2.0 overestimate the effective temperature by100 k and surface gravities by 0.25 dex. the average thermal structure of theformally convectively stable layers is little affected by convective overshootand wave heating, i.e., stays close to radiative equilibrium conditions. ourmodels suggest that the rate of mixing by convective overshoot declinesexponentially with geometrical distance to the schwarzschild stabilityboundary. it increases at given effective temperature with decreasinggravitational acceleration.

astro-ph;0702534	two t dwarfs from the ukidss early data release	we report on the first ultracool dwarf discoveries from the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) large area survey early data release (las edr), inparticular the discovery of t dwarfs which are fainter and more distant thanthose found using the 2mass and sdss surveys. we aim to show that ourmethodologies for searching the ~27 sq degs of the las edr are successful forfinding both l and t dwarfs $via$ cross-correlation with the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) dr4 release. while the area searched so far is small, the numbersof objects found shows great promise for near-future releases of the las andgreat potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. ultracool dwarfs areselected by combinations of their yjh(k) ukidss colours and sdss dr4 z-j andi-z colours, or, lower limits on these red optical/infrared colours in the caseof dr4 dropouts. after passing visual inspection tests, candidates have beenfollowed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.our main result is the discovery following ch4 imaging and spectroscopy of at4.5 dwarf, ulasj 1452+0655, lying ~80pc distant. a further t dwarf candidate,ulasj 1301+0023, has very similar ch4 colours but has not yet been confirmedspectroscopically. we also report on the identification of a brighter l0 dwarf,and on the selection of a list of las objects designed to probe for t-likedwarfs to the survey j-band limit. our findings indicate that the combinationof the ukidss las and sdss surveys provide an excellent tool for identifying land t dwarfs down to much fainter limits than previously possible. ourdiscovery of one confirmed and one probable t dwarf in the edr is consistentwith expectations from the previously measured t dwarf density on the sky.

astro-ph;9805311	optical spectroscopy of denis mini-survey brown dwarf candidates	we present optical (6500-9200a) spectroscopy of eight cool dwarfs detected ina 231 square degree ``mini-survey'' of the deep near infrared survey (denis)data. we are able to confirm that the spectral types derived from themini-survey infrared spectroscopy are meaningful. we provide a spectralsequence which extends beyond the m-dwarf range and into the proposed ``l''class of dwarfs. the dominant spectral features in the optical for these l-typedwarfs are resonance lines of cs i and molecular band heads of crh and feh. theother dominant feature in these l-type spectra is a broad 600a absorption dipcentered on 7700a, which we identify with extremely strong (equivalent width$\sim$ several hundred a) absorption associated with the 7664,7698a resonancedoublet of k i. we find that model atmospheres which include the effects ofmolecular condensation without dust opacity (to simulate rapid gravitationalsettling of dust grains) produce significantly better agreement with observedoptical spectra for l-type dwarfs, than models including dust opacity. thissuggests gravitational settling of dust grains plays an important role inl-dwarf photospheres. the extreme strength of the k i resonance doublet, anddisappearance of tio and vo, and the consequent dominance of crh and feh inl-dwarf spectra offer considerable prospects as sensitive effective temperaturediagnostics, even at low spectral resolution.

astro-ph;9807255	infrared colors at the stellar/substellar boundary	we present new infrared photometry for 61 halo and disk stars around thestellar/substellar boundary. these data are combined with available opticalphotometry and astrometric data to produce color--color and absolutemagnitude--color diagrams. the disk and halo sequences are compared to thepredictions of the latest model atmospheres and structural models.  we find good agreement between observation and theory except for knownproblems in the v and h passbands probably due to incomplete molecular data fortio, metal hydrides and h$_2$o. the metal--poor m subdwarfs are well matched bythe models as oxide opacity sources are less important in this case. the knownextreme m subdwarfs have metallicities about one--hundredth solar, and thecoolest subdwarfs have t$_{eff}\sim 3000$ k with masses $\sim$0.09m/m$_{\odot}$. the grainless models are not able to reproduce the fluxdistributions of disk objects with t$_{eff} &lt;$ 2500 k, however a preliminaryversion of the nextgen--dusty models which includes homogeneous formation andextinction by dust grains {\it is} able to match the colors of these very coolobjects. the least luminous objects in this sample are gd165b, three denisobjects --- dbd0205, dbd1058 and dbd1228 --- and kelu-1. these havet$_{eff}\sim$ 2000 k and are at or below the stellar limit with masses$\leq$0.075m/m$_{\odot}$. photometry alone cannot constrain these parametersfurther as the age is unknown, but published lithium detections for two ofthese objects (kelu-1 and dbd1228) imply that they are young (aged about 1 gyr)and substellar (mass $\leq$0.06m/m$_{\odot}$).

astro-ph;9901294	period - luminosity - color - radius relationships of cepheids as a  function of metallicity: evolutionary effects	based on consistent evolutionary and pulsation calculations, we analyse theeffect of metallicity and of different convection treatments in the stellarmodels on period - magnitude, - color and - radius relationships. in order toperform an accurate comparison with observations, we have computed grids ofatmosphere models and synthetic spectra for different metallicities, coveringthe range of effective temperatures and gravities relevant for cepheids. themodels are compared to recent observations of galactic and magellanic cloudscepheids. unprecedented level of agreement is found between models andobservations. we show that within the range of metallicity for the galaxy andthe magellanic clouds, a change of slope in the period - luminosity (pl)relationship is predicted at low periods, due to the reduction of the blue loopduring core he burning. the minimum mass undergoing a blue loop andconsequently the critical period at which this change of slope occurs depend onthe metallicity z and on the convection treatment in the stellar models.however, besides this change of slope, we do not find any significant effect ofmetallicity on period - magnitude relationships from v to k bands, and onperiod - color relationships in ir colors. we only find a detectable effect of$z$ on $(b-v)$ colors. these results are not affected by uncertainties inherentto current stellar models, mainly due to convection treatment.

0809.3657	a comparison of chemistry and dust cloud formation in ultracool dwarf  model atmospheres	the atmospheres of substellar objects contain clouds of oxides, iron,silicates, and other refractory condensates. water clouds are expected in thecoolest objects. the opacity of these `dust' clouds strongly affects both theatmospheric temperature-pressure profile and the emergent flux. thus anyattempt to model the spectra of these atmospheres must incorporate a cloudmodel. however the diversity of cloud models in atmospheric simulations islarge and it is not always clear how the underlying physics of the variousmodels compare. likewise the observational consequences of different modelingapproaches can be masked by other model differences, making objectivecomparisons challenging. in order to clarify the current state of the modelingapproaches, this paper compares five different cloud models in two sets oftests. test case 1 tests the dust cloud models for a prescribed l, l--t, andt-dwarf atmospheric (temperature t, pressure p, convective velocityvconv)-structures. test case 2 compares complete model atmosphere results forgiven (effective temperature teff, surface gravity log g). all models agree onthe global cloud structure but differ in opacity-relevant details like grainsize, amount of dust, dust and gas-phase composition. comparisons of syntheticphotometric fluxes translate into an modelling uncertainty in apparentmagnitudes for our l-dwarf (t-dwarf) test case of 0.25 &lt; \delta m &lt; 0.875 (0.1&lt; \delta m m 1.375) taking into account the 2mass, the ukirt wfcam, the spitzerirac, and vlt visir filters with ukirt wfcam being the most challenging for themodels.

0811.3583	a probable giant planet imaged in the beta pictoris disk	since the discovery of its dusty disk in 1984, beta pictoris has become theprototype of young early-type planetary systems, and there are now variousindications that a massive jovian planet is orbiting the star at ~ 10 au.however, no planets have been detected around this star so far. our goal was toinvestigate the close environment of beta pic, searching for planetarycompanion(s). deep adaptive-optics l'-band images of beta pic were recordedusing the naco instrument at the very large telescope. a faint point-likesignal is detected at a projected distance of ~ 8 au from the star, within thenorth-east side of the dust disk. various tests were made to rule out with agood confidence level possible instrumental or atmospheric artifacts. theprobability of a foreground or background contaminant is extremely low, basedin addition on the analysis of previous deep hubble space telescope images. theobject l'=11.2 apparent magnitude would indicate a typical temperature of ~1500k and a mass of ~ 8 jovian masses. if confirmed, it could explain the mainmorphological and dynamical peculiarities of the beta pic system. the presentdetection is unique among a-stars by the proximity of the resolved planet toits parent star. its closeness and location inside the beta pic disk suggest aformation process by core accretion or disk instabilities rather than abinary-like formation process.
