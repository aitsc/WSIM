0901.2536	disk formation and the origin of clumpy galaxies at high redshift	observations of high redshift galaxies have revealed a multitude of largeclumpy rapidly star-forming galaxies. their formation scenario and their linkto present day spirals is still unknown. in this letter we perform adaptivemesh refinement simulations of disk formation in a cosmological context thatare unrivalled in terms of mass and spatial resolution. we find that the socalled "chain-galaxies" and "clump-clusters" are a natural outcome of earlyepochs of enhanced gas accretion from cold dense streams as well as tidally andram-pressured stripped material from minor mergers and satellites. throughinteraction with the hot halo gas, this freshly accreted cold gas settles intoa large disk-like system, not necessarily aligned to an older stellarcomponent, that undergoes fragmentation and subsequent star formation, forminglarge clumps in the mass range 10^7-10^9 m_sun. galaxy formation is a complexprocess at this important epoch when most of the central baryons are beingacquired through a range of different mechanisms - we highlight that a rapidmass loading epoch is required to fuel the fragmentation taking place in themassive arms in the outskirts of extended disks, an accretion mode that occursnaturally in the hierarchical assembly process at early epochs.

0905.4669	morphological quenching of star formation: making early-type galaxies  red	we point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation inearly-type galaxies. it automatically links the color of a galaxy with itsmorphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gassupply. given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gasdisks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation tobound clumps. this can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, forinstance by mergers. we present the concept of morphological quenching (mq)using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its naturaloccurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique.we show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficientto stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxyred and dead while gas accretion continues. the turbulence necessary for diskstability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in theabsence of bound star-forming clumps. while gas stripping processes are limitedto dense groups and clusters, and other quenching mechanisms like agn feedback,virial shock heating and gravitational heating, are limited to halos moremassive than 10^12 mo, the mq can explain the appearance of red ellipticalseven in less massive halos and in the field. the dense gas disks observed insome of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereasred galaxies with quenched gas disks are expected to be more frequent at highredshift.

0908.3862	magnetised winds in dwarf galaxies	the origin and the magnitude of the inter-galactic magnetic field is ofprimordial importance in the global picture of magnetic field evolution, as itis considered to be the missing link between galactic magnetic fields andcluster magnetic fields on much larger scales. we are testing whether dwarfgalaxies are good candidates to explain the enrichment of the igm: after theirdiscs form and trigger galactic dynamos, supernova feedback will launch strongwinds, expelling magnetic field lines in the igm. we have performed mhdsimulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy, forming self-consistently inside acooling halo. using the ramses code, we have for the first time simulated theformation of a magnetised supernova-driven galactic outflow. this simulation isan important step towards a more realistic modelling using fully cosmologicalsimulations. our simulations reproduce well the observed properties of magneticfields in spiral galaxies. the formation and the evolution of our simulateddisc lead to a strong magnetic field amplification: the magnetic field in thefinal wind bubble is one order of magnitude larger than the initial value. themagnetic field in the disc, essentially toroidal, is growing linearly with timeas a consequence of differential rotation. we discuss the consequence of thissimple mechanism on the cosmic evolution of the magnetic field: we propose anew scenario for the evolution of the magnetic field, with dwarf galaxiesplaying a key role in amplifying and ejecting magnetic energy in the igm,resulting in what we call a "cosmic dynamo" that could contribute to the ratherhigh field strengths observed in galaxies and clusters today.

0912.4886	3d simulations of supernova remnants evolution including non-linear  particle acceleration	if a sizeable fraction of the energy of supernova remnant shocks is channeledinto energetic particles (commonly identified with galactic cosmic rays), thenthe morphological evolution of the remnants must be distinctly modified.evidence of such modifications has been recently obtained with the chandra andxmm-newton x-ray satellites. to investigate these effects, we coupled asemi-analytical kinetic model of shock acceleration with a 3d hydrodynamic code(by means of an effective adiabatic index). this enables us to study thetime-dependent compression of the region between the forward and reverse shocksdue to the back reaction of accelerated particles, concomitantly with thedevelopment of the rayleigh-taylor hydrodynamic instability at the contactdiscontinuity. density profiles depend critically on the injection level eta ofparticles: for eta up to about 10^-4 modifications are weak and progressive,for eta of the order of 10^-3 modifications are strong and immediate.nevertheless, the extension of the rayleigh-taylor unstable region does notdepend on the injection rate. a first comparison of our simulations withobservations of tycho's remnant strengthens the case for efficient accelerationof protons at the forward shock.

0707.3376	on the onset of galactic winds in quiescent star forming galaxies	we studied the effect of supernovae feedback on a disk galaxy, taking intoaccount the impact of infalling gas on both the star formation history and thecorresponding outflow structure, the apparition of a supernovae-driven windbeing highly sensitive to the halo mass, the galaxy spin and the star formationefficiency. we model our galaxies as cooling and collapsing nfw spheres. thedark matter component is modelled as a static external potential, while thebaryon component is described by the euler equations using the amr code ramses.metal-dependent cooling and supernovae-heating are also implemented usingstate-of-the-art recipes coming from cosmological simulations. we allow for 3parameters to vary: the halo circular velocity, the spin parameter and the starformation efficiency. we found that the ram pressure of infalling material isthe key factor limiting the apparition of galactic winds. we obtain a very lowfeedback efficiency, with supernovae to wind energy conversion factor aroundone percent, so that only low cicrular velocity galaxies give rise to strongwinds. for massive galaxies, we obtain a galatic fountain, for which we discussthe observational properties. we conclude that for quiescent isolated galaxies,galactic winds appear only in very low mass systems. although that can quiteefficiently enrich the igm with metals, they don't carry away enough coldmaterial to solve the overcooling problem.

1002.1964	the large-scale orientations of disk galaxies	we use a 380 h-1 pc resolution hydrodynamic amr simulation of a cosmicfilament to investigate the orientations of a sample of ~100 well-resolvedgalactic disks spanning two orders of magnitude in both stellar and halo mass.we find: (i) at z=0, there is an almost perfect alignment at a median angle of18 deg, in the inner dark matter halo regions where the disks reside, betweenthe spin vector of the gaseous and stellar galactic disks and that of theirinner host haloes. the alignment between galaxy spin and spin of the entirehost halo is however significantly weaker, ranging from a median of ~46 deg atz=1 to ~50 deg at z=0. (ii) the most massive galaxy disks have spinspreferentially aligned so as to point along their host filaments. (iii) thespin of disks in lower-mass haloes shows, at redshifts above z~0.5 and inregions of low environmental density, a clear signature of alignment with theintermediate principal axis of the large-scale tidal field. this behavior isconsistent with predictions of linear tidal torque theory. this alignmentdecreases with increasing environmental density, and vanishes in the highestdensity regions. non-linear effects in the high density environments areplausibly responsible for establishing this density-alignment correlation. weexpect that our numerical results provide important insights for bothunderstanding intrinsic alignment in weak lensing from the astrophysicalperspective and formation and evolution processes of galactic disks in acosmological context.

1002.5048	simulation of the growth of the 3d rayleigh-taylor instability in  supernova remnants using an expanding reference frame	context: the rayleigh-taylor instabilities generated by the deceleration of asupernova remnant during the ejecta-dominated phase are known to producefinger-like structures in the matter distribution which modify the geometry ofthe remnant. the morphology of supernova remnants is also expected to bemodified when efficient particle acceleration occurs at their shocks. aims: theimpact of the rayleigh-taylor instabilities from the ejecta-dominated to thesedov-taylor phase is investigated over one octant of the supernova remnant. wealso study the effect of efficient particle acceleration at the forward shockon the growth of the rayleigh-taylor instabilities. methods: we modified theadaptive mesh refinement code ramses to study with hydrodynamic numericalsimulations the evolution of supernova remnants in the framework of anexpanding reference frame. the adiabatic index of a relativistic gas betweenthe forward shock and the contact discontinuity mimics the presence ofaccelerated particles. results: the great advantage of the super-comovingcoordinate system adopted here is that it minimizes numerical diffusion at thecontact discontinuity, since it is stationary with respect to the grid. wepropose an accurate expression for the growth of the rayleigh-taylor structuresthat connects smoothly the early growth to the asymptotic self-similarbehaviour. conclusions: the development of the rayleigh-taylor structures isaffected, although not drastically, if the blast wave is dominated by cosmicrays. the amount of ejecta that makes it into the shocked interstellar mediumis smaller in the latter case. if acceleration occurs at both shocks the extentof the rayleigh-taylor structures is similar but the reverse shock is stronglyperturbed.

1003.4744	mass distribution in galaxy clusters: the role of agn feedback	we use 1 kpc resolution cosmological amr simulations of a virgo-like galaxycluster to investigate the effect of feedback from supermassive black holes(smbh) on the mass distribution of dark matter, gas and stars. we comparedthree different models: (i) a standard galaxy formation model featuring gascooling, star formation and supernovae feedback, (ii) a "quenching" model forwhich star formation is artificially suppressed in massive halos and finally(iii) the recently proposed agn feedback model of booth &amp; schaye (2009).without agn feedback (even in the quenching case), our simulated clustersuffers from a strong overcooling problem, with a stellar mass fractionsignificantly above observed values in m87. the baryon distribution is highlyconcentrated, resulting in a strong adiabatic contraction (ac) of dark matter.with agn feedback, on the contrary, the stellar mass in the bright centralgalaxy (bcg) lies below observational estimates and the overcooling problemdisappears. the stellar mass of the bcg is seen to increase with increasingmass resolution, suggesting that our stellar masses converges to the correctvalue from below. the gas and total mass distributions are in strikingagreement with observations. we also find a slight deficit (~10%) of baryons atthe virial radius, due to the effect of agn-driven shock waves pushing gas tompc scales and beyond. this baryon deficit results in a slight adiabaticexpansion of the dark matter distribution, that can be explained quantitativelyby ac theory.

1004.0005	the formation of disc galaxies in a lcdm universe	we study the formation of disc galaxies in a fully cosmological frameworkusing adaptive mesh refinement simulations. we perform an extensive parameterstudy of the main subgrid processes that control how gas is converted intostars and the coupled effect of supernovae feedback. we argue that previousattempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universaladoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies.unless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar mediumduring supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulgedominated s0/sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3. we showthat a low efficiency of star-formation more closely models the subparsecphysical processes, especially at high redshift. we highlight the successfulformation of extended disc galaxies with scale lengths r_d=4-5 kpc, flatrotation curves and bulge to disc ratios of b/d~1/4. not only do we resolve theformation of a milky way-like spiral galaxy, we also observe the secularevolution of the disc as it forms a pseudo-bulge. the disc properties agreewell with observations and are compatible with the photometric and baryonictully-fisher relations, the kennicutt-schmidt relation and the observed angularmomentum content of spiral galaxies. we conclude that underlying small-scalestar formation physics plays a larger role than previously considered insimulations of galaxy formation.

1004.1851	jet-regulated cooling catastrophe	we present the first implementation of active galactic nuclei (agn) feedbackin the form of momentum driven jets in an adaptive mesh refinement (amr)cosmological resimulation of a galaxy cluster. the jets are powered by gasaccretion onto super massive black holes (smbhs) which also grow by mergers.throughout its formation, the cluster experiences different dynamical states:both a morphologically perturbed epoch at early times and a relaxed state atlate times allowing us to study the different modes of bh growth and associatedagn jet feedback. bhs accrete gas efficiently at high redshift (z&gt;2),significantly pre-heating proto-cluster halos. gas-rich mergers at highredshift also fuel strong, episodic jet activity, which transports gas from theproto-cluster core to its outer regions. at later times, while the clusterrelaxes, the supply of cold gas onto the bhs is reduced leading to lower jetactivity. although the cluster is still heated by this activity as sound wavespropagate from the core to the virial radius, the jets inefficientlyredistribute gas outwards and a small cooling flow develops, along withlow-pressure cavities similar to those detected in x-ray observations. overall,our jet implementation of agn feedback quenches star formation quiteefficiently, reducing the stellar content of the central cluster galaxy by afactor 3 compared to the no agn case. it also dramatically alters the shape ofthe gas density profile, bringing it in close agreement with the beta modelfavoured by observations, producing quite an isothermal galaxy cluster forgigayears in the process. however, it still falls short in matching the lowerthan universal baryon fractions which seem to be commonplace in observed galaxyclusters.

1004.2503	reionization simulations powered by gpus i: the structure of the  ultraviolet radiation field	we present a set of cosmological simulations with radiative transfer in orderto model the reionization history of the universe. galaxy formation and theassociated star formation are followed self-consistently with gas and darkmatter dynamics using the ramses code, while radiative transfer is performed asa post-processing step using a moment-based method with m1 closure relation inthe aton code. the latter has been ported to a multiple graphics processingunits (gpu) architecture using cuda + mpi, resulting in an overall acceleration(x80) that allows us to tackle radiative transfer problems at resolution of1024^3 + 2 levels of refinement for the hydro adaptive grid and 1024^3 for thert cartesian grid. we observe a good convergence between our differentresolution runs as long as the effects of finite resolution on the starformation history are properly taken into account. we also show that theneutral fraction depends on the total mass density, in a way close to thepredictions of photoionization equilibrium, as long as the effect ofself-shielding is included in the background radiation model. however we stillfail at reproducing the z=6 constraints on the h neutral fraction and theintensity of the uv background. in order to account for unresolved densityfluctuations, we added a simple clumping factor model. using our most spatiallyresolved simulation (12.5 mpc/h-1024^3) to calibrate our subgrid model, we haveresimulated our largest box (100 mpc/h 1024^3), successfully reproducing theobserved level of h neutral fraction at z=6. we don't reproduce thephotoionization rate inferred from the same observations. we argue that thisdiscrepancy could be explained by the fact that the average radiation intensityand the average neutral fraction depends on different regions of the gasdensity distribution, so that one quantity cannot be simply deduced from theother.

1006.1322	systematic uncertainties in the determination of the local dark matter  density	a precise determination of the local dark matter density and an accuratecontrol over the corresponding uncertainties are of paramount importance fordark matter (dm) searches. using very recent high-resolution numericalsimulations of a milky way like object, we study the systematic uncertaintiesthat affect the determination of the local dark matter density based ondynamical measurements in the galaxy. in particular, extracting from thesimulation with baryons the orientation of the galactic stellar disk withrespect to the dm distribution, we study the dm density for an observer locatedat $\sim$8 kpc from the galactic center {\it on the stellar disk}, $\rho_0$.this quantity is found to be always larger than the average density in aspherical shell of same radius $\bar{\rho}_0$, which is the quantity inferredfrom dynamical measurements in the galaxy, and to vary in the range$\rho_0/\bar{\rho}_0=1.01-1.41$. this suggests that the actual dark matterdensity in the solar neighbourhood is on average 21\% larger than the valueinferred from most dynamical measurements, and that the associated systematicerrors are larger than the statistical errors recently discussed in theliterature.

1006.4757	the driving mechanism of starbursts in galaxy mergers	we present hydrodynamic simulations of a major merger of disk galaxies, andstudy the ism dynamics and star formation properties. high spatial and massresolutions of 12pc and 4x10^4 m_sol allow to resolve cold and turbulent gasclouds embedded in a warmer diffuse phase. we compare to lower resolutionmodels, where the multiphase ism is not resolved and is modeled as a relativelyhomogeneous and stable medium. while merger-driven bursts of star formation aregenerally attributed to large-scale gas inflows towards the nuclear regions, weshow that once a realistic ism is resolved, the dominant process is actuallygas fragmentation into massive and dense clouds and rapid star formationtherein. as a consequence, star formation is more efficient by a factor of upto 10 and is also somewhat more extended, while the gas density probabilitydistribution function (pdf) rapidly evolves towards very high densities. wethus propose that the actual mechanism of starburst triggering in galaxycollisions can only be captured at high spatial resolution and when the coolingof gas is modeled down to less than 10^3 k. not only does our model reproducethe properties of the antennae system, but it also explains the ``starburstmode'' revealed recently in high-redshift mergers compared to quiescent disks.

1006.4782	hydrodynamics of high-redshift galaxy collisions: from gas-rich disks to  dispersion-dominated mergers and compact spheroids	disk galaxies at high redshift (z~2) are characterized by high fractions ofcold gas, strong turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. major mergers ofdisk galaxies at high redshift should then generally involve such turbulentclumpy disks. merger simulations, however, model the ism as a stable,homogeneous, and thermally pressurized medium. we present the first mergersimulations with high fractions of cold, turbulent, and clumpy gas. we discussthe major new features of these models compared to models where the gas isartificially stabilized and warmed. gas turbulence, which is already strong inhigh-redshift disks, is further enhanced in mergers. some phases aredispersion-dominated, with most of the gas kinetic energy in the form ofvelocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger modelsusing a thermally stabilized gas. these mergers can reach very high starformation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent withsubmillimeter galaxies. major mergers with high fractions of cold turbulent gasare also characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to the center ofmass, with the stellar component following in a global contraction. the finalgalaxies are early-type with relatively small radii and high sersic indices,like high-redshift compact spheroids. the mass fraction in a disk componentthat survives or re-forms after a merger is severely reduced compared to modelswith stabilized gas, and the formation of a massive disk component wouldrequire significant accretion of external baryons afterwards. mergers thusappear to destroy extended disks even when the gas fraction is high, and thislends further support to smooth infall as the main formation mechanism formassive disk galaxies.

1007.2566	ism properties in hydrodynamic galaxy simulations: turbulence cascades,  cloud formation, role of gravity and feedback	we study the properties of ism substructure and turbulence in hydrodynamic(amr) galaxy simulations with resolutions up to 0.8 pc and 5x10^3 msun. weanalyse the power spectrum of the density distribution, and various componentsof the velocity field. we show that the disk thickness is about the averagejeans scale length, and is mainly regulated by gravitational instabilities.from this scale of energy injection, a turbulence cascade towards small-scaleis observed, with almost isotropic small-scale motions. on scales larger thanthe disk thickness, density waves are observed, but there is also a full rangeof substructures with chaotic and strongly non-isotropic gas velocitydispersions. the power spectrum of vorticity in an lmc-sized model suggeststhat an inverse cascade of turbulence might be present, although energy inputover a wide range of scales in the coupled gaseous+stellar fluid could alsoexplain this quasi-2d regime on scales larger than the disk scale height.similar regimes of gas turbulence are also found in massive high-redshift diskswith high gas fractions. disk properties and ism turbulence appear to be mainlyregulated by gravitational processes, both on large scales and inside denseclouds. star formation feedback is however essential to maintain the ism in asteady state by balancing a systematic gas dissipation into dense and smallclumps. our galaxy simulations employ a thermal model based on a barotropicequation of state (eos) aimed at modelling the equilibrium of gas betweenvarious heating and cooling processes. denser gas is typically colder in thisapproach, which is shown to correctly reproduce the density structures of astar-forming, turbulent, unstable and cloudy ism down to scales of a fewparsecs.

1007.4667	cell count moments in the halo model	we study cell count moments up to fifth order of the distributions of haloes,of halo substructures as a proxy for galaxies, and of mass in the context ofthe halo model and compare theoretical predictions to the results of numericalsimulations. on scales larger than the size of the largest cluster, we presenta simple point cluster model in which results depend only on cluster-clustercorrelations and on the distribution of the number of objects within a cluster,or cluster occupancy. the point cluster model leads to expressions for momentsof galaxy counts in which the volume-averaged moments on large scales approachthose of the halo distribution and on smaller scales exhibit hierarchicalclustering with amplitudes $s_k$ determined by moments of the occupancydistribution. in this limit, the halo model predictions are purelycombinatoric, and have no dependence on halo profile, concentration parameter,or potential asphericity. the full halo model introduces only two additionaleffects: on large scales, haloes of different mass have different clusteringstrengths, introducing relative bias parameters; and on the smallest scales,halo structure is resolved and details of the halo profile become important,introducing shape-dependent form factors. because of differences betweendiscrete and continuous statistics, the hierarchical amplitudes for galaxiesand for mass behave differently on small scales even if galaxy number isexactly proportional to mass, a difference that is not necessarily welldescribed in terms of bias.

1012.5227	star formation in galaxy mergers: ism turbulence, dense gas excess, and  scaling relations for disks and starbusts	galaxy interactions and mergers play a significant, but still debated andpoorly understood role in the star formation history of galaxies. numerical andtheoretical models cannot yet explain the main properties of merger-inducedstarbursts, including their intensity and their spatial extent. usually, themechanism invoked in merger-induced starbursts is a global inflow of gastowards the central kpc, resulting in a nuclear starburst. we show here, usinghigh-resolution amr simulations and comparing to observations of the gascomponent in mergers, that the triggering of starbursts also results fromincreased ism turbulence and velocity dispersions in interacting systems. thisforms cold gas that are denser and more massive than in quiescent diskgalaxies. the fraction of dense cold gas largely increases, modifying theglobal density distribution of these systems, and efficient star formationresults. because the starbursting activity is not just from a global compactingof the gas to higher average surface densities, but also from higher turbulenceand fragmentation into massive and dense clouds, merging systems can enter adifferent regime of star formation compared to quiescent disk galaxies. this isin quantitative agreement with recent observations suggesting that diskgalaxies and starbursting systems are not the low-activity end andhigh-activity end of a single regime, but actually follow different scalingrelations for their star formation.

1102.1216	radiation hydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement and application to  prestellar core collapse. i methods	radiative transfer has a strong impact on the collapse and the fragmentationof prestellar dense cores. we present the radiation-hydrodynamics solver wedesigned for the ramses code. the method is designed for astrophysicalpurposes, and in particular for protostellar collapse. we present the solver,using the co-moving frame to evaluate the radiative quantities. we use thepopular flux limited diffusion approximation, under the grey approximation (onegroup of photon). the solver is based on the second-order godunov scheme oframses for its hyperbolic part, and on an implicit scheme for the radiationdiffusion and the coupling between radiation and matter. we report in detailsour methodology to integrate the rhd solver into ramses. we test successfullythe method against several conventional tests. for validation in 3d, we performcalculations of the collapse of an isolated 1 m_sun prestellar dense core,without rotation. we compare successfully the results with previous studiesusing different models for radiation and hydrodynamics. we have developed afull radiation hydrodynamics solver in the ramses code, that handles adaptivemesh refinement grids. the method is a combination of an explicit scheme and animplicit scheme, accurate to the second-order in space. our method is wellsuited for star formation purposes. results of multidimensional dense corecollapse calculations with rotation are presented in a companion paper.

1102.4195	the impact of ism turbulence, clustered star formation and feedback on  galaxy mass assembly through cold flows and mergers	two of the dominant channels for galaxy mass assembly are cold flows (coldgas supplied via the filaments of the cosmic web) and mergers. how theseprocesses combine in a cosmological setting, at both low and high redshift, toproduce the whole zoo of galaxies we observe is largely unknown. indeed thereis still much to understand about the detailed physics of each process inisolation. while these formation channels have been studied usinghydrodynamical simulations, here we study their impact on gas properties andstar formation (sf) with some of the first simulations that capture themultiphase, cloudy nature of the interstellar medium (ism), by virtue of theirhigh spatial resolution (and corresponding low temperature threshold). in thisregime, we examine the competition between cold flows and asupernovae(sne)-driven outflow in a very high-redshift galaxy (z {\approx} 9)and study the evolution of equal-mass galaxy mergers at low and high redshift,focusing on the induced sf. we find that sne-driven outflows cannot reduce thecold accretion at z {\approx} 9 and that sf is actually enhanced due to theensuing metal enrichment. we demonstrate how several recent observationalresults on galaxy populations (e.g. enhanced hcn/co ratios in ulirgs, aseparate kennicutt schmidt (ks) sequence for starbursts and the population ofcompact early type galaxies (etgs) at high redshift) can be explained withmechanisms captured in galaxy merger simulations, provided that the multiphasenature of the ism is resolved.

1103.5525	comparing numerical methods for isothermal magnetized supersonic  turbulence	we employ simulations of supersonic super-alfvenic turbulence decay as abenchmark test problem to assess and compare the performance of nineastrophysical mhd methods actively used to model star formation. the set ofnine codes includes: enzo, flash, kt-mhd, ll-mhd, pluto, ppml, ramses, stagger,and zeus. we present a comprehensive set of statistical measures designed toquantify the effects of numerical dissipation in these mhd solvers. we comparepower spectra for basic fields to determine the effective spectral bandwidth ofthe methods and rank them based on their relative effective reynolds numbers.we also compare numerical dissipation for solenoidal and dilatational velocitycomponents to check for possible impacts of the numerics on small-scale densitystatistics. finally, we discuss convergence of various characteristics for theturbulence decay test and impacts of various components of numerical schemes onthe accuracy of solutions. we show that the best performing codes employ aconsistently high order of accuracy for spatial reconstruction of the evolvedfields, transverse gradient interpolation, conservation law update step, andlorentz force computation. the best results are achieved with divergence-freeevolution of the magnetic field using the constrained transport method, andusing little to no explicit artificial viscosity. codes which fall short in oneor more of these areas are still useful, but they must compensate highernumerical dissipation with higher numerical resolution. this paper is thelargest, most comprehensive mhd code comparison on an application-like testproblem to date. we hope this work will help developers improve their numericalalgorithms while helping users to make informed choices in picking optimalapplications for their specific astrophysical problems.

1104.0171	how agn feedback and metal cooling shape cluster entropy profiles	observed clusters of galaxies essentially come in two flavors: non cool coreclusters characterized by an isothermal temperature profile and a centralentropy floor, and cool-core clusters where temperature and entropy in thecentral region are increasing with radius. using cosmological resimulations ofa galaxy cluster, we study the evolution of its intracluster medium (icm) gasproperties, and through them we assess the effect of different (sub-grid)modelling of the physical processes at play, namely gas cooling, starformation, feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (agn). morespecifically we show that agn feedback plays a major role in the pre-heating ofthe proto-cluster as it prevents a high concentration of mass from collectingin the center of the future galaxy cluster at early times. however, agnactivity during the cluster's later evolution is also required to regulate themass flow into its core and prevent runaway star formation in the centralgalaxy. whereas the energy deposited by supernovae alone is insufficient toprevent an overcooling catastrophe, supernovae are responsible for spreading alarge amount of metals at high redshift, enhancing the cooling efficiency ofthe icm gas. as the agn energy release depends on the accretion rate of gasonto its central black hole engine, the agn responds to this supernova enhancedgas accretion by injecting more energy into the surrounding gas, and as aresult increases the amount of early pre-heating. we demonstrate that theinteraction between an agn jet and the icm gas that regulates the growth of theagn's bh, can naturally produce cool core clusters if we neglect metals.however, as soon as metals are allowed to contribute to the radiative cooling,only the non cool core solution is produced.

1104.1703	a simple multigrid scheme for solving the poisson equation with  arbitrary domain boundaries	we present a new multigrid scheme for solving the poisson equation withdirichlet boundary conditions on a cartesian grid with irregular domainboundaries. this scheme was developed in the context of the adaptive meshrefinement (amr) schemes based on a graded-octree data structure. the poissonequation is solved on a level-by-level basis, using a "one-way interface"scheme in which boundary conditions are interpolated from the previous coarserlevel solution. such a scheme is particularly well suited for self-gravitatingastrophysical flows requiring an adaptive time stepping strategy. byconstructing a multigrid hierarchy covering the active cells of each amr level,we have designed a memory-efficient algorithm that can benefit fully from themultigrid acceleration. we present a simple method for capturing the boundaryconditions across the multigrid hierarchy, based on a second-order accuratereconstruction of the boundaries of the multigrid levels. in case of verycomplex boundaries, small scale features become smaller than the discretizationcell size of coarse multigrid levels and convergence problems arise. we proposea simple solution to address these issues. using our scheme, the convergencerate usually depends on the grid size for complex grids, but good linearconvergence is maintained. the proposed method was successfully implemented ondistributed memory architectures in the ramses code, for which we present anddiscuss convergence and accuracy properties as well as timing performances.

1104.2037	disc heating: comparing the milky way with cosmological simulations	we present the analysis of a suite of simulations run with differentparticle-and grid-based cosmological hydrodynamical codes and compare them withobservational data of the milky way. this is the first study to makecomparisons of properties of galaxies simulated with particle and grid-basedcodes. our analysis indicates that there is broad agreement between thesedifferent modelling techniques. we study the velocity dispersion - age relationfor disc stars at z=0 and find that four of the simulations are more consistentwith observations by holmberg et al. (2008) in which the stellar disc appearsto undergo continual/secular heating. two other simulations are in betteragreement with the quillen &amp; garnett (2001) observations that suggest a"saturation" in the heating profile for young stars in the disc. none of thesimulations have thin discs as old as that of the milky way. we also analysethe kinematics of disc stars at the time of their birth for different epochs inthe galaxies' evolution and find that in some simulations old stars are borncold within the disc and are subsequently heated, while other simulationspossess old stellar populations which are born relatively hot. the models whichare in better agreement with observations of the milky way's stellar discundergo significantly lower minor-merger/assembly activity after the last majormerger - i.e. once the disc has formed. all of the simulations aresignificantly "hotter" than the milky way disc; on top of the effects ofmergers, we find a "floor" in the dispersion that is related to the underlyingtreatment of the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium, and the lowdensity threshold which such codes use for star formation. this finding hasimportant implications for all studies of disc heating that use hydrodynamicalcodes.

1106.5371	the formation of the brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological  simulations: the case for agn feedback	we use 500 pc resolution cosmological simulations of a virgo-like galaxycluster to study the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) thatforms at the center of the halo. we compared two simulations; one incorporatingonly supernovae feedback and a second that also includes prescriptions forblack hole growth and the resulting agn feedback from gas accretion. asprevious work has shown, with supernovae feedback alone we are unable toreproduce any of the observed properties of massive cluster ellipticals. theresulting bcg is rotating quickly, has a high sersic index, a strong massexcess in the center and a total central density profile falling more steeplythan isothermal. furthermore, it is far too efficient at converting most of theavailable baryons into stars which is strongly constrained by abundancematching. with a treatment of black hole dynamics and agn feedback the bcgproperties are in good agreement with data: they rotate slowly, have a coredsurface density profile, a flat or rising velocity dispersion profile and a lowstellar mass fraction. the agn provides a new mechanism to create cores inluminous elliptical galaxies; the core expands due to the combined effects ofheating from dynamical friction of sinking massive black holes and agn feedbackthat ejects gaseous material from the central regions.

1107.1483	black hole growth and agn obscuration by instability-driven inflows in  high-redshift disk galaxies fed by cold streams	disk galaxies at high redshift have been predicted to maintain high gassurface densities due to continuous feeding by intense cold streams leading toviolent gravitational instability, transient features and giant clumps.gravitational torques between the perturbations drive angular momentum out andmass in, and the inflow provides the energy for keeping strong turbulence. weuse analytic estimates of the inflow for a self-regulated unstable disk at atoomre stability parameter q~1, and isolated galaxy simulations capable ofresolving the nuclear inflow down to the central parsec. we predict an averageinflow rate ~10 msun/yr through the disk of a 10^11 msun galaxy, withconditions representative of z~2 stream-fed disks. the inflow rate scales withdisk mass and (1+z)^{3/2}. it includes clump migration and inflow of thesmoother component, valid even if clumps disrupt. this inflow grows the bulge,while only a fraction ~ 10^-3 of it needs to accrete onto a central black hole(bh), in order to obey the observed bh-bulge relation. a galaxy of 10^11 msunat z~2 is expected to host a bh of ~10^8 msun, accreting on average withmoderate sub-eddington luminosity l_x ~ 10^42-43 erg/s, accompanied by brighterepisodes when dense clumps coalesce. we note that in rare massive galaxies atz~6, the same process may feed 10^9 msun bh at the eddington rate. high centralgas column densities can severely obscure agn in high-redshift disks, possiblyhindering their detection in deep x-ray surveys.

1108.0110	self-regulated growth of supermassive black holes by a dual jet/heating  agn feedback mechanism: methods, tests and implications for cosmological  simulations	we develop a new sub-grid model for the growth of supermassive black holes(bhs) and their associated active galactic nuclei (agn) feedback inhydrodynamical cosmological simulations. assuming that bhs are created in theearly stages of galaxy formation, they grow by mergers and accretion of gas ata eddington-limited bondi accretion rate. however this growth is regulated byagn feedback which we model using two different modes: a quasar-heating modewhen accretion rates onto the bhs are comparable to the eddington rate, and aradio-jet mode at lower accretion rates. in other words, our feedback modeldeposits energy as a succession of thermal bursts and jet outflows depending onthe properties of the gas surrounding the bhs. we assess the plausibility ofsuch a model by comparing our results to observational measurements of thecoevolution of bhs and their host galaxy properties, and check their robustnesswith respect to numerical resolution. we show that agn feedback must be acrucial physical ingredient for the formation of massive galaxies as it appearsto be the only physical mechanism able to efficiently prevent the accumulationof and/or expel cold gas out of halos/galaxies and significantly suppress starformation. our model predicts that the relationship between bhs and their hostgalaxy mass evolves as a function of redshift, because of the vigorousaccretion of cold material in the early universe that drives eddington-limitedaccretion onto bhs. quasar activity is also enhanced at high redshift. however,as structures grow in mass and lose their cold material through star formationand efficient bh feedback ejection, the agn activity in the low-redshiftuniverse becomes more and more dominated by the radio mode, which powers jetsthrough the hot circum-galactic medium.

1110.1379	ecosmog: an efficient code for simulating modified gravity	we introduce a new code, ecosmog, to run n-body simulations for a wide classof modified gravity and dynamical dark energy theories. these theoriesgenerally have one or more new dynamical degrees of freedom, the dynamics ofwhich are governed by their (usually rather nonlinear) equations of motion.solving these non-linear equations has been a great challenge in cosmology. ourcode is based on the ramses code, which solves the poisson equation onadaptively refined meshes to gain high resolutions in the high-density regions.we have added a solver for the extra degree(s) of freedom and performednumerous tests for the f(r) gravity model as an example to show itsreliability. we find that much higher efficiency could be achieved comparedwith other existing mesh/grid-based codes thanks to two new features of thepresent code: (1) the efficient parallelisation and (2) the usage of themultigrid relaxation to solve the extra equation(s) on both the regular domaingrid and refinements, giving much faster convergence even under much morestringent convergence criteria. this code is designed for performinghigh-accuracy, high-resolution and large-volume cosmological simulations formodified gravity and general dark energy theories, which can be utilised totest gravity and the dark energy hypothesis using the upcoming and future deepand high-resolution galaxy surveys.

1110.6086	hydrodynamics of galaxy mergers with supermassive black holes: is there  a last parsec problem ?	we study the formation of a supermassive black hole (smbh) binary and theshrinking of the separation of the two holes to sub-pc scales starting from arealistic major merger between two gas-rich spiral galaxies with masscomparable to our milky way. the simulations, carried out with the adaptivemesh refinement (amr) code ramses, are capable of resolving separations assmall as 0.1 pc. the collision of the two galaxies produces a gravo-turbulentrotating nuclear disk with mass (10^9 msun) and size (60 pc) in excellentagreement with previous sph simulations with particle splitting that used asimilar setup (mayer et al. 2007) but were limited to separations of a fewparsecs. the amr results confirm that the two black holes sink rapidly as aresult of dynamical friction onto the gaseous background, reaching a separationof 1 pc in less than 10^7 yr. we show that the dynamical friction wake is wellresolved by our model and we find good agreement with analytical predictions ofthe drag force as a function of the mach number. below 1 pc, black hole pairingslows down significantly, as the relative velocity between the sinking smbhbecomes highly subsonic and the mass contained within their orbit falls belowthe mass of the binary itself, rendering dynamical friction ineffective. inthis final stage, the black holes have not opened a gap as the gaseousbackground is highly pressurized in the center. non-axisymmetric gas torques donot arise to restart sinking in absence of efficient dynamical friction, atvariance with previous calculations using idealized equilibrium nuclear diskmodels.

1110.6209	co-planar streams, pancakes, and angular-momentum exchange in high-z  disc galaxies	we study the feeding of massive galaxies at high redshift through streamsfrom the cosmic web using the mare nostrum hydro-cosmological simulation. ourstatistical sample consists of 350 dark-matter haloes of ~10^12 msun at z =2.5. we find that ~70% of the influx into the virial radius rv is in narrowstreams covering 10% of the virial shell. on average 64% of the stream influxis in one stream, and 95% is in three dominant streams. the streams that feed amassive halo tend to lie in a plane that extends from half to a few rv,hereafter "the stream plane" (sp). the streams are typically embedded in a thinsheet of low-entropy gas, a zel'dovich pancake, which carries ~20% of theinflux into rv. the filaments-in-a-plane configuration about the massive haloesat the nodes of the cosmic web differs from the large- scale structure of theweb where the filaments mark the intersections of slanted sheets. the streamplane is only weakly aligned with the angular momentum (am) near rv, consistentwith the fact that typically 80% of the am is carried by one dominant stream.the galactic disc plane shows a weak tendency to be perpendicular to thelarge-scale sp, consistent with tidal-torque theory. most interesting, thedirection of the disc am is only weakly correlated with the am direction at rv.this indicates a significant am exchange at the interphase between streams anddisc in the greater environment of the disc inside an "am sphere" of radius~0.3rv . the required large torques are expected based on the perturbedmorphology and kinematics within this interaction sphere. this am exchange mayor may not require a major modification of the standard disc modeling based onam conservation, depending on the extent to which the amplitude of the disc amis affected, which is yet to be studied.

1112.2752	the effects of baryon physics, black holes and agn feedback on the mass  distribution in clusters of galaxies	the spatial distribution of matter in clusters of galaxies is mainlydetermined by the dominant dark matter component, however, physical processesinvolving baryonic matter are able to modify it significantly. we analyse a setof 500 pc resolution cosmological simulations of a cluster of galaxies withmass comparable to virgo, performed with the amr code ramses. we compare themass density profiles of the dark, stellar and gaseous matter components of thecluster that result from different assumptions for the subgrid baryonic physicsand galaxy formation processes. first, the prediction of a gravity only n-bodysimulation is compared to that of a hydrodynamical simulation with standardgalaxy formation recipes, then all results are compared to a hydrodynamicalsimulation which includes thermal agn feedback from super massive black holes(smbh). we find the usual effects of overcooling and adiabatic contraction inthe run with standard galaxy formation physics, but very different results arefound when implementing smbhs and agn feedback. star formation is stronglyquenched, producing lower stellar densities throughout the cluster, and muchless cold gas is available for star formation at low redshifts. at redshift z =0 we find a flat density core of radius 10 kpc in both of the dark and stellarmatter density profiles. we specu- late on the possible formation mechanismsable to produce such cores and we conclude that they can be produced throughthe coupling of different processes: (i) dynamical friction from the decay ofblack hole orbits during galaxy mergers; (ii) agn driven gas outflows producingfluctuations of the gravitational potential causing the removal ofcollisionless matter from the central region of the cluster; (iii) adiabaticexpansion in response to the slow expulsion of gas from the central region ofthe cluster during the quiescent mode of agn activity.

1201.0816	radiatively efficient magnetized bondi accretion	we have carried out a numerical study of the effect of large scale magneticfields on the rate of accretion from a uniform, isothermal gas onto aresistive, stationary point mass. only mass, not magnetic flux, accretes ontothe point mass. the simulations for this study avoid complications arising fromboundary conditions by keeping the boundaries far from the accreting object.our simulations leverage adaptive refinement methodology to attain high spatialfidelity close to the accreting object. our results are particularly relevantto the problem of star formation from a magnetized molecular cloud in whichthermal energy is radiated away on time scales much shorter than the dynamicaltime scale. contrary to the adiabatic case, our simulations show convergencetoward a finite accretion rate in the limit in which the radius of theaccreting object vanishes, regardless of magnetic field strength. for very weakmagnetic fields, the accretion rate first approaches the bondi value and thendrops by a factor ~ 2 as magnetic flux builds up near the point mass. forstrong magnetic fields, the steady-state accretion rate is reduced by a factor~ 0.2 \beta^{1/2} compared to the bondi value, where \beta is the ratio of thegas pressure to the magnetic pressure. we give a simple expression for theaccretion rate as a function of the magnetic field strength. approximateanalytic results are given in the appendixes for both time-dependent accretionin the limit of weak magnetic fields and steady-state accretion for the case ofstrong magnetic fields.

1201.1079	a diversity of progenitors and histories for isolated spiral galaxies	we analyze a suite of 33 cosmological simulations of the evolution of milkyway-mass galaxies in low-density environments. our sample spans a broad rangeof hubble types at z=0, from nearly bulgeless disks to bulge-dominatedgalaxies. despite the fact that a large fraction of the bulge is typically inplace by z=1, we find no significant correlation between the morphology at z=1and at z=0. the z=1 progenitors of disk galaxies span a range of morphologies,including smooth disks, unstable disks, interacting galaxies andbulge-dominated systems. by z=0.5, spiral arms and bars are largely in placeand the progenitor morphology is correlated with the final morphology. we nextfocus on late-type galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio b/t&lt;0.3 at z=0. theseshow a correlation between b/t at z=0 and the mass ratio of the largest mergerat z&lt;2, as well as with the gas accretion rate at z&gt;1. we find that thegalaxies with the lowest b/t tend to have a quiet baryon input history, with nomajor mergers at z&lt;2, and with a low and constant gas accretion rate that keepsa stable angular-momentum direction. more violent merger or gas accretionhistories lead to galaxies with more prominent bulges. most disk galaxies havea bulge sersic index n&lt;2. the galaxies with the highest bulge sersic index tendto have histories of intense gas accretion and disk instability rather thanactive mergers.

1204.4121	indirect dark matter searches: towards a consistent top-bottom approach  for studying the gamma-ray signals and associated backgrounds	while dark matter (dm) is the key ingredient for a successful theory ofstructure formation, its microscopic nature remains elusive. indirect detectionmay provide a powerful test for some strongly motivated dm particle models.nevertheless, astrophysical backgrounds are usually expected with amplitudesand spectral features similar to the chased signals. on galactic scales, thesebackgrounds arise from interactions of cosmic rays (crs) with the interstellargas, both being difficult to infer and model in detail from observations.moreover, the associated predictions unavoidably come with theoretical errors,which are known to be significant. we show that a trustworthy guide for suchchallenging searches can be obtained by exploiting the full informationcontained in cosmological simulations of galaxies, which now include baryonicgas dynamics and star formation. we further insert cr production and transportfrom the identified supernova events and fully calculate the cr distribution ina simulated galaxy. we focus on diffuse gamma-rays, and self-consistentlycalculate both the astrophysical galactic emission and the dark matter signal.we notably show that adiabatic contraction does not necessarily induce largesignal-to-noise ratios in galactic centers, and could anyway be traced from theastrophysical background itself. we finally discuss how all this may be used asa generic diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.

1206.4895	cusp-core transformations in dwarf galaxies: observational predictions	the presence of a dark matter core in the central kiloparsec of many dwarfgalaxies has been a long standing problem in galaxy formation theories based onthe standard cold dark matter paradigm. recent cosmological simulations, basedon smooth particle hydrodynamics and rather strong feedback recipes have shownthat it was indeed possible to form extended dark matter cores using baryonicprocesses related to a more realistic treatment of the interstellar medium.using adaptive mesh refinement, together with a new, stronger supernovaefeedback scheme that we have recently implemented in the ramses code, we showthat it is also possible to form a prominent dark matter core within thewell-controlled framework of an isolated, initially cuspy, 10 billion solarmasses dark matter halo. although our numerical experiment is idealized, itallows a clean and unambiguous identification of the dark matter core formationprocess. our dark matter inner profile is well fitted by a pseudo-isothermalprofile with a core radius of 800 pc. the core formation mechanism isconsistent with the one proposed recently by pontzen &amp; governato. we highlighttwo key observational predictions of all simulations that find cusp-coretransformations: (i) a bursty star formation history with peak to trough ratioof 5 to 10 and a duty cycle comparable to the local dynamical time; and (ii) astellar distribution that is hot with v/sigma=1. we compare the observationalproperties of our model galaxy with recent measurements of the isolated dwarfwlm. we show that the spatial and kinematical distribution of stars and hi gasare in striking agreement with observations, supporting the fundamental roleplayed by stellar feedback in shaping both the stellar and dark matterdistribution.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1304.7126	ramses-rt: radiation hydrodynamics in the cosmological context	we present a new implementation of radiation hydrodynamics (rhd) in theadaptive mesh refinement (amr) code ramses. the multi-group radiative transfer(rt) is performed on the amr grid with a first-order godunov method using them1 closure for the eddington tensor, and is coupled to the hydrodynamics vianon-equilibrium thermochemistry of hydrogen and helium. this moment-basedapproach has the large advantage that the computational cost is independent ofthe number of radiative sources - it can even deal with continuous regions ofemission such as bound-free emission from gas. as it is built directly intoramses, the rt takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelizationstrategies already in place. since we use an explicit advection solver for theradiative transport, the time step is restricted by the speed of light - asevere limitation that can be alleviated using the so--called "reduced speed oflight" approximation. we propose a rigorous framework to assess the validity ofthis approximation in various conditions encountered in cosmology and galaxyformation. we finally perform with our newly developed code a complete suite ofrhd tests, comparing our results to other rhd codes. the tests demonstrate thatour code performs very well and is ideally suited for exploring the effect ofradiation on current scenarios of structure and galaxy formation.

1306.2641	beyond the nuclear starburst? clustered star formation in major mergers	recent simulation work has successfully captured the formation of the starclusters that have been observed in merging galaxies. these studies, however,tend to focus on studying extreme starbursts, such as the antennae galaxies. weaim to establish whether there is something special occurring in these extremesystems or whether the mechanism for cluster formation is present in allmergers to a greater or lesser degree. we undertake a general study ofmerger-induced star formation in a sample of 5 pc resolution adaptive meshrefinement simulations of low redshift equal-mass mergers with randomly-chosenorbital parameters. we find that there is an enhanced mass fraction of verydense gas that appears as the gas density probability density function evolvesduring the merger. this finding has implications for the interpretation of someobservations; a larger mass fraction of dense gas could account for theenhanced hcn/co ratios seen in ulirgs and predicts that alpha_co is lower inmergers, as for a given mass of h_2, co emission will increase in a denserenvironment. we also find that as the star formation rate increases, there is acorrelated peak in the velocity dispersion of the gas, which we attribute toincreasing turbulence driven by the interaction itself. star formation tends tobe clumpy: in some cases there is extended clumpy star formation, but even whenstar formation is concentrated within the inner kpc (i.e. what may beconsidered a nuclear starburst) it still often has a clumpy, rather than asmooth, distribution. we find no strong evidence for a clear bimodality in thekennicutt-schmidt relation for the average mergers simulated here. instead,they are typically somewhat offset above the predicted quiescent relationduring their starbursts.

1307.7136	the long lives of giant clumps and the birth of outflows in gas-rich  galaxies at high redshift	star-forming disk galaxies at high redshift are often subject to violent diskinstability, characterized by giant clumps whose fate is yet to be understood.the main question is whether the clumps disrupt within their dynamicaltimescale (&lt;50myr), like molecular clouds in today's galaxies, or whether theysurvive stellar feedback for more than a disk orbital time (~300myr) in whichcase they can migrate inward and help building the central bulge. we present3.5-7pc resolution amr simulations of high-redshift disks includingphoto-ionization, radiation pressure, and supernovae feedback (renaud et al.2013, and perret et al., this astro-ph issue). our modeling of radiationpressure determines the mass loading and initial velocity of winds from basicphysical principles. we find that the giant clumps produce steady outflow ratescomparable to and sometimes somewhat larger than their star formation rate,with velocities largely sufficient to escape galaxy. the clumps also lose mass,especially old stars, by tidal stripping, and the stellar populations containedin the clumps hence remain relatively young (&lt;=200myr), as observed. the clumpssurvive gaseous outflows and stellar loss, because they are wandering ingas-rich turbulent disks from which they can re-accrete gas at high ratescompensating for outflows and tidal stripping, overall keeping realistic andself-regulated gaseous and stellar masses. our simulations produce gaseousoutflows with velocities, densities and mass loading consistent withobservations, and at the same time suggest that the giant clumps survive forhundreds of myr and complete their migration to the center of high-redshiftgalaxies, without rapid dispersion and reformation of clumps.

1308.6321	a systematic look at the effects of radiative feedback on disc galaxy  formation	galaxy formation models and simulations rely on various feedback mechanismsto reproduce the observed baryonic scaling relations and galaxy morphologies.although dwarf galaxy and giant elliptical properties can be explained usingfeedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei, milky way-sized galaxiesstill represent a challenge to current theories of galaxy formation. in thispaper, we explore the possible role of feedback from stellar radiation inregulating the main properties of disk galaxies such as our own milky way. wehave performed a suite of cosmological simulations of the same $\sim10^{12}{\rm m}_{\odot}$ halo selected based on its rather typical mass accretionhistory. we have implemented radiative feedback from young stars using a crudemodel of radiative transfer for ultraviolet (uv) and infrared (ir) radiation.however, the model is realistic enough such that the dust opacity plays adirect role in regulating the efficiency of our feedback mechanism. we haveexplored various models for the dust opacity, assuming different constant dusttemperatures, as well as a varying dust temperature model. we find that whilestrong radiative feedback appears as a viable mechanism to regulate the stellarmass fraction in massive galaxies, it also prevents the formation of discs withreasonable morphologies. in models with strong stellar radiation feedback,stellar discs are systematically too thick while the gas disc morphology iscompletely destroyed due to the efficient mixing between the feedback-affectedgas and its surroundings. at the resolution of our simulation suite, we find itimpossible to preserve spiral disc morphology while at the same time expellingenough baryons to satisfy the abundance matching constraints.

1402.1165	dancing in the dark: galactic properties trace spin swings along the  cosmic web	a large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, horizon-agn, is used toinvestigate the alignment between the spin of galaxies and the cosmic filamentsabove redshift 1.2. the analysis of more than 150 000 galaxies per time step inthe redshift range 1.2&lt;z&lt;1.8 with morphological diversity shows that the spinof low-mass blue galaxies is preferentially aligned with their neighbouringfilaments, while high-mass red galaxies tend to have a perpendicular spin. thereorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers,which are significant in their mass build-up. we find that the stellar masstransition from alignment to misalignment happens around 3.10^10 m_sun.galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migratetowards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angularmomentum into spin. the signature of this process can be traced to theproperties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. we argue that astrong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quenchin situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various morphologies. itallows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and,therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.

1402.1680	the role of turbulence in star formation laws and thresholds	the schmidt-kennicutt relation links the surface densities of gas to the starformation rate in galaxies. the physical origin of this relation, and inparticular its break, i.e. the transition between an inefficient regime at lowgas surface densities and a main regime at higher densities, remains debated.here, we study the physical origin of the star formation relations and breaksin several low-redshift galaxies, from dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. weuse numerical simulations representative of the milky way, the large and thesmall magellanic clouds with parsec up to subparsec resolution, and whichreproduce the observed star formation relations and the relative variations ofthe star formation thresholds. we analyze the role of interstellar turbulence,gas cooling, and geometry in drawing these relations, at 100 pc scale. wesuggest in particular that the existence of a break in the schmidt- kennicuttrelation could be linked to the transition from subsonic to supersonicturbulence and is independent of self-shielding effects. this transition beingconnected to the gas thermal properties and thus to the metallicity, the breakis shifted toward high surface densities in metal-poor galaxies, as observed indwarf galaxies. our results suggest that together with the collapse of cloudsunder self-gravity, turbulence (injected at galactic scale) can induce thecompression of gas and regulate star formation.

1405.0528	brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations with adaptive  mesh refinement: successes and failures	a large sample of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations withadaptive mesh refinement (amr) is analysed to study the properties of simulatedbrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). following the formation and evolution ofbcgs requires modeling an entire galaxy cluster, because the bcg properties arelargely influenced by the state of the gas in the cluster and by interactionsand mergers with satellites. bcg evolution is also deeply influenced by thepresence of gas heating sources such as active galactic nuclei (agns) thatprevent catastrophic cooling of large amounts of gas. we show that agn feedbackis one of the most important mechanisms in shaping the properties of bcgs atlow redshift by analysing our statistical sample of simulations with andwithout agn feedback. when agn feedback is included bcg masses, sizes, starformation rates and kinematic properties are closer to those of the observedsystems. some small discrepancies are observed only for the most massive bcgsand in the fraction of star-forming bcgs, effects that might be due to physicalprocesses that are not included in our model.

1408.2856	chameleon $f(r)$ gravity on the virgo cluster scale	models of modified gravity offer promising alternatives to the concordance$\lambda$cdm cosmology to explain the late-time acceleration of the universe. apopular such model is $f(r)$ gravity, in which the ricci scalar in theeinstein-hilbert action is replaced by a general function of it. we study the$f(r)$ model of hu &amp; sawicki (2007), which recovers standard general relativityin high density regimes, while reproducing the desired late-time accelerationat cosmological scales. we run a suite of high resolution zoom simulationsusing the ecosmog code to examine the effect of $f(r)$ gravity on theproperties of a halo that is analogous to the virgo cluster. we show that thevelocity dispersion profiles can potentially discriminate between $f(r)$ modelsand $\lambda$cdm, and provide complementary analysis of lensing signal profilesto explore the possibility to further distinguish the different $f(r)$ models.our results confirm the techniques explored by cabre et al. (2012) to quantifythe effect of environment in the behavior of $f(r)$ gravity, and we extend themto study halo satellites at various redshifts. we find that the modifiedgravity effects in our models are most observable at low redshifts, and thateffects are generally stronger for satellites far from the center of the mainhalo. we show that the screening properties of halo satellites trace very wellthat of dark matter particles, which means that low-resolution simulations inwhich subhalos are not very well resolved can in principle be used to studysatellite properties. we discuss observables, particularly for halo satellites,that can potentially be used to constrain the observational viability of $f(r)$gravity.

1409.6528	towards a more realistic sink particle algorithm for the ramses code	we present a new sink particle algorithm developed for the adaptive meshrefinement code ramses. our main addition is the use of a clump finder toidentify density peaks and their associated regions (the peak patches). thisallows us to unambiguously define a discrete set of dense molecular cores aspotential sites for sink particle formation. furthermore, we develop a newscheme to decide if the gas in which a sink could potentially form, is indeedgravitationally bound and rapidly collapsing. this is achieved using a generalintegral form of the virial theorem, where we use the curvature in thegravitational potential to correctly account for the background potential. wedetail all the necessary steps to follow the evolution of sink particles inturbulent molecular cloud simulations, such as sink production, theirtrajectory integration, sink merging and finally the gas accretion rate onto anexisting sink. we compare our new recipe for sink formation to other popularimplementations. statistical properties such as the sink mass function, theaverage sink mass and the sink multiplicity function are used to evaluate theimpact that our new scheme has on accurately predicting fundamental quantitiessuch as the stellar initial mass function or the stellar multiplicity function.

1410.6826	baryonic effects on weak-lensing two-point statistics and its  cosmological implications	we develop an extension of \textit{the halo model} that describesanalytically the corrections to the matter power spectrum due to the physics ofbaryons. we extend these corrections to the weak-lensing shear angular powerspectrum. within each halo, our baryonic model accounts for: 1) a centralgalaxy, the major stellar component whose properties are derived from abundancematching techniques; 2) a hot plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium and 3) anadiabatically-contracted dark matter component. this analytic approach allowsus to compare our model to the dark-matter-only case. our basic assumptions aretested against the hydrodynamical simulations of martizzi et. al. (2014), withwhich a remarkable agreement is found. our baryonic model has only one freeparameter, $m_{\rm crit}$, the critical halo mass that marks the transitionbetween feedback-dominated halos, mostly devoid of gas, and gas rich halos, inwhich agn feedback effects become weaker. we explore the entire cosmologicalparameter space, using the angular power spectrum in three redshift bins as theobservable, assuming a euclid-like survey. we derive the correspondingconstraints on the cosmological parameters, as well as the possible biasintroduced by neglecting the effects of baryonic physics. we find that, up to$\ell_{max}$=4000, baryonic physics plays very little role in the cosmologicalparameters estimation. however, if one goes up to $\ell_{max}$=8000, themarginalized errors on the cosmological parameters can be significantlyreduced, but neglecting baryonic physics can lead to bias in the recoveredcosmological parameters up to 10$\sigma$. these biases are removed if one takesinto account the main baryonic parameter, $m_{\rm crit}$, which can also bedetermined up to 1-2\%, along with the other cosmological parameters.

1501.04632	galaxies that shine: radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of disk  galaxies	radiation feedback is typically implemented using subgrid recipes inhydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. very little work has so far beenperformed using radiation-hydrodynamics (rhd), and there is no consensus on theimportance of radiation feedback in galaxy evolution. we present rhdsimulations of isolated galaxy disks of different masses with a resolution of18 pc. besides accounting for supernova feedback, our simulations are the firstgalaxy-scale simulations to include rhd treatments of photo-ionisation heatingand radiation pressure, from both direct optical/uv radiation andmulti-scattered, re-processed infrared (ir) radiation. photo-heating smoothsand thickens the disks and suppresses star formation about as much as theinclusion of ("thermal dump") supernova feedback does. these effects decreasewith galaxy mass and are mainly due to the prevention of the formation of denseclouds, as opposed to their destruction. radiation pressure, whether fromdirect or ir radiation, has little effect, but for the ir radiation we showthat its impact is limited by our inability to resolve the high optical depthsfor which multi-scattering becomes important. while artificially boosting their optical depths does reduce the star formation, it does so by smoothing thegas rather than by generating stronger outflows. we conclude that althoughhigher-resolution simulations, and potentially also different supernovaimplementations, are needed for confirmation, our findings suggest thatradiation feedback is more gentle and less effective than is often assumed insubgrid prescriptions.

1502.07356	milking the spherical cow: on aspherical dynamics in spherical  coordinates	galaxies and the dark matter halos that host them are not sphericallysymmetric, yet spherical symmetry is a helpful simplifying approximation foridealised calculations and analysis of observational data. the assumption leadsto an exact conservation of angular momentum for every particle, making thedynamics unrealistic. but how much does that inaccuracy matter in practice foranalyses of stellar distribution functions, collisionless relaxation, or darkmatter core-creation?  we provide a general answer to this question for a wide class of asphericalsystems; specifically, we consider distribution functions that are "maximallystable", i.e. that do not evolve at first order when external potentials (whicharise from baryons, large scale tidal fields or infalling substructure) areapplied. we show that a spherically-symmetric analysis of such systems givesrise to the false conclusion that the density of particles in phase space isergodic (a function of energy alone).  using this idea we are able to demonstrate that: (a) observational analysesthat falsely assume spherical symmetry are made more accurate by imposing astrong prior preference for near-isotropic velocity dispersions in the centreof spheroids; (b) numerical simulations that use an idealisedspherically-symmetric setup can yield misleading results and should be avoidedwhere possible; and (c) triaxial dark matter halos (formed in collisionlesscosmological simulations) nearly attain our maximally-stable limit, but theirevolution freezes out before reaching it.

1503.03924	rhapsody-g simulations: galaxy clusters as baryonic closed boxes and the  covariance between hot gas and galaxies	within a sufficiently large cosmic volume, conservation of baryons implies asimple `closed box' view in which the sum of the baryonic components must equala constant fraction of the total enclosed mass. we present evidence fromrhapsody-g hydrodynamic simulations of massive galaxy clusters that theclosed-box expectation may hold to a surprising degree within the interior,non-linear regions of haloes. at a fixed halo mass, we find a significantanti-correlation between hot gas mass fraction and galaxy mass fraction (coldgas + stars), with a rank correlation coefficient of -0.69 within $r_{500c}$.because of this anti-correlation, the total baryon mass serves as a low-scatterproxy for total cluster mass. the fractional scatter of total baryon fractionscales approximately as $0.02 (\delta_c/100)^{0.6}$, while the scatter ofeither gas mass or stellar mass is larger in magnitude and declines more slowlywith increasing radius. we discuss potential observational tests using clustersamples selected by optical and hot gas properties; the simulations suggestthat joint selection on stellar and hot gas has potential to achieve 5% scatterin total halo mass.

1504.00018	black hole evolution: i. supernova-regulated black hole growth	the growth of a supermassive black hole (bh) is determined by how much gasthe host galaxy is able to feed it, which in turn is controlled by the cosmicenvironment, through galaxy mergers and accretion of cosmic flows that time howgalaxies obtain their gas, but also by internal processes in the galaxy, suchas star formation and feedback from stars and the bh itself. in this paper, westudy the growth of a 10^12 msun halo at z=2, which is the progenitor of algroup of galaxies at z=0, and of its central bh by means of a high-resolutionzoomed cosmological simulation, the seth simulation. we study the evolution ofthe bh driven by the accretion of cold gas in the galaxy, and explore theefficiency of the feedback from supernovae (sne). for a relatively inefficientenergy input from sne, the bh grows at the eddington rate from early times, andreaches self-regulation once it is massive enough. we find that at early cosmictimes z&gt;3.5, efficient feedback from sne forbids the formation of a settleddisc as well as the accumulation of dense cold gas in the vicinity of the bhand starves the central compact object. as the galaxy and its halo accumulatemass, they become able to confine the nuclear inflows provided by major mergersand the bh grows at a sustained near-to-eddington accretion rate. we argue thatthis mechanism should be ubiquitous amongst low-mass galaxies, corresponding togalaxies with a stellar mass below &lt;10^9 msun in our simulations.

0805.1693	cosmic velocity--gravity relation in redshift space	we propose a simple way to estimate the parameter beta = omega_m^(0.6)/b fromthree-dimensional galaxy surveys. our method consists in measuring the relationbetween the cosmological velocity and gravity fields, and thus requirespeculiar velocity measurements. the relation is measured *directly in redshiftspace*, so there is no need to reconstruct the density field in real space. inlinear theory, the radial components of the gravity and velocity fields inredshift space are expected to be tightly correlated, with a slope given, inthe distant observer approximation, by g / v = (1 + 6 beta / 5 + 3 beta^2 /7)^(1/2) / beta. we test extensively this relation using controlled numericalexperiments based on a cosmological n-body simulation. to perform themeasurements, we propose a new and rather simple adaptive interpolation schemeto estimate the velocity and the gravity field on a grid. one of the moststriking results is that nonlinear effects, including `fingers of god', affectmainly the tails of the joint probability distribution function (pdf) of thevelocity and gravity field: the 1--1.5 sigma region around the maximum of thepdf is *dominated by the linear theory regime*, both in real and redshiftspace. this is understood explicitly by using the spherical collapse model as aproxy of nonlinear dynamics. applications of the method to real galaxy catalogsare discussed, including a preliminary investigation on homogeneous (volumelimited) `galaxy' samples extracted from the simulation with simpleprescriptions based on halo and sub-structure identification, to quantify theeffects of the bias between the galaxy and the total matter distibution, and ofshot noise (abridged).

1506.00849	a small-scale dynamo in feedback-dominated galaxies as the origin of  cosmic magnetic fields. i-the kinematic phase	astrophysical dynamo theories provide various mechanisms for magnetic fieldamplification inside galaxies, where weak initial fields grow exponentially onvarious timescales. we investigate the particular role played by stellarfeedback mechanisms in creating strong fluid turbulence, allowing for amagnetic dynamo to emerge. performing magnetohydrodynamic simulations ofisolated cooling halos, for both dwarf and milky way sized objects, we comparethe magnetic field evolution for various initial field topologies and variousstellar feedback mechanisms. we find that feedback can indeed drive strong gasturbulence which gives rise to a fast exponential magnetic field growth. oursimulations feature typical properties of kolmogorov turbulence with a $k^{-5/3}$ kinetic energy spectrum, as well as the characteristic properties of asmall-scale dynamo, with a $k^{3/2}$ magnetic energy spectrum as predicted bykazantsev dynamo theory. in these feedback-dominated galaxies, stellar feedbackprovides forcing on large scales close to the halo scale radius, providing thusexponential field growth on all scales within the galaxy. we also investigatesimulations with a final quiescent phase by manually turning off the feedback.as turbulence decreases, the galactic fountain settles into a thin,rotationally supported disk. the magnetic field develops a large-scale,well-ordered structure with quadrupole symmetry, irrespective of the initialfield topology, which is in good agreement with magnetic field observations ofnearby spirals. our findings suggest that weak initial seed fields were firstamplified by a small-scale dynamo during a violent, feedback-dominated earlyphase in the galaxy formation history, followed by a more quiescent evolution,where the fields have slowly decayed or were maintained via large-scale dynamoaction.

(2015): radiative physics +classic sph can produce entropy cores. furthermore, the inclusion/absence ofagn feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellarcontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and afalling central entropy profile. however, agn feedback does strongly affect theoverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducingsensibly the stellar fraction.

astro-ph;0611419	metal enrichment in galactic winds	observations give evidences of the presence of metals in the intergalacticmedium (igm). the stars responsible for transforming hydrogen and helium intomore complex atoms do not form outside the galaxies in the standard scenario ofgalaxy formation. supernovae-driven winds and their associated feedback wasproposed as a possible solution to explain such enrichment of the igm. itturned out that a proper modelling of supernovae explosions within a turbulentinterstellar medium (ism) is a difficult task. recent advances have beenobtained using a multiphase approach to solve for the thermal state of the ism,plus some additional recipes to account for the kinetic effect of supernovae onthe galactic gas. we briefly describe here our implementation of supernovaefeedback within the ramses code, and apply it to the formation and evolution ofisolated galaxies of various masses and angular momenta. we have explored underwhat conditions a galactic wind can develop, if one considers only a quiescentmode of star formation. we have also characterized the distribution andevolution of metallicity in the gas outflow spreading in the igm.

astro-ph;9704023	non-linear dynamics and mass function of cosmic structures: i analytical  results	we investigate some modifications to the press &amp; schechter (1974) (ps)prescription resulting from shear and tidal effects. these modifications relyon more realistic treatments of the collapse process than the standard approachbased on the spherical model.  first, we show that the mass function resulting from a new approximatelagrangian dynamic (audit &amp; alimi 96), contains more objects at high mass, thanthe classical ps mass function and is well fitted by a ps-like function with athreshold density of $\delta_c \simeq 1.4$. however, such a lagrangiandescription can underestimate the epoch of structure formation since it definesit as the collapse of the first principal axis. we therefore suggest someanalytical prescriptions, for computing the collapse time along the second andthird principal axes, and we deduce the corresponding mass functions. thecollapse along the third axis is delayed by the shear and the number of objectsof high mass then decreases.  finally, we show that the shear also strongly affects the formation oflow-mass halos. this dynamical effect implies a modification of the low-massslope of the mass function and allows the reproduction of the observedluminosity function of field galaxies. in a companion paper, we present resultsof numerical simulations which complete this work.

astro-ph;9704033	gas and dark matter spherical dynamics	we investigate the formation of spherical cosmological structures followingboth dark matter and gas components. we focus on the dynamical aspect of thecollapse assuming an adiabatic, $\gamma = 5/3$, fully ionized primordialplasma. we use for that purpose a fully lagrangian hydrodynamical code designedto describe highly compressible flows in spherical geometry. we investigatealso a "fluid approach" to describe the mean physical quantities of the darkmatter flow. we test its validity for a wide range of initial density contrast.we show that an homogeneous isentropic core forms in the gas distribution,surrounded by a self-similar hydrostatic halo, with much higher entropygenerated by shock dissipation. we derive analytical expressions for the size,density and temperature of the core, as well as for the surrounding halo. weshow that, unless very efficient heating processes occur in the intergalacticmedium, we are unable to reproduce within adiabatic models the typical coresizes in x-ray clusters. we also show that, for dynamical reasons only, the gasdistribution is naturally antibiased relative to the total mass distribution,without invoking any reheating processes. this could explain why the gasfraction increases with radius in very large x-ray clusters. as a preparationfor the next study devoted to the thermodynamical aspect of the collapse, weinvestigate the initial entropy level required to solve the core problem inx-ray clusters.

astro-ph;9704034	self similar spherical collapse revisited: a comparison between gas and  dark matter dynamics	we reconsider the collapse of cosmic structures in an einstein-de sitteruniverse, using the self similar initial conditions of fillmore &amp; goldreich(1984). we first derive a new approximation to describe the dark matterdynamics in spherical geometry, that we refer to the "fluid approach". thismethod enables us to recover the self-similarity solutions of fillmore &amp;goldreich for dark matter. we derive also new self-similarity solutions for thegas. we thus compare directly gas and dark matter dynamics, focusing on thedifferences due to their different dimensionalities in velocity space. thiswork may have interesting consequences for gas and dark matter distributions inlarge galaxy clusters, allowing to explain why the total mass profile is alwayssteeper than the x-ray gas profile. we discuss also the shape of the darkmatter density profile found in n-body simulations in terms of a change ofdimensionality in the dark matter velocity space. the stable clusteringhypothesis has been finally considered in the light of this analyticalapproach.

0810.1741	large scale galactic turbulence: can self-gravity drive the observed hi  velocity dispersions?	observations of turbulent velocity dispersions in the hi component ofgalactic disks show a characteristic floor in galaxies with low star formationrates and within individual galaxies the dispersion profiles decline withradius. we carry out several high resolution adaptive mesh simulations ofgaseous disks embedded within dark matter haloes to explore the roles ofcooling, star-formation, feedback, shearing motions and baryon fraction indriving turbulent motions. in all simulations the disk slowly cools untilgravitational and thermal instabilities give rise to a multi-phase medium inwhich a large population of dense self-gravitating cold clouds are embeddedwithin a warm gaseous phase that forms through shock heating. the diffuse gasis highly turbulent and is an outcome of large scale driving of globalnon-axisymmetric modes as well as cloud-cloud tidal interactions and merging.at low star-formation rates these processes alone can explain the observed hivelocity dispersion profiles and the characteristic value of ~10 km/s observedwithin a wide range of disk galaxies. supernovae feedback creates a significanthot gaseous phase and is an important driver of turbulence in galaxies with astar-formation rate per unit area &gt;10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2.
