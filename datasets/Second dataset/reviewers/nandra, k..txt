0902.0363	aegis: the clustering of x-ray agn relative to galaxies at z~1	we measure the clustering of non-quasar x-ray agn at z=0.7-1.4 in the aegisfield. using the cross-correlation of 113 chandra-selected agn, with a medianlog l_x=42.8 erg s^-1, with ~5,000 deep2 galaxies, we find that the x-ray agnare fit by a power law with a clustering scale length of r_0=5.95 +/-0.90 h^-1mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. x-ray agn have a similar clustering amplitudeas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantlymore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. the x-ray agn clusteringstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; agn in red hostgalaxies are significantly more clustered than agn in blue host galaxies, witha relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue deep2 galaxies. wedetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, x-ray luminosity, orhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. we find evidence for galaxieshosting x-ray agn to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matchingjoint optical color and magnitude distributions. this implies that galaxieshosting x-ray agn are more likely to reside in groups and more massive darkmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an x-rayagn. in comparison to optically-selected quasars in the deep2 fields, we findthat x-ray agn at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (witha 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive darkmatter halos. our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasarphase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with alower-luminosity x-ray agn, if they are similar objects at differentevolutionary stages.

0904.3747	host galaxy morphologies of x-ray selected agn: assessing the  significance of different black hole fueling mechanisms to the accretion  density of the universe at z~1	we use morphological information of x-ray selected agn hosts to set limits onthe fraction of the accretion density of the universe at z~1 that is not likelyto be associated with major mergers. deep x-ray observations are combined withhigh resolution optical data from the hubble space telescope in the aegis,goods north and goods south fields to explore the morphological breakdown ofx-ray sources in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. the sample is split intodisks, early-type bulge dominated galaxies, peculiar systems and point-sourcesin which the nuclear source outshines the host galaxy. the x-ray luminosityfunction and luminosity density of agn at z~1 are then calculated as a functionof morphological type. we find that disk-dominated hosts contribute 30\pm9 percent to the total agn space density and 23\pm6 per cent to the luminositydensity at z~1. we argue that agn in disk galaxies are most likely fueled notby major merger events but by minor interactions or internal instabilities. wefind evidence that these mechanisms may be more efficient in producing luminousagn (l_x&gt;1e44 erg/s) compared to predictions for the stochastic fueling ofmassive black holes in disk galaxies.

0906.4461	evolution of the x-ray luminosity in young hii galaxies	in an effort to understand the correlation between x-ray emission and presentstar formation rate (sfr), we obtained xmm-newton data to estimate the x-rayluminosities of a sample of actively starforming hii galaxies. the obtainedx-ray luminosities are compared to other well known tracers of star formationactivity such as the far infrared and the ultraviolet luminosities. we alsocompare the obtained results with empirical laws from the literature and withrecently published analysis applying synthesis models. we use the time delaybetween the formation of the stellar cluster and that of the first x-raybinaries, in order to put limits on the age of a given stellar burst. weconclude that the generation of soft x-rays, as well as the ha or infraredluminosities is instantaneous. the relation between the observed radio and hardx-ray luminosities, on the other hand, points to the existence of a time delaybetween the formation of the stellar cluster and the explosion of the firstmassive stars and the consequent formation of supernova remnants and high massx-ray binaries (hmxb) which originate the radio and hard x-ray fluxesrespectively. when comparing hard x-rays with a star formation indicator thattraces the first million years of evolution (e.g. ha luminosities) we found adeficit in the expected x-ray luminosity. this deficit is not found when thex-ray luminosities are compared with infrared luminosities, a star formationtracer that represents an average over the last 10^8 years. the results supportthe hypothesis that hard x-rays are originated in x-ray binaries which, assupernova remnants, have a formation time delay of a few mega years after thestarforming burst.

0906.4938	testing the starburst/agn connection with swire x-ray/70 micron sources	we explore the nature of x-ray sources with 70 micron counterparts selectedin the swire fields elais-n1, lockman hole and chandra deep field south, forwhich chandra x-ray data are available. a total of 28 x-ray/70 micron sourcesin the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3 are selected. the x-ray luminosities and theshape of the x-ray spectra show that these sources are agn. modelling of theoptical to far-infrared spectral energy distribution indicates that most ofthem (27/28) have a strong starburst component (&gt;50 solar masses per year) thatdominates in the infrared. it is found that the x-ray and infrared luminositiesof the sample sources are broadly correlated, consistent with a link betweenagn activity and star-formation. contrary to the predictions of some models forthe co-evolution of agn and galaxies, the x-ray/70 micron sources in the sampleare not more obscured at x-ray wavelengths compared to the overall x-raypopulation. it is also found that the x-ray/70 micron sources have lowerspecific star-formation rates compared to the general 70 micron population,consistent with agn feedback moderating the star-formation in the hostgalaxies.

0910.1141	the evolution of the hard x-ray luminosity function of agn	we present new observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10kevx-ray luminosity function (xlf) of agn. we utilise data from a number ofsurveys including both the 2ms chandra deep fields and the aegis-x 200kssurvey, enabling accurate measurements of the evolution of the faint end of thexlf. we combine direct, hard x-ray selection and spectroscopic follow-up orphotometric redshift estimates at z&lt;1.2 with a rest-frame uv colourpre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated withcatastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. only robust opticalcounterparts to x-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matchingtechnique. a bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshiftprobability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our highredshift samples, and allows robust comparison of different evolutionarymodels. we find that the xlf retains the same shape at all redshifts, butundergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z~1, and an overall negativedensity evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolutionat earlier times. we do not find evidence that a luminosity-dependent densityevolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required todescribe the evolution of the xlf. we find significantly higher space densitiesof low-luminosity, high-redshift agn than in prior studies, and a smaller shiftin the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasingluminosity. the total luminosity density of agn peaks at z=1.2+/-0.1, but thereis a mild decline to higher redshifts. we find &gt;50% of black hole growth takesplace at z&gt;1, with around half in lx&lt;10^44 erg/s agn.

0707.2950	relativistic iron k emission and absorption in the seyfert 1.9 galaxy  mcg-5-23-16	we present the results of the simultaneous deep xmm and chandra observationsof the bright seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg-5-23-16, which is thought to have one ofthe best known examples of a relativistically broadened iron k-alpha line. thetime averaged spectral analysis shows that the iron k-shell complex is bestmodeled with an unresolved narrow emission component (fwhm &lt; 5000 km/s, ew ~ 60ev) plus a broad component. this latter component has fwhm ~ 44000 km/s and ew~ 50 ev. its profile is well described by an emission line originating from anaccretion disk viewed with an inclination angle ~ 40^\circ and with theemission arising from within a few tens of gravitational radii of the centralblack hole. the time-resolved spectral analysis of the xmm epic-pn spectrumshows that both the narrow and broad components of the fe k emission lineappear to be constant in time within the errors. we detected a narrow sporadicabsorption line at 7.7 kev which appears to be variable on a time-scale of 20ksec. if associated with fe xxvi ly-alpha this absorption is indicative of apossibly variable, high ionization, high velocity outflow. the variability ofthis absorption feature appears to rule out a local (z=0) origin. the analysisof the xmm rgs spectrum reveals that the soft x-ray emission of mcg-5-23-16 islikely dominated by several emission lines superimposed on an unabsorbedscattered power-law continuum. the lack of strong fe l shell emission togetherwith the detection of a strong forbidden line in the o vii triplet isconsistent with a scenario where the soft x-ray emission lines are produced ina plasma photoionized by the nuclear emission.

1005.3331	aegis: a multi-wavelength study of spitzer power-law galaxies	this paper analyzes a sample of 489 spitzer/irac sources in the extendedgroth strip whose spectral energy distributions fit a red power law from 3.6 to8.0 \micron. the median for sources with known redshift is &lt;z&gt;=1.6. though allor nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei, only 33%were detected in the egs x-ray survey (aegis-x) using 200 ks chandraobservations. the detected sources are x-ray luminous with l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/sand moderately to heavily obscured with n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. stacking thex-ray-undetected sample members yields a statistically significant x-raysignal, suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured thansources with x-ray detections. the ratio of x-ray to mid-infrared fluxessuggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in x-rays areobscured at the compton-thick level, in contrast to the x-ray-detected sources,all of which appear to be compton-thin. for the x-ray-detected power-lawsources with redshifts, an x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 10^44 erg/s marks atransition between low-luminosity, blue sources dominated by the host galaxy tohigh-luminosity, red power-law sources dominated by nuclear activity.x-ray-to-optical ratios, infrared variability, and 24 micron properties of thesample are consistent with the identification of infrared power-law sources asactive nuclei, but a rough estimate is that only 22% of agns are selected bythe power law criteria. comparison of the power-law selection technique andvarious irac color criteria for identifying agns confirms that high-redshiftsamples selected via simple irac colors may be heavily contaminated bystarlight-dominated objects.

0708.1305	an xmm-newton survey of broad iron lines in seyfert galaxies	we present an analysis of the x-ray spectra of a sample of 37 observations of26 seyfert galaxies observed by xmm-newton in order to characterize their ironk emission. all objects show evidence for iron line emission in the 6-7 kevband. a narrow core at 6.4 kev is seen almost universally in the spectra, andwe model this using a neutral compton reflection component, assumed to beassociated with distant, optically thick material such as the molecular torus.once this, and absorption by a zone of ionized gas in the line-of-sight isaccounted for, less than half of the sample observations show an acceptablefit. approximately 2/3 of the sample shows evidence for further, broadenedemission in the iron k-band. when modeled with a gaussian, the inferred energyis close to that expected for neutral iron, with a slight redshift, with anaverage velocity width of ~0.1c. the mean parameters are consistent withprevious asca results and support the idea that the broad components can beassociated with the accretion disk. before proceeding to that conclusion, wetest an alternative model comprising a blend of 3-4 narrow, unshifted emissionlines (including the 6.4 kev core), together with 1-2 zones of highly ionizedgas in the line-of-sight. around 1/3 of the objects are not adequately fit bythis model, and in general better fits are obtained with a relativistic diskline model, which has fewer free parameters. nonetheless we find thatabsorption by ionized gas affects the spectrum above 2.5 kev in approximatelyhalf the sample. there is evidence for multiple ionized zones in at least 3objects, but in all those cases a blurred reflector is required in addition tothe complex absorption.

1109.0287	observational constraints on the physics behind the evolution of agn  since z ~ 1	we explore the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame colours and spacedensities of agn hosts (relative to normal galaxies) to shed light on thedominant mechanism that triggers accretion onto supermassive black holes as afunction of cosmic time. data from serendipitous wide-area xmm surveys of thesdss footprint (xmm/sdss, needles in the haystack survey) are combined withchandra deep observations in the aegis, goods-north and goods-south to compileuniformly selected samples of moderate luminosity x-ray agn [l_x(2-10kev) =1e41-1e44erg/s] at redshifts 0.1, 0.3 and 0.8. it is found that the fraction ofagn hosted by red versus blue galaxies does not change with redshift. also, thex-ray luminosity density associated with either red or blue agn hosts remainsnearly constant since z=0.8. x-ray agn represent a roughly fixed fraction ofthe space density of galaxies of given optical luminosity at all redshiftsprobed by our samples. in contrast the fraction of x-ray agn among galaxies ofa given stellar mass decreases with decreasing redshift. these findings suggestthat the same process or combination of processes for fueling supermassiveblack holes are in operation in the last 5 gyrs of cosmic time. the data areconsistent with a picture in which the drop of the accretion power during thatperiod (1dex since z=0.8) is related to the decline of the space density ofavailable agn hosts, as a result of the evolution of the specificstar-formation rate of the overall galaxy population. scenarios which attributethe evolution of moderate luminosity agn since z \approx 1 to changes in thesuppermassive black hole accretion mode are not favored by our results.

1212.5076	measuring the dark matter halo mass of x-ray agn at z~1 using  photometric redshifts	data from the aegis, cosmos and ecdfs surveys are combined to infer the biasand dark matter halo mass of moderate luminosity [lx(2-10 kev) = 42.9 erg s-1]x-ray agn at z~1 via their cross-correlation function with galaxies. incontrast to standard cross-correlation function estimators, we present a methodthat requires spectroscopy only for the agn and uses photometric redshiftprobability distribution functions for galaxies to determine the projectedreal-space agn/galaxy cross-correlation function. the estimated dark matterhalo mass of x-ray agn in the combined aegis, cosmos and ecdfs fields is~13h-1m_solar, in agreement with previous studies at similar redshift andluminosity ranges. removing from the sample the 5 per cent of the agnassociated with x-ray selected groups results in a reduction by about 0.5 dexin the inferred agn dark matter halo mass. the distribution of agn in darkmatter halo mass is therefore skewed and the bulk of the population lives inmoderate mass haloes. this result favour cold gas accretion as the main channelof supermassive black hole growth for most x-ray agn.

1302.5114	x-ray groups of galaxies in the aegis deep and wide fields	we present the results of a search for extended x-ray sources and theircorresponding galaxy groups from 800-ks chandra coverage of the all-wavelengthextended groth strip international survey (aegis). this yields one of thelargest x-ray selected galaxy group catalogs from a blind survey to date. thered-sequence technique and spectroscopic redshifts allow us to identify 100$%$of reliable sources, leading to a catalog of 52 galaxy groups. the groups spanthe redshift range $z\sim0.066-1.544$ and virial mass range$m_{200}\sim1.34\times 10^{13}-1.33\times 10^{14}m_\odot$. for the 49 extendedsources which lie within deep2 and deep3 galaxy redshift survey coverage, weidentify spectroscopic counterparts and determine velocity dispersions. weselect member galaxies by applying different cuts along the line of sight or inprojected spatial coordinates. a constant cut along the line of sight can causea large scatter in scaling relations in low-mass or high-mass systems dependingon the size of cut. a velocity dispersion based virial radius can moreoverestimate velocity dispersion in comparison to x-ray based virial radius forlow mass systems. there is no significant difference between these two radialcuts for more massive systems. independent of radial cut, overestimation ofvelocity dispersion can be created in case of existence of significantsubstructure and also compactness in x-ray emission which mostly occur in lowmass systems. we also present a comparison between x-ray galaxy groups andoptical galaxy groups detected using the voronoi-delaunay method (vdm) fordeep2 data in this field.

1305.3917	a statistical relation between the x-ray spectral index and eddington  ratio of active galactic nuclei in deep surveys	we present an investigation into how well the properties of the accretionflow onto a supermassive black hole may be coupled to those of the overlyinghot corona. to do so, we specifically measure the characteristic spectralindex, gamma, of a power-law energy distribution, over an energy range of 2 to10 kev, for x-ray selected, broad-lined radio-quiet agn up to z~2 in cosmos ande-cdf-s. we test the previously reported dependence between gamma and blackhole mass, fwhm and eddington ratio using a sample of agn covering a broadrange in these parameters based on both the mg ii and h-alpha emission lineswith the later afforded by recent near infrared spectroscopic observationsusing subaru/fmos. we calculate the eddington ratios, lambda_edd, for sourceswhere a bolometric luminosity (l_bol) has been presented in the literature,based on sed fitting, or, for sources where these data do not exist, wecalculate l_bol using a bolometric correction to the lx, derived from arelationship between the bolometric correction, and lx/l3000. from a sample of69 x-ray bright sources (&gt;250 counts), where gamma can be measured withgreatest precision, with an estimate of l_bol, we find a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and lambda_edd, which is highlysignificant with a chance probability of 6.59x10^-8. a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and the fwhm of the optical lines isconfirmed, but at lower significance than with lambda_edd indicating thatlambda_edd is the key parameter driving conditions in the corona. linearregression analysis reveals that gamma=(0.32+/-0.05)log10lambda_edd+(2.27+/-0.06) andgamma=(-0.69+/-0.11)log10(fwhm/km/s)+(4.44+/-0.42). our results ongamma-lambda_edd are in very good agreement with previous results.

1306.2328	the hot and energetic universe: understanding the build-up of  supermassive black holes and galaxies at the heyday of the universe	observations in the last decade have provided strong evidence that the growthof supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies is among the mostinfluential processes in galaxy evolution. open questions that relate to ourcurrent understanding of black hole growth and its relation to the build-up ofgalaxies at redshifts z=1-4, when most black holes and stars we see inpresent-day galaxies were put in place, include: what is the nature of agnfeedback and whether it plays a significant role in the evolution of galaxies?what is the dominant population of accreting agn at that critical epoch? is itdominated by obscured objects as required by many current observations andmodels? the athena+ mission concept will provide the technological leaprequired for a breakthrough in our understanding of agn and galaxy evolution atthe heyday of the universe. the high throughput of athena+ will allow thesystematic study of the incidence, nature and energetics of agn feedbackprocesses to z~4 via the identification and measurement of blue-shifted x-rayabsorption lines. the excellent survey and spectral capabilities of the athena+wide field imager will complete the census of black hole growth by yieldingsamples of up to 100 times larger than is currently possible of the mostheavily obscured, including compton thick, agn to redshifts z~4. thedemographics of this population relative to their hosts is fundamental forunderstanding how major black hole growth events relate to the build-up ofgalaxies.

0801.2160	the role of agn in the colour transformation of galaxies at redshifts  z~1	we explore the role of agn in establishing and/or maintaining the bimodalcolour distribution of galaxies by quenching their star-formation and hence,causing their transition from the blue to the red cloud. important tests forthis scenario include (i) the x-ray properties of galaxies in the transitionzone between the two clouds and (ii) the incidence of agn in post-starbursts,i.e. systems observed shortly after (&lt;1gyr) the termination of theirstar-formation. we perform these tests by combining deep chandra observationswith multiwavelength data from the aegis survey. stacking the x-ray photons atthe positions of galaxies (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9) not individually detected at x-raywavelengths suggests a population of obscured agn among sources in thetransition zone and in the red cloud. their mean x-ray and mid-ir propertiesare consistent with moderately obscured low-luminosity agn, compton thicksources or a mix of both. morphologies show that major mergers are unlikely todrive the evolution of this population but minor interactions may play a role.the incidence of obscured agn in the red cloud (both direct detections andstacking results) suggests that bh accretion outlives the termination of thestar-formation. this is also supported by our finding that post-starburstgalaxies at z~0.8 and agn are associated, in agreement with recent results atlow-z. a large fraction of post-starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidencefor at least moderate levels of agn obscuration. this implies that if agnoutflows cause the colour transformation of galaxies, then some nuclear gas anddust clouds either remain unaffected or relax to the central galaxy regionsafter the quenching their star-formation.

1310.1398	reversal or no reversal: the evolution of the star formation  rate-density relation up to z~1.6	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr)-densityrelation in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) and the greatobservatories origin deep survey (goods) fields up to z~1.6. in addition to the"traditional method", in which the environment is defined according to astatistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a "dynamical"approach, where galaxies are classified according to three differentenvironment regimes: group, "filament-like", and field. both methods show noevidence of a sfr-density reversal. moreover, group galaxies show a mean sfrlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group andfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (sf) activity. wefind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant inthe suppression of the sf below z~1, with respect to purely density-relatedprocesses. we confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies indifferent environments with respect to the so-called main sequence (ms) ofstar-forming galaxies. galaxies in both group and "filament-like" environmentspreferentially lie below the ms up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lowerlevels of star-forming activity at a given mass. at z&gt;1, the star-forminggalaxies in groups reside on the ms. groups exhibit the highest fraction ofquiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, "filament-like", and fieldenvironments have a similar mix of galaxy types. we conclude that groups arethe most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. thus, a fundamentaldifference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matterhaloes of different masses.

1402.0004	x-ray spectral modelling of the agn obscuring region in the cdfs:  bayesian model selection and catalogue	agn are known to have complex x-ray spectra that depend on both theproperties of the accreting smbh (e.g. mass, accretion rate) and thedistribution of obscuring material in its vicinity ("torus"). often however,simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the x-ray spectra ofagn. in the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have animpact on e.g. the determination of the agn luminosity function, the inferredaccretion history of the universe and also on our understanding of the relationbetween agn and their host galaxies. we develop a bayesian framework for modelcomparison and parameter estimation of x-ray spectra. we take into accountuncertainties associated with x-ray data and photometric redshifts. we alsodemonstrate how bayesian model comparison can be used to select among tendifferent physically motivated x-ray spectral models the one that provides abetter representation of the observations. despite the use of low-countspectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry ofthe torus. for a sample of 350 agn in the 4 ms chandra deep field south field,our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity ofthe observed x-ray spectra: (abridged). simpler models are ruled out withdecisive evidence in favour of a geometrically extended structure withsignificant compton scattering. regarding the geometry of the obscurer, thereis strong evidence against both a completely closed or entirely open toroidalgeometry, in favour of an intermediate case. the additional compton reflectionrequired by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a signof a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk.finally, we release a catalogue with estimated parameters such as the accretionluminosity in the 2-10 kev band and the column density, $n_{h}$, of theobscurer.

1402.2277	investigating evidence for different black hole accretion modes since  redshift z~1	chandra data in the cosmos, aegis-xd and 4ms cdfs are combined withoptical/near-ir photometry to determine the rest-frame u-v vs v-j colours ofx-ray agn hosts at mean redshifts 0.40 and 0.85. this combination of colours(uvj) provides an efficient means of separating quiescent from star-forming,including dust reddened, galaxies. morphological information emphasisesdifferences between agn split by their uvj colours. agn in quiescent galaxiesare dominated by spheroids, while star-forming hosts are split between bulgesand disks. the uvj diagram of agn hosts is then used to set limits on theaccretion density associated with evolved and star-forming systems. most of theblack hole growth since z~1 is associated with star-forming hosts.nevertheless, ~15-20% of the x-ray luminosity density since z~1, is takingplace in the quiescent region of the uvj diagram. for the z~0.40 subsample,there is tentative evidence (2sigma significance), that agn split by their uvjcolours differ in eddington ratio. agn in star-forming hosts dominate at higheddington ratios, while agn in quiescent hosts become increasingly important asa fraction of the total population toward low eddington ratios. at higherredshift, z~0.8, such differences are significant at the 2sigma level only ateddington ratios &gt;1e-3. these findings are consistent with scenarios in whichdiverse accretion modes are responsible for the build-up of smbhs at thecentres of galaxies. we compare our results with the galform semi-analyticmodel, which postulates two black hole fuelling modes, the first linked tostar-formation and the second occuring in passive galaxies. galform predicts alarger fraction of black hole growth in quiescent galaxies at z&lt;1, compared tothe data. relaxing the strong assumption of the model that passive agn hostshave zero star-formation rate could reconcile this disagreement.

1407.1863	large scale clustering measurements with photometric redshifts:  comparing the dark matter halos of x-ray agn, star-forming and passive  galaxies at z~1	we combine multiwavelength data in the aegis-xd and c-cosmos surveys tomeasure the typical dark matter halo mass of x-ray selected agn[lx(2-10kev)&gt;1e42 erg/s] in comparison with far-infrared selected star-forminggalaxies detected in the herschel/pep survey (pacs evolutionary probe; lir&gt;1e11solar) and quiescent systems at z~1. we develop a novel method to measure theclustering of extragalactic populations that uses photometric redshiftprobability distribution functions in addition to any spectroscopy. this isadvantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in the clusteringanalysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. the method works bestfor large samples. the loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy isbalanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering. wefind that x-ray agn, far-infrared selected star-forming galaxies and passivesystems in the redshift interval 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 are found in halos of similar mass,$\log m_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$. we argue that this is becausethe galaxies in all three samples (agn, star-forming, passive) have similarstellar mass distributions, approximated by the j-band luminosity. thereforeall galaxies that can potentially host x-ray agn, because they have stellarmasses in the appropriate range, live in dark matter haloes of $\logm_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$ independent of their star-formationrates. this suggests that the stellar mass of x-ray agn hosts is driving theobserved clustering properties of this population. we also speculate thattrends between agn properties (e.g. luminosity, level of obscuration) and largescale environment may be related to differences in the stellar mass of the hostgalaxies.

1503.04870	a tidal disruption flare in a massive galaxy? implications for the  fuelling mechanisms of nuclear black holes	we argue that the `changing look' agn recently reported by lamassa et al.could be a luminous flare produced by the tidal disruption of a super-solarmass star passing just a few gravitational radii outside the event horizon of a$\sim 10^8 m_{\odot}$ nuclear black hole. this flare occurred in a massive,star forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks torepeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. by takingdifference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year sdss stripe-82light-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum overthe course of the outburst. the tidal disruption event (tde) interpretation isconsistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, whichdisplays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (witha clear superimposed re-brightening flare). our analysis places constraints onthe physical properties of the tde, such as the putative disrupted star's massand orbital parameters, as well as the size and temperature of the emittingmaterial. the properties of the broad and narrow emission lines observed in twoepochs of sdss spectra provide further constraints on the circum-nuclearstructure, and could be indicative that the system hosted a moderate-luminosityagn as recently as a few $10^4$ years ago, and is likely undergoing residualaccretion as late as ten years after peak, as seen from the broad h$\alpha$emission line. we discuss the complex interplay between tidal disruption eventsand gas accretion episodes in galactic nuclei, highlighting the implicationsfor future tde searches and for estimates of their intrinsic rates.

1507.07558	the x-ray luminosity function of active galactic nuclei in the redshift  interval z=3-5	we combine deep x-ray survey data from the chandra observatory and thewide-area/shallow xmm-xxl field to estimate the agn x-ray luminosity functionin the redshift range z=3-5. the sample consists of nearly 340 sources witheither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.the combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminositybaseline of three orders of magnitude, lx(2-10kev)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z&gt;3. wefollow a bayesian approach to determine the binned agn space density andexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. our methodology accountsfor poisson errors in the determination of x-ray fluxes and uncertainties inphotometric redshift estimates. we demonstrate that the latter is essential forunbiased measurement of space densities. we find that the agn x-ray luminosityfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. thereis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminositydependent. the space density of agn with lx&lt;1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5between the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter agnappears to be milder. comparison of our x-ray luminosity function with that ofuv/optical selected qsos at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at brightluminosities, lx&gt;1e45erg/s. the faint-end slope of uv/optical luminosityfunctions however, is steeper than for x-ray selected agn. this implies thatthe type-i agn fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z&gt;3, oppositeto trends established at lower redshift. we also assess the significance of agnin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. our x-ray luminosity functionyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep theuniverse ionised at redshift z&gt;4. a source of uncertainty in this calculationis the escape fraction of uv photons for x-ray selected agn.

1509.00043	the evolution of the disc variability along the hard state of the black  hole transient gx 339-4	we report on the analysis of hard-state power spectral density function (psd)of gx 339-4 down to the soft x-ray band, where the disc significantlycontributes to the total emission. at any luminosity probed, the disc in thehard state is intrinsically more variable than in the soft state. however, thefast decrease of disc variability as a function of luminosity, combined withthe increase of disc intensity, causes a net drop of fractional variability athigh luminosities and low energies, which reminds the well-known behaviour ofdisc-dominated energy bands in the soft state. the peak-frequency of thehigh-frequency lorentzian (likely corresponding to the high-frequency breakseen in active galactic nuclei, agn) scales with luminosity, but we do not findevidence for a linear scaling. in addition, we observe that this characteristicfrequency is energy-dependent. we find that the normalization of the psd at thepeak of the high-frequency lorentzian decreases with luminosity at allenergies, though in the soft band this trend is steeper. together with thefrequency shift, this yields quasi-constant high frequency (5-20 hz) fractionalrms at high energies, with less than 10 percent scatter. this reinforcesprevious claims suggesting that the high frequency psd solely scales with bhmass. on the other hand, this constancy breaks down in the soft band (where thescatter increases to ~30 percent). this is a consequence of the additionalcontribution from the disc component, and resembles the behaviour of opticalvariability in agn.

0805.4417	a new method for determining the sensitivity of x-ray imaging  observations and the x-ray number counts	we present a new method for determining the sensitivity of x-ray imagingobservations, which correctly accounts for the observational biases that affectthe probability of detecting a source of a given x-ray flux, without the needto perform a large number of time consuming simulations. we use this newtechnique to estimate the x-ray source counts in different spectral bands(0.5-2, 0.5-10, 2-10 and 5-10kev) by combining deep pencil-beam and shallowwide-area chandra observations. the sample has a total of 6295 unique sourcesover an area of $\rm 11.8deg^2$ and is the largest used to date to determinethe x-ray number counts. we determine, for the first time, the break flux inthe 5-10 kev band, in the case of a double power-law source count distribution.we also find an upturn in the 0.5-2kev counts at fluxes below about6e-17erg/s/cm2. we show that this can be explained by the emergence of normalstar-forming galaxies which dominate the x-ray population at faint fluxes. thefraction of the diffuse x-ray background resolved into point sources atdifferent spectral bands is also estimated. it is argued that a singlepopulation of compton thick agn cannot be responsible for the entire unresolvedx-ray background in the energy range 2-10kev.

1510.02798	tracing the reverberation lag in the hard state of black hole x-ray  binaries	we report results obtained from a systematic analysis of x-ray lags in asample of black hole x-ray binaries, with the aim of assessing the presence ofreverberation lags and studying their evolution during outburst. we usedxmm-newton and simultaneous rxte observations to obtain broad-band energycoverage of both the disc and the hard x-ray comptonization components. in mostcases the detection of reverberation lags is hampered by low levels ofvariability signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. typically when the source is in a softstate) and/or short exposure times. the most detailed study was possible for gx339-4 in the hard state, which allowed us to characterize the evolution ofx-ray lags as a function of luminosity in a single source. over all the sampledfrequencies (~0.05-9 hz) we observe the hard lags intrinsic to the power lawcomponent, already well-known from previous rxte studies. the xmm-newton softx-ray response allows us to detail the disc variability. at low-frequencies(long time scales) the disc component always leads the power law component. onthe other hand, a soft reverberation lag (ascribable to thermal reprocessing)is always detected at high-frequencies (short time scales). the intrinsicamplitude of the reverberation lag decreases as the source luminosity and thedisc-fraction increase. this suggests that the distance between the x-raysource and the region of the optically-thick disc where reprocessing occurs,gradually decreases as gx 339-4 rises in luminosity through the hard state,possibly as a consequence of reduced disc truncation.

1511.01899	non-linearity and environmental dependence of the star forming galaxies  main sequence	using data from four deep fields (cosmos, aegis, ecdfs, and cdfn), we studythe correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate(sfr) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z&lt;1.1$. to accuratelyestimate the galaxy sfr, we use the deepest available spitzer/mips 24 andherschel/pacs datasets. we distinguish group environments ($m_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$m_{\odot}$) based on the available deep x-raydata and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. weconfirm that the main sequence (ms) of star forming galaxies is not a linearrelation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses ($m_*&gt;10^{10.4-10.6}$ $m_{\odot}$), across all environments. at high redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1$ ), the ms varies little with environment. at low redshift ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean ms towards theregion of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-denseenvironments. we find that the flattening of the ms toward low sfr is due to anincreased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. instead, thedeviation of group galaxies from the ms at low redshift is caused by a largefraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lowerdensity environments. our results suggest that above a mass threshold ($\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$m_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environmentact together in driving the evolution of the sf activity towards lower level.the presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes arealready in place beyond $z\sim$1. the environmental effects appear, instead, atlower redshifts and have a long time-scale.

astro-ph;0006339	the origin of the x-ray and ultraviolet emission in ngc 7469	we present a spectral analysis of a 30d, near-continuous observation of theseyfert 1 galaxy ngc 7469 with rxte. daily integrations show strong spectralchanges during the observation. ourmain result is that we find the x-rayspectral index to be correlated with the uv flux. furthermore, the broad-bandx-ray photon flux is also correlated with the uv continuum. these correlationspoint towards a model in which the x-rays originate via thermal comptonizationof uv seed photons. furthermore, the uv is also correlated with theextrapolation of the x-ray power law into the soft x-ray/euv region. our dataanalysis therefore re-opens the possibility the the uv photons and theirvariability arise from reprocessing, as long as the primary source of heatingis photo-electric absorption in the reprocessor, rather than comptondownscattering, a coherent picture of the x-ray/uv variability can therefore beconstructed whereby absorption and reprocessing of euv/soft x-rays in astandard accretion disk produce a variable seed photon distribution which arein turn up-scattered into the x-ray band. we also find a significantcorrelation between the 2-10 kev flux and the 6.4 kev iron k-line suggestingthat at least some portion of the line originates within ~1 lt day of the x-raycontinuum source. neither the power law photon index nor the compton reflectioncomponent are correlated with the 2-10 kev flux. the latter is not correlatedwith the iron k line flux either. we do find an apparent correlation betweenthe x-ray spectral index and the strength of the compton reflection component.in an appendix we show, however, that this can be produced by a combination ofstatistical and systematic errors. we conclude the apparent variations in thecompton reflection component may be an artifact of these effects.

astro-ph;0007356	iron k line emission in agn: observations	iron k-alpha lines are key diagnostics of the central regions of agn. theirprofiles indicate that they are formed deep in the potential well of thecentral black hole, where extreme broadening and red shift occur. the profilesare most easily reproducible in an accretion disk: the lack of significantemission blue-ward of the rest energy is difficult produce in other geometries.in one source an apparent (and perhaps variable) absorption feature in the redwing of the line may represent rare evidence for inflow onto the black hole.sample analysis has defined the mean properties, showing a strong concentrationof the emission in the central regions and face-on accretion disks, at least inseyfert 1 galaxies. surprising results have been obtained from examination ofthe line variability. strong profile changes may be accounted for by changes inthe illumination pattern of the central, relativistic part of the disk. in atleast the case of mcg-6-30-15, there is evidence for emission from within 6r_g, possibly indicating a spinning black hole. developing an understanding ofthese complex changes has the potential to reveal the geometry and kinematicsof the inner few gravitational radii around extragalactic black holes.

astro-ph;0105238	temporal characteristics of the x-ray emission of ngc 7469	we present a study of the time variability of ngc 7469, based on a ~30 drxte/pca observation. variability is seen across the x-ray band, and spectralchanges are observed. the softness ratio is correlated with the ultravioletflux, but appears to show more rapid variability. the rms variability parametercalculated on ~1d time scales is significantly variable, and sharp increasesare seen close to the periods where the spectrum is hardest. cross correlationof 2-4 kev, 4-10 kev and 10-15 kev light curves show a peak at zero delay, butthe ccfs are skewed towards positive lags (i.e. the soft leading the hard) withan apparent time lag of about 0.5d. the power spectral density (psd) functionin the 2-10 kev band shows no clear features - for example periodicities orbreaks - but a power law is a rather poor fit, particularly to the highfrequency spectrum. the normalized psd in the soft x-ray band shows a largeramplitude of variability on long time scales but the hard x-ray psd is flatter,and shows more power on time scales less than about 1d. our data broadlysupport the idea that the x-rays are produced by compton upscattering oflower-energy seed photons, as had been previously concluded. they are difficultto reconcile with models in which the sole source of variability is the seedphotons, and more likely suggest a variability process intrinsic to the x-raycorona. our interpretation for these results is that the low-frequencyvariability in ngc 7469 does arise via variations in the compton seed photons,but that the high frequency variability arises from the coronal heatingmechanism (truncated)

astro-ph;0112318	the effect of changes in the asca calibration on the fe-kalpha lines in  active galaxies	the asca calibration has evolved considerably since launch and indeed, isstill evolving. there have been concerns in the literature that changes in theasca calibration have resulted in the fe-kalpha lines in active galaxies (agn)now being systematically narrower than was originally thought. if this weretrue, a large body of asca results would be impacted. in particular, it hasbeen claimed that the broad red wing (when present) of the fe-kalpha line hasbeen considerably weakened by changes in the asca calibration. we demonstrateexplicitly that changes in the asca calibration over a period of about eightyears have a negligible effect on the width, strength, or shape of thefe-kalpha lines. the reduction in both width and equivalent width is only ~8%or less. we confirm this with simulations and individual sources, as well assample average profiles. the average profile for type 1 agn is still verybroad, with the red wing extending down to ~4 kev. the reason for the claimed,apparently large, discrepancies is that in some sources the \fekalfa line iscomplex, and a single-gaussian model, being an inadequate description of theline profile, picks up different portions of the profile with differentcalibration. single-gaussian fits do not therefore model all of the lineemission in some sources, in which case they do not compare old and currentcalibration since the models do not then describe the data.

astro-ph;0211421	x-ray continuum variability of mcg-6-30-15	this paper presents a comprehensive examination of the x-ray continuumvariability of the bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15. the source clearlyshows the strong, linear correlation between rms variability amplitude and fluxfirst seen in galactic x-ray binaries. the high frequency power spectraldensity (psd) of mcg-6-30-15 is examined in detail using a monte carlo fittingprocedure and is found to be well represented by a steep power-law at highfrequencies (with a power-law index alpha ~ 2.5), breaking to a flatter slope(alpha ~ 1) below f_br ~ 0.6 - 2.0 x 10^-4 hz, consistent with the previousresults of uttley, mchardy &amp; papadakis. the slope of the power spectrum abovethe break is energy dependent, with the higher energies showing a flatter psd.at low frequencies the variations between different energy bands are highlycoherent while at high frequencies the coherence is significantly reduced. timelags are detected between energy bands, with the soft variations leading thehard. the magnitude of the lag is small (&lt;200 s for the frequencies observed)and is most likely frequency dependent. these properties are remarkably similarto the temporal properties of the galactic black hole candidate cygnus x-1. thecharacteristic timescales in these two types of source differ by ~10^5;assuming that these timescales scale linearly with black hole mass thensuggests a black hole mass ~10^6 m_sun for mcg-6-30-15. we speculate that thetiming properties of mcg-6-30-15 may be analogous to those of cyg x-1 in itshigh/soft state and discuss a simple phenomenological model, originallydeveloped to explain the timing properties of cyg x-1, that can explain many ofthe observed properties of mcg-6-30-15.

astro-ph;0303273	x-ray fluctuation power spectral densities of seyfert 1 galaxies	by combining complementary monitoring observations spanning long, medium andshort time scales, we have constructed power spectral densities (psds) of sixseyfert~1 galaxies. these psds span $\gtrsim$4 orders of magnitude in temporalfrequency, sampling variations on time scales ranging from tens of minutes toover a year. in at least four cases, the psd shows a "break," a significantdeparture from a power law, typically on time scales of order a few days. thisis similar to the behavior of galactic x-ray binaries (xrbs), lower masscompact systems with breaks on time scales of seconds. ngc 3783 shows tentativeevidence for a doubly-broken power law, a feature that until now has only beenseen in the (much better-defined) psds of low-state xrbs. it is alsointeresting that (when one previously-observed object is added to make a smallsample of seven), an apparently significant correlation is seen between thebreak time scale $t$ and the putative black hole mass $m_{\rm bh}$, while noneis seen between break time scale and luminosity. the data are consistent withthe linear relation $ t = m_{\rm bh}/10^{6.5} \msun$; extrapolation over 6--7orders of magnitude is in reasonable agreement with xrbs. all of thisstrengthens the case for a physical similarity between seyfert~1s and xrbs.

(2001)).we focus on the 2-10 kev spectrum which shows clear evidence for a broad,complex fek alpha line, previously unseen by asca, and for an fe k-shell edgedetected at ~7.3-7.4 kev (rest-frame). the presence of this edge could beexplained by either partial covering or ionized/relativistic reflection models,with the latter being preferred and with a resulting power law slope of gamma\~2.2. the line profile is complex, with a broad bump between ~ 5.5-6.5 kev anda narrow emission line at ~ 7 kev, separated by a sharp drop at ~ 6.8 kev. thisprofile is compatible with two possible scenarios: i) a broad, ionized andgravitationally redshifted laor diskline plus a narrow and ionized emissionline; ii) a broad, ionized and single schwarzschild (double-peaked) disklinewith a superimposed narrow absorption line.

astro-ph;0309096	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783. iv. variability and  modeling of the 900 ks chandra spectrum	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the data obtained from ngc 3783during the period 2000-2001 using chandra. this analysis leads us to thefollowing results. 1) ngc 3783 fluctuated in luminosity by a factor ~1.5 duringindividual observations (~170 ks duration). these fluctuations were notassociated with significant spectral variations. 2) on a longer time scale(20-120 days), we found the source to exhibit two very different spectralshapes. the main difference between these can be well-described by theappearance and disappearance of a spectral component that dominates theunderlying continuum at the longest wavelengths. the spectral variations arenot related to the brightening or the fading of the continuum at shortwavelengths in any simple way. 3) the appearance of the soft continuumcomponent is consistent with being the only spectral variation, and there is noneed to invoke changes in the opacity of the absorbers. 4) photoionizationmodeling indicates that a combination of three ionized absorbers, each splitinto two kinematic components, can explain the strengths of almost all theabsorption lines and bound-free edges. all three components are thermallystable and seem to have the same gas pressure. 5) the only real discrepancybetween our model and the observations concerns the range of wavelengthsabsorbed by the iron m-shell uta feature. this most likely arises as the resultof our underestimation of the poorly-known dielectronic recombination ratesappropriate for these ions. 6) the lower limit on the distance of the absorbinggas in ngc 3783 is between 0.2 and 3.2 pc. the assumption of pressureequilibrium imposes an upper limit of about 25 pc on the distance of theleast-ionized component from the central source.

astro-ph;0309718	physical interpretation of the uv/x-ray variability behavior of ngc 7469	we present a re-analysis of the simultaneous 30 day iue/xte observation ofngc 7469 done in 1996. our main progress, in comparison to previous spectralanalysis, is to adopt and fit directly to the data a detailed comptonizationmodel. this firstly allows to fit simultaneously the data from the uv to thehard x-ray band in a self-consistent way and secondly it gives directconstraints on the physical parameters of the disc-corona system. our resultsare completely consistent with a slab geometry where all the observed uvemission is supposed to cross the corona but more photon-starved geometriesalso give acceptable fits. whatever the geometry is, the uv seed photonemission appears to be dominated by the reprocessing of the x-rays. we alsofound very interesting correlations between the different model parameters, themost important one being the anticorrelation between the corona temperature andthe uv flux. such an anticorrelation is clearly inconsistent with a fixeddisc-corona configuration and suggests a variation of the geometry of thesystem. we also find a correlation between the corona optical depth and thex-ray flux which may reflect processes linked to the corona formation. duringthe observations, ngc 7469 appears to accrete near its eddington limit. thissource could then be an example of magnetically dominated disc-corona system asrecently proposed by merloni (2003).

astro-ph;0310820	the xmm-newton iron line profile of ngc 3783	we report on observations of the iron k line in the nearby seyfert 1 galaxy,ngc 3783, obtained in a long, 2 orbit (240 ks) xmm-newton observation. the lineprofile obtained exhibits two strong narrow peaks at 6.4 kev and at 7.0 kev,with measured line equivalent widths of 120 and 35 ev respectively. the 6.4 kevemission is the k-alpha line from near neutral fe, whilst the 7.0 kev featureprobably originates from a blend of the neutral fe k-beta line and the h-likeline of fe at 6.97 kev. the relatively narrow velocity width of the k-alphaline (&lt;5000 km/s), its lack of response to the continuum emission on shorttimescales and the detection of a neutral compton reflection component are allconsistent with a distant origin in compton-thick matter such as the putativemolecular torus. a strong absorption line from highly ionized iron (at 6.67kev) is detected in the time-averaged iron line profile, whilst the depth ofthe feature appears to vary with time, being strongest when the continuum fluxis higher. the iron absorption line probably arises from the highest ionizationcomponent of the known warm absorber in ngc 3783, with an ionization of logxi=3and column density of 5x10^{22}cm{-2} and may originate from within 0.1pc ofthe nucleus. a weak red-wing to the iron k line profile is also detected below6.4 kev. however when the effect of the highly ionized warm absorber on theunderlying continuum is taken into account, the requirement for a relativisticiron line component from the inner disk is reduced.

astro-ph;0311017	the properties and the evolution of the highly ionized gas in mr2251-178	we present the first xmm-newton observations of the radio-quiet quasarmr2251-178. we model the x-ray spectrum with two power laws, one at highenergies with a slope of \gamma=1.6 and the other to model the soft excess witha slope of \gamma=2.9, both absorbed by at least two warm absorbers (was). thehigh-resolution grating spectrum shows emission lines from n vi, o vii, o viii,ne ix, and ne x, as well as absorption lines from the low ionization ions oiii, o iv, and o v. a study of the spectral variations in mr2251-178 over aperiod of 8.5 years yields that all x-ray observations can be fitted with theabove model. luminosity variations over timescales of years seem to correlatewith the soft excess variations but not with the wa properties variations. theoverall picture is that of a stratified wa that enters and disappears from theline-of-sight on timescales of several months. we also present the first fusespectrum of mr2251-178. the general characteristics of the uv and x-rayabsorbers seem to be consistent.

astro-ph;0311029	x-ray and optical counterparts of hard x-ray selected sources from the  sheep survey: first results	we present followup observations of five hard x-ray sources from the asca5-10 kev sheep survey, which has a limiting flux of $\sim 10^{-13}$ ergcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. chandra data have been obtained to improve the x-raypositions from a few arcmin to $&lt;1''$, which allows unambiguous opticalidentification. while the objects almost certainly house agn based on theirx-ray luminosity, optical spectroscopy reveals a variety of properties. theidentifications indicate that the sheep survey samples the same populations asdeeper surveys which probe the origin of the x-ray background, but because thesheep sources are far brighter, they are more amenable to detailed followupwork. we find a variety of classifications and properties, including a type iiqso, a galaxy undergoing star formation, and a broad-line agn which has a veryhard x-ray spectrum, indicating substantial absorption in the x-ray but none inthe optical. two objects have x-ray/optical flux ratios which, were they at anx-ray flux level typical of objects in chandra deep surveys, would place themin the ``optically faint'' category. they are both identified with broad lineqsos at z$\sim 1$. clearly this survey - which is relatively unbiased againstobscured objects - is revealing a set of remarkable objects quite different tothe familiar classes of agn found in previous optical and soft x-ray surveys.

astro-ph;0409459	on the variability of the iron line in mrk 841	petrucci et al. (2002; hereafter p02) have reported extraordinary behaviourof the iron k alpha line in the type 1 agn mrk 841. at the xmm-newton/epicresolution, a narrow line was observed in a short observation, which thenapparently disappeared around 0.5 days later when another observation wasperformed. the limits are such that the line cannot both be narrow, andvariable at this level, as the light-travel time places the material at aradius where broadening by the black hole's gravitational field is inevitable.adding an additional observation taken before the p02 data, we present adifferent interpretation of the apparent variability. the data support thehypothesis that the line in fact varies in width, not only in flux. rather thanshowing no line, and despite the strong compton reflection component, the finalobservation exhibits broad emission at ~ 6.2-6.4 kev, with a width of ~0.8 kev,typical of a relativistic accretion disc. we suggest that the apparently narrowline in the early observations arises from local illumination by a flareinducing an hotspot in the inner disc, which then becomes progressivelybroadened as the disc rotates.

astro-ph;0503490	the space density of moderate luminosity active galaxies at z=3	we present an estimate of the space density of active galactic nuclei (agn)at z=3. combining deep x-ray data with lyman break galaxy (lbg)colour-selection in the rest-frame uv makes for highly efficient identificationof agn in a narrow redshift range (z~2.5-3.5). using chandra data from thegroth-westphal strip and the hubble deep field north, we find a total of 15x-ray detected lbgs at z~3, the majority of which are unlikely to have beenidentified in blanket followup surveys of x-ray detected objects. we find thecomoving space density of moderate luminosity agn at z=3 to be a factor ~10higher than the most powerful objects. the available data are consistent with aroughly constant space density of mlagn from z=0.5-3, and they are alsoconsistent with a mild decline in the space density above z=1 as predicted bythe luminosity-dependent density evolution models of ueda et al. (2003). thisstrong agn activity at z=3 argues against previous suggestions that themajority of black hole accretion occurs at low redshift. a further implicationof our investigation is that, as far as can be determined from current data,the majority of the agn population at z~3 are selected by the lbg dropouttechnique. although this is sensitive to agn with a uv-excess due to anaccretion disk, it predominantly identifies star-forming galaxies. asignificant fraction of x-ray sources seem likely to be hosted by these moretypical lbgs, further strengthening the starburst-agn connection at highredshift.

astro-ph;0601245	xmm-newton and chandra observations of sheep sources	we present chandra and xmm observations of 12 bright (f(2-10 kev)  &gt; 10^-13 cgs) sources from the asca sheep (search for the high energy  extragalactic population) survey. most of these have been either not observedor not detected previously with the rosat mission and therefore they constitutea sample biased towards hard sources. the chandra observations are important inlocating with accuracy the optical counterpart of the x-ray sources. opticalspectroscopic observations show that our sample is associated with bothnarrow-line (nl) (six objects), and  broad-line (bl) agn (five objects) with one source remaining unidentified.  our sources cover the redshift range 0.04 to 1.29 spanning luminosities from10^42 to 10^45 cgs (2-10 kev). the nl sources have preferentially lowerredshift (and luminosity) compared with the bl ones. this can be most easilyexplained in a model where the nl agn are intrinsically less luminous than thebl ones in line with the results of steffen et al.  the x-ray spectral fittings show a roughly equal number of obscured(n_h&gt;10^22 cgs) and unobscured (n_h&lt;10^22 cgs) sources.  there is a clear tendency for obscured sources to be associated with  nl agn and unobscured sources with bl ones. however, there is a markedexception with the highest obscuring column observed at a bl agn at a redshiftof z=0.5.

astro-ph;0602081	on the origin of the fe k-alpha line cores in active galactic nuclei	x-ray observations with chandra and xmm-newton have shown that there arerelatively narrow cores to the iron k-alpha emission lines in active galacticnuclei (agn). plausible origins for this core emission include the outerregions of an accretion disk, a pc-scale molecular torus, and the opticalbroad-line region (blr). using data from the literature it is shown that nocorrelation exists between the fe k-alpha core width and the blr (specificallyh-beta) line width. this shows that in general the iron k-alpha core emissiondoes not arise from the blr. there is a similar lack of correlation between thewidth of the fe k-alpha core and black hole mass. the average k-alpha width isabout a factor of two lower than the h-beta width. it therefore seems likelythat in many cases the narrow core arises in the torus. there is a very widerange of observed fe k-alpha core widths, however, and this argues for multipleorigins. the simplest explanation for the observed line profiles in agn is thatthey are due to a mixing of very narrow emission from the inner edge of thetorus, and broadened emission from the accretion disk, in varying proportionsfrom object-to-object.

0809.1349	aegis-x: the chandra deep survey of the extended groth strip	we present the aegis-x survey, a series of deep chandra acis-i observationsof the extended groth strip. the survey comprises pointings at 8 separatepositions, each with nominal exposure 200ks, covering a total area ofapproximately 0.67 deg2 in a strip of length 2 degrees. we describe in detailan updated version of our data reduction and point source detection algorithmsused to analyze these data. a total of 1325 band-merged sources have been foundto a poisson probability limit of 4e-6, with limiting fluxes of 5.3e-17erg/cm2/s in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band and 3.8e-16 erg/cm2/s in the hard (2-10kev) band. we present simulations verifying the validity of our sourcedetection procedure and showing a very small, &lt;1.5%, contamination rate fromspurious sources. optical/nir counterparts have been identified from the deep2,cfhtls, and spitzer/irac surveys of the same region. using a likelihood ratiomethod, we find optical counterparts for 76% of our sources, complete tor(ab)=24.1, and, of the 66% of the sources that have irac coverage, 94% have acounterpart to a limit of 0.9 microjy at 3.6 microns (m(ab)=23.8). afteraccounting for (small) positional offsets in the 8 chandra fields, theastrometric accuracy of the chandra positions is found to be 0.8 arcsec rms,however this number depends both on the off-axis angle and the number ofdetected counts for a given source. all the data products described in thispaper are made available via a public website.

astro-ph;0607270	aegis: the color-magnitude relation for x-ray selected agn	we discuss the relationship between rest-frame color and optical luminosityfor x-ray sources in the range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 selected from the chandra survey ofthe extended groth strip (egs). these objects are almost exclusively activegalactic nuclei (agn). while there are a few luminous qsos, most are relativelyweak or obscured agn whose optical colors should be dominated by host galaxylight. the vast majority of agn hosts at z~1 are luminous and red, with veryfew objects fainter than m_{b}=-20.5 or bluer than u-b=0.6. this places the agnin a distinct region of color-magnitude space, on the ``red sequence'' or atthe top of the ``blue cloud'', with many in between these two modes in galaxycolor. a key stage in the evolution of massive galaxies is when star formationis quenched, resulting in a migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence.our results are consistent with scenarios in which agn either cause or maintainthis quenching. the large numbers of red sequence agn imply that strong,ongoing star formation is not a necessary ingredient for agn activity, as blackhole accretion appears often to persist after star formation has beenterminated.

astro-ph;0609123	the x-ray emission of lyman break galaxies	we present an analysis of the x-ray emission of a large sample of z~3 lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs), based on chandra/acis observations of several lbg surveyfields. 24 lbgs are directly detected in the x-ray. 13 of the lbgs have opticalspectroscopic signatures of agn activity, but almost all the other x-raydetections are also likely to host an accreting black hole based on their x-rayproperties. the agn exhibit a wide range in x-ray luminosity, from weakseyferts to bright qsos. optical spectroscopy identified approximately 1/3 ofthe x-ray detected sources as broad line qsos, 1/3 as narrow line agn and 1/3as normal star forming lbgs. the fraction of x-ray detected lbgs is 3%, muchlower than has been found for submm selected galaxies. 2 galaxies have x-rayluminosities, spectra and f_x/f_opt values that are consistent with emissionfrom star formation processes and are candidate x-ray bright, pure starburstgalaxies at z~3. x-ray spectral analysis of the lbgs shows a mean photon index1.96, similar to local agn. there is evidence for absorption in at least 40% ofthe objects. significantly more absorption is evident in the narrow line agn,consistent with agn unification schemes. after correction for absorption thenarrow and broad line objects show the same average luminosity. lbgsspectroscopically classified as normal galaxies are less luminous in x-rayindicating that the host galaxy is outshining any optical agn signature. forthe lbgs without direct detections, stacking the x-ray flux in the 2 deepestfields under consideration (the hdf-n and gws) produced significant detectionsin each. the detection in the hdf-n gives an x-ray derived sfr of 42.4+/-7.8msolar/yr per lbg and, by comparing with the uv sfr, the implied uv extinctioncorrection is 4.1+/-0.8.

astro-ph;0609466	far-infrared characterization of an ultra-luminous starburst associated  with a massively-accreting black hole at z=1.15	as part of the "all wavelength extended groth strip international survey"(aegis), we describe the panchromatic characterization of an x-ray luminousactive galactic nucleus (agn) in a merging galaxy at z=1.15. this object isdetected at infrared (8mic, 24mic, 70mic, 160mic), submillimeter (850mic) andradio wavelengths, from which we derive a bolometric luminosity l_bol ~ 9x10^12lsol. we find that the agn clearly dominates the hot dust emission below 40micbut its total energetic power inferred from the hard x-rays is substantiallyless than the bolometric output of the system. about 50% of the infraredluminosity is indeed produced by a cold dust component that probably originatesfrom enshrouded star formation in the host galaxy. in the context of a coevalgrowth of stellar bulges and massive black holes, this source might represent a``transition'' object sharing properties with both quasars and luminousstarbursts. study of such composite galaxies will help address how the starformation and disk-accretion phenomena may have regulated each other at highredshift and how this coordination may have participated to the build-up of therelationship observed locally between the masses of black holes and stellarspheroids.

astro-ph;0610585	an xmm-newton survey of broad iron lines in agn	we report on the iron k-alpha line properties of a sample of seyfert galaxiesobserved with the xmm-newton epic pn instrument. using a systematic and uniformanalysis, we find that complexity at iron-k is extremely common in the xmmspectra. once appropriate soft x-ray absorption, narrow 6.4 kev emission andassociated compton reflection are accounted for, ~75 of the sample show animprovement when a further gaussian component is introduced. the typicalproperties of the broad emission are both qualitatively and quantitativelyconsistent with previous results from asca. the complexity is in general verywell described by relativistic accretion disk models. in most cases thecharacteristic emission radius is constrained to be within ~50 r_g, wherestrong gravitational effects become important. we find in about 1/3 of thesample the accretion disk interpretation is strongly favoured over competingmodels. in a few objects no broad line is apparent. we find evidence foremission within 6 r_g in only two cases, both of which exhibit highly complexabsorption. evidence for black hole spin based on the x-ray spectra thereforeremains tentative.

(1994), the iron line is broad and strong (equivalent width\sim300\thinspace ev). the line profile is also suggestive of it being skewed.such a line would be expected from a relativistic accretion disk. we also findvery rapid primary x-ray variability. assuming relativistic beaming to beunimportant, the derived efficiency is comparable to the maximum obtainablefrom accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole. correlated variability outsideof the energy range of {\it asca} might exceed this maximum, thus requiringefficient accretion onto a kerr hole.

astro-ph;9804135	new constraints on the continuum-emission mechanism of agn: intensive  monitoring of ngc 7469 in the x-ray and ultraviolet	we have undertaken near-continuous monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc7469 in the x-ray with rxte over a ~30d baseline. the source shows strongvariability with a root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of ~16 per cent, andpeak-to-peak variations of a factor of order 2. simultaneous data over thisperiod were obtained in the ultraviolet (uv) using iue, making this the mostintensive x-ray uv/x-ray variability campaign performed for any active galaxy.comparison of the continuum light curves reveals very similar amplitudes ofvariability, but different variability characteristics, with the x-rays showingmuch more rapid variations. the data are not strongly correlated at zero lag.the largest absolute value of the correlation coefficient occurs for ananticorrelation between the two bands, with the x-ray variations leading the uvby ~4d. the largest positive correlation is for the ultraviolet to lead thex-rays by ~4d. neither option appears to be compatible with any simpleinterband transfer function. the peak positive correlation at ~4d occursbecause the more prominent peaks in the uv light curve appear to lead those inthe x-rays by this amount. however, the minima of the light curves arenear-simultaneous. these observations provide new constraints on theoreticalmodels of the central regions of active galactic nuclei. models in which theobserved uv emission is produced solely by re-radiation of absorber x-rays areruled out by our data, as are those in which the x-rays are produced solely bycompton upscattering of the observed uv component by a constant distribution ofparticles.

astro-ph;9806392	the x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc 3227	(abridged) we present the results from {\it asca} observations of ngc 3227along with those from a {\it rosat} observation. the 0.6--10 kev continuum isconsistent with a powerlaw with $\gamma \sim 1.6$, flatter than that typicallyobserved in seyfert galaxies. fe $k$-shell emission is observed with an ew andprofile typical of seyfert 1 galaxies. the {\it asca} observations in 1993reveal absorption by a screen $n_{h,z}^{ion} \simeq 3\times10^{21} cm^{-2}}$ ofionized material with $u_x \simeq 0.01$. joint analysis of the {\it asca} and{\it rosat} data show an additional screen of neutral material instrinsic tongc 3227 with $n_{h,z}^{neu} \sim $few$\times10^{20} cm^{-2}}$. ngc 3227exhibits spectral variability both within and between the observations, due toshort-term variability in the continuum emission and longer-term variability inthe absorption. time-resolved spectroscopy show the continuum steepened by$\delta \gamma \simeq 0.1$ during a flare of duration $\sim 10^4$s. the columnincreased by a factor of $\sim10$ by the 1995 epoch, while the continuum isconsistent with that observed in 1993. the 1995 data also show evidence thatthe warm absorber allows $\sim$10% of the nuclear emission to escape withoutattenuation.

astro-ph;9806393	x-ray signatures of an ionized reprocessor in the seyfert galaxy ton s  180	we discuss the hard x-ray properties of the seyfert galaxy ton s 180, basedupon the analysis of asca data. we find the x-ray flux varied by a factor ~2 ona time scale of a few thousand seconds. the source showed significantly higheramplitude of variability in the 0.5-2 kev band than in the 2-10 kev band. thecontinuum is adequately parameterized as a gamma ~ 2.5 power-law across the0.6--10 kev band . we confirm the recent discovery of an emission line of highequivalent width, due to fe k-shell emission from highly-ionized material.these asca data show the fe line profile to be broad and asymmetric andtentatively suggest it is stronger during the x-ray flares, consistent with anorigin from the inner parts of an accretion disk. the x-ray spectrum is complexbelow 2 kev, possibly due to emission from a blend of soft x-ray lines, whichwould support the existence of an ionized reprocessor, most likely due to arelatively high accretion rate in this source.

astro-ph;9807142	x-ray observations of the seyfert galaxy lb 1727 (1h 0419-577)	we discuss the properties of the seyfert 1.5 galaxy lb 1727, also known as 1h0419-577, from x-ray observations obtained by asca and rosat along with opticalobservations from earlier epochs. asca shows only modest (&lt; 20%) variations inx-ray flux within or between the observations. in contrast, a daily monitoringcampaign over 1996 jun - sept by the rosat hri instrument reveals the softx-ray (0.1-2 kev) flux to have increased by a factor ~3.  the 2 - 10 kev continuum can be parameterized as a power-law with a photonindex gamma ~ 1.45-1.68 across ~0.7 - 11 kev in the rest-frame. we also reportthe first detection of iron kalpha line emission in this source. simultaneousasca and rosat data show the x-ray spectrum to steepen sharply at a rest-energy\~0.75 kev, the spectrum below this energy can be parameterized as a power-lawof slope gamma ~3.6. we show that lb 1727 is one of the few seyferts for whichwe can rule out the possibility that the presence of a warm absorber is solelyresponsible for the spectral steepening in the soft x-ray regime. considerationof the overall spectral-energy-distribution for this source indicates thepresence of a pronounced xuv-bump visible in optical, ultraviolet and softx-ray data.

astro-ph;9807349	a peculiar emission line feature in the x-ray spectrum of the quasar pks  0637-752	we report the results from an asca observation of the high-luminosity,radio-loud quasar pks 0637-752 (redshift 0.654), covering the 0.8-15 kev bandin the quasar-frame. we find the source to have a luminosity ~10^46 erg/s inthe 2-10 kev band, a factor of ~3 lower than during a previous gingaobservation. the continuum appears to be well modeled by a simple power-lawwith a photon index of 1.64 +/- 0.07, with no evidence for absorption bymaterial intrinsic to the quasar, or fe-k emission (with an equivalent width &lt;80 ev at 90% confidence). however we do find evidence for a narrow emissionline at an energy 1.60 +/- 0.07 kev and equivalent width 59 [+38,-34] ev (bothin the quasar frame). line emission at these energies has not been observed inany other active galaxy or quasar to date. we reject the possibility that thisline is the result of instrumental artifacts, and briefly explore possibleidentifications.

astro-ph;9907193	the properties of the relativistic iron k-line in ngc 3516	we present an analysis of the relativistic iron k-alpha line in the seyfert 1galaxy ngc 3516, based on a continuous, five-day asca observation. the broadprofile which has been found in several other agn is confirmed in ngc 3516 withunprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. disk-line models with either a kerr orschwarzschild metric fit the integrated profile, but both require emission verystrongly concentrated in the inner disk. we find tentative evidence for theline signatures of ni k-alpha and/or fe k-beta. the continuum flux varied by\~50 per cent during the observation and time-resolved analysis shows that theline also changes. the line core seems to follow the continuum, but the bluewing is unrelated and shows a greater amplitude (factor ~2) of variability. thered wing is formally consistent with a constant but appears to be correlatedwith the blue wing. we interpret this as evidence for independent variabilityof the broadest parts of the line. there also appears to be an absorptionfeature in the profile, consistent with resonance scattering in infallingmaterial. this variable feature may be the signature of material being accretedby the central black hole.

astro-ph;9910218	x-ray observations of optically-selected, radio-quiet quasars i: the  asca results	we present the result of 27 asca observations of 26 radio-quiet quasars(rqqs) from the pg survey. all the rqqs were detected except 2 balqsos. we findthe variability characteristics of the sources to be consistent with seyf-1s. apowerlaw offers an acceptable description of the time-averaged spectra in the2-10 kev (rqq-frame) band for all but 1 dataset. the photon indices vary fromobject to object over the range 1.5~&lt;gamma(2-10 kev)~&lt;3 with a meangamma(2-10kev)~2 and dispersion ~=0.25. the distribution of gamma(2-10 kev istherefore similar to that observed in other rq agn, and seems unrelated tox-ray luminosity. no single model adequately describes the full 0.6-10 kev(obs-frame) continuum of all the rqqs. ~50% of the sources can be described bya single powerlaw (or with only very subtle deviations). all but one of theremaining datasets have convex spectra (flattening to higher energies). theexception is pg 1411+442, in which a substantial column density obscures ~98%of the continuum. we find only 5 (or 6) of 14 objects with z&lt;~0.25 to have a'soft excess' at energies &lt;~1 kev, but find no universal shape for thesespectral components. the spectrum of pg 1244+026 contains an emission featureat ~1 kev. the detection rate of absorption due to ionized material in theserqqs is lower than in seyf-1s. in part, this may be due to selection effects.however, when detected, the absorbers in the rqqs exhibit a similar range ofcolumn density and ionization parameter as seyf-1s. we find evidence of fek-shell emission in at least 8 rqqs. these are all low-luminosity objects, andthe line parameters are consistent with other low-luminosity rq agn. however wefind a trend whereby the profile and strength of the fe k-shell emissionchanges as a function of luminosity.

0706.0134	unveiling the broad band x-ray continuum and iron line complex in mkr  841	mkr 841 is a bright seyfert 1 galaxy known to harbor a strong soft excess anda variable k$\alpha$ iron line. it has been observed during 3 different periodsby xmm for a total cumulated exposure time of $\sim$108 ks. we present in thispaper a broad band spectral analysis of the complete epic-pn data sets. we wereable to test two different models for the soft excess, a relativisticallyblurred photoionized reflection (\r model) and a relativistically smearedionized absorption (\a model). the continuum is modeled by a simple cut-offpower law and we also add a neutral reflection. these observations reveal theextreme and puzzling spectral and temporal behaviors of the soft excess andiron line. the 0.5-3 kev soft x-ray flux decreases by a factor 3 between 2001and 2005 and the line shape appears to be a mixture of broad and narrowcomponents. we succeed in describing this complex broad-band 0.5-10 kevspectral variability using either \r or \a to fit the soft excess. both modelsgive statistically equivalent results even including simultaneous bepposax dataup to 200 kev. both models are consistent with the presence of remotereflection characterized by a constant narrow component in the data. howeverthey differ in the presence of a broad line component present in \r but notneeded in \a. this study also reveals the sporadic presence of relativisticallyredshifted narrow iron lines.

0812.2034	are red 2mass qsos young?	we use photometric data from spitzer to explore the mid- and far-irproperties of 10 red qsos (j-k&gt;2, r-k&gt;5) selected by combining the 2mass in thenir with the sdss at optical wavelengths. optical and/or near-infrared spectraare available for 8/10 sources. modeling the sed from uv to far-ir shows thatmoderate dust reddening (a_v=1.3-3.2) can explain the red optical and near-ircolours of the sources in the sample. there is also evidence that red qsos have60/12micron luminosity ratio higher than pg qsos (97% significance). this canbe interpreted as a higher level of star-formation in these systems (measuredby the 60micron luminosity) for a given agn power (approximated by the 12micronluminosity). this is consistent with a picture where red qsos represent anearly phase of agn evolution, when the supermassive black hole is enshrouded indust and gas clouds, which will eventually be blown out (possibly by agn drivenoutflows) and the system will appear as typical optically luminous qso. thereis also tentative evidence significant at the 96% level that red 2mass qsos aremore often associated with radio emission than optically selected sdss qsos.this may indicate outflows, also consistent with the young agn interpretation.we also estimate the space density of red qsos relative to optically selectedsdss qsos, taking into account the effect of dust extinction and the intrinsicluminosity of the sources. we estimate that the fraction of red qsos in theoverall population increases from 3% at m_k=-27.5mag to 12% at m_k=-29.5mag.this suggests that reddened qsos become more important at the bright end of theluminosity function. if red qsos are transition objects on the way to becomingtypical optically luminous qsos, the low fractions above suggest that thesesystems spent &lt;12% of their lifetime at the "reddened" stage.
