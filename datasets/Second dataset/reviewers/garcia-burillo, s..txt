0906.2493	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): xii. the head-on collision  in ngc1961	we present high-resolution co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the liner 2 galaxyngc1961. this galaxy is unusual among late-type (sc) disk galaxies in having avery large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. we propose a head-oncollision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both theoff-centered rings and the inflated radius. this scenario is supported by thedetection of a steep velocity gradient in the co(1-0) map at the position of asouthwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. this peak wouldrepresent the remnant of the disrupting companion. we use numerical models todemonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. while ram pressure strippingcould in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce thestriking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group inx-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.the collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,which accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on thesouthern side. we argue that ngc1961 has a strongly warped disk, which givesthe false impression of a nearly face-on system; the main disk is actually moreedge-on, and this error in the true inclination has led to the surprisinglyhigh dynamical mass for a morphologically late-type galaxy. in addition, theoutward propagating ring artificially enlarges the disk. the collisionde-stabilizes the inner disk and can provide gas inflow to the active nucleus.

0906.5154	probing x-ray irradiation in the nucleus of ngc 1068 with observations  of high-j lines of dense gas tracers	with the incorporation of high-j molecular lines, we aim to constrain thephysical conditions of the dense gas in the central region of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and to determine signatures of the agn or the starburstcontribution.  we used the james clerk maxwell telescope to observe the j=4-3 transition ofhcn, hnc, and hco+, as well as the cn n_j=2_{5/2}-1_{3/2} andn_j=3_{5/2}-2_{5/2}, in ngc 1068.  we estimate the excitation conditions of hcn, hnc, and cn, based on the lineintensity ratios and radiative transfer models.  we find that the bulk emission of hcn, hnc, cn, and the high-j hco+ emergefrom dense gas n(h_2)&gt;=10^5 cm^-3). however, the low-j hco+ lines (dominatingthe hco+ column density) trace less dense (n(h_2)&lt;10^5 cm^-3) and colder(t_k&lt;=20 k) gas, whereas the high-j hco+ emerges from warmer (&gt;30 k) gas thanthe other molecules.  the hco+ j=4-3 line intensity, compared with the lower transition lines andwith the hcn j=4-3 line, support the influence of a local xdr environment. theestimated n(cn)/n(hcn)~1-4 column density ratios are indicative of an xdr/agnenvironment with a possible contribution of grain-surface chemistry induced byx-rays or shocks.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1005.1263	molecular gas chemistry in agn. ii. high-resolution imaging of sio  emission in ngc1068: shocks or xdr?	this paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from themolecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (cnd) of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068.single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of siliconmonoxide(sio) in the cnd of ngc1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude withrespect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in thegalaxy. we aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the sio enhancement. wehave imaged with the iram plateau de bure interferometer the emission of thesio(2-1) and cn(2--1) lines in ngc1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,respectively. we have also obtained complementary iram 30m observations of hncoand methanol (ch3oh) lines. sio is detected in a disk of 400pc size around theagn. sio abundances in the cnd of (1-5)xe-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitudeabove those measured in the starburst ring. the overall abundance of cn in thecnd is high: (0.2-1)xe-07. the abundances of sio and cn are enhanced at theextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the agn(r&lt;70pc). abundances measured for cn and sio, and the correlation of cn/co andsio/co ratios with hard x-ray irradiation, suggest that the cnd of ngc1068 hasbecome a giant x-ray dominated region (xdr). the extreme properties ofmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of ngc1068 result from theinterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.whereas xdr chemistry offers a simple explanation for cn and sio in ngc1068,the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. the inclusion of dust grainchemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of othermolecular species, like hcn, which are under-predicted by xdr models.

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1007.1167	hifi spectroscopy of low-level water transitions in m82	we present observations of the rotational ortho-water ground transition, thetwo lowest para-water transitions, and the ground transition of ionisedortho-water in the archetypal starburst galaxy m82, performed with the hifiinstrument on the herschel space observatory. these observations are the firstdetections of the para-h2o(111-000) (1113\,ghz) and ortho-h2o+(111-000)(1115\,ghz) lines in an extragalactic source. all three water lines showdifferent spectral line profiles, underlining the need for high spectralresolution in interpreting line formation processes. using the line shape ofthe para-h2o(111-000) and ortho-h2o+(111-000) absorption profile in conjunctionwith high spatial resolution co observations, we show that the (ionised) waterabsorption arises from a ~2000 pc^2 region within the hifi beam located about~50 pc east of the dynamical centre of the galaxy. this region does notcoincide with any of the known line emission peaks that have been identified inother molecular tracers, with the exception of hco. our data suggest that waterand ionised water within this region have high (up to 75%) area-coveringfactors of the underlying continuum. this indicates that water is notassociated with small, dense cores within the ism of m82 but arises from a morewidespread diffuse gas component.

1106.2098	the metallicity dependence of the co {\rightarrow} h_2 conversion factor  in z&gt;1 star forming galaxies	we use the first systematic samples of co millimeter emission in z&gt;1'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (sfgs) to study the metallicitydependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}co, from co line luminosity tomolecular gas mass. the molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio ofthe star formation rate (sfr) to co luminosity, is ~1 gyr-1 for near-solarmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above m_s~1e11 m_sun. in this regimethe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as afunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. belowm_s the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. we arguethat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physicalparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamentalmetallicity-sfr-stellar mass relation. a more probable explanation is that theconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in'co-dark' gas. the trend is also expected theoretically from the effect ofenhanced photodissociation of co by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.from the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of thelog({\alpha}co) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairlyinsensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formationactivity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas massesestimated from co luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward forgalaxies below m_s.

0710.2000	atomic hydrogen properties of agn host galaxies: hi in 16 nuclei of  galaxies (nuga) sources	we present a comprehensive spectroscopic imaging survey of the distributionand kinematics of atomic hydrogen (hi) in 16 nearby spiral galaxies hosting lowluminosity agn, observed with high spectral and spatial resolution (resolution:~20 arcsec, 5 km/s) using the nrao very large array (vla). the sample containsa range of nuclear types, ranging from seyfert to star-forming nuclei and wasoriginally selected for the nuclei of galaxies project (nuga) - a spectrallyand spatially resolved interferometric survey of gas dynamics in nearbygalaxies designed to identify the fueling mechanisms of agn and the relation tohost galaxy evolution. here we investigate the relationship between the hiproperties of these galaxies, their environment, their stellar distribution andtheir agn type. the large-scale hi morphology of each galaxy is classified asringed, spiral, or centrally concentrated; comparison of the resultingmorphological classification with agn type reveals that ring structures aresignificantly more common in liner than in seyfert host galaxies, suggesting atime evolution of the agn activity together with the redistribution of theneutral gas. dynamically disturbed hi disks are also more prevalent in linerhost galaxies than in seyfert host galaxies. while several galaxies aresurrounded by companions (some with associated hi emission), there is nocorrelation between the presence of companions and the agn type(seyfert/liner).

1111.6762	detection of hcn, hco+ and hnc in the mrk231 molecular outflow - dense  molecular gas in the agn wind	we detect luminous emission from hcn, hco+ and hnc 1--0 in the qso ulirgmrk~231 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer at 1."55 by 1."28resolution. all three lines show broad line wings - which are particularlyprominent for hcn. velocities are found to be similar (750 km/s) to those foundfor co 1-0. this is the first time bright hcn, hco+ and hnc emission has beendetected in a large-scale galactic outflow. we find that both the blue- andred-shifted line wings are spatially extended by at least 0."75 (700 pc) in anorth-south direction. the line wings are brighter (relative to the line centerintensity) in hcn than in co 1-0 and line ratios suggest that the molecularoutflow consists of dense (n&gt;10e4 cme-3) and clumpy gas with a high hcnabundance x(hcn)&gt;10e-8. these properties are consistent with the molecular gasbeing compressed and fragmented by shocks in the outflow. alternatively, hcn isinstead pumped by mid-ir continuum, but we propose that this effect is notstrong for the spatially extended outflowing gas. in addition, we find that therotation of the main disk, in east-west direction, is also evident in the hcn,hco+ and hnc line emission. an unexpectedly bright hc3n 10-9 line is detectedinside the central 400 pc of mrk231. this hc3n emission may emerge from ashielded, dust-enshrouded region within the inner 40-50 pc where the gas isheated to high temperatures (200 - 300 k) by the agn.

1111.6773	star formation laws in luminous infrared galaxies. new observational  constraints on models	the observational study of star formation relations in galaxies is central tounraveling the physical processes at work on local and global scales. we wishto expand the sample of extreme starbursts, represented by local lirgs andulirgs, with high quality observations in the 1-0 line of hcn. we study if auniversal law can account for the star formation relations observed for thedense molecular gas in normal star forming galaxies and extreme starbursts. wehave used the iram 30m telescope to observe a sample of 19 lirgs in the 1-0lines of co, hcn and hco+. the analysis of the new data proves that theefficiency of star formation in the dense molecular gas (sfe-dense) of extremestarbursts is a factor 3-4 higher compared to normal galaxies. we find aduality in kennicutt-schmidt (ks) laws that is reinforced if we account for thedifferent conversion factor for hcn (alpha-hcn) in extreme starbursts and forthe unobscured star formation rate in normal galaxies. this result extends tothe higher molecular densities probed by hcn lines the more extreme bimodalbehavior of star formation laws, derived from co molecular lines by two recentsurveys. we have confronted our observations with the predictions oftheoretical models in which the efficiency of star formation is determined bythe ratio of a constant star formation rate per free-fall time (sfr-ff) to thelocal free-fall time. we find that it is possible to fit the observeddifferences in the sfe-dense between normal galaxies and lirgs/ulirgs using acommon constant sfr-ff and a set of physically acceptable hcn densities, butonly if sfr-ff~0.005-0.01 and/or if alpha-hcn is a factor of a few lower thanour favored values. star formation recipes that explicitly depend on the galaxyglobal dynamical time scales do not significantly improve the fit to the newhcn data presented in this work.

1202.0458	on the molecular gas content and sfr in hickson compact groups: enhanced  or deficient?	we study the effect of the extreme environment in hickson compact groups(hcgs) on the molecular gas mass, \mhtwo, and the star formation rate (sfr) ofgalaxies as a function of atomic hydrogen (hi) content and evolutionary phaseof the group. we have selected a redshift limited (d$&lt;$100 mpc) sample of 88galaxies in 20 hcgs with available atomic hydrogen (hi) vla maps, covering awide range of hi deficiencies and evolutionary phases of the groups, andcontaining at least one spiral galaxy. we derived the far-infrared (fir)luminosity (\lfir) from iras data and used it as a tracer of the sfr. wecalculated the hi mass, \lfir and \mhtwo deficiencies. the mean deficiencies of\lfir and \mhtwo of spiral galaxies in hcgs are close to 0, indicating thattheir average sfr and molecular gas content are similar to those of isolatedgalaxies. however, there are indications of an excess in \mhtwo\($\sim$ 50%) inspiral galaxies in hcgs which can be interpreted as either an enhancedmolecular gas content or as a higher concentration of \mhtwo towards the centerin comparison to galaxies in lower density environments. in contrast, the mean\mhi of spiral galaxies in hcgs is only 12% of the expected value. the specificstar formation rate (ssfr= sfr/stellar mass) tends to be lower for galaxieswith a higher \mhtwo\ or \mhi\ deficiency. this trend is not seen for the starformation efficiency (sfe=sfr/\mhtwo). we found tentative indications for anenhancement of \mhtwo\ in spiral galaxies in hcgs in an early evolutionaryphase and a decrease in later phases. we suggest that this might be due to anenhancement of the conversion from atomic to molecular gas due to on-goingtidal interactions in an early evolutionary phase, followed by hi stripping anda decrease of the molecular gas content because of lack of replenishment.

1205.4242	physical properties of dense molecular gas in centres of seyfert  galaxies	we present new ~1" resolution data of the dense molecular gas in the central50-100 pc of four nearby seyfert galaxies. pdbi observations of hcn and, in 2of the 4 sources, simultaneously hco+ allow us to carefully constrain thedynamical state of the dense gas surrounding the agn. analysis of thekinematics shows large line widths of 100-200 km/s fwhm that can only partiallyarise from beam smearing of the velocity gradient. the observed morphologicaland kinematic parameters (dimensions, major axis position angle, red and bluechannel separation, and integrated line width) are well reproduced by a thickdisk, where the emitting dense gas has a large intrinsic dispersion (20-40km/s), implying that it exists at significant scale heights (25-30% of the diskradius). to put the observed kinematics in the context of the starburst and agnevolution, we estimate the toomre q parameter. we find this is always greaterthan the critical value, i.e. q is above the limit such that the gas is stableagainst rapid star formation. this is supported by the lack of direct evidence,in these 4 seyfert galaxies, for on-going star formation close around the agn.instead, any current star formation tends to be located in a circumnuclearring. we conclude that the physical conditions are indeed not suited to starformation within the central ~100 pc.

1209.3665	gas fraction and star formation efficiency at z &lt; 1.0	after new observations of 39 galaxies at z = 0.6-1.0 obtained at the iram 30mtelescope, we present our full co line survey covering the redshift range 0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1. our aim is to determine the driving factors accounting for the steepdecline in the star formation rate during this epoch. we study both the gasfraction, defined as mgas/(mgas+mstar), and the star formation efficiency (sfe)defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass(lfir/m(h2), i.e. a measure for the inverse of the gas depletion time. thesources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), with lfirgreater than 10^12 lo and experiencing starbursts. when we adopt a standardulirg co-to-h2 conversion factor, their molecular gas depletion time is lessthan 100 myr. our full survey has now filled the gap of co observations in the0.2&lt;z&lt;1 range covering almost half of cosmic history. the detection rate in the0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 interval is 38% (15 galaxies out of 39), compared to 60% for the0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 interval. the average co luminosity is l'co = 1.8 10^10 k km/s pc^2,corresponding to an average h2 mass of 1.45 10^10 mo. from observation of 7galaxies in both co(2-1) and co(4-3), a high gas excitation has been derived;together with the dust mass estimation, this supports the choice of our lowulirg conversion factor between co luminosity and h2, for our sample sources.we find that both the gas fraction and the sfe significantly increase withredshift, by factors of 3 +-1 from z=0 to 1, and therefore both quantities playan important role and complement each other in cosmic star formation evolution.

1209.4305	star-formation laws in extreme starbursts	the observational study of star-formation laws is paramount to disentanglingthe physical processes at work on local and global scales in galaxies. to thisaim we have expanded the sample of extreme starbursts, represented by locallirgs and ulirgs, with high-quality data obtained in the 1-0 line of hcn. theanalysis of the new data shows that the star-formation efficiency of the densemolecular gas, derived from the fir/hcn luminosity ratio, is a factor 3-4higher in extreme starbursts compared to normal galaxies. we find a duality inthe kennicutt-schmidt laws that is enhanced if we account for the differentconversion factor for hcn (alpha_hcn) in extreme starbursts and correct for theunobscured star-formation rate in normal galaxies. we find that it is possibleto fit the observed differences in the fir/hcn ratios between normal galaxiesand lirgs/ulirgs with a common constant star-formation rate per free-fall time(sfr_ff) if we assume that hcn densities are ~1-2 orders of magnitude higher inlirgs/ulirgs, and provided that sfr_ ff~0.005-0.01 and/or if alpha_hcn is afactor of a few lower than our favored values.

1209.5523	star formation efficiency at intermediate redshift	star formation is evolving very fast in the second half of the universe, andit is yet unclear whether this is due to evolving gas content, or evolving starformation efficiency (sfe). we have carried out a survey of ultra-luminousgalaxies (ulirg) between z=0.2 and 1, to check the gas fraction in this domainof redshift which is still poorly known.  our survey with the iram-30m detected 33 galaxies out of 69, and we derive asignificant evolution of both the gas fraction and sfe of ulirgs over the wholeperiod, and in particular a turning point around z=0.35.  the result is sensitive to the co-to-h2, conversion factor adopted, and bothgas fraction and sfe have comparable evolution, when we adopt the low starburstconversion factor of \alpha =0.8 mo/(k km/s pc^2). adopting a higher \alphawill increase the role of the gas fraction.  using \alpha =0.8, the sfe and the gas fraction for z=0.2-1.0 ulirgs arefound to be significantly higher, by a factor 3, than for local ulirgs, and arecomparable to high redshift ones. we compare this evolution to the expectedcosmic h2 abundance and the cosmic star formation history.

0712.0319	a multi-transition hcn and hco+ study of 12 nearby active galaxies: agn  versus sb environments	recent studies have indicated that the hcn-to-co(j=1-0) andhco+-to-hcn(j=1-0) ratios are significantly different between galaxies with agn(active galactic nucleus) and sb (starburst) signatures. in order to study themolecular gas properties in active galaxies and search for differences betweenagn and sb environments, we observed the hcn(j=1-0), (j=2-1), (j=3-2),hco+(j=1-0) and hco+(j=3-2), emission with the iram 30m in the centre of 12nearby active galaxies which either exhibit nuclear sb and/or agn signatures.consistent with previous results, we find a significant difference of thehcn(j=2-1)-to-hcn(j=1-0), hcn(j=3-2)-to-hcn(j=1-0), hco+(j=3-2)-to-hco+(j=3-2),and hco+-to-hcn intensity ratios between the sources dominated by an agn andthose with an additional or pure central sb: the hcn, hco+ and hco+-to-hcnintensity ratios tend to be higher in the galaxies of our sample with a centralsb as opposed to the pure agn cases which show rather low intensity ratios.based on an lvg analysis of these data, i.e., assuming purely collisionalexcitation, the (average) molecular gas densities in the sb dominated sourcesof our sample seem to be systematically higher than in the agn sources. the lvganalysis seems to further support systematically higher hcn and/or lower hco+abundances as well as similar or higher gas temperatures in agn compared to thesb sources of our sample. also, we find that the hcn-to-co ratios decrease withincreasing rotational number j for the agn while they stay mostly constant forthe sb sources.

0712.0582	evidence of enhanced star formation efficiency in luminous and  ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present new observations made with the iram 30m telescope of the j=1-0 and3-2 lines of hcn and hco^+ used to probe the dense molecular gas content in asample of 17 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs). these observations have allowed us to derive an updated version of thepower law describing the correlation between the fir luminosity (l_fir) and thehcn(1-0) luminosity (l'_hcn(1-0)) of local and high-redshift galaxies. wepresent the first clear observational evidence that the star formationefficiency of the dense gas (sfe_dense), measured as the l_fir/l'_hcn(1-0)ratio, is significantly higher in lirgs and ulirgs than in normal galaxies, aresult that has also been found recently in high-redshift galaxies. this mayimply a statistically significant turn upward in the kennicutt-schmidt lawderived for the dense gas at l_fir &gt;= 10^11 l_sun. we have used a one-phaselarge velocity gradient (lvg) radiative transfer code to fit the threeindependent line ratios derived from our observations. the results of thisanalysis indicate that the [hcn]/[hco^+] abundance ratios could be up to oneorder of magnitude higher than normal in a significant number of lirgs andulirgs of our sample. an overabundance of hcn at high l_fir implies that thereported trend in the l_fir/l'_hcn ratio as a function of l_fir would beunderestimating a potentially more dramatic change of the sfe_dense. resultsobtained with two-phase lvg models corroborate that the l'_hcn(1-0)-to-m_denseconversion factor must be lowered at high l_fir. we discuss the implications ofthese findings for the use of hcn as a tracer of the dense molecular gas inlocal and high-redshift luminous infrared galaxies.

1301.0628	towards a resolved kennicutt-schmidt law at high redshift	massive galaxies in the distant universe form stars at much higher rates thantoday. although direct resolution of the star forming regions of these galaxiesis still a challenge, recent molecular gas observations at the iram plateau debure interferometer enable us to study the star formation efficiency onsubgalactic scales around redshift z = 1.2. we present a method for obtainingthe gas and star formation rate (sfr) surface densities of ensembles of clumpscomposing galaxies at this redshift, even though the corresponding scales arenot resolved. this method is based on identifying these structures inposition-velocity diagrams corresponding to slices within the galaxies. we useunique iram observations of the co(3-2) rotational line and deep2 spectra offour massive star forming distant galaxies - egs13003805, egs13004291,egs12007881, and egs13019128 in the aegis terminology - to determine the gasand sfr surface densities of the identifiable ensembles of clumps thatconstitute them. the integrated co line luminosity is assumed to be directlyproportional to the total gas mass, and the sfr is deduced from the [oii] line.we identify the ensembles of clumps with the angular resolution available inboth co and [oii] spectroscopy; i.e., 1-1.5". sfr and gas surface densities areaveraged in areas of this size, which is also the thickness of the deep2 slitsand of the extracted iram slices, and we derive a spatially resolvedkennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on a scale of ~8 kpc. the data generallyindicates an average depletion time of 1.9 gyr, but with significant variationsfrom point to point within the galaxies.

1403.3974	on carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in starburst galaxies: new data from  ngc253 and mrk231 and their implications	using the iram 30-m telescope, cn and co isotopologues have been measuredtoward the central regions of the nearby starburst galaxy ngc253 and theprototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in ngc253, the 12c/13c ratiois 40+-10. assuming that the ratio also holds for the co emitting gas, thisyields 16o/18o = 145+-36 and 16o/17o = 1290+-365 and a 32s/34s ratio close tothat measured for the local interstellar medium (20-25). no indication forvibrationally excited cn is found. peak line intensity ratios between ngc253and mrk231 are ~100 for 12c16o and 12c18o j=1-0, while the ratio for 13c16oj=1-0 is ~250. this and similar 13co and c18o line intensities in the j=1-0 and2-1 transitions of mrk231 suggest 12c/13c ~ 100 and 16o/18o ~ 100, in agreementwith values obtained for the less evolved ultraluminous merger arp220. alsoaccounting for other extragalactic data, 12c/13c ratios appear to vary over afull order of magnitude, from &gt;100 in ultraluminous high redshift galaxies to~100 in more local such galaxies to ~40 in weaker starbursts not undergoing alarge scale merger to 25 in the central molecular zone of the milky way. with12c being predominantly synthesized in massive stars, while 13c is mostlyejected by longer lived lower mass stars at later times, this is qualitativelyconsistent with our results of decreasing carbon isotope ratios with time andrising metallicity. it is emphasized, however, that both infall of poorlyprocessed material, initiating a nuclear starburst, as well as the ejecta fromnewly formed massive stars (in particular in case of a top-heavy stellarinitial mass function) can raise the carbon isotope ratio for a limited amountof time.

1404.7667	an alma early science survey of molecular absorption lines toward  pks1830-211 -- analysis of the absorption profiles	we present the first results of an alma spectral survey of strong absorptionlines for common interstellar species in the z=0.89 molecular absorber towardthe lensed blazar pks1830-211. the dataset brings essential information on thestructure and composition of the absorbing gas in the foreground galaxy. inparticular, we find absorption over large velocity intervals (gtrsim 100 km/s)toward both lensed images of the blazar. this suggests either that the galaxyinclination is intermediate and that we sample velocity gradients or streamingmotions in the disk plane, that the molecular gas has a large verticaldistribution or extraplanar components, or that the absorber is not a simplespiral galaxy but might be a merger system. the number of detected species isnow reaching a total of 42 different species plus 14 different rareisotopologues toward the sw image, and 14 species toward the ne line-of-sight.the abundances of ch, h2o, hco+, hcn, and nh3 relative to h2 are found to becomparable to those in the galactic diffuse medium. of all the lines detectedso far toward pks1830-211, the ground-state line of ortho-water has the deepestabsorption. we argue that ground-state lines of water have the best potentialfor detecting diffuse molecular gas in absorption at high redshift.

astro-ph;0402556	molecular gas chemistry in agn i. the iram survey of ngc1068	there is observational evidence that nuclear winds and x-rays can heavilyinfluence the physical conditions and chemical abundances of molecular gas inthe circumnuclear disks (cnd) of active galactic nuclei (agn). in this paper weprobe the chemical status of molecular gas in the cnd of ngc1068, aprototypical seyfert 2 galaxy. precedent claims that the chemistry of moleculargas in the nucleus of ngc1068 is abnormal by galactic standards were based onthe high hcn/co luminosity ratio measured in the cnd. results from newobservations obtained in this survey have served to derive abundances ofmolecular species such as sio, cn, hco+, hoc+, h13co+ and hco. these estimatesare complemented by a re-evaluation of molecular abundances for hcn, cs and co,based on previously published single-dish and interferometer observations ofngc1068. we report on the first detection of sio emission in the cnd ofngc1068. the estimated large abundance of sio in the cnd, x(sio)~5-10x10^{-9},cannot be attributed to shocks related to star formation, as there is littleevidence of a recent starburst in the nucleus of ngc1068. alternatively, wepropose that silicon chemistry is driven by intense x-ray processing ofmolecular gas. we also report on the first extragalactic detection of thereactive ion hoc+. most remarkably, the estimated hco+/hoc+ abundance ratio inthe nucleus of ngc1068, ~30-80, is the smallest ever measured in molecular gas.the abundances derived for all molecules that have been the subject of thissurvey are compared with the predictions of models invoking eitheroxygen-depletion or x-ray chemistry in molecular gas. our conclusions favour anoverall scenario where the cnd of ngc1068 has become a giant x-ray dominatedregion (xdr).

astro-ph;0507070	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): iv. gravitational torques  and agn feeding	we discuss the efficiency of stellar gravity torques as a mechanism toaccount for the feeding of the central engines of four low luminosity agn:ngc4321, ngc4826, ngc4579 and ngc6951. these galaxies have been observed aspart of the nuga co project, aimed at the study of agn fueling mechanisms. ourcalculations allow us to derive the characteristic time-scales for gas flowsand discuss whether torques from the stellar potentials are efficient enough todrain the gas angular momentum in the inner 1 kpc of these galaxies. resultsindicate paradoxically that feeding should be thwarted close to the agn: in thefour cases analyzed, gravity torques are mostly positive inside r~200pc,resulting in no inflow on these scales. as a possible solution for the paradox,we speculate that the agent responsible for driving inflow to still smallerradii is transient and thus presently absent in the stellar potential.alternatively, the gravity torque barrier associated with the ilr of the barsin these galaxies could be overcome by other mechanisms that become competitivein due time against gravity torques. we find that viscosity can counteractmoderate--to--low gravity torques on the gas if it acts on a nuclear ring ofhigh gas surface density contrast and a few 100pc size. we propose anevolutionary scenario in which gravity torques and viscosity act in concert toproduce recurrent episodes of activity during the typical lifetime of anygalaxy. in this scenario the recurrence of activity in galaxies is indirectlyrelated to that of the bar instabilities.

astro-ph;0508311	insights into the carbon chemistry of mon r2	aiming to learn about the chemistry of the dense pdr around the ultracompact(uc) hii region in mon r2, we have observed a series of mm-wavelengthtransitions of c3h2 and c2h. in addition, we have traced the distribution ofother molecules, such as h13co+, sio, hco, and hc3n. these data, together withthe reactive ions recently detected, have been considered to determine thephysical conditions and to model the pdr chemistry. we then identified two kindof molecules. the first group, formed by the reactive ions (co+, hoc+) andsmall hydrocarbons (c2h, c3h2), traces the surface layers of the pdr and ispresumably exposed to a high uv field (hence we called it as "high uv", orhuv). huv species is expected to dominate for visual absorptions 2 &lt; av &lt; 5mag. a second group (less exposed to the uv field, and hence called "low uv",or luv) includes hco and sio, and is mainly present at the edges of the pdr (av&gt; 5 mag). while the abundances of the huv molecules can be explained by gasphase models, this is not the case for the studied luv ones. although someefficient gas-phase reactions might be lacking, grain chemistry sounds like aprobable mechanism able to explain the observed enhancement of hco and sio.within this scenario, the interaction of uv photons with grains produces animportant effect on the molecular gas chemistry and constitutes the firstevidence of an ionization front created by the uc hii region carving its hostmolecular cloud. the physical conditions and kinematics of the gas layer whichsurrounds the uc hii region were derived from the huv molecules. molecularhydrogen densities &gt; 4 10^6 cm^(-3) are required to reproduce the observations.such high densities suggest that the hii region could be pressure-confined bythe surrounding high density molecular gas.

astro-ph;0510290	large-scale molecular shocks in galaxies: the sio interferometer map of  ic342	(abridged) we present the first high-resolution (5.6''x5.1'') images of theemission of silicon monoxide (sio) in the nearby spiral ic342, obtained withthe iram plateau de bure interferometer. we have mapped the emission of thesio(2-1) and h13co+(1-0) lines in a 0.9kpcx1.3kpc region around the nucleus ofic342. the bulk of the line emission comes from a 290pc spiral arm and a r~80pcnuclear ring. the distribution of sio clouds is mostly anticorrelated with thecontinuum emission at 87ghz, dominated by thermal free-free bremsstrahlung. thesio/h13co+ intensity ratio increases by an order of magnitude from the nuclearring to the spiral arm. furthermore the gas kinematics show significantdifferences between sio and h13co+ over the spiral arm, where the linewidths ofsio are 2 times larger than that of h13co+. the average abundance of sio in theinner r~320pc, x(sio)&gt;2x10^{-10}, evidences that shock chemistry is at work inic342. we have compared the emission of sio with another tracer of molecularshocks: the emission of methanol (ch3oh). the significant difference of thex(sio) measured between the spiral arm (~a few 10^{-9}) and the nuclear ring(~10^{-10}) is not echoed by a comparable variation in the sio/ch3oh intensityratio. this implies that the typical shock velocities should be similar in bothregions. in contrast, the fraction of shocked molecular gas should be 5-7 timeslarger in the spiral arm (up to ~10% of the available molecular gas mass overthe arm region) compared to the nuclear ring. we conclude that the large-scaleshocks revealed by the sio map of ic342 are mostly unrelated with starformation and arise instead in a pre-starburst phase. shocks are driven bycloud-cloud collisions along the potential well of the ic342 bar. the generalimplications for the current understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.

astro-ph;0701403	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): vi. detection of a molecular  gas disk/torus via hcn in the seyfert2 galaxy ngc6951?	several studies of nearby active galaxies indicate significantly higherhcn-to-co intensity ratios in agn than in starburst (sb) environments. hcnenhancement can be caused by many different effects, such as higher gasdensities/temperatures, uv/x-ray radiation, and non-collisional excitation. asactive galaxies often exhibit intense circumnuclear sb, high angularresolution/sensitivity observations are of paramount importance todisentangling the influence of sb from that of nuclear activity on thechemistry of the surrounding molecular gas. the tight relation of hcnenhancement and nuclear activity may qualify hcn as an ideal tracer ofmolecular gas close to the agn, providing complementary and additionalinformation to that gained via co. ngc6951 houses nuclear and sb activity,making it an ideal testbed in which to study the effects of differentexcitation conditions on the molecular gas. we used the new abcd configurationsof the iram pdbi to observe hcn(1-0) in ngc6951 at high angular resolution(1''). we detect very compact (&lt;50pc) hcn emission in its nucleus, supportingprevious hints of nuclear gas structure. our observations also reveal hcnemission in the sb ring and resolve it into several peaks, leading to a highercoincidence between the hcn and co distributions than previously reported. wefind a significantly higher hcn-to-co intensity ratio (&gt;0.4) in the nucleusthan in the sb ring (0.02-0.05). as for ngc1068, this might result from ahigher hcn abundance in the centre due to an x-ray dominated gas chemistry, buta higher gas density/temperature or additional non-collisional excitation ofhcn cannot be entirely ruled out, based on these observations. the compact hcnemission is associated with rotating gas in a circumnuclear disk/torus.

0810.4892	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga). xi. a complete gravity  torque map of ngc4579: new clues on bar evolution	we create a complete gravity torque map of the disk of the liner/seyfert 1.9galaxy ngc4579. we quantify the efficiency of angular momentum transport andsearch for signatures of secular evolution in the fueling process from r~15kpcdown to the inner r~50pc around the active galactic nucleus (agn). we use boththe 1-0 and 2-1 line maps of co obtained with the plateau de bureinterferometer (pdbi) as part of the nuclei of galaxies-(nuga)-project. wederive the stellar potential from a nir (k band) wide field image of thegalaxy. the k-band image, which reveals a stellar bar, together with a highresolution hi map of ngc4579 obtained with the very large array (vla), allow usto extend the gravity torque analysis to the outer disk. the bulk of the gasresponse traced by the co pdbi maps follows the expected gas flow patterninduced by the bar potential in the presence of two inner lindblad resonances(ilr). we also detect an oval distortion in the inner r~200pc of the k-bandimage. the oval is not aligned with the large-scale bar, a signature ofdynamical decoupling. the morphology of the outer disk suggests that theneutral gas is currently piling up in a pseudo-ring formed by two windingspiral arms that are morphologically decoupled from the bar structure. in theouter disk, the decoupling of the spiral allows the gas to efficiently producenet gas inflow on intermediate scales. the corotation barrier seems to beovercome due to secular evolution processes. the gas in the inner disk isefficiently funneled by gravity torques down to r~300pc. closer to the agn, thetwo m=2 modes (bar and oval) act in concert to produce net gas inflow down tor~50pc, providing a clear smoking gun evidence of fueling with associated shortdynamical time-scales.
