0901.2930	the kiloparsec-scale kinematics of high-redshift star-forming galaxies	we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the kinematic structureof star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 3 using keck/osiris integral fieldspectroscopy. our sample is comprised of 12 galaxies between redshifts z ~ 2.0and 2.5 and one galaxy at z ~ 3.3 which are well detected in either halpha or[o iii] emission. these observations were obtained in conjunction with the kecklaser guide star adaptive optics system, with a typical angular resolutionafter spatial smoothing ~ 0.15" (approximately 1 kpc at the redshift of thetarget sample). at most five of these 13 galaxies have spatially resolvedvelocity gradients consistent with rotation while the remaining galaxies haverelatively featureless or irregular velocity fields. all of our galaxies showlocal velocity dispersions ~ 60 - 100 km/s, suggesting that (particularly forthose galaxies with featureless velocity fields) rotation about a preferredaxis may not be the dominant mechanism of physical support. while some galaxiesshow evidence for major mergers such evidence is unrelated to the kinematics ofindividual components (one of our strongest merger candidates also exhibitsunambiguous rotational structure), refuting a simple bimodal disk/mergerclassification scheme. we discuss these data in light of complementary surveysand extant uv-ir spectroscopy and photometry, concluding that the dynamicalimportance of cold gas may be the primary factor governing the observedkinematics of z ~ 2 galaxies. we conclude by speculating on the importance ofmechanisms for accreting low angular-momentum gas and the early formation ofquasi-spheroidal systems in the young universe.(abridged)

0902.1991	a downturn in intergalactic civ as redshift 6 is approached	we present the results of the largest survey to date for intergalactic metalsat redshifts z &gt; 5, using near-ir spectra of nine qsos with emission redshiftsz(em) &gt; 5.7. we find, for the first time, a change in the comoving mass densityof c iv ions as we look back to redshifts z &gt; 5. at a mean &lt;z&gt; = 5.76, wededuce omega(c iv)=(4.4+/-2.6)x10^(-9) which implies a drop by a factor ofabout 3.5 compared to the value at z &lt; 4.7, after accounting for the differingsensitivities of different surveys. the observed number of c iv doublets isalso lower by a similar factor, compared to expectations for a non-evolvingcolumn density distribution of absorbers. these results point to a rapidbuild-up of intergalactic c iv over a period of only 300 myr; such a build-upcould reflect the accumulation of metals associated with the rising levels ofstar formation activity from z = 9 indicated by galaxy counts, and/or anincreasing degree of ionisation of the intergalactic medium (igm), followingthe overlap of ionisation fronts from star-forming regions. if the value ofomega(c iv) we derive is typical of the igm at large, it would imply ametallicity z(igm) = 10^(-4) z(sun). the early-type stars responsible forsynthesising these metals would have emitted only about one lyman continuumphoton per baryon prior to z = 5.8; such a background is insufficient to keepthe igm ionised and we speculate on possible factors which could make up therequired shortfall.

0706.2865	morphologies of galaxies in and around a protocluster at z=2.300	we present results from the first robust investigation of galaxy morphologyas a function of environment at z&gt;1.5. our study is motivated by the fact thatstar-forming galaxies contained within a protocluster at z=2.3 in the hs1700+64field have significantly older ages and larger stellar masses on average thanthose at similar redshifts but more typical environmental densities. in theanalysis of hst/acs images, we apply non-parametric statistics to characterizethe rest-frame uv morphologies of a sample of 85 uv-selected star-forminggalaxies at z=1.7-2.9, 22 of which are contained in the protocluster. theremaining 63 control-sample galaxies are not in the protocluster but have asimilar mean redshift of &lt;z&gt;~2.3. we find no environmental dependence for thedistributions of morphological properties. combining the measured morphologieswith the results of population synthesis modeling, we find only weakcorrelations, if any, between morphological and stellar population propertiessuch as stellar mass, age, extinction and star-formation rate. given theincomplete census of the protocluster galaxy population, and the lack ofcorrelation between rest-frame uv morphology and star-formation history at z~2within our sample, the absence of environmental trends in the distribution ofmorphological properties is not surprising. additionally, using a larger sampleof photometric candidates, we compare morphological distributions for 282uv-selected and 43 near-ir-selected galaxies. while the difference in thedegree of nebulosity between the two samples appears to be a byproduct of thefainter average rest-frame uv surface brightness of the near-ir-selectedgalaxies, we find that, among the lowest surface brightness galaxies, thenear-ir-selected objects have significantly smaller angular sizes (abridged).

0706.4091	multi-wavelength constraints on the cosmic star formation history from  spectroscopy: the rest-frame uv, h-alpha, and infrared luminosity functions  at redshifts 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4	we use a sample of rest-frame uv selected and spectroscopically observedgalaxies at redshifts 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4, combined with ground-based spectroscopich-alpha and spitzer mips 24 micron data, to derive the most robust measurementsof the rest-frame uv, h-alpha, and infrared (ir) luminosity functions (lfs) atthese redshifts. our sample is by far the largest of its kind, with over 2000spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4 and ~15000 photometriccandidates in 29 independent fields covering a total area of almost a squaredegree. our method for computing the lfs takes into account a number ofsystematic effects, including photometric scatter, ly-alpha perturbations tooptical colors, and contaminants. taking into account the latter, we find noevidence for an excess of uv-bright galaxies over what was inferred in earlyz~3 lbg studies. the uv lf appears to undergo little evolution between z~4 andz~2. corrected for extinction, the uv luminosity density (ld) at z~2 is atleast as large as the value at z~3 and a factor of ~9 larger than the value atz~6, primarily reflecting an increase in the number density of bright galaxiesbetween z~6 and z~2. our analysis yields the first constraints anchored byextensive spectroscopy on the ir and bolometric lfs for faint and moderatelyluminous (l[bol]&lt;10^12 l_sun) galaxies. adding the ir to the emergent uvluminosity, incorporating independent measurements of the ld from ulirgs, andassuming realistic dust attenuation values for uv-faint galaxies, indicatesthat galaxies with l[bol]&lt;10^12 l_sun account for ~80% of the bolometric ld andsfrd at z~2-3. our multi-wavelength constraints on the global sfrd indicatethat approximately one-third of the present-day stellar mass density was formedin sub-ultraluminous galaxies between redshifts z=1.9-3.4.

0906.2197	rest-frame optical spectra of three strongly lensed galaxies at z~2	we present keck ii nirspec rest-frame optical spectra for three recentlydiscovered lensed galaxies: the cosmic horseshoe (z = 2.38), the clone (z =2.00), and sdss j090122.37+181432.3 (z = 2.26). the boost in signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) from gravitational lensing provides an unusually detailed view ofthe physical conditions in these objects. a full complement of high s/nrest-frame optical emission lines is measured, spanning from rest-frame 3600 to6800aa, including robust detections of fainter lines such as h-gamma,[sii]6717,6732, and in one instance [neii]3869. sdss j090122.37+181432.3 showsevidence for agn activity, and therefore we focus our analysis on star-formingregions in the cosmic horseshoe and the clone. for these two objects, weestimate a wide range of physical properties, including star-formation rate(sfr), metallicity, dynamical mass, and dust extinction. in all respects, thelensed objects appear fairly typical of uv-selected star-forming galaxies atz~2. the clone occupies a position on the emission-line diagnostic diagram of[oiii]/h-beta vs. [nii]/h-alpha that is offset from the locations of z~0galaxies. our new nirspec measurements may provide quantitative insights intowhy high-redshift objects display such properties. from the [sii] line ratio,high electron densities (~1000 cm^(-3)) are inferred compared to localgalaxies, and [oiii]/[oii] line ratios indicate higher ionization parameterscompared to the local population. building on previous similar results at z~2,these measurements provide further evidence (at high s/n) that star-formingregions are significantly different in high-redshift galaxies, compared totheir local counterparts (abridged).

0906.2412	the ultraviolet spectrum of the gravitationally lensed galaxy `the  cosmic horseshoe': a close-up of a star-forming galaxy at z = 2	taking advantage of strong gravitational lensing, we have recorded therest-frame uv spectrum of the z = 2.38115 galaxy `the cosmic horseshoe'(j1148+1930) at higher resolution and s/n than is currently feasible forunlensed galaxies at z = 2 -3. from the analysis of stellar spectral features,we conclude that a continuous mode of star formation with a salpeter slopegives a good representation of the uv spectrum, ruling out significantdepartures from a `standard' imf. generally, we find good agreement between thevalues of metallicity deduced from stellar and nebular tracers. interstellarabsorption is present over a velocity range of 1000 km/s, from -800$ to +250km/s relative to the stars and their h ii regions, and there is evidence thatthe outflowing interstellar gas may be patchy, covering only 60% of the uvstellar continuum. the lya line shares many of the characteristics of theso-called lya emitters. its double-peaked profile can be reproduced by modelsof lya photons resonantly scattered by an expanding shell of gas and dust, with10-15% of the photons escaping the galaxy. many of the physical properties ofthe cosmic horseshoe are similar to those of the only other galaxy at z = 2-3studied in comparable detail up to now: ms 1512-cb58. the fact that these twogalaxies have drastically different lya lines may be due simply to orientationeffects, or differences in the covering factor of outflowing gas, and cautionsagainst classifying high-z galaxies only on the basis of spectral features,such as lya, whose appearance can be affected by a variety of differentparameters.

0909.1321	the nature of hi absorbers in grb afterglows: clues from hydrodynamic  simulations	in recent work, we have shown that it is possible to link quantitatively manyaspects of damped lyman alpha (dla) absorbers in the spectra of quasars to highresolution simulations of galaxy formation. using runs from the same series ofhydrodynamic numerical studies, we consider the expected properties of lymanalpha absorbers seen in the spectra of high redshift (z&gt;2) gamma ray burstafterglows (grb-dlas). if grbs are associated with the death of massive stars,their afterglows provide insights into otherwise unprobed regions ofprotogalactic objects, but detailed physical interpretations are currentlyembryonic.  we find that median impact parameters (measured from the potential minimum)are approximately 1 kpc for grbs compared with 4 kpc for qso-dlas. however, anequally important difference is that grb-dlas are predominantly associated withhalos of mass 10^10&lt;m_vir/m_sol&lt;10^12, an order of magnitude larger than thehosts of qso-dlas. accordingly, there are differences in the stellar propertiesof hosts.  our simulations accurately predict the form of the grb-dla hi column densitydistribution, producing quantitative agreement for n_hi&gt;10^19 cm^-2, but theysomewhat underpredict the incidence of low column densities n_hi&lt;10^19 cm^-2.line-of-sight neutral gas metallicities predicted by our simulations (10^-2 &lt;z/z_sol &lt; 1) are consistent with the modest observational constraints. becauseof large internal dispersions in gas metallicities, this agreement is notsignificantly compromised by imposing a cut-off on the metallicity of starsable to launch grbs (z_star&lt;z_sol/3), confounding claims that the observedmetallicity of grb-dlas poses a challenge to current grb models.

0910.0840	a study of interstellar gas and stars in the gravitationally lensed  galaxy `the cosmic eye' from rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopy	we report the results of a study of the rest-frame uv spectrum of the cosmiceye, a luminous lyman break galaxy at z=3.07331 gravitationally lensed by afactor of 25. the spectrum, recorded with the esi spectrograph on the keck iitelescope, is rich in absorption features from the gas and massive stars inthis galaxy. the interstellar absorption lines are resolved into two componentsof approximately equal strength and each spanning several hundred km/s invelocity. one component has a net blueshift of -70 km/s relative to the starsand h ii regions and presumably arises in a galaxy-scale outflow similar tothose seen in most star-forming galaxies at z = 2-3. the other is more unusualin showing a mean redshift of +350 km/s relative to the systemic redshift;possible interpretations include a merging clump, or material ejected by aprevious star formation episode and now falling back onto the galaxy, or moresimply a chance alignment with a foreground galaxy. in the metal absorptionlines, both components only partially cover the ob stars against which they arebeing viewed. we tentatively associate the redshifted component with the strongdamped lyman alpha line, indicative of a column density n(h i) = (3.0 +/- 0.8)x 10(21) atoms/cm2, and propose that it provides the dust `foreground screen'responsible for the low ratio of far-infrared to uv luminosities of the cosmiceye. compared to other well-studied examples of strongly lensed galaxies, wefind that the young stellar population of the cosmic eye is essentiallyindistinguishable from those of the cosmic horseshoe and ms 1512-cb58, whilethe interstellar spectra of all three galaxies are markedly different,attesting to the real complexity of the interplay between starbursts andambient interstellar matter in young galaxies (abridged).

0911.2000	the relationship between stellar populations and lyman alpha emission in  lyman break galaxies	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 321 lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3 to investigate systematically the relationshipbetween lya emission and stellar populations. lya equivalent widths (ew) werecalculated from rest-frame uv spectroscopy and optical/near-infrared/spitzerphotometry was used in population synthesis modeling to derive the keyproperties of age, dust extinction, star formation rate (sfr), and stellarmass. we directly compare the stellar populations of lbgs with and withoutstrong lya emission, where we designate the former group (ew &gt; 20 aa) as lyaemitters (laes) and the latter group (ew &lt; 20 aa) as non-laes. this controlledmethod of comparing objects from the same uv luminosity distribution representsan improvement over previous studies in which the stellar populations of lbgsand narrowband-selected laes were contrasted, where the latter were oftenintrinsically fainter in broadband filters by an order of magnitude simply dueto different selection criteria. using a variety of statistical tests, we findthat lya equivalent width and age, sfr, and dust extinction, respectively, aresignificantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong lya emissionalso tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty thanobjects with weak lya emission, or the line in absorption. we accordinglyconclude that, within the lbg sample, objects with strong lya emissionrepresent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-inducedoutflows have reduced the dust covering fraction. we also examined thehypothesis that the attenuation of lya photons is lower than that of thecontinuum, as proposed by some, but found no evidence to support this picture.

0707.3634	integral field spectroscopy of high-redshift star forming galaxies with  laser guided adaptive optics: evidence for dispersion-dominated kinematics	we present early results from an ongoing study of the kinematic structure ofstar-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 3 using integral-field spectroscopyof rest-frame optical nebular emission lines in combination with keck laserguide star adaptive optics (lgsao). we show kinematic maps of 3 target galaxiesq1623-bx453, q0449-bx93, and dsf2237a-c2 located at redshifts z = 2.1820,2.0067, and 3.3172 respectively, each of which is well-resolved with a psfmeasuring approximately 0.11 - 0.15 arcsec (~ 900 - 1200 pc at z ~ 2-3) aftercosmetic smoothing. neither galaxy at z ~ 2 exhibits substantial kinematicstructure on scales &gt;~ 30 km/s; both are instead consistent with largelydispersion-dominated velocity fields with sigma ~ 80 km/s along any given lineof sight into the galaxy. in contrast, dsf2237a-c2 presents a well-resolvedgradient in velocity over a distance of ~ 4 kpc with peak-to-peak amplitude of140 km/s. it is unlikely that dsf2237a-c2 represents a dynamically coldrotating disk of ionized gas as the local velocity dispersion of the galaxy(sigma = 79 km/s) is comparable to the observed shear. using extantmulti-wavelength spectroscopy and photometry we relate these kinematic data tophysical properties such as stellar mass, gas fraction, star formation rate,and outflow kinematics and consider the applicability of current galaxyformation models.[abridged]

1002.0837	dust obscuration and metallicity at high redshift: new inferences from  uv, h-alpha, and 8 micron observations of z~2 star-forming galaxies	we use a sample of 90 spectroscopically-confirmed lyman break galaxies withh-alpha and 24 micron observations to constrain the relationship betweenrest-frame 8 micron luminosity, l(8), and star formation rate (sfr) for l*galaxies at z~2. we find a tight correlation with 0.24 dex scatter between l8and l(ha)/sfr for z~2 galaxies with l(ir)~10^10 - 10^12 lsun. employing thisrelationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts,we find that the uv slope can be used to recover the dust attenuation of thevast majority of l* galaxies at z~2 to within 0.4 dex scatter using the localcorrelation. separately, young galaxies with ages &lt;100 myr appear to follow anextinction curve that is steeper than the one found for local starburstgalaxies. therefore, such young galaxies may be significantly less dusty thaninferred previously. our results provide the first direct evidence, independentof the uv slope, for a correlation between uv and bolometric luminosity at highredshift, in the sense that uv-faint galaxies are also on average less infraredand less bolometrically-luminous than their uv-bright counterparts. further, asthe sfr increases, the uv luminosity reaches a maximum value corresponding tol* at z~2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible formodulating the bright-end of the uv luminosity function. l* galaxies at z~2,while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically-luminous, exhibitratios of metals-to-dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. thisresult is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a lessmetal-rich environment compared to local galaxies of the same luminosity, thusnaturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the luminosity-metallicityand luminosity-obscuration relations.

1003.0693	large scale outflows from z ~ 0.7 starburst galaxies identified via  ultra-strong mgii quasar absorption lines	(abridged) star formation-driven outflows are a critical phenomenon intheoretical treatments of galaxy evolution, despite the limited ability ofobservations to trace them across cosmological timescales. if the strongestmgii absorption-line systems detected in the spectra of background quasarsarise in such outflows, "ultra-strong" mgii (usmgii) absorbers would identifysignificant numbers of galactic winds over a huge baseline in cosmic time, in amanner independent of the luminous properties of the galaxy. to this end, wepresent the first detailed imaging and spectroscopic study of the fields of twousmgii absorber systems culled from a statistical absorber catalog, with thegoal of understanding the physical processes leading to the large velocityspreads that define such systems. each field contains two bright emission-linegalaxies at similar redshift (dv &lt; 300 km/s) to that of the absorption.lower-limits on their instantaneous star formation rates (sfr) from theobserved oii and hb line fluxes, and stellar masses from spectral templatefitting indicate specific sfrs among the highest for their masses at z~0.7.additionally, their 4000a break and balmer absorption strengths imply they haveundergone recent (~0.01 - 1 gyr) starbursts. the concomitant presence of tworare phenomena - starbursts and usmgii absorbers - strongly implies a causalconnection. we consider these data and usmgii absorbers in general in thecontext of various popular models, and conclude that galactic outflows aregenerally necessary to account for the velocity extent of the absorption. wefavour starburst driven outflows over tidally-stripped gas from a majorinteraction which triggered the starburst as the energy source for the majorityof systems. finally, we discuss the implications of these results and speculateon the overall contribution of such systems to the global sfr density at z~0.7.

0708.0007	the sightline to q2343-bx415: clues to galaxy formation in a quasar  environment	(abridged) we have discovered a strong dla coincident in redshift with thefaint qso q2343-bx415 (r = 20.2, z_em = 2.57393). follow-up observations atintermediate spectral resolution reveal that the metal lines associated withthis 'proximate' dla consist of two sets of absorption components. one set ismoving towards the quasar with velocities of ~ 150-600 km/s; this gas is highlyionized and does not fully cover the continuum source, suggesting that it isphysically close to the active nucleus. the other, which accounts for most ofthe neutral gas, is blueshifted relative to the qso, with the strongestcomponent at ~ -160 km/s. we consider the possibility that the pdla arises inthe outflowing interstellar medium of the host galaxy of q2343-bx415, aninterpretation supported by strong c iv and n v absorption at nearbyvelocities, and by the intense radiation field longward of the lyman limitimplied by the high c ii*/h i ratio. if q2343-bx415 is the main source of theseuv photons, then the pdla is located at either ~ 8 or ~ 37 kpc from the activenucleus. alternatively, the absorber may be a foreground star-forming galaxyunrelated to the quasar and coincidentally at the same redshift, but our deepimaging and follow-up spectroscopy of the field of q2343-bx415 has not yetproduced a likely candidate. we measure the abundances of 14 elements in thepdla, finding an overall metallicity of ~ 1/5 solar and a normal pattern ofrelative element abundances for this metallicity. thus, in this pdla there isno evidence for the super-solar metallicities that have been claimed for someproximate, high ionization, systems.

1011.0733	a carbon-enhanced metal-poor damped lyman alpha system: probing gas from  population iii nucleosynthesis?	we present high resolution observations of an extremely metal-poor dampedlyman-alpha system, at z_abs = 2.3400972 in the spectrum of the qso j0035-0918,exhibiting an abundance pattern consistent with model predictions for thesupernova yields of population iii stars. specifically, this dla has [fe/h] =-3.04, shows a clear `odd-even' effect, and is c-rich with [c/fe] = +1.53, afactor of about 20 greater than reported in any other damped lyman-alphasystem. in analogy to the carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars in the galactic halo(with [c/fe] &gt; +1.0), this is the first reported case of a carbon-enhanceddamped lyman-alpha system. we determine an upper limit to the mass of 12c,m(12c) &lt; 200 solar masses, which depends on the unknown gas density n(h); ifn(h) &gt; 1 atom per cubic cm (which is quite likely for this dla given its lowvelocity dispersion), then m(12c) &lt; 2 solar masses, consistent with pollutionby only a few prior supernovae. we speculate that dlas such as the one reportedhere may represent the `missing link' between the yields of pop iii stars andtheir later incorporation in the class of carbon-enhanced metal-poor starswhich show no enhancement of neutron-capture elements (cemp-no stars).

1104.4194	a galaxy as the source of a civ absorption system close to the epoch of  reionization	we find a bright (l_{uv}=2.5 l*_{z=6}) lyman alpha emitter at redshiftz=5.719 at a projected distance of 79 physical kpc from a strong triply ionizedcarbon (civ) absorption system at redshift z=5.7238 previously reported in thespectrum of the z_{em} = 6.309 qso sdss j1030+0524. this is the highestredshift galaxy-absorber pair detected to-date, supporting the idea thatgalaxy-wide outflows were already in place at the end of the epoch ofreionization. the proximity of this object makes it the most likely source ofmetals, consistent with models of outflows at lower redshift where significantobservational evidence relates metal absorption systems with galaxies hostingoutflows.  in a typical outflow scenario, a wind of 200 km/s, active since the universewas only 0.6 gyr old (z ~8.4), could eject metals out to 79 kpc at z=5.719.although the origin of metals in the intergalactic medium (igm) is still underdebate, our results are consistent with predictions from cosmologicalsimulations which reproduce the evolution of the cosmic density of civ, from z~ 6 to the present day based on outflow-driven enrichment of the igm.  we also report two more lyman alpha emitters in this field, at z=5.973\pm0.002 and z=5.676\pm 0.002 respectively, the former confirming the originalidentification by stiavelli et al. our results suggest that the colour cuttypically used to identify i-dropouts (i_{775}-z_{850}&gt;1.3) misses anon-negligible fraction of blue galaxies with faint uv continuum at z \geq 5.7.

1106.2805	the most metal-poor damped lyman-alpha systems: insights into chemical  evolution in the very metal-poor regime	we present a high spectral resolution survey of the most metal-poor dampedlyman-alpha absorption systems (dlas) aimed at probing the nature andnucleosynthesis of the earliest generations of stars. our survey comprises 22systems with iron abundance less than 1/100 solar; observations of seven ofthese are reported here for the first time. together with recent measures ofthe abundances of c and o in galactic metal-poor stars, we reinvestigate thetrend of c/o in the very metal-poor regime and we compare, for the first time,the o/fe ratios in the most metal-poor dlas and in halo stars. we confirm thenear-solar values of c/o in dlas at the lowest metallicities probed, and findthat their distribution is in agreement with that seen in galactic halo stars.we find that the o/fe ratio in very metal-poor (vmp) dlas is essentiallyconstant, and shows very little dispersion, with a mean [&lt;o/fe&gt;] = +0.39 +/-0.12, in good agreement with the values measured in galactic halo stars whenthe oxygen abundance is measured from the [o i] 6300 line. we speculate thatsuch good agreement in the observed abundance trends points to a universalorigin for these metals. in view of this agreement, we construct the abundancepattern for a typical very metal-poor dla and compare it to model calculationsof population ii and population iii nucleosynthesis to determine the origin ofthe metals in vmp dlas. our results suggest that the most metal-poor dlas mayhave been enriched by a generation of metal-free stars; however, given thatabundance measurements are currently available for only a few elements, wecannot yet rule out an additional contribution from population ii stars.

0710.2899	discovery of 21cm absorption in a $z_{\rm abs} =2.289$ dla towards txs  0311+430: the first low spin temperature absorber at z &gt; 1	we report the detection of hi 21 cm absorption from the $z=2.289$ dampedlyman-$\alpha$ system (dla) towards txs 0311+430, with the green banktelescope. the 21 cm absorption has a velocity spread (between nulls) of $\sim110$ km s$^{-1}$ and an integrated optical depth of $\int \tau {\rm d}v =(0.818 \pm 0.085)$ km s$^{-1}$. we also present new giant metrewave radiotelescope 602 mhz imaging of the radio continuum. txs 0311+430 is unresolved atthis frequency, indicating that the covering factor of the dla is likely to behigh. combining the integrated optical depth with the dla hi column density of\nhi = $(2 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{20}$ \cm, yields a spin temperature of $t_s =(138 \pm 36)$ k, assuming a covering factor of unity. this is the first case ofa low spin temperature ($&lt; 350$ k) in a $z &gt; 1$ dla and is among the lowestever measured in any dla. indeed, the $t_s$ measured for this dla is similar tovalues measured in the milky way and local disk galaxies. we also determine alower limit (si/h) $\gtrsim 1/3$ solar for the dla metallicity, amongst thehighest abundances measured in dlas at any redshift. based on low redshiftcorrelations, the low $t_s$, large 21 cm absorption width and high metallicityall suggest that the $z \sim 2.289$ dla is likely to arise in a massive,luminous disk galaxy.

1205.0555	the characteristic star formation histories of galaxies at redshifts  z~2-7	a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;3.7, withcomplementary imaging in the near- and mid-ir from the ground and from hubbleand spitzer, is used to infer the average star formation histories (sfhs) oftypical galaxies from z~7 to 2. for a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6, weperform a comparison of star formation rates (sfrs) determined from sedmodeling (sfrs[sed]) and those calculated from deep keck uv and spitzer/mips 24micron imaging (sfrs[ir+uv]). exponentially declining sfhs yield sfrs[sed] thatare 5-10x lower on average than sfrs[ir+uv], indicating that declining sfhs maynot be accurate for typical galaxies at z&gt;2. the sfrs of z~2-3 galaxies aredirectly proportional to their stellar masses m*, with unity slope---a resultthat is confirmed with spitzer/irac stacks of 1179 uv-faint (r&gt;25.5)galaxies---for m*&gt;5e8 msun and sfrs &gt;2 msun/yr. we interpret this result in thecontext of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of thesfr-m* relation. the average specific sfrs at z~2-3 are similar within a factorof two to those measured at z&gt;4, implying an average sfh where sfrs increasewith time. a consequence of these rising sfhs is that (a) a substantialfraction of uv-bright z~2-3 galaxies had faint sub-l* progenitors at z&gt;4; and(b) gas masses must increase with time from z=7 to 2, over which time the netcold gas accretion rate---as inferred from the specific sfr and thekennicutt-schmidt relation---is ~2-3x larger than the sfr . however, if weevolve to higher redshift the sfhs and masses of the halos that are expected tohost l* galaxies at z~2, we find that &lt;10% of the baryons accreted onto typicalhalos at z&gt;4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. theseresults highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at earlycosmic times when galaxies were first assembling.

1205.3785	a new, precise measurement of the primordial abundance of deuterium	the metal-poor damped lyman alpha (dla) system at z = 3.04984 in the qsosdssj1419+0829 has near-ideal properties for an accurate determination of theprimordial abundance of deuterium, (d/h)_p. we have analysed a high-qualityspectrum of this object with software specifically designed to deduce the bestfitting value of d/h and to assess comprehensively the random and systematicerrors affecting this determination. we find (d/h)_dla = (2.535 +/-0.05) x10^(-5), which in turn implies omega_b h^2 = 0.0223 +/- 0.0009, in very goodagreement with omega_b h^2 (cmb) = 0.0222 +/- 0.0004 deduced from the angularpower spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. if the value in this dla isindeed the true (d/h)_p produced by big-bang nucleosynthesis (bbn), there maybe no need to invoke non-standard physics nor early astration of d to bringtogether omega_b h^2 (bbn) and omega_b h^2 (cmb). the scatter between most ofthe reported values of (d/h)_p in the literature may be due largely tounaccounted systematic errors and biases. further progress in this area willrequire a homogeneous set of data comparable to those reported here andanalysed in a self-consistent manner. such an endeavour, while observationallydemanding, has the potential of improving our understanding of bbn physics,including the relevant nuclear reactions, and the subsequent processing of 4heand 7li through stars.

1209.0005	the temperature-density relation in the intergalactic medium at redshift  &lt;z&gt;=2.4	we present new measurements of the temperature-density (t-rho) relation forneutral hydrogen in the 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 intergalactic medium (igm) using a sampleof ~6000 individual hi absorbers fitted with voigt profiles constrained in allcases by multiple lyman series transitions. we find model independent evidencefor a positive correlation between the column density of hi (nhi) and theminimum observed velocity width of absorbers (bmin). with minimalinterpretation, this implies that the temperature-density relation in the igmis not "inverted", contrary to many recent studies. fitting bmin as a functionof nhi results in line width - column density dependence of the form bdmin =b_0 [nhi/n_(hi,0)]^(gamma-1) with a minimum line width at mean density rhobar[n_(hi, 0) = 10^13.6 cm^-2] of b_0 = 17.9 +- 0.2 km/s and a power-law index of(gamma-1) = 0.15 +- 0.02. using analytic arguments, these measurements imply an"equation of state" for the igm at &lt;z&gt;= 2.4 of the form t = t_0(rho/rhobar)^(gamma-1) with a temperature at mean density of t_0 = (1.94 +-0.05) x 10^4 k and a power-law index (gamma -1) = 0.46 +- 0.05.

1211.2805	the explosion energy of early stellar populations: the fe-peak element  ratios in low metallicity damped lyman-alpha systems	the relative abundances of the fe-peak elements (ti-zn) at the lowestmetallicities are intimately linked to the physics of core-collapse supernovaexplosions. with a sample of 25 very metal-poor damped lyman-alpha systems, weinvestigate the trends of the fe-peak element ratios with metallicity. for nineof the 25 dlas, a direct measurement (or useful upper limit) of one or more ofthe ti,cr,co,ni,zn/fe abundance ratios could be determined from detectedabsorption lines. for the remaining systems (without detections), we devised anew form of spectral stacking to estimate the typical fe-peak element ratios ofthe dla population in this metallicity regime. we compare these data toanalogous measurements in metal-poor stars of the galactic halo and to detailedcalculations of explosive nucleosynthesis in metal-free stars. we conclude thatmost of the dlas in our sample were enriched by stars that released an energyof &lt; 1.2 x 10^51 erg when they exploded as core-collapse supernovae. finally,we discuss the exciting prospect of measuring fe-peak element ratios in dampedlyman-alpha systems with fe/h &lt; 1/1000 of solar when 30-m class telescopesbecome available. only then will we be able to pin down the energy that wasreleased by the supernovae of the first stars.

0712.1829	c, n, o abundances in the most metal-poor damped lyman alpha systems	this study focuses on some of the most metal-poor damped lyman alphaabsorbers known in the spectra of high redshift qsos, using new and archivalobservations obtained with uv-sensitive echelle spectrographs on the keck andvlt telescopes. the weakness and simple velocity structure of the absorptionlines in these systems allows us to measure the abundances of several elements,and in particular those of c, n, and o, a group that is difficult to study indlas of more typical metallicities. we find that when the oxygen abundance isless than about 1/100 of solar, the c/o ratio in high redshift dlas andsub-dlas matches that of halo stars of similar metallicity and shows highervalues than expected from galactic chemical evolution models based onconventional stellar yields. furthermore, there are indications that at theselow metallicities the n/o ratio may also be above simple expectations and mayexhibit a minimum value, as proposed by centurion and her collaborators in2003. both results can be interpreted as evidence for enhanced production of cand n by massive stars in the first few episodes of star formation, in ourgalaxy and in the distant proto-galaxies seen as qso absorbers. the higherstellar yields implied may have an origin in stellar rotation which promotesmixing in the stars' interiors, as considered in some recent modelcalculations. we briefly discuss the relevance of these results to currentideas on the origin of metals in the intergalactic medium and the universalityof the stellar initial mass function.

1301.3424	a search for hi 21cm absorption towards a radio-selected quasar sample  ii: a new low spin temperature dla at high redshift	we report results from a deep search for redshifted hi 21cm absorption fromeight damped lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (dlas) detected in our earlier opticalsurvey for dlas towards radio-loud quasars. hi 21cm absorption was detectedfrom the $z = 2.192$ dla towards txs2039+187, only the sixth case of such adetection at $z &gt; 2$, while upper limits on the hi 21cm optical depth wereobtained in six other dlas at $z &gt; 2$. our detection of hi 21cm absorption inthe eighth system, at $z = 2.289$ towards txs0311+430, has been reportedearlier. we also present high spatial resolution images of the backgroundquasars at frequencies close to the redshifted hi 21cm line frequency, allowingus to estimate the covering factor of each dla, and then determine its spintemperature $t_s$. for three non-detections of hi 21cm absorption, we obtainstrong lower limits on the spin temperature, $t_s \gtrsim 790$ k, similar tothe bulk of the high-$z$ dla population; three other dlas yield weak lowerlimits, $t_s &gt; 140-400$ k. however, for the two dlas with detections of hi 21cmabsorption, the derived spin temperatures are both low $t_s = (160 \pm 35)\times (f/0.35)$ k for the $z = 2.192$ dla towards txs2039+187 and $t_s = (72\pm 18) \times (f/0.52)$ k for the $z = 2.289$ dla towards txs0311+430. theseare the first two dlas at $z &gt; 1$ with $t_s$ values comparable to thoseobtained in local spiral galaxies. based on the observed correlations betweenspin temperature and metallicity and velocity spread and metallicity in dlas,we suggest that the hosts of the two absorbers are likely to be massive,high-metallicity galaxies.

1304.4231	comprehensive study of a z = 2.35 dla galaxy: mass, metallicity, age,  morphology and sfr from hst and vlt	we present a detailed study of the emission from a z = 2.35 galaxy thatcauses damped lyman-alpha absorption in the spectrum of the background qso,sdss j 2222-0946. we present the results of extensive analyses of the stellarcontinuum covering the rest frame optical-uv regime based on broad-band hstimaging, and of spectroscopy from vlt/x-shooter of the strong emission lines:ly-alpha, [oii], [oiii], [nii], h-alpha and h-beta. we compare the metallicityfrom the absorption lines in the qso spectrum with the oxygen abundanceinferred from the strong-line methods (r23 and n2). the two emission-linemethods yield consistent results: [o/h] = -0.30+/-0.13. based on the absorptionlines in the qso spectrum a metallicity of -0.49+/-0.05 is inferred at animpact parameter of 6.3 kpc from the centre of the galaxy with a column densityof hydrogen of log(n_hi)=20.65+/-0.05. the star formation rates of the galaxyfrom the uv continuum and h-alpha line can be reconciled assuming an amount ofreddening of e(b-v) = 0.06+/-0.01, giving an inferred sfr of 13+/-1 m_sun / yr(assuming a chabrier imf). from the hst imaging, the galaxy associated with theabsorption is found to be a compact (re=1.12 kpc) object with a disc-like,elongated (axis ratio 0.17) structure indicating that the galaxy is seen closeto edge on. moreover, the absorbing gas is located almost perpendicularly abovethe disc of the galaxy suggesting that the gas causing the absorption is notco-rotating with the disc. we investigate the stellar and dynamical masses fromsed-fitting and emission-line widths, respectively, and find consistent resultsof 2x10^9 m_sun. we suggest that the galaxy is a young proto-disc with evidencefor a galactic outflow of enriched gas. this galaxy hints at how star-forminggalaxies may be linked to the elusive population of damped lyman-alphaabsorbers.

(2012), wefind that there are fractionally more high-nhi absorbers than low-nhi absorbersin the cgm compared to the igm, leading to a shallower power law fit to the cgmfrequency distribution. we use these new measurements to calculate the totalopacity of the igm and cgm to hydrogen-ionizing photons, finding significantlyhigher opacity than most previous studies, especially from absorbers withlog(nhi) &lt; 17.2. reproducing the opacity measured in our data as well as theincidence of absorbers with log(nhi) &gt; 17.2 requires a broken power lawparameterization of the frequency distribution with a break near log(nhi) ~ 15.we compute new estimates of the mean free path (mfp) to hydrogen-ionizingphotons at z=2.4, finding mfp = 147 +- 15 mpc when considering only igmopacity. if instead, we consider photons emanating from a high-z star-forminggalaxy and account for the local excess opacity due to the surrounding cgm ofthe galaxy itself, the mean free path is reduced to mfp = 121 +- 15 mpc. thesemfp measurements are smaller than recent estimates and should inform futurestudies of the metagalactic uv background and of ionizing sources at z~2-3.

0801.1678	new insights into the stellar content and physical conditions of  star-forming galaxies at z = 2-3 from spectral modelling	we have used extensive libraries of model and empirical galaxy spectra(assembled respectively from the population synthesis code of bruzual andcharlot and the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey) tointerpret some puzzling features seen in the spectra of high redshiftstar-forming galaxies. we show that a stellar he ii 1640 emission line,produced in the expanding atmospheres of of and wolf-rayet stars, should bedetectable with an equivalent width of 0.5-1.5aa in the integrated spectra ofstar-forming galaxies, provided the metallicity is greater than about halfsolar. our models reproduce the strength of the he ii 1640 line measured in thespectra of lyman break galaxies for established values of their metallicities.with better empirical calibrations in local galaxies, this spectral feature hasthe potential of becoming a useful diagnostic of massive star winds at high, aswell as low, redshifts.  we also uncover a relationship in sdss galaxies between their location in the[o iii]/hb vs. [n ii]/ha diagnostic diagram (the bpt diagram) and their excessspecific star formation rate relative to galaxies of similar mass. we inferthat an elevated ionisation parameter u is at the root of this effect, andpropose that this is also the cause of the offset of high redshift star-forminggalaxies in the bpt diagram compared to local ones. we further speculate thathigher electron densities and escape fractions of hydrogen ionising photons maybe the factors responsible for the systematically higher values of u in the hii regions of high redshift galaxies. the impact of such differences onabundance determinations from strong nebular lines are considered and found tobe relatively minor.

1308.3240	precision measures of the primordial abundance of deuterium	we report the discovery of deuterium absorption in the very metal-poor([fe/h] = -2.88) damped lyman-alpha system at z_abs = 3.06726 toward the qsosdss j1358+6522. on the basis of 13 resolved d i absorption lines and thedamping wings of the h i lyman alpha transition, we have obtained a new,precise measure of the primordial abundance of deuterium. furthermore, tobolster the present statistics of precision d/h measures, we have reanalyzedall of the known deuterium absorption-line systems that satisfy a set of strictcriteria. we have adopted a blind analysis strategy (to remove human bias), anddeveloped a software package that is specifically designed for precision d/habundance measurements. for this reanalyzed sample of systems, we obtain aweighted mean of (d/h)_p = (2.53 +/- 0.04) x 10^-5, corresponding to auniversal baryon density100 omega_b h^2 = 2.202 +/- 0.046 for the standardmodel of big bang nucleosynthesis. by combining our measure of (d/h)_p withobservations of the cosmic microwave background, we derive the effective numberof light fermion species, n_eff = 3.28 +/- 0.28. we therefore rule out theexistence of an additional (sterile) neutrino (i.e. n_eff = 4.046) at 99.3percent confidence (2.7 sigma), provided that n_eff and the baryon-to-photonratio (eta_10) did not change between bbn and recombination. we also place astrong bound on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, xi_d = +0.05 +/- 0.13 basedonly on the cmb+(d/h)_p observations. combining xi_d with the current bestliterature measure of y_p, we find |xi| &lt;= +0.062. in future, improvedmeasurements of several key reaction rates, in particular d(p,gamma)3he, andfurther measures of (d/h)_p with a precision comparable to those consideredhere, should allow even more stringent limits to be placed on new physicsbeyond the standard model.

1406.7003	the most metal-poor damped lyman alpha systems: an insight into dwarf  galaxies at high redshift	in this paper we analyze the kinematics, chemistry, and physical propertiesof a sample of the most metal-poor damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas), touncover their links to modern-day galaxies. we present evidence that the dlapopulation as a whole exhibits a `knee' in the relative abundances of thealpha-capture and fe-peak elements when the metallicity is [fe/h] ~ -2.0,assuming that zn traces the build-up of fe-peak elements. in this respect, thechemical evolution of dlas is clearly different from that experienced by milkyway halo stars, but resembles that of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the localgroup. we also find a close correspondence between the kinematics of localgroup dwarf galaxies and of high redshift metal-poor dlas, which furtherstrengthens this connection. on the basis of such similarities, we propose thatthe most metal-poor dlas provide us with a unique opportunity to directly studythe dwarf galaxy population more than ten billion years in the past, at a timewhen many dwarf galaxies were forming the bulk of their stars. to this end, wehave measured some of the key physical properties of the dla gas, includingtheir neutral gas mass, size, kinetic temperature, density, and turbulence. wefind that metal-poor dlas contain a warm neutral medium with t_gas ~ 9600 kpredominantly held up by thermal pressure. furthermore, all of the dlas in oursample exhibit a subsonic turbulent mach number, implying that the gasdistribution is largely smooth. these results are among the first empiricaldescriptions of the environments where the first few generations of stars mayhave formed in the universe.

1407.4850	evidence of patchy hydrogen reionization from an extreme ly$\alpha$  trough below redshift six	we report the discovery of an extremely long ($\sim$110 mpc/$h$) and dark($\tau_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 7$) ly$\alpha$ trough extending down to $z \simeq 5.5$towards the $z_{\rm em} \simeq 6.0$ quasar ulas j0148+0600. we use these newdata in combination with ly$\alpha$ forest measurements from 42 quasars at $4.5\le z_{\rm em} \le 6.4$ to conduct an updated analysis of the line-of-sightvariance in the intergalactic ly$\alpha$ opacity over $4 \le z \le 6$. we findthat the scatter in transmission among lines of sight near $z \sim 6$significantly exceeds theoretical expectations for either a uniform ultravioletbackground (uvb) or simple fluctuating uvb models in which the mean free pathto ionizing photons is spatially invariant. the data, particularly near $z\simeq 5.6$-5.8, instead require fluctuations in the volume-weighted hydrogenneutral fraction that are a factor of 3 or more beyond those expected fromdensity variations alone. we argue that these fluctuations are most likelydriven by large-scale variations in the mean free path, consistent withexpectations for the final stages of inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization. evenby $z \simeq 5.6$, however, a large fraction of the data are consistent with auniform uvb, and by $z \sim 5$ the data are fully consistent with opacityfluctuations arising solely from the density field. this suggests that whilereionization may be ongoing at $z \sim 6$, it has fully completed by $z \sim5$.

1408.3638	the ly-alpha properties of faint galaxies at z2-3 with systemic  redshifts and velocity dispersions from keck-mosfire	we study the lya profiles of 36 spectroscopically-detected lya-emitters(laes) at z2-3, using keck mosfire to measure systemic redshifts and velocitydispersions from rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. the sample has amedian optical magnitude r=26.0, and ranges from r23 to r&gt;27, corresponding torest-frame uv absolute magnitudes m_uv-22 to m_uv&gt;-18.2. dynamical masses rangefrom m_dyn&lt;1.3e8 msun to m_dyn=6.8e9 msun, with a median value of m_dyn=6.3e8msun. thirty of the 36 lya emission lines are redshifted with respect to thesystemic velocity with at least 1 sigma significance, and the velocity offsetwith respect to systemic dv_lya is correlated with r-band magnitude, m_uv, andthe velocity dispersion measured from nebular emission lines with &gt;3 sigmasignificance: brighter galaxies with larger velocity dispersions tend to havelarger values of dv_lya. we also make use of a comparison sample of 122uv-color-selected r&lt;25.5 galaxies at z2, all with lya emission and systemicredshifts measured from nebular emission lines. using the combined lae andcomparison samples for a total of 158 individual galaxies, we find that dv_lyais anti-correlated with the lya equivalent width with 7 sigma significance. ourresults are consistent with a scenario in which the lya profile is determinedprimarily by the properties of the gas near the systemic redshift; in such ascenario, the opacity to lya photons in lower mass galaxies may be reduced iflarge gaseous disks have not yet developed and if the gas is ionized by theharder spectrum of young, low metallicity stars.

1411.7371	uncovering blue diffuse dwarf galaxies	extremely metal poor (xmp) galaxies are known to be very rare, despite thelarge numbers of low-mass galaxies predicted by the local galaxy luminosityfunction. this paper presents a sub-sample of galaxies that were selected via amorphology-based search on sdss images with the aim of finding these elusivexmp galaxies. by using the recently discovered extremely metal-poor galaxy, leop, as a guide, we obtained a collection of faint, blue systems, each withisolated hii regions embedded in a diffuse continuum, that have remainedoptically undetected until now. here we show the first results from opticalspectroscopic follow-up observations of 12 of ~100 of these blue, diffuse dwarf(bdd) galaxies yielded by our search algorithm. oxygen abundances were obtainedvia the direct method for eight galaxies, and found to be in the range7.45&lt;12+log(o/h)&lt;8.0, with two galaxies being classified as xmps. all bdds werefound to currently have a young star-forming population (&lt;10 myr) andrelatively high ionisation parameters of their hii regions. despite their lowluminosities (-11&lt; m_b &lt; -18) and low surface brightnesses (~23-25 magarcsec^-2), the galaxies were found to be actively star-forming, with currentstar-formation rates between 0.0003 and 0.078 msol/yr. from our currentsubsample, bdd galaxies appear to be a population of non-quiescent dwarfirregular (dirr) galaxies, or the diffuse counterparts to blue compact galaxies(bcds) and as such may bridge the gap between these two populations. our searchalgorithm demonstrates that morphology-based searches are successful inuncovering more diffuse metal-poor star-forming galaxies, which traditionalemission-line based searches overlook.

1411.7956	the first carbon-enhanced metal-poor star found in the sculptor dwarf  spheroidal	the origin of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars and their possibleconnection with the chemical elements produced by the first stellar generationis still highly debated. in contrast to the galactic halo, not many cemp starshave been found in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the milky way. here wepresent detailed abundances from eso vlt/uves high-resolution spectroscopy foret0097, the first cemp star found in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal. this starhas $\text{[fe/h]}=-2.03\pm0.10$, $\text{[c/fe]}=0.51\pm0.10$ and$\text{[n/fe]}=1.18\pm0.20$. the traditional definition of cemp stars is$\text{[c/fe]}\geq0.70$, but taking into account that this luminous red giantbranch star has undergone mixing, it was intrinsically less nitrogen enhancedand more carbon-rich when it was formed, and so it falls under the definitionof cemp stars, as proposed by aoki et al. (2007) to account for this effect. bymaking corrections for this mixing, we conclude that the star had$\text{[c/fe]}\approx0.8$ during its earlier evolutionary stages. apart fromthe enhanced c and n abundances, et0097 shows no peculiarities in otherelements lighter than zn, and no enhancement of the heavier neutron-captureelements (ba, la, ce, nd, sm, eu, dy), making this a cemp-no star. however, thestar does show signs of the weak $r$-process, with an overabundance of thelighter neutron-capture elements (sr, y, zr). to explain the abundance patternobserved in et0097, we explore the possibility that this star was enriched byprimordial stars. in addition to the detailed abundances for et0097, we presentestimates and upper limits for c abundances in 85 other stars in sculptorderived from cn molecular lines, including 11 stars with $\text{[fe/h]}\leq-2$.combining these limits with observations from the literature, the fraction ofcemp-no stars in sculptor seems to be significantly lower than in the galactichalo.

0804.4474	damped lyman alpha systems in galaxy formation simulations	we investigate the population of z=3 damped lyman alpha absorbers (dlas) in arecent series of high resolution galaxy formation simulations. the simulationsare of interest because they form at z=0 some of the most realistic diskgalaxies to date. no free parameters are available in our study: these havebeen fixed by physical and z=0 observational constraints, and thus our studyprovides a genuine consistency test. the precise role of dlas in galaxyformation remains in debate, but they provide a number of strong constraints onthe nature of our simulated bound systems at z=3 because of their coupledinformation on neutral h i densities, kinematics, metallicity and estimates ofstar formation activity.  our results, without any parameter-tuning, closely match the observedincidence rate and column density distributions of dlas. our simulations arethe first to reproduce the distribution of metallicities (with a median ofz_{dla} = z_{solar}/20) without invoking observationally unsupported mechanismssuch as dust biasing. this is especially encouraging given that thesesimulations have previously been shown to have a realistic 0&lt;z&lt;2 stellarmass-metallicity relation. additionally, we see a strong positive correlationbetween sightline metallicity and low-ion velocity width, the normalization andslope of which comes close to matching recent observational results. however,we somewhat underestimate the number of observed high velocity width systems;the severity of this disagreement is comparable to other recent dla focusedstudies. by z=0 the majority of the z=3 neutral gas forming the dlas has beenconverted into stars, in agreement with rough physical expectations.

1505.03155	sulphur in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy - including nlte  corrections	in galactic halo stars, sulphur has been shown to behave like other$\alpha$-elements, but until now, no comprehensive studies have been done onthis element in stars of other galaxies. here, we use high-resolution esovlt/flames/giraffe spectra to determine sulphur abundances for 85 stars in thesculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, covering the metallicity range $-2.5\leq\text{[fe/h]} \leq-0.8$. the abundances are derived from the s~i triplet at9213, 9228, and 9238~\aa. these lines have been shown to be sensitive todeparture from local thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e. nlte effects. therefore,we present new nlte corrections for a grid of stellar parameters covering thoseof the target stars. the nlte-corrected sulphur abundances in sculptor show thesame behaviour as other $\alpha$-elements in that galaxy (such as mg, si, andca). at lower metallicities ($\text{[fe/h]}\lesssim-2$) the abundances areconsistent with a plateau at $\text{[s/fe]}\approx+0.16$, similar to what isobserved in the galactic halo, $\text{[s/fe]}\approx+0.2$. with increasing[fe/h], the [s/fe] ratio declines, reaching negative values at$\text{[fe/h]}\gtrsim-1.5$. the sample also shows an increase in [s/mg] with[fe/h], most probably because of enrichment from type ia supernovae.

0805.2940	a search for damped lyman-alpha systems towards radio-loud quasars i:  the optical survey	we present the results from the optical component of a survey for dampedlyman-alpha systems (dlas) towards radio-loud quasars. our quasar sample isdrawn from the texas radio survey with the following primary selectioncriteria: z_em &gt; 2.4, optical magnitudes b &lt; 22 and 365 mhz flux density s_365&gt; 400 mjy. we obtained spectra for a sample of 45 qsos with the williamherschel telescope, very large telescope and gemini-north, resulting in asurvey redshift path delta z = 38.79. we detect nine dlas and one sub-dla witha mean absorption redshift &lt;z&gt; = 2.44. the dla number density is n(z) =0.23^{+0.11}_{-0.07}, in good agreement with the value derived for dlasdetected in the sloan digital sky survey at this redshift. the dla numberdensity of our sample is also in good agreement with optically-completeradio-selected samples, supporting previous claims that n(z) is notsignificantly affected by dust obscuration bias. we present n(hi) columndensity determinations and metal line equivalent width measurements for all ourdlas. the low frequency flux density selection criterion used for the quasarsample implies that all absorbers will be suitable for follow-up absorptionspectroscopy in the redshifted hi 21 cm line. a following paper (kanekar etal.) will present hi 21 cm absorption studies of, and spin temperaturedeterminations for, our dla sample.

1510.03867	the primordial abundance of deuterium: ionization correction	we determine the relative ionization of deuterium and hydrogen in lowmetallicity damped lyman-alpha (dla) and sub-dla systems using a detailed suiteof photoionization simulations. we model metal-poor dlas as clouds of gas inpressure equilibrium with a host dark matter halo, exposed to the haardt &amp;madau (2012) background radiation of galaxies and quasars at redshift z~3. ourresults indicate that the deuterium ionization correction correlates with the hi column density and the ratio of successive ion stages of the most commonlyobserved metals. the n(n ii) / n(n i) column density ratio provides the mostreliable correction factor, being essentially independent of the gas geometry,h i column density, and the radiation field. we provide a series of convenientfitting formulae to calculate the deuterium ionization correction based onobservable quantities. the ionization correction typically does not exceed 0.1per cent for metal-poor dlas, which is comfortably below the currentmeasurement precision (2 per cent). however, the deuterium ionizationcorrection may need to be applied when a larger sample of d/h measurementsbecomes available.

astro-ph;0001089	constraints on cosmological parameters from the lyman-alpha forest power  spectrum and cobe-dmr	we combine cobe-dmr measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropywith a recent measurement of the mass power spectrum at redshift z=2.5 from lyaforest data to derive constraints on cosmological parameters and test theinflation+cdm scenario of structure formation. by treating the inflationaryspectral index n as a free parameter, we can find successful fits to the cobeand lya forest constraints in omega_m=1 models with and without massiveneutrinos and in low-omega_m models with and without a cosmological constant.within each class of model, the combination of cobe and the lya forest p(k)constrains a parameter combination of the form (omega_m h^a n^b omega_b^c),with different indices for each case. this new constraint breaks some of thedegeneracies in cosmological parameter determinations from other measurements.the lya forest p(k) provides the first measurement of the slope of the linearmass power spectrum on ~mpc scales, and it confirms a basic prediction of theinflationary cdm scenario: a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primevalfluctuations (n~1) that bends towards k^{n-4} on small scales. consideringadditional observational data, we find that cobe-normalized, omega_m=1 modelsthat match the lya forest p(k) do not match the observed masses of rich galaxyclusters and that a low-omega_m model with a cosmological constant provides thebest overall fit, even without the direct evidence for cosmic acceleration fromsupernovae. modest improvements in the lya forest p(k) measurement couldgreatly restrict the allowable region of parameter space for cdm models,constrain the contribution of tensor fluctuations to cmb anisotropy, andachieve a more stringent test of the current consensus model of structureformation.

astro-ph;0004349	mixing metals in the early universe	we investigate the evolution of the metallicity of the intergalactic medium(igm) with particular emphasis on its spatial distribution. we propose thatmetal enrichment occurs as a two step process. first, supernova (sn) explosionseject metals into relatively small regions confined to the surroundings ofstar-forming galaxies. from a comprehensive treatment of blowout we show thatsnae by themselves fail by more than one order of magnitude to distribute theproducts of stellar nucleosynthesis over volumes large enough to pollute thewhole igm to the metallicity levels observed. thus, a additional (but as yetunknown) physical mechanism must be invoked to mix the metals on scalescomparable to the mean distance between the galaxies which are most efficientpollutants. from this simple hypothesis we derive a number of testablepredictions for the evolution of the igm metallicity. specifically, we findthat: (i) the fraction of metals ejected over the star formation history of theuniverse is about 50% at z=0; that is, approximately half of the metals todayare found in the igm; (ii) if the ejected metals were homogeneously mixed withthe baryons in the universe, the average igm metallicity would be &lt;z&gt; ~ 1/25z(solar) at z=3. however, due to spatial inhomogeneities, the mean of thedistribution of metallicities in the diffusive zones has a wide (more than 2orders of magnitude) spread around this value; (iii) if metals become moreuniformly distributed at z &lt; 1, as assumed, at z = 0 the metallicity of the igmis narrowly confined within the range z ~ 0.1 +/- 0.03 z(solar). finally, wepoint out that our results can account for the observed metal content of theintracluster medium.

astro-ph;0005448	the enrichment history of the intergalactic medium: measuring the civ/hi  ratio in the lyman alpha forest	we have obtained an exceptionally high s/n, high resolution spectrum of thegravitationally lensed quasar q1422+231 in order to investigate the metalenrichment of the igm. a column density distribution function (cddf) isdetermined for civ, which is well fit by a power law with index 1.44 +/- 0.05.once a correction for incompleteness is applied, we find that the cddf isconsistent with a power law down to log n(civ) = 11.75, a factor of 10 moresensitive than previously determined. in order to determine whether the civenrichment extends to even lower column density hi clouds, we find that ananalysis of individual pixel optical depths is more robust than the stackingtechnique. the results obtained from this optical depth method are comparedwith analyses of simulated spectra enriched with varying civ enrichmentrecipes. from these simulations, we conclude that more civ than is currentlydirectly detected in q1422+231 is required to reproduce the optical depthsdetermined from the data, consistent with the conclusions drawn fromconsideration of the power law distribution.

astro-ph;0104474	a new measurement of the primordial abundance of deuterium: toward  convergence with the baryon density from the cmb?	from the analysis of the near-uv spectrum of the qso 2206-199, obtained witha long series of exposures with stis on the hst, we deduce a value (d/h) =(1.65 +/- 0.35) x 10(-5) (1 sigma error) for the abundance of deuterium in thez(abs) = 2.0762 damped lyman alpha system (dla) along this sight-line. thevelocity structure of this absorber is very simple and its neutral hydrogencolumn density, n(h i), is accurately known; the error in d/h is mostly due tothe limited signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum. since this is also one ofthe most metal-poor dlas, with metal abundances of about 1/200 of solar, thecorrection due to astration of d is expected to be insignificant and the valuewe deduce should be essentially the primordial abundance of deuterium. when all(six) available measurements of d/h in high redshift qso absorbers areconsidered, we find that the three dlas---where n(h i) is measured mostreliably---give consistently lower values than the three lyman limit systems.we point out that the weighted mean of the dla measurements, d/h = (2.2 +/-0.2) x 10(-5), yields a baryon density omega_b h^2 = 0.025 +/- 0.001 which iswithin 1 sigma of the value deduced from the analysis of the cmb angular powerspectrum, and is still consistent with the present-day d/h and models ofgalactic chemical evolution. future observations of d i absorption in otherdlas are needed to establish whether our finding reflects a real advantage ofdlas over other classes of qso absorbers for the measurement of d, or is just astatistical fluctuation.

astro-ph;0109205	the corals survey i: new estimates of the number density and gas content  of damped lyman alpha systems free from dust bias	(abridged) we present the first results from the complete optical and radioabsorption line system (corals) survey. we have compiled a homogeneous sampleof radio-selected qsos from the parkes catalogue and searched for damped lymanalpha systems (dlas) towards every target, irrespective of its opticalmagnitude. this approach circumvents selection effects -- particularly fromintervening dust -- which have long been suspected to affect dla surveys inoptically-selected, magnitude-limited qso samples. the corals data set consistsof 66 z_em &gt; 2.2 qsos in which 22 dlas with absorption redshifts 1.8 &lt; z_abs &lt;z_em have been identified over a total redshift interval delta z = 55.46. inthis first paper of the corals series we describe the sample, presentintermediate resolution spectroscopy and determine the population statistics ofdlas. we deduce a value of the neutral gas mass density traced by dlas(expressed as a fraction of the closure density) log omega_dla h =-2.59^{+0.17}_{-0.24}, and a number density of dlas per unit redshift n(z) =0.31^{+0.09}_{-0.08}, both at a mean redshift &lt;z&gt; = 2.37. taking into accountthe errors, we conclude that dust-induced bias in previous surveys may have ledto an underestimate of these quantities by at most a factor of two and we havenot uncovered a previously unrecognised population of high column density dlasin front of faint qsos.

astro-ph;0110637	new observations of the interstellar medium in the lyman break galaxy ms  1512-cb58	we present the results of a detailed study of the interstellar medium of ms1512-cb58, an l* lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276, based on new spectralobservations obtained with the echelle spectrograph and imager on the keck iitelescope at 58 km/s resolution. we focus in particular on the chemicalabundances and kinematics of the interstellar gas and our main findings are asfollows. even at this relatively early epoch, the ism of this galaxy is alreadyhighly enriched in elements released by type ii supernovae; the abundances ofo, mg, si, p, and s are all about 2/5 of their solar values. in contrast, n andthe fe-peak elements mn, fe, and ni are underabundant by a factor of about 3.based on current ideas of stellar nucleosynthesis, these results can beunderstood if most of the metal enrichment in cb58 has taken place within thelast 300 million years, the timescale for the release of n from intermediatemass stars. cb58 appears to be an example of a galaxy in the process ofconverting its gas into stars on a few dynamical timescales; quite possibly weare witnessing the formation of a galactic bulge or an elliptical galaxy. theenergetic star formation activity has stirred the interstellar medium to highvelocities of up to 1000 km/s. the net effect is a bulk outflow of the ism at aspeed of 255 km/s and at a rate which exceeds the star formation rate. it isunclear whether this gas will be lost or retained by the galaxy. we point outthat the chemical and kinematic properties of cb58 are markedly different fromthose of most damped lyman alpha systems at the same redshift.

astro-ph;0112135	the corals survey ii: clues to galaxy clustering around qsos from z_abs  ~ z_em damped lyman alpha systems	we present a list of z_abs ~ z_em (delta v &lt; 3000 km/s) dlas discoveredduring the corals survey for absorbers in a radio-selected qso sample. on theassumption that z_abs ~ z_em dlas are neither ejecta from the qso, nor part ofthe host galaxy itself, we use the number density statistics of these dlas toinvestigate galaxy clustering near the qso redshift. we find that n(z) of z_abs\~z_em dlas in our radio-selected qso sample is ~4 times larger than the numberdensity of intervening dlas, implying an excess of galaxies near the qso. thisresult is further supported with the inclusion of the radio-loud qsos in thefirst survey, although the total number of dlas is still small (4) and theresult is currently only significant at approximately the 2 sigma level. sinceall of the z_abs ~ z_em dlas we identify in corals are found towards opticallybright (b &lt; 20) qsos, there is no strong evidence (based on these limitedstatistics) that this population suffers from a severe dust bias. we compareour results with those from an optically-selected, radio-quiet qso sample inorder to determine whether there is evidence for an excess of galaxies aroundradio-loud versus radio-quiet qsos. we find that the n(z) of z_abs ~ z_em dlastowards radio-quiet qsos is in agreement with the number density of interveningabsorbers. this result, although currently limited by the small numberstatistics of our survey, supports the conclusion that radio-loud quasars arefound preferentially in rich galaxy environments at high redshift. finally, wereport that one of the new z_abs ~ z_em dlas discovered by corals has someresidual flux in the base of the lya trough which may be due to lya emission,either from star formation in the dla galaxy or from gas photoionised by theqso.

astro-ph;0205472	the abundances of nitrogen and oxygen in damped lyman alpha systems	we take a fresh look at the abundance of nitrogen in dlas with oxygenabundances between 1/10 and 1/100 of solar. this is a metallicity regime poorlysampled in the local universe and where qso absorbers may hold clues to boththe nucleosynthetic origin of n and the chemical evolution of high redshiftgalaxies. we combine new vlt uves observations with others from the literatureto form a sample of 10 dlas in which the abundances of n and of one of the twoalpha-capture elements o or s have been measured. we confirm earlier reportsthat the (n/o) ratio exhibits a larger range of values than other ratios ofheavy elements in dlas; however, all 10 dlas fall in the region of the (n/o)vs. (o/h) plot delimited by the primary and secondary levels of nitrogenproduction. our results provide empirical evidence in support of the proposalthat intermediate mass stars (with masses less than 7 solar masses) are themain source of primary nitrogen, so that its release into the ism lags behindthat of oxygen, which is produced by type ii snae. a high proportion (40%) ofthe dlas in our sample have apparently not yet attained the full primary levelof n enrichment; this finding may be an indication that the metallicity regimewe are studying preferentially picks out galaxies which have only recentlycondensed out of the igm and begun forming stars. alternatively, the delay inthe release of n following an episode of star formation may increase withdecreasing metallicity, if stars of progressively lower masses than 4 solarmasses can synthesize n in their hotter interiors.

astro-ph;0208003	lyman-alpha absorption around nearby galaxies	we have used stis aboard hst to search for lyman-alpha (lya) absorption linesin the outer regions of eight nearby galaxies using background qsos and agn asprobes. lya lines are detected within a few hundred km/s of the systemicvelocity of the galaxy in all cases. we conclude that a backgroundline-of-sight which passes within 26-200 h-1 kpc of a foreground galaxy islikely to intercept low column density neutral hydrogen with log n(hi) &gt;~ 13.0.the ubiquity of detections implies a covering factor of ~ 100% for low n(hi)gas around galaxies within 200 h-1 kpc. we discuss the difficulty in trying toassociate individual absorption components with the selected galaxies and theirneighbors, but show that by degrading our stis data to lower resolutions, weare able to reproduce the anti-correlation of lya equivalent width and impactparameter found at higher redshift. we also show that the equivalent width andcolumn density of lya complexes (when individual components are summed over ~1000 km/s) correlate well with a simple estimate of the volume density ofgalaxies brighter than m(b) = -17.5 at the same redshift as a lya complex. wedo not reject the hypothesis that the selected galaxies are directlyresponsible for the observed lya lines, but our analysis indicates thatabsorption by clumpy intragroup gas is an equally likely explanation.

0808.2470	measurements of caii absorption, metals, and dust in a sample of z~1  dlas and subdlas	we present observations of caii, znii, and crii absorption lines in 16 dlasand 6 subdlas at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.3, obtained for the dual purposes of: (i)clarifying the relationship between dlas and absorbers selected via strong caiilines, and (ii) increasing the still limited sample of zn and cr abundances inthis redshift range. we find only partial overlap between current samples ofintermediate-z dlas (which are drawn from magnitude limited surveys) and strongcaii absorbers: approximately 25% of known dlas at these redshifts have anassociated caii 3935 line with rew&gt;0.35a, the threshold of the sdss sampleassembled by wild and her collaborators. the lack of the strongest systems(with rew&gt;0.5a) is consistent with these authors' conclusion that suchabsorbers are often missed in current dla surveys because they redden/dim thelight of the background qsos. we rule out the suggestion that strong caiiabsorption is associated exclusively with the highest-n(hi) dlas. furthermore,we find no correlation between the strength of the caii lines and either themetallicity or depletion, although the strongest caii absorber in our sample isalso the most metal-rich dla yet discovered, with [zn/h] ~ solar. we concludethat a complex mix of parameters determine the strengths of the caii lines,including the density of particles and uv photons in the ism of the galaxieshosting the dlas. we find tentative evidence (given the small size of oursample) that strong caii systems may preferentially sample regions of high gasdensity, perhaps akin to the dlas exhibiting molecular hydrogen absorption atredshifts z&gt;2. if this connection is confirmed, strong caii absorbers wouldtrace possibly metal-rich, h2-bearing columns of cool, dense gas at distancesup to tens of kpc from normal galaxies.

astro-ph;0301287	the effects of rotation on wolf--rayet stars and on the production of  primary nitrogen by intermediate mass stars	we use the rotating stellar models described in the paper by a. maeder &amp; g.meynet in this volume to consider the effects of rotation on the evolution ofthe most massive stars into and during the wolf--rayet phase, and on thepost-main sequence evolution of intermediate mass stars. the two main resultsof this discussion are the following. first, we show that rotating models areable to account for the observed properties of the wolf--rayet stellarpopulations at solar metallicity. second, at low metallicities, the inclusionof stellar rotation in the calculation of chemical yields can lead to a longertime delay between the release of oxygen and nitrogen into the interstellarmedium following an episode of star formation, since stars of lower masses(compared to non-rotating models) can synthesize primary n. qualitatively, suchan effect may be required to explain the relative abundances of n and o inextragalactic metal--poor environments, particularly at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0303272	element abundances through the cosmic ages	the horizon for studies of element abundances has expanded dramatically inthe last ten years. once the domain of astronomers concerned chiefly with starsand nearby galaxies, this field has now become a key component of observationalcosmology, as technological advances have made it possible to measure theabundances of several chemical elements in a variety of environments atredshifts up to z = 4, when the universe was in its infancy. in this series oflectures i summarise current knowledge on the chemical make-up of distantgalaxies observed directly in their starlight, and of interstellar andintergalactic gas seen in absorption against the spectra of bright backgroundsources. the picture which is emerging is one where the universe at z = 3already included many of the constituents of today's galaxies-even at theseearly times we see evidence for population i and ii stars, while the `smokinggun' for population iii objects may be hidden in the chemical composition ofthe lowest density regions of the intergalactic medium, yet to be deciphered.

astro-ph;0303392	h-alpha spectroscopy of galaxies at z&gt;2: kinematics and star formation	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of h-alpha emission lines in a sampleof 16 star-forming galaxies at redshifts 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.6. our targets are drawn froma large sample of galaxies photometrically selected and spectroscopicallyconfirmed to lie in this redshift range. six of the galaxies exhibit spatiallyextended, tilted h-alpha emission lines; rotation curves for these objectsreach mean velocities of ~150 km/s at radii of ~6 kpc, without corrections forany observational effects. the velocities and radii give a mean dynamical massof m&gt;4e10 m_sun. one-dimensional velocity dispersions for the 16 galaxies rangefrom ~50 to ~260 km/s, and in cases where we have both virial masses implied bythe velocity dispersions and dynamical masses derived from the spatiallyextended emission lines, they are in rough agreement. we compare our kinematicresults to similar measurements made at z~3, and find that both the observedrotational velocities and velocity dispersions tend to be larger at z~2 than atz~3. we find a mean sfr_h-alpha of 16 m_sun/yr and an averagesfr_h-alpha/sfr_uv ratio of 2.4, without correcting for extinction. we seemoderate evidence for an inverse correlation between the uv continuumluminosity and the ratio sfr_h-alpha/sfr_uv, such as might be observed if theuv-faint galaxies suffered greater extinction. we discuss the effects of dustand star formation history on the sfrs, and conclude that extinction is themost likely explanation for the discrepancy between the two sfrs.

astro-ph;0305413	the c iv mass density of the universe at redshift 5	in order to search for metals in the lyman alpha forest at redshifts z &gt; 4,we have obtained spectra of high s/n and resolution of three qsos at z &gt; 5.4discovered by the sloan digital sky survey. these data allow us to probe tometal enrichment of the intergalactic medium at early times with highersensitivity than previous studies. we find 16 c iv absorption systems withcolumn densities log n(c iv) = 12.50 - 13.98 over a total redshift path delta x= 3.29. in the redshift interval z = 4.5-5.0, where our statistics are mostreliable, we deduce a comoving mass density of c iv ions omega(c iv) = (4.3 +/-2.5) x 10(-8) (90% confidence limits) for absorption systems with log n(c iv) &gt;13.0 (for an einstein-de sitter cosmology with h = 0.65). this value of omega(civ) is entirely consistent with those measured at z &lt; 4; we confirm the earlierfinding by songaila (2001) that neither the column density distribution of c ivabsorbers nor its integral show significant redshift evolution over a period oftime which stretches from 1.25 to 4.5 gyr after the big bang. this somewhatsurprising conclusion may be an indication that the intergalactic medium wasenriched in metals at redshifts much greater than 5, perhaps by the sourcesresponsible for its reionization. alternatively, the c iv systems we see may beassociated with outflows from massive star-forming galaxies at later times,while the truly intergalactic metals may reside in regions of the lyman alphaforest of lower density than those probed up to now.

astro-ph;0310472	the evolution of the c/o ratio in metal-poor halo stars	we report new measurements of carbon and oxygen abundances in 34 f and gdwarf and subgiant stars belonging to the halo population and spanning a rangeof metallicity from [fe/h] = -0.7 to -3.2 . the survey is based on observationsof four permitted lines of c i near 9100 a, and the o i 7774 a triplet, allrecorded at high signal-to-noise ratios with the uves echelle spectrograph onthe eso vlt. the line equivalent widths were analysed with the 1d, lte, marcsmodel atmosphere code to deduce c and o abundances; corrections due to non-lteand 3d effects are discussed. when combined with similar published data fordisk stars, our results confirm the metallicity dependence of the c/o ratioknown from previous stellar and interstellar studies: c/o drops by a factor of3-4 as o/h decreases from solar to 1/10 solar. analysed within the context ofstandard models for the chemical evolution of the solar vicinity, this dropresults from the metallicity dependence of the c yields from massive stars withmass loss, augmented by the delayed release of c from stars of low andintermediate mass. the former is, however, always the dominant factor. oursurvey has also uncovered tentative evidence to suggest that, as the oxygenabundance decreases below [o/h] = -1, [c/o] may not remain constant at [c/o] =-0.5, as previously thought, but increase again, possibly approachingnear-solar values at the lowest metallicities ([o/h] approximately equal to-3). with the current dataset this is no more than a 3 sigma effect and it maybe due to metallicity-dependent non-lte corrections to the [c/o] ratio whichhave not been taken into account. however, its potential importance as a windowon the nucleosynthesis by population iii stars is a strong incentive for futurework, both observational and theoretical, to verify its reality.

astro-ph;0403327	have we detected one of the sources responsible for an early  reionisation of the universe?	in a recent paper pell'o et al. have reported a candidate z=10 galaxy,a1835#1916, which was found in a near-infrared survey of the central regions ofthe gravitational lensing cluster a1835. if this detection is confirmed and thedetection rate turns out to be typical, then the volume averaged ultravioletemissivity must be rising rapidly with increasing redshift. for a magnificationdue to gravitational lensing by a factor m&gt;25 estimated by pell'o et al., theinferred star formation rate density at z=10 would be about one order ofmagnitude higher than estimates of the star formation rate density at z=6.objects at z=10 would contribute substantially to the total source counts at1.6 micronm and the estimated space density of sources may exceed the spacedensity of dark matter haloes in a lcdm model. we therefore argue that ifa1835#1916 is indeed at z=10 then either the magnification factor may have beenoverestimated or the galaxy has a top-heavy initial mass function. sources withthe ultraviolet flux and space density of a1835#1916 may be sufficient toreionise most of the diffuse hydrogen in the universe at z=10. we further use acorrelation between the equivalent width and the redshift of the ly-alphaemission line with respect to the systemic redshift observed in lyman breakgalaxies to obtain constraints on the ionisation state of the surroundingintergalactic medium (igm) from the gunn-peterson absorption. these constraintsalso argue in favour of the surrounding igm being partially or fully ionised.

astro-ph;0404235	the kinematics of morphologically selected z~2 galaxies in the goods-n  field	we present near-ir spectra of h-alpha emission from 13 galaxies at z~2 in thegoods-n field. the galaxies were selected primarily because they appear to haveelongated morphologies, and slits were aligned with the major axes (asdetermined from the rest-frame uv emission) of 11 of the 13. if the galaxiesare elongated because they are highly inclined, alignment of the slit and majoraxis should maximize the observed velocity and reveal velocity shear, ifpresent. in spite of this alignment, we see spatially resolved velocity shearin only two galaxies. we show that the seeing makes a large difference in theobserved velocity spread of a tilted emission line, and use this information toplace limits on the velocity spread of the ionized gas of the galaxies in thesample: we find that all 13 have v_{0.5} &lt; 110 km/s, where v_{0.5} is thevelocity shear (half of the velocity range of a tilted emission line) thatwould be observed under our best seeing conditions of ~0.5". when combined withprevious work, our data also indicate that aligning the slit along the majoraxis does not increase the probability of observing a tilted emission line. wethen focus on the one-dimensional velocity dispersion \sigma, which is muchless affected by the seeing, and see that the elongated subsample exhibits asignificantly lower velocity dispersion than galaxies selected at random fromour total h-alpha sample, not higher as one might have expected. we also seesome evidence that the elongated galaxies are less reddened than those randomlyselected using only uv colors. both of these results are counter to what wouldbe expected if the elongated galaxies were highly inclined disks. it is atleast as likely that the galaxies' elongated morphologies are due to mergingsubunits.

astro-ph;0407296	spectral modelling of star-forming regions in the ultraviolet: stellar  metallicity diagnostics for high redshift galaxies	the chemical composition of high redshift galaxies is an important propertywhich gives clues to their past history and future evolution and yet isdifficult to measure with current techniques. in this paper we investigate newmetallicity indicators, based upon the strengths of stellar photosphericfeatures at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths. by combining the evolutionaryspectral synthesis code starburst99 with the output from the non-lte modelatmosphere code wm-basic, we have developed a code that can model theintegrated ultraviolet stellar spectra of star-forming regions at metallicitiesbetween 1/20 and twice solar. we use our models to explore a number of spectralregions that are sensitive to metallicity and clean of other spectral features.the most promising metallicity indicator is an absorption feature between 1935a and 2020 a, which arises from the blending of numerous fe iii transitions. wecompare our model spectra to observations of two well studied high redshiftstar-forming galaxies, ms1512-cb58 (a lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276), andq1307-bm1163 (a uv-bright galaxy at z = 1.411). the profiles of thephotospheric absorption features observed in these galaxies are well reproducedby the models. in addition, the metallicities inferred from their equivalentwidths are in good agreement with previous determinations based on interstellarabsorption and nebular emission lines. our new technique appears to be apromising alternative, or complement, to established methods which have only alimited applicability at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0503485	uv to mid-ir observations of star-forming galaxies at z~2: stellar  masses and stellar populations	we present the broad-band uv through mid-infrared spectral energydistributions (seds) of a sample of 72 spectroscopically-confirmed star-forminggalaxies at z=2.30+/-0.3. located in a 72 arcmin-squared field centered on thebright background qso, hs1700+643, these galaxies were pre-selected to lie atz~2 based solely on their rest-frame uv colors and luminosities, and should berepresentative of uv-selected samples at high redshift. in addition to deepground-based photometry spanning from 0.35-2.15 microns, we make use ofspitzer/irac data, which probes the rest-frame near-ir at z~2. the range ofstellar populations present in the sample is investigated with simple,single-component stellar population synthesis models. emphasizing stellar massestimates, which are less subject to systematic uncertainties than otherparameters, we find &lt;log(m*/msun)&gt;=10.32+/-0.51 for the sample. allowing forthe possibility of episodic star formation, we find that typical galaxies inour sample could contain up to three times more stellar mass in an oldunderlying burst than what was inferred from single-component modeling. incontrast, mass estimates for the most massive galaxies in the sample (m*&gt;10^11msun) are fairly insensitive to the method used to model the stellarpopulation. galaxies in this massive tail, which are also the oldest objects inthe sample, could plausibly evolve into the passive galaxies discovered atz~1.7 with near-ir selection techniques. in the general framework ofhierarchical galaxy formation and mergers, which implies episodicstar-formation histories, galaxies at high redshift may pass in and out ofuv-selected and near-ir color-selected samples as they evolve from phases ofactive star formation to quiescence and back again (abridged).

astro-ph;0506180	zn and cr abundances in damped lyman alpha systems from the corals  survey	we present metal abundances in 15 damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) from thecomplete optical and radio absorption line system (corals) survey, designed tobe free from any biasing effects due to extinction of qsos by dust inintervening absorbers. it has long been suggested that such biasing may explaindifferences in metallicity between dlas and coeval luminous galaxies, andbetween model predictions and observations. we use our measured zinc andchromium abundances (combined with those for five more corals dlas from theliterature, giving us a very nearly complete sample) to test whether themetallicity and degree of dust depletion in corals dlas are significantlydifferent from those of existing, larger, samples of dlas drawn from magnitudelimited, optical surveys. we find that the column density weighted metallicityof corals dlas, [&lt;(zn/h)_dla&gt;] = -0.88 +/- 0.21 in the redshift interval 1.86 &lt;z(abs) &lt; 3.45, is only marginally higher than that of a control sample from therecent compilation by kulkarni et al., [&lt;(zn/h)_dla&gt;] = -1.09 +/- 0.10. withthe present limited statistics this difference is not highly significant.furthermore, we find no evidence for increased dust depletions in coralsdlas--their [cr/zn] ratios conform to the known trend of increasing depletion(decreasing [cr/zn]) with increasing metallicity, and we have encountered nocases where cr is as depleted as in local cold interstellar clouds. theseresults, when combined with the earlier findings of the corals survey reportedby ellison et al. in 2001, make it difficult to invoke a dust-induced bias toexplain the generally low level of chemical evolution exhibited by most dlas.rather, they indicate that large scale optical qso surveys give a fair censusof the population of high redshift absorbers.

astro-ph;0509002	a comparison of absorption and emission line abundances in the nearby  damped lyman-alpha galaxy sbs 1543+593	we have used the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) aboard hst tomeasure a sulfur abundance of [s/h] = -0.41 +/-0.06 in the interstellar medium(ism) of the nearby damped lyman-alpha (dla) absorbing galaxy sbs 1543+593. adirect comparison between this qso absorption line abundance on the one hand,and abundances measured from hii region emission line diagnostics on the other,yield the same result: the abundance of sulfur in the neutral ism is in goodagreement with that of oxygen measured in an hii region 3 kpc away. our resultcontrasts with those of other recent studies which have claimedorder-of-magnitude differences between hi (absorption) and hii (emission)region abundances. we also derive a nickel abundance of [ni/h] &lt; -0.81, somethree times less than that of sulfur, and suggest that the depletion is due todust, although we cannot rule out an over-abundance of alpha-elements as thecause of the lower metallicity. it is possible that our measure of [s/h] isover-estimated if some sii arises in ionized gas; adopting a plausible starformation rate for the galaxy along the line of sight, and a measurement of thecii* 1335.7 absorption line detected from sbs 1543+593, we determine that themetallicity is unlikely to be smaller than we derive by more than 0.25 dex. weestimate that the cooling rate of the cool neutral medium is log [l_c (ergss^{-1} h atom^{-1})] = -27.0, the same value as that seen in the high redshiftdla population.

astro-ph;0512042	selecting damped lyman-alpha systems through caii absorption. i: dust  depletions and reddening at z~1	we use the average e(b-v) and znii column densities of a sample of z~1 caii(3935, 3970) absorption line systems selected from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss dr4) to show that on average, with conservative assumptions regardingmetallicities and dust-to-gas ratios, they contain column densities of neutralhydrogen greater than the damped lyman-alpha (dla) limit. we propose thatselection by caii absorption is an effective way of identifying high columndensities of neutral hydrogen, and thus large samples of dlas at z&lt;1.3 from thesdss. the number density of strong caii absorbers (with rest-frame equivalentwidth w_3935&gt;0.5aa), is ~20-30% that of dlas, after correcting for thesignificant bias against their detection due to obscuration of the backgroundquasars by dust. on average these absorbers have e(b-v)&gt;0.1mag; the dustiestabsorbers show depletions of refractory elements at a level of the largestdepletions seen in dlas. for the first time we can measure the dust-to-metalsratio in a sample of absorption selected galaxies, and find values close to, oreven larger than, those observed locally. all of these properties suggest thata substantial fraction of the caii absorbers are more chemically evolved thantypical dlas. from consideration of the e(b-v) distribution in our sample, andassuming caii absorbers represent a subset of dlas, we calculate that dustobscuration causes an underestimation in the number density of dlas by at least8-12% at these redshifts. finally, the removal of broad absorption line (bal)quasars from the sdss quasar sample increases the sensitivity of the detectionof reddening by intervening absorbers. to this end, we describe a new,automated, principal component analysis (pca) method for identifying balquasars.

astro-ph;0602473	the mass-metallicity relation at z~2	we use a sample of 87 rest-frame uv-selected star-forming galaxies with meanspectroscopic redshift z=2.26 to study the correlation between metallicity andstellar mass at high redshift. using stellar masses determined from sed fittingto 0.3-8 micron photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in stellar mass,and construct six composite h-alpha+[nii] spectra from all of the objects ineach bin. we estimate the mean oxygen abundance in each bin from the[nii]/h-alpha ratio, and find a monotonic increase in metallicity withincreasing stellar mass, from 12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.2 for galaxies with &lt;m_star&gt; =2.7e9 msun to 12+log(o/h) = 8.6 for galaxies with &lt;m_star&gt; = 1e11 msun. we usethe empirical relation between star formation rate density and gas density toestimate the gas fractions of the galaxies, finding an increase in gas fractionwith decreasing stellar mass. these gas fractions combined with the observedmetallicities allow the estimation of the effective yield y_eff as a functionof stellar mass; in constrast to observations in the local universe which showa decrease in y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.such a variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit by a model withsupersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times higher than the star formationrate. we conclude that the mass-metallicity relation at high redshift is drivenby the increase in metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through starformation, and is likely modulated by metal loss from strong outflows ingalaxies of all masses. there is no evidence for preferential loss of metalsfrom low mass galaxies as has been suggested in the local universe.

astro-ph;0602596	star formation and extinction in redshift z~2 galaxies: inferences from  spitzer mips observations	using very deep spitzer/mips 24 micron observations, we present an analysisof the bolometric luminosities (l[bol]) and uv extinction properties of morethan 200 spectroscopically identified, optically selected (ugr) z~2 galaxies inthe goods-n field. the large spectroscopic sample is supplemented with near-irselected (bzk/drg) galaxies and submm sources at similar redshifts in the samefield, providing a representative collection of relatively massive (m*&gt;1e10msun) galaxies at high redshifts. we focus on the redshift range 1.5-2.6, wheremips is sensitive to the strength of the mid-ir pah features in the galaxyspectra (rest-frame 5-8.5 micron). we demonstrate, using stacked x-ray data anda subset of galaxies with h-alpha measurements, that l(5-8.5) provides areliable estimate of l(ir) for most star forming galaxies at z~2. the range ofl(ir) in the samples considered extends from ~1e10 to &gt;1e12 lsun, with a meanof 2e11 lsun. using 24 micron observations to infer dust extinction in highredshift galaxies, we find that, as in the local universe, the obscuration(l[ir]/l[1600]) is strongly dependent on l(bol), and ranges in value from &lt;1 to\~1000. however, the obscuration is ~10 times smaller at a given l(bol) at z~2than at z=0. we show that the values of l(ir) and obscuration inferred from theuv spectral slope beta generally agree well with the values inferred froml(5-8.5) for l(bol)&lt;1e12 lsun. for galaxies with l(bol)&gt;1e12 lsun, it is commonfor uv-based estimates to underpredict l(ir) by a factor of ~10-100. using thespecific sfr as a proxy for cold gas fraction, we find a wide range in theevolutionary state of galaxies at z~2, from those which have just begun to formstars to those which have already accumulated most of their stellar mass andare about to become, or already are, passively-evolving.

astro-ph;0604041	the stellar, gas and dynamical masses of star-forming galaxies at z~2	we present analysis of the near-infrared spectra of 114 rest-frameuv-selected star-forming galaxies at z~2. by combining the h-alpha spectra withphotometric measurements from observed 0.3--8 micron, we assess therelationships between kinematics, dynamical masses, inferred gas fractions, andstellar masses and ages. the h-alpha line widths give a mean dynamical massm_dyn=6.9 +/- 0.6 x 10^10 msun within a typical radius of ~6 kpc, afterexcluding agn. the average dynamical mass is ~2 times larger than the averagestellar mass, and the two agree to within a factor of several for most objects.however, ~15% of the sample has m_dyn &gt;&gt; m_star. these objects are best fit byyoung stellar populations and tend to have high h-alpha equivalent widths,suggesting that they are young starbursts with large gas masses. rest-frameoptical luminosity and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigmasignificance. using the local empirical correlation between star formation rateper unit area and gas surface density, we estimate the mass of the gasassociated with star formation, and find a mean gas fraction of ~50% and astrong decrease in gas fraction with increasing stellar mass. the masses of gasand stars combined are considerably better correlated with the dynamical massesthan are the stellar masses alone, and agree to within a factor of three for85% of the sample. the combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gasmasses, and stellar population properties suggest that the factor of ~500 rangein stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully explained by intrinsicdifferences in the total masses of the galaxies, which vary by a factor of ~40;the remaining variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population andthe conversion of gas into stars.

astro-ph;9705222	zinc and chromium abundances in a third damped lyman alpha system at  intermediate redshift	we have determined the metallicity of the $z_{abs} = 1.0093$ damped lymanalpha system in the bright qso ex 0302-223; this is only the third suchmeasurement at redshifts $z \simlt 1$. unlike the previous two cases, we findthat the abundance of zn is only a factor of $\sim 2$ lower than in thegalactic interstellar medium today and is entirely compatible with the typicalmetallicity of stars in the milky way disk at a look-back time of 9.5 gyrs.although the galaxy responsible for producing the absorption system has yet tobe positively identified, our observations show that galaxies on a chemicalevolution path similar to that of the milky way do contribute to the dampedlyman alpha population at intermediate redshifts. cr is 2.5 times less abundantthan zn, presumably because of depletion onto dust; however, the degree ofdepletion is less severe than in diffuse interstellar clouds in the disk of ourgalaxy and in the magellanic clouds. evidently, the interstellar environment indamped lyman alpha galaxies is less conducive to the formation and survival ofdust grains (and molecular hydrogen), but the physical processes at the root ofthis effect have yet to be clarified.

astro-ph;9707200	the spectra of star forming galaxies at high redshift	we review the spectral properties of the population of star forming galaxiesat z = 3 discovered using a colour selection technique which targets the lymandiscontinuity at 912 angstroms. the uv luminosity of the typical z = 3 galaxyexceeds by more than one order of magnitude that of the most luminousstarbursts in the nearby universe, although the maximum star formationintensity (sfr per unit area) is within the limits found in local surveys. weconsider in detail the likely magnitude of dust extinction and conclude thatpublished estimates of the volume-averaged star formation rate at high z needto be revised to higher values by a factor of about 3. this correction improvesthe agreement between the observations and recent theoretical predictions.lyman alpha emission is generally weak, most likely as a result of resonantscattering. the large equivalent widths of the strongest interstellar lines andtheir systematic blueshift (by up to several hundred km/s) relative to thelyman alpha emission line are indicative of highly energetic outflows in theinterstellar medium. pilot observations have detected the redshifted hbeta and[o iii] emission lines in the k band. the widths of these features implydynamical masses of approximately 10^{10} solar masses for the innermost starforming regions; the total masses involved are likely to exceed 10^{12} solarmasses.

astro-ph;9707306	lyman alpha absorption in the nearby universe: the sightline to  q1821+643	we present the first results of a survey designed to understand the origin ofthe lyman alpha-forest absorption systems at low redshift. using the wyffos andhydra multi-fibre spectrographs on the wht and wiyn telescopes, we haveidentified 51 galaxies brighter than b_j=18.5 within 30 arcmins of thesightline of the qso 1821+643. we find three galaxies within 500 h-1 kpc of theqso sightline; the nearest galaxy is 104 h-1 kpc away from the line of sight,and is at the same redshift as a strong lyman alpha absorption line. theremaining two galaxies have no corresponding absorption to extremely lowequivalent width limits (&lt; 0.05 \aa). beyond 500 h-1 kpc lyman-alpha absorptionlines are found at similar redshifts as several galaxies, but we show thatthese coincidences are likely to be accidental.  half of the lyman alpha systems for which we could have found at least an l^*galaxy have no galaxies at the absorbers' redshifts. for the majority of theremainder, we show that any apparent association with galaxies is probablycoincidental. these \lya systems are characterised by their weak equivalentwidths (w_r &lt; 0.2 \aa), and we conclude that this population of absorbers isuncorrelated, or at best, weakly correlated, with galaxies.

astro-ph;9708117	the discovery of primeval galaxies and the epoch of galaxy formation	we review the steps which have led to the discovery of a widespreadpopulation of objects at z = 3 with many of the characteristics which we expectfor primeval galaxies, and emphasize in particular the advantages of a colourselection technique which targets the lyman discontinuity at 912 angstroms.star forming galaxies at z = 3 resemble local starbursts, although they aretypically more luminous by more than one order of magnitude. the ultravioletcontinuum is dominated by the integrated light of o and early b type stars andshows prominent interstellar absorption lines which are often blueshiftedrelative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy, indicating highly energeticoutflows in the interstellar medium. lyman alpha emission is generally weak,probably as a result of resonant scattering. the spectral slope of theultraviolet continuum and the strength of the hbeta emission line, which wehave detected in a few cases with pilot observations in the infrared k band,suggest that some interstellar dust is already present in these young galaxiesand that it attenuates their uv luminosities by a factor of about 3. theefficiency of our photometric selection technique has allowed us to establishthat large scale concentrations of galaxies were already in place at z = 3,possibly the precursors of galaxy clusters as they as they were beginning todecouple from the hubble expansion. in the context of cold dark matter modelsof structure formation, the observed clustering of the z~3 galaxies suggeststhat they are associated with dark matter halos of mass greater than 10^12solar masses. we conclude by pointing out the need for infrared spaceobservatories, such as the proposed next generation space telescope, forpushing the quest for the origin of galaxies beyond z=5.

astro-ph;9709014	estimating the mass density of neutral gas at $z &lt; 1$	we use the relationships between galactic hi mass and b-band luminositydetermined by rao &amp; briggs to recalculate the mass density of neutral gas atthe present epoch based on more recent measures of the galaxy luminosityfunction than were available to those authors. we find $\omega_{gas}(z=0)\simeq 5 \times 10^{-4}$ in good agreement with the original rao &amp; briggsvalue, suggesting that this quantity is now reasonably secure. we then showthat, if the scaling between h i mass and b-band luminosity has remainedapproximately constant since $z = 1$, the evolution of the luminosity functionfound by the canada-france redshift survey translates to an increase of$\omega_{gas}$ by a factor of $\approx 3$ at $z = 0.5 - 1$ . a similar value isobtained quite independently from consideration of the luminosity function ofmg ii absorbers at $z = 0.65$. by combining these new estimates with data fromdamped \lya systems at higher redshift, it is possible to assemble a roughsketch of the evolution of $\omega_{gas}$ over the last 90% of the age of theuniverse. the consumption of h i gas with time is in broad agreement withmodels of chemical evolution which include the effects of dust, although moreextensive samples of damped \lya systems at low and intermediate redshift arerequired for a quantitative assessment of the dust bias.

astro-ph;9802318	the angular clustering of lyman-break galaxies at redshift z=3	we have measured the angular correlation function w(theta) for a sample of871 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z=3. fitting a power-law to a weightedaverage of w(theta) from 5 fields, we find the amplitude to be a_w=2arcsec^{\beta} and the slope \beta=0.9. the slope is the same as in the localand moderate redshift universe. a slope \beta=0.25 or shallower is ruled out bythe data at the 99.9% confidence level. because n(z) of lbgs is well determinedfrom 376 spectroscopic redshifts, the real-space correlation function can bederived from the angular one through the limber transform. this inversion israther insensitive to the still relatively large errors on a_w and \beta, andthe spatial correlation length is much more tightly constrained than either ofthese parameters. we estimate r_0=3.3 -0.6 +0.7 (2.1 -0.5 +0.4) h^{-1} mpc(comoving) for q_0=0.1 (0.5) at z=3.04 (h is in units of 100 km/s/mpc). thecorrelation length of lbgs at z=3 is comparable to that of present-day spiralgalaxies and is only about 50% smaller than that of the ellipticals; it is aslarge or larger than any measured in galaxy samples at 0.3&lt;z&lt;1. by comparingthe observed galaxy correlation length to that of the mass predicted from cdmtheory, we estimate a bias for lbgs of b\sim 1.5 (4.5) for q_0=0.1 (0.5), inagreement with our previous estimates based on preliminary spectroscopy. thestrong clustering and the large bias of the lbgs are consistent with biasedgalaxy formation theories and provide additional evidence that these systemsare associated with massive dark matter halos. the clustering of lbgs at z=3emphasizes that apparent evolution of galaxy clustering may be due as much tovariations in effective bias parameter among different samples as to evolutionin the mass distribution through gravitational instability.

astro-ph;9806219	infared observations of nebular emission lines from galaxies at z = 3	we present the first results from a program of near-infrared spectroscopyaimed at studying the familiar rest-frame optical emission lines from the h iiregions of lyman break galaxies at z = 3. by targeting redshifts which bringthe lines of interest into gaps between the strong oh sky emission, we havebeen successful in detecting balmer and [o iii] emission lines in all fivegalaxies observed so far with cgs4 on ukirt. for a salpeter imf and a h_0 = 70km/s/mpc, q_0 = 0.1 cosmology, the hbeta luminosities uncorrected for dustextinction imply star formation rates of 20 - 270 solar masses per year. on thebasis of the present limited sample it appears that an extinction of 1 - 2magnitudes at 1500 a may be typical of lyman break galaxies. this value isconsistent with recent estimates of dust obscuration in star forming galaxiesat z &lt; 1, and does not require a substantial revision of the broad picture ofstar formation over the hubble time proposed by madau et al. (1996). in fourout of five cases the velocity dispersion of the emission line gas is sigma =70 km/s, while in the fifth the line widths are nearly three times larger.virial masses in the range from 1 x 10^{10} to 5 x 10^{10} solar masses aresuggested, but both velocities and masses could be higher because ourobservations are only sensitive to the brightest cores of these systems wherethe line widths may not sample the full gravitational potential. the relativeredshifts of interstellar absorption, nebular emission, and lyman alphaemission lines differ by several hundred km/s and suggest that large-scaleoutflows may be a common characteristic of lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;9808017	metal abundances at z &lt; 1.5: fresh clues to the chemical enrichment  history of damped lyman alpha systems	we explore the redshift evolution of the metal content of damped lyman alphasystems (dlas) with new observations of four absorbers at z &lt; 1.5 . the mainconclusion is that the column density--weighted mean metallicity, [&lt;zn/h&gt;] =-1.03 +/- 0.23 (on a logarithmic scale), is not significantly higher at z &lt; 1.5than at earlier epochs, despite the fact that the comoving star formation ratedensity of the universe was near its maximum value at this redshift. for threeof the four dlas our observations include absorption lines of si, mn, cr, fe,and ni, as well as zn. we argue that the relative abundances of these elementsare consistent with a moderate degree of dust depletion which, once accountedfor, leaves no room for the enhancement of the alpha-elements over iron seen inmetal poor stars in the milky way. this is contrary to previous assertions thatdlas have been enriched solely by type ii supernovae, but can be understood ifthe rate of star formation in the systems studied proceeded more slowly than inthe early history of our galaxy. these results add to a growing body of dataall pointing to the conclusion that known dlas do not trace the galaxypopulation responsible for the bulk of star formation. possible reasons arethat sight-lines through metal rich gas are systematically underrepresentedbecause the background qsos are reddened, and that the most actively starforming galaxies are also the most compact, presenting too small across-section to have been probed yet with the limited statistics of currentsamples.

astro-ph;9809401	the power spectrum of mass fluctuations measured from the lyman-alpha  forest at redshift z=2.5	we measure the linear power spectrum of mass density fluctuations at redshiftz=2.5 from the \lya forest absorption in a sample of 19 qso spectra, using themethod introduced by croft et al. (1998). the p(k) measurement covers the range2\pi/k ~ 450-2350 km/s (2-12 comoving \hmpc for \omega=1). we examine a numberof possible sources of systematic error and find none that are significant onthese scales. in particular, we show that spatial variations in the uvbackground caused by the discreteness of the source population should havenegligible effect on our p(k) measurement. we obtain consistent results fromthe high and low redshift halves of the data set and from an entirelyindependent sample of nine qso spectra with mean redshift z=2.1. a power lawfit to our measured p(k) yields a logarithmic slope n=-2.25 +/- 0.18 and anamplitude \delta^2(k_p) = 0.57^{+0.26}_{-0.18}, where $\delta^2$ is thecontribution to the density variance from a unit interval of lnk and k_p=0.008(km/s)^{-1}. direct comparison of our mass p(k) to the measured clustering oflyman break galaxies shows that they are a highly biased population, with abias factor b~2-5. the slope of the linear p(k), never previously measured onthese scales, is close to that predicted by models based on inflation and colddark matter (cdm). the p(k) amplitude is consistent with some scale-invariant,cobe-normalized cdm models (e.g., an open model with \omega_0=0.4) andinconsistent with others (e.g., \omega=1). even with limited dynamic range andsubstantial statistical uncertainty, a measurement of p(k) that has no unknown``bias factors'' offers many opportunities for testing theories of structureformation and constraining cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;9810142	cosmology with the lyman-alpha forest	we outline the physical picture of the high-redshift ly-alpha forest that hasemerged from cosmological simulations, describe statistical characteristics ofthe forest that can be used to test theories of structure formation, present apreliminary comparison between simulation results and measurements from keckhires spectra, and discuss a recent determination of the slope and amplitude ofthe linear mass power spectrum p(k) at z=2.5 from moderate resolution spectra.the physical picture is simple if each qso spectrum is viewed as a continuousnon-linear map of the line-of-sight density field rather than a collection ofdiscrete absorption lines. the distribution of flux decrements depends mainlyon the amplitude and pdf (gaussian vs. non-gaussian) of the primordial densityfluctuations. the threshold crossing frequency, analogous to the 3-d genuscurve, responds to the shape and amplitude of p(k) and to the values of omegaand lambda. open and lambda-cdm models agree well with the measured fluxdecrement distribution at smoothing lengths of 25 km/s and 100 km/s and withthe threshold crossing frequency at 100 km/s. discrepancy with the observedthreshold crossing frequency at 25 km/s may reflect the combined effects ofnoise in the data and limited mass resolution of the simulations. the slope ofthe measured p(k) agrees with the predictions of inflation+cdm models.combining the amplitude with cobe normalization imposes a constraint on thesemodels of the form omega h^x n^y omega_b^z = constant. assuming gaussianprimordial fluctuations and a power spectrum shape parameter gamma~0.2,consistency of the measured p(k) with the observed cluster mass function at z=0requires omega=0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.10} for an open universe andomega=0.34^{+0.13}_{-0.09} for a flat universe (1-sigma errors).

astro-ph;9903063	metal abundances in the lyman alpha forest	we present high s/n echelle spectra of the recently discovered ultraluminousqso apm 08279+5255 and use these data to re-examine the abundance of carbon inly alpha forest clouds. in agreement with previous work, we find thatapproximately half of the ly alpha clouds whose hydrogen column densities logn(hi) &gt; 14.5 have associated weak civ absorption with log n(civ) &gt; 12, and wederive a median n(civ)/n(h i) = 1.4 x 10^-3. we then investigate whether thereis any civ absorption in weaker ly alpha clouds with 13.5 &lt; log n(hi) &lt; 14.0.two contrasting techniques are compared - firstly by stacking individual civlines to produce a high s/n (=580) composite spectrum and secondly byconstructing pixel-by-pixel optical depth distributions, a technique recentlydeveloped by cowie &amp; songaila (1998). by simulating stacks of syntheticabsorption lines, the composite spectrum technique is found to be severelyhampered by random redshift offsets between civ lines and their correspondinghi. whilst the optical depth method showed evidence for civ asborption even athi optical depths as small as 0.5 - 2, simulations showed that even higher s/nratios are required in order to determine whether the civ/hi ratio remainsconstant at these low column densities.

astro-ph;9908007	the ultraviolet spectrum of ms 1512-cb58: an insight into lyman break  galaxies	we present an intermediate resolution, high s/n spectrum of the z = 2.7268galaxy ms 1512-cb58, obtained with lris on the keck i telescope and coveringthe rest frame far-uv from 1150 to 1930 a. gravitational lensing by aforeground cluster boosts the flux from cb58 by a factor of about 30 andprovides the opportunity for a first quantitative study of the physicalproperties of star forming galaxies at high redshift. our main results are asfollows. the ultraviolet spectral properties of cb58 are remarkably similar tothose of nearby star forming galaxies. the p-cygni profiles of civ and nv arebest matched by continuous star formation with a salpeter imf extending beyond50 solar masses---we find no evidence for either a flatter imf (at the highmass end), or an imf deficient in the most massive stars. there are clues inour data that the metallicity of both the stars and the gas is a few timesbelow solar. our best estimate, approximately equal to 1/4 solar, is 3 timeshigher than the typical metallicity of damped lyman alpha systems at the sameredshift, consistent with the proposal that the galaxies which dominate the h iabsorption cross-section are generally forming stars at a slower rate than l*lyman break galaxies like cb58. the relative velocities of the stellar lines,interstellar absorption, and h ii emission indicate the existence oflarge-scale outflows in the interstellar medium of cb58, with a bulk outwardmotion of 200 km/s and a mass loss rate of approximately 60 solar masses peryear, roughly comparable to the star formation rate. such galactic winds maywell be the mechanism which self-regulates star formation, distributes metalsover large volumes and allows the escape of ionizing photons into the igm.

astro-ph;9909092	a search for the submillimetre counterparts to lyman break galaxies	we have carried out targetted sub-mm observations as part of a programme toexplore the connection between the rest-frame uv and far-ir properties ofstar-forming galaxies at high redshift, which is currently poorly understood.on the one hand the lyman break technique is very effective at selecting z~3galaxies. on the other hand `blank field' imaging in the sub-mm seems to turnup sources routinely, amongst which some are star forming galaxies at similarredshifts. already much work has been done searching for opticalidentifications of objects detected using the scuba instrument. here we havetaken the opposite approach, performing sub-mm photometry for a sample of lymanbreak galaxies whose uv properties imply high star formation rates.  the total signal from our lyman break sample is undetected in the sub-mm, atan rms level of 0.5 mjy, which implies that the population of lyman breakgalaxies does not constitute a large part of the recently detected blank-fieldsub-mm sources. however, our one detection suggests that with reasonable scubaintegrations we might expect to detect those few lbgs that are far-irbrightest.

0810.3236	dust biasing of damped lyman alpha systems: a bayesian analysis	if damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) contain even modest amounts of dust, theultraviolet luminosity of the background quasar can be severely diminished.when the spectrum is redshifted, this leads to a bias in optical surveys fordlas. previous estimates of the magnitude of this effect are in some tension;in particular, the distribution of dlas in the column-density -- metallicityplane has led to claims that we may be missing a considerable fraction of metalrich, high column density dlas, whereas radio surveys do not unveil asubstantial population of otherwise hidden systems. motivated by this tension,we perform a bayesian parameter estimation analysis of a simple dustobscuration model. we include radio and optical observations of dlas in ouroverall likelihood analysis and show that these do not, in fact, constituteconflicting constraints.  our model gives statistical limits on the biasing effects of dust, predictingthat only 7% of dlas are missing from optical samples due to dust obscuration;at 2 sigma confidence, this figure takes a maximum value of 17%. this contrastswith recent claims that dla incidence rates are underestimated by 30 -- 50%.optical measures of the mean metallicities of dlas are found to underestimatethe true value by just 0.1 dex (or at most 0.4 dex, 2 sigma confidence limit),in agreement with the radio survey results of akerman et al. the quantity mostaffected by dust biasing is the total cosmic density of metals in dlas,omega_{z,dla}, which is underestimated in optical surveys by a factor ofapproximately two.
