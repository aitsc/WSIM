0903.1123	the global gas and dust budget of the large magellanic cloud: agb stars  and supernovae, and the impact on the ism evolution	we report on an analysis of the gas and dust budget in the the interstellarmedium (ism) of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). recent observations from thespitzer space telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess ofasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the lmc. this is the first time we canquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from agb stars over a completegalaxy, fully based on observations. the integrated mass-loss rate over allintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich agb candidates in the lmc is8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. this numbercould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich starsare included. this is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,considering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass starswhere formed, and the initial mass functions. agb stars are one of the mostimportant gas sources in the lmc, with supernovae (sne), which produces about2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. at the moment, the star formation rate exceedsthe gas feedback from agb stars and sne in the lmc, and the current starformation depends on gas already present in the ism. this suggests that as thegas in the ism is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline inthe lmc, unless gas is supplied externally. our estimates suggest `a missingdust-mass problem' in the lmc, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: theaccumulated dust mass from agb stars and possibly sne over the dust life time(400--800 myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ism. another dustsource is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.

0905.1124	unusual dust emission from planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic study of a sample of 25planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds. the low-resolution modules are usedto analyze the dust features present in the infrared spectra. this studycomplements a previous work by the same authors where the same sample wasanalyzed in terms of neon and sulfur abundances. over half of the objects (14)show emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, typical of carbon-rich dustenvironments. we compare the hydrocarbon emission in our objects to those ofgalactic hii regions and planetary nebulae, and lmc/smc hii regions. amorphoussilicates are seen in just two objects, enforcing the now well-known-fact thatoxygen-rich dust is less common at low metallicities. besides these commonfeatures, some planetary nebulae show very unusual dust. nine objects show astrong silicon carbide feature at 11um and twelve of them show magnesiumsulfide emission starting at 25um. the high percentage of spectra with siliconcarbide in the magellanic clouds is not common. two objects show a broad bandwhich may be attributed to hydrogenated amorphous carbon and weaklow-excitation atomic lines. it is likely that these nebulae are very young.the spectra of the remaining eight nebulae are dominated by the emission offine-structure lines with a weak continuum due to thermal emission of dust,although in a few cases the s/n in the spectra is low, and weak dust featuresmay not have been detected.

0906.2870	knots in the helix nebula found in h2	we present a deep and wide field-of-view (4'x 7') image of the planetarynebula (pn) ngc 7293 (the helix nebula) in the 2.12 micron h2 v=1-0 s(1) line.the excellent seeing (0.4'') at the subaru telescope, allows the details ofcometary knots to be examined. the knots are found at distances of 2.2'-6.4'from the central star (cs). at the inner edge and in the inner ring (up to 4.5'fromthe cs), the knot often show a `tadpole' shape, an elliptical head with abright crescent inside and a long tail opposite to the cs. in detail, there arevariations in the tadpole shapes, such as narrowing tails, widening tails,meandering tails, or multi-peaks within a tail. in the outer ring (4.5'-6.4'from the cs), the shapes are more fractured, and the tails do not collimateinto a single direction. the transition in knot morphology from the inner edgeto the outer ring is clearly seen. the number density of knots governs the h2surface brightness in the inner ring: h2 exists only within the knots. possiblemechanisms which contribute to the shaping of the knots are discussed,including photo-ionization and streaming motions. a plausible interpretation ofour images is that inner knots are being overrun by a faster wind, but thatthis has not (yet) reached the outer knots. based on h2 formation anddestruction rates, h2 gas can survive in knots from formation during the lateasymptotic giant branch (agb) phase throughout the pn phase. these observationsprovide new constraints on the formation and evolution of knots, and on thephysics of molecular gas embedded within ionized gas.

0906.4718	analysis of the infrared spectra of the peculiar post-agb stars eplyr  and hd52961	aim: we aim to study in detail the peculiar mineralogy and structure of thecircumstellar environment of two binary post-agb stars, eplyr and hd52961. bothstars were selected from a larger sample of evolved disc sources observed withspitzer and show unique solid-state and gas features in their infrared spectra.moreover, they show a very small infrared excess in comparison with the othersample stars. methods: the different dust and gas species are identified on thebasis of high-resolution spitzer-irs spectra. we fit the full spectrum toconstrain grain sizes and temperature distributions in the discs. this,combined with our broad-band spectral energy distribution and interferometricmeasurements, allows us to study the physical structure of the disc, using aself-consistent 2d radiative-transfer disc model. results: we find that bothstars have strong emission features due to co_2 gas, dominated by^{12}c^{16}o_2, but with clear ^{13}c^{16}o_2 and even ^{16}o^{12}c^{18}oisotopic signatures. crystalline silicates are apparent in both sources butproved very hard to model. ep lyr also shows evidence of mixed chemistry, withemission features of the rare class-c pahs. whether these pahs reside in theoxygen-rich disc or in a carbon-rich outflow is still unclear. with thestrongly processed silicates, the mixed chemistry and the low ^{12}c/^{13}cratio, ep lyr resembles some silicate j-type stars, although the depletedphotosphere makes nucleosynthetic signatures difficult to probe. we find thatthe disc environment of both sources is, to a first approximation, wellmodelled with a passive disc, but additional physics such as grain settling,radial dust distributions, and an outflow component must be included to explainthe details of the observed spectral energy distributions in both stars.

0909.2642	near-ir spectra of iphas extremely red galactic agb stars	we present a library of 139 near-ir spectra of cool asymptotic giant branchstars that will be useful for comparison with theoretical model atmospherecalculations and for modeling the integrated emission from intermediate-agestellar populations. the source list was selected from the `extremely red'region of the int photometric h alpha survey (iphas) colour-colour plane thatis overwhelmingly dominated by very late-type stars. the spectral library alsoincludes a large fraction of s-type and carbon stars. we present a number ofspectral classification sequences highlighting the various molecular featuresidentified and discuss a number of rare features with uncertain identificationsin the literature. with its focus on particularly cool photospheres thiscatalogue serves as a companion to recent spectroscopic atlases of mk standardsin the near-ir. finally the relationship between iphas (r'-i') and (r'-h alpha)colours and spectroscopically determined properties is discussed and a strongcorrelation between (r'-h alpha) colour and the c/o abundance index for s-typeand carbon stars is noted. this relation has the potential to separate o-rich,s-type and carbon stars in the galaxy based on their photometry alone.

0910.5624	chemical depletion in the large magellanic cloud: rv tauri stars and the  photospheric feedback from their dusty discs	aims: by studying the photospheric abundances of 4 rv tauri stars in the lmc,we test whether the depletion pattern of refractory elements, seen in similargalactic sources, is also common for extragalactic sources. since thisdepletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc,we investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. methods: adetailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution uvesoptical spectra. to study the circumstellar environment we use photometric datato construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine thegeometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution spitzer-irsinfrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. results: our results showthat, also in the lmc, the photospheres of rv tauri stars are commonly affectedby the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength fromsource to source. from our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, wefind that this process, as in the galaxy, appears closely related to thepresence of a stable keplerian disc. the newly studied extragalactic objectshave similar observational characteristics as galactic post-agb binariessurrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of abinary system. one source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for adisc source, but still has evidence for depletion. we speculate this couldpoint to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seenaround young stellar objects.

0911.4918	the interface between the stellar wind and interstellar medium around r  cassiopeiae revealed by far-infrared imaging	the circumstellar dust shells of intermediate initial-mass (about 1 to 8solar masses) evolved stars are generated by copious mass loss during theasymptotic giant branch phase. the density structure of their circumstellarshell is the direct evidence of mass loss processes, from which we caninvestigate the nature of mass loss. we used the akari infrared astronomysatellite and the spitzer space telescope to obtain the surface brightness mapsof an evolved star r cas at far-infrared wavelengths, since the temperature ofdust decreases as the distance from the star increases and one needs to probedust at lower temperatures, i.e., at longer wavelengths. the observed shellstructure and the star's known proper motion suggest that the structurerepresents the interface regions between the dusty wind and the interstellarmedium. the deconvolved structures are fitted with the analytic bow shockstructure to determine the inclination angle of the bow shock cone. our datashow that (1) the bow shock cone of 1 - 5 x 10^-5 solar masses (dust mass) isinclined at 68 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky, and (2) the dusttemperature in the bow shock cone is raised to more than 20 k by collisionalshock interaction in addition to the ambient interstellar radiation field. bycomparison between the apex vector of the bow shock and space motion vector ofthe star we infer that there is a flow of interstellar medium local to r caswhose flow velocity is at least 55.6 km/s, consistent with an environmentconducive to dust heating by shock interactions.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1005.2787	dust in the bright supernova remnant n49 in the lmc	we investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (snr) n49 inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) as observed with the herschel spaceobservatory. n49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecularcloud along its eastern edge. we have used pacs and spire to measure the far irflux densities of the entire snr and of a bright region on the eastern edge ofthe snr where the snr shock is encountering the molecular cloud. using thesefluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate thedust mass associated with n49 to be about 10 msun. the bulk of the dust in oursimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 k, similar to that ofnearby molecular clouds. unfortunately, as a result of the limited angularresolution of herschel at the wavelengths sampled with spire, the uncertaintiesare fairly large. assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with thesnr is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the snrarises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significantx-ray emission. the total amount of warm 50-60 k dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 msun,depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicategrains. this provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust inn49.

0709.3199	spitzer space telescope spectral observations of agb stars in the fornax  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we have observed five carbon-rich agb stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal(dsph) galaxy, using the infrared spectrometer on board the spitzer spacetelescope. the stars were selected from a near-infrared survey of fornax andinclude the three reddest stars, with presumably the highest mass-loss rates,in that galaxy. such carbon stars probably belong to the intermediate-agepopulation (2-8 gyr old and metallicity of [fe/h] -1) of fornax. the primaryaim of this paper is to investigate mass-loss rate, as a function of luminosityand metallicity, by comparing agb stars in several galaxies with differentmetallicities. the spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfermodel. we find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 msunyr-1. the other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 msun yr-1. wefind no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggestthat the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in therange 240 to 800. the c2h2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because ofthe higher c/o ratio. in contrast, the sic fraction is reduced at lowmetallicity, due to low silicon abundance. the total mass-loss rate from allknown carbon-rich agb stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is ofthe order of 2x10^-5 msun yr-1. this is much lower than that of the dwarfirregular galaxy wlm, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.the difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of wlm. thesuppressed gas-return rate to the ism accentuates the difference between therelatively gas-rich dwarf irregular and the gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies.our study will be useful to constrain gas and dust recycling processes in lowmetallicity galaxies.

1104.2316	warm water vapour in the sooty outflow from a luminous carbon star	in 2001, the discovery of circumstellar water vapour around the ageing carbonstar irc+10216 was announced. this detection challenged the currentunderstanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to beabsent in carbon-rich stars. several explanations for the occurrence of watervapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets ordwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, andphotochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. however, the only waterline detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, byitself, between the different mechanisms proposed. here we report on thedetection by the herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in thefar-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of irc+10216, including somehigh-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 k. the emission ofthese high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour ispresent in the warm inner region of the envelope. a plausible explanation forthe formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet(uv) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. this mechanism triggersalso the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observedabundances are much higher than hitherto predicted.

1110.3235	the circumstellar environment of r coronae borealis: white dwarf merger  or final helium shell flash?	in 2007, r coronae borealis (r crb) went into an historically deep and longdecline. in this state, the dust acts like a natural coronagraph at visiblewavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. imaging hasbeen obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with gemini/gmos, hst/wfpc2, spitzer/mips,and herschel/spire. several of the structures around r crb are cometaryglobules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. the estimateddust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the r crbdeclines if they form along the line of sight to the star. in addition, thereis a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containingcool 25 k dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. the sed of r crbcan be well fit by a 150 au disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelopewhich corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. the total masses ofthe disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 m(sun), respectively, assuming agas-to-dust ratio of 100. the evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger ora final-helium-shell flash origin for r crb is contradictory. the shell and thecometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. along with thefact that r crb shows significant lithium in its atmosphere, this supports thefinal-helium-shell flash. however, the relatively high inferred mass of r crband its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.

1111.6627	dust in historical galactic type ia supernova remnants with herschel	the origin of interstellar dust in galaxies is poorly understood,particularly the relative contributions from supernovae and the cool stellarwinds of low-intermediate mass stars. here, we present herschel pacs and spirephotometry at 70-500um of the historical young supernova remnants: kepler andtycho; both thought to be the remnants of type ia explosion events. we detect awarm dust component in kepler's remnant with t = 82k and mass 0.0031msun; thisis spatially coincident with thermal x-ray emission optical knots andfilaments, consistent with the warm dust originating in the circumstellarmaterial swept up by the primary blast wave of the remnant. similarly fortycho's remnant, we detect warm dust at 90k with mass 0.0086msun. comparing thespatial distribution of the warm dust with x-rays from the ejecta and swept-upmedium, and ha emission arising from the post-shock edge, we show that the warmdust is swept up interstellar material. we find no evidence of a cool (25-50 k)component of dust with mass &gt;0.07msun as observed in core-collapse remnants ofmassive stars. neither the warm or cold dust components detected here arespatially coincident with supernova ejecta material. we compare the lack ofobserved supernova dust with a theoretical model of dust formation in type iaremnants which predicts dust masses of 0.088(0.017)msun for ejecta expandinginto surrounding densities of 1(5)cm-3. the model predicts that silicon- andcarbon-rich dust grains will encounter the interior edge of the observed dustemission at 400 years confirming that the majority of the warm dust originatesfrom swept up circumstellar or interstellar grains (for kepler and tychorespectively). the lack of cold dust grains in the ejecta suggests that type iaremnants do not produce substantial quantities of iron-rich dust grains and hasimportant consequences for the 'missing' iron mass observed in ejecta.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1204.5754	carbon-rich dust production in metal-poor galaxies in the local group	we have observed a sample of 19 carbon stars in the sculptor, carina, fornax,and leo i dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the infrared spectrograph on thespitzer space telescope. the spectra show significant quantities of dust aroundthe carbon stars in sculptor, fornax, and leo i, but little in carina. previouscomparisons of carbon stars with similar pulsation properties in the galaxy andthe magellanic clouds revealed no evidence that metallicity affected theproduction of dust by carbon stars. however, the more metal-poor stars in thecurrent sample appear to be generating less dust. these data extend two knowntrends to lower metallicities. in more metal-poor samples, the sic dustemission weakens, while the acetylene absorption strengthens. the bolometricmagnitudes and infrared spectral properties of the carbon stars in fornax areconsistent with metallicities more similar to carbon stars in the magellanicclouds than in the other dwarf spheroidals in our sample. a study of the carbonbudget in these stars reinforces previous considerations that the dredge-up ofsufficient quantities of carbon from the stellar cores may trigger the finalsuperwind phase, ending a star's lifetime on the asymptotic giant branch.

1206.5982	an independent distance estimate to cw leo	cw leo has been observed six times between october 2009 and june 2012 withthe spire instrument on board the herschel satellite. variability has beendetected in the flux emitted by the central star with a period of 639 \pm 4days, in good agreement with determinations in the literature. variability isalso detected in the bow shock around cw leo that had previously been detectedin the ultraviolet and herschel pacs/spire data. although difficult to provedirectly, our working hypothesis is that this variability is directly relatedto that of the central star. in this case, fitting a sine curve with the periodfixed to 639 days results in a time-lag in the variability between bow shockand the central star of 402 \pm 37 days. the orientation of the bow shockrelative to the plane of the sky is unknown (but see below). for an inclinationangle of zero degrees, the observed time-lag translates into a distance to cwleo of 130 \pm 13 pc, and for non-zero inclination angles the distance issmaller. fitting the shape of the bow shock with an analytical model (wilkin1996), the effect of the inclination angle on the distance may be estimated.making the additional assumption that the relative peculiar velocity betweenthe interstellar medium (ism) and cw leo is determined entirely by the starspace velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (i.e. a stationaryism), the inclination angle is found to be (-33.3 \pm 0.8) degrees based on theobserved proper motion and radial velocity. using the wilkin model, our currentbest estimate of the distance to cw leo is 123 \pm 14 pc. for a distance of 123pc, we derive a mean luminosity of 7790 \pm 150 lsol (internal error).

1209.1023	oxygen-rich dust production in ic 10	we report the detection of oxygen-rich circumstellar envelopes in stars ofthe nearby (700 kpc) starburst galaxy ic 10. the star formation history and thechemical environment of this galaxy makes it an ideal target to observe dustproduction by high-mass stars in a low-metallicity environment. the goal ofthis study is to identify oxygen-rich stars in ic 10 and to constrain theirnature between asymptotic giant branch stars (agbs), red supergiants (rsgs),and other infrared bright sources. we examine the mass-loss rate of the starsand compare to results obtained for the magellanic clouds. our objectives areto (1) assess whether rsgs can be significant dust producers in ic 10, and (2),solve the discrepancy between the star formation history of ic 10 and therelatively low number of rsgs detected in the optical. we search for silicatedust in emission by using the spectral map observed with the infraredspectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope. the optical (ubvri) andinfrared (jhk, spitzer/irac and spitzer/mips) photometry is used to assert themembership of the stars to ic 10 and disentangle between agbs and rsgs.radiative models are used to infer mass-loss rates and stellar luminosities.the luminosity and colors of at least 9 silicate emission sources areconsistent with stars within ic 10. furthermore, the photometry of 2 of thesesources is consistent with rsgs. we derive dust mass-loss rates similar to thevalues found in the magellanic clouds. accounting for the sample completeness,rsgs are not important contributors to the dust mass budget in ic 10.

1212.1468	the global gas and dust budget of the small magellanic cloud	in order to understand the evolution of the interstellar medium (ism) of agalaxy, we have analysed the gas and dust budget of the small magellanic cloud(smc). using the spitzer space telescope, we measured the integrated gasmass-loss rate across asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and red supergiants(rsgs) in the smc, and obtained a rate of 1.4x10^-3 msun yr-1. this is muchsmaller than the estimated gas ejection rate from type ii supernovae (sne)(2-4x10^-2 msun yr-1). the smc underwent a an increase in starformation rate inthe last 12 myrs, and consequently the galaxy has a relatively high sn rate atpresent. thus, sne are more important gas sources than agb stars in the smc.the total gas input from stellar sources into the ism is 2-4x10^-2 msun yr-1.this is slightly smaller than the ism gas consumed by starformation (~8x10^-2msun yr-1). starformation in the smc relies on a gas reservoir in the ism, buteventually the starformation rate will decline in this galaxy, unless gasinfalls into the ism from an external source. the dust injection rate from agband rsg candidates is 1x10^-5 msun yr-1. dust injection from sne is in therange of 0.2--11x10^-4 msun yr-1, although the sn contribution is ratheruncertain. stellar sources could be important for ism dust (3x10^5 msun yr-1)in the smc, if the dust lifetime is about 1.4 gyrs. we found that the presenceof poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) in the ism cannot be explained entirely bycarbon-rich agb stars. carbon-rich agb stars could inject only 7x10^-9 msunyr-1 of pahs at most, which could contribute up to 100 msun of pahs in thelifetime of a pah. the estimated pah mass of 1800 msun in the smc can not beexplained. additional pah sources, or ism reprocessing should be needed.

1306.1777	oh/ir stars and their superwinds as observed by the herschel space  observatory	aim : in order to study the history of mass loss in extreme oh/ir stars, weobserved a number of these objects using co as a tracer of the density andtemperature structure of their circumstellar envelopes.  method : combining co observations from the herschel space observatory withthose from the ground, we trace mass loss rates as a function of radius in fiveextreme oh/ir stars. using radiative transfer modelling, we modelled the dustyenvelope as well as the co emission. the high-rotational transitions of coindicate that they originate in a dense superwind region close to the starwhile the lower transitions tend to come from a more tenuous outer wind whichis a result of the mass loss since the early agb phase.  result : the models of the circumstellar envelopes around these stars suggestthat they have entered a superwind phase in the past 200 - 500 years. the low18o/17o (~ 0.1 compared to the solar abundance ratio of ~ 5) and 12c/13c (3-30cf. the solar value of 89) ratios derived from our study support the idea thatthese objects have undergone hot-bottom burning and hence that they are massivem &gt;= 5 solar-mass agb stars.

1403.2892	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel - i. the co envelope	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars lose their envelopes by means of astellar wind whose driving mechanism is not understood well. characterizing thecomposition and thermal and dynamical structure of the outflow providesconstraints that are essential for understanding agb evolution, including therate of mass loss and isotopic ratios.  we modeled the co emission from the wind of the low mass-loss rateoxygen-rich agb star w hya using data obtained by the hifi, pacs, and spireinstruments onboard the herschel space observatory and ground-based telescopes.$^{12}$co and $^{13}$co lines are used to constrain the intrinsic$^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio from resolved hifi lines.  the acceleration of the outflow up to about 5.5 km/s is quite slow and can berepresented by a beta-type velocity law with index 5. beyond this point,acceleration up the terminal velocity of 7 km/s is faster. using the j=10-9,9-8, and 6-5 transitions, we find an intrinsic $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio of$18\pm10$ for w hya, where the error bar is mostly due to uncertainties in the$^{12}$co abundance and the stellar flux around 4.6 $\mu$m. to match thelow-excitation co lines, these molecules need to be photo-dissociated at about500 stellar radii. the radial dust emission intensity profile measured by pacsimages at 70 $\mu$m shows substantially stronger emission than our modelpredicts beyond 20 arcsec.  the initial slow acceleration of the wind implies inefficient wind driving inthe lower part of the envelope. the final injection of momentum in the windmight be the result of an increase in the opacity thanks to the latecondensation of dust species. the derived intrinsic isotopologue ratio for whya is consistent with values set by the first dredge-up and suggestive of aninitial mass of 2 m$_\odot$ or more. however, the uncertainty in themain-sequence mass derived based on this isotopologic ratio is large.

1409.0396	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel. ii. the molecular envelope of w  hya	the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass ina stellar wind. understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellarwinds of agb stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products ofnucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining agb evolution and predicting thechemical evolution of galaxies. in a previous paper we have constrained thestructure of the outflowing envelope of w hya using spectral lines of the$^{12}$co molecule. here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set ofh$_{2}$o and $^{28}$sio lines observed by the three instruments on boardherschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfercode. the oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$sio abundance profile can beconnected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formationat the base of the stellar wind, respectively. the modelling of h$_{2}$o and$^{28}$sio confirms the properties of the envelope model of w hya derived from$^{12}$co lines. we find an h$_2$o ortho-to-para ratio of2.5\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an agb wind. theo$^{16}$/o$^{17}$ ratio indicates that w hya has an initial mass of about 1.5m$_\odot$. although the ortho- and para-h$_{2}$o lines observed by hifi appearto trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocityof $0.7\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the hifi lines of both spin isomers and thoseof $^{28}$sio well. the ortho- and para-h$_2^{16}$o and $^{28}$sio abundancesrelative to h$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \times10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. assuming a solarsilicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$sio line emission model is consistent withabout one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.

1410.7386	the timing and location of dust formation in the remnant of sn 1987a	the discovery with the {\it herschel space observatory} of bright farinfrared and submm emission from the ejecta of the core collapse supernovasn\,1987a has been interpreted as indicating the presence of some0.4--0.7\,m$_\odot$ of dust. we have constructed radiative transfer models ofthe ejecta to fit optical to far-infrared observations from the literature atepochs between 615 days and 24 years after the explosion, to determine when andwhere this unexpectedly large amount of dust formed.  we find that the observations by day 1153 are consistent with the presence of3$\times$10$^{-3}$m$_\odot$ of dust. although this is a larger amount than haspreviously been considered possible at this epoch, it is still very smallcompared to the amount present in the remnant after 24 years, and significantlyhigher dust masses at the earlier epochs are firmly ruled out by theobservations, indicating that the majority of the dust must have formed at verylate times. by 8515-9200 days after the explosion, 0.6--0.8\,m$_\odot$ of dustis present, and dust grains with radii greater than 2\,$\mu$m are required toobtain a fit to the observed sed. this suggests that the dust mass increase atlate times was caused by accretion onto and coagulation of the dust grainsformed at earlier epochs.  these findings provide further confirmation that core collapse supernovae cancreate large quantities of dust, and indicate that the reason for small dustmasses being estimated in many cases is that the vast majority of the dustforms long after most supernovae have been detectable at mid-infraredwavelengths.

1411.7381	a stubbornly large mass of cold dust in the ejecta of supernova 1987a	we present new herschel photometric and spectroscopic observations ofsupernova 1987a, carried out in 2012. our dedicated photometric measurementsprovide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 microncompared to previous observations in 2010. our herschel spectra show only weakco line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [o i] line flux,eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previouslyestimated dust mass. the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) iswell fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. the newly measured 70 micronflux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a singletemperature. the far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 msun ofamorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosyntheticmass prediction for carbon. the observation of sio molecules at early and latephases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the sedwith a combination of 0.3 msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 msun of silicates,totalling 0.8 msun of dust. our analysis thus supports the presence of a largedust reservoir in the ejecta of sn 1987a. the inferred dust mass suggests thatsupernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, fromlocal to high-redshift galaxies.

1505.04499	spitzer infrared spectrographic point source classification in the small  magellanic cloud	the magellanic clouds are uniquely placed to study the stellar contributionto dust emission. individual stars can be resolved in these systems even in themid-infrared, and they are close enough to allow detection of infrared excesscaused by dust.we have searched the spitzer space telescope data archive forall infrared spectrograph (irs) staring-mode observations of the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) and found that 209 infrared array camera (irac) pointsources within the footprint of the surveying the agents of galaxy evolution inthe small magellanic cloud (sage-smc) spitzer legacy programme were targeted,within a total of 311 staring mode observations. we classify these pointsources using a decision tree method of object classification, based oninfrared spectral features, continuum and spectral energy distribution shape,bolometric luminosity, cluster membership and variability information. we find58 asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars, 51 young stellar objects (ysos), 4post-agb objects, 22 red supergiants (rsgs), 27 stars (of which 23 are dusty obstars), 24 planetary nebulae (pne), 10wolf-rayet (wr) stars, 3 hii regions, 3 rcoronae borealis (r crb) stars, 1 blue supergiant and 6 other objects,including 2 foreground agb stars. we use these classifications to evaluate thesuccess of photometric classification methods reported in the literature.

1505.05750	herschel observations of extreme oh/ir stars - the isotopic ratios of  oxygen as a sign-post for the stellar mass	aim: the late stages of stellar evolution are mainly governed by the mass ofthe stars. low- and intermediate-mass stars lose copious amounts of mass duringthe asymptotic giant branch (agb) which obscure the central star making itdifficult to study the stellar spectra and determine the stellar mass. in thisstudy, we present observational data that can be used to determine lower limitsto the stellar mass. method: spectra of nine heavily reddened agb stars takenby the herschel space observatory display numerous molecular emission lines.the strongest emission lines are due to h2o. we search for the presence ofisotopologues of h2o in these objects. result: we detected the 16o and 17oisotopologues of water in these stars, but lines due to h2^{18}o are absent.the lack of 18o is predicted by a scenario where the star has undergonehot-bottom burning which preferentially destroys 18o relative to 16o and 17o.from stellar evolution calculations, this process is thought to occur when thestellar mass is above 5 msun for solar metallicity. hence, observations ofdifferent isotopologues of h2o can be used to help determine the lower limit tothe initial stellar mass. conclusion: from our observations, we deduce thatthese extreme oh/ir stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses of &gt;= 5 msun.their high mass-loss rates of ~ 1.0e-4 msun/yr may affect the enrichment of theinterstellar medium and the overall chemical evolution of our galaxy.

astro-ph;0006009	infrared properties of sio maser sources in late-type stars	results of an sio maser survey for the late-type stars selected by the irts(infrared telescope in space) are presented. we have detected sio j=1-0, v=1and/or v=2 lines in 27 stars out of 59 stars. the maser intensity increaseswith the depth of the h2o absorption in the infrared spectra and redness of the2.2 and 12 micron color. the column densities of the water vapor in the targetstars are estimated from the depth of the water absorption in the irts spectra.we found that the sio maser was detected mostly in the stars with the columndensity of water vapor higher than 3x10^19-3x10^20 cm^-2. we further estimatethe density of hydrogen molecules in the outer atmosphere corresponding tothese column densities, obtaining 10^9 - 10^10 cm^-3 as a lower limit. thesevalues are roughly in agreement with the critical hydrogen density predicted bymodels for the excitation of the sio masers. it is possible that the sio masersare excited in clumps with even higher than this density. the present resultsprovide useful information on the understanding of the physical conditions ofthe outer atmospheres in late-type stars.

astro-ph;0201084	the time variation in infrared water-vapour bands in mira variables	the time variation in the water-vapour bands in oxygen-rich mira variableshas been investigated using multi-epoch iso/sws spectra of four mira variablesin the 2.5-4.0 micron region. all four stars show h2o bands in absorptionaround minimum in the visual light curve. at maximum, h2o emission featuresappear in the ~3.5-4.0 micronm region, while the features at shorterwavelengths remain in absorption. these h2o bands in the 2.5-4.0 micron regionoriginate from the extended atmosphere.  the analysis has been carried out with a disk shape, slab geometry model. theobserved h2o bands are reproduced by two layers; a `hot' layer with anexcitation temperature of 2000 k and a `cool' layer with an excitationtemperature of 1000-1400 k. the radii of the `hot' layer (r_hot) are ~1 r_* atvisual minimum and 2 r_* at maximum, where r_* is a radius of background sourceof the model. the time variation of r_hot/r_* from 1 to 2 is attributed to theactual variation in the radius of the h2o layer. a high h2o density shelloccurs near the surface of the star around minimum, and moves out with thestellar pulsation. this shell gradually fades away after maximum, and a newhigh h2o density shell is formed in the inner region again at the next minimum.due to large optical depth of h2o, the near-infrared variability is dominatedby the h2o layer, and the l'-band flux correlates with the area of the h2oshell. the infrared molecular bands trace the structure of the extendedatmosphere and impose appreciable effects on near-infrared light curve of miravariables.

astro-ph;0203234	the extended atmosphere and evolution of the rv tau star r scuti	we analyze iso/sws spectra of the rv tau star r scuti. the infrared spectraare dominated by h2o emission bands. the near- and mid-infrared excess isattributed to h2o; the dust contribution is less important. we also identifyco, sio and co2 bands. the various molecular emission bands originate from anextended atmosphere, an atmosphere above the photosphere. the extendedatmosphere of r sct is formed from matter which gradually have lifted up fromthe photosphere through the pulsations of the star.  in contrast to the abundant molecules around the star, the silicate dustfeature is weak and the dust mass-loss rate is only 10^{-11} solar mass peryear. this implies that there might be a process to inhibit dust formation frommolecules.  rv tau stars are commonly considered as post-agb stars. while a detached dustenvelope around r sct is consistent with such an interpretation, we show thatits period evolution is slower than expected. we argue that r sct may be athermal-pulsing agb star, observed in a helium-burning phase.

astro-ph;0302164	the mineralogy, geometry and mass-loss history of iras 16342-3814	we present the 2-200 um infrared space observatory (iso) spectrum and 3.8-20um isaac and timmi2 images of the extreme oh/ir star iras 16342-3814. amorphoussilicate absorption features are seen, together with crystalline silicateabsorption features up to almost 45 um. no other oh/ir star is known to havecrystalline silicate features in absorption up to these wavelengths. thissuggests that iras 16342-3814 must have, or recently had, an extremely highmass-loss rate. preliminary radiative transfer calculations suggest that themass-loss rate may be as large as 10^{-3} msun/yr. the 3.8 um isaac image showsa bipolar reflection nebula with a dark equatorial waist or torus, similar tothat seen in optical hubble space telescope (hst) images. the position angle ofthe nebula decreases significantly with increasing wavelength, suggesting thatthe dominant source of emission changes from scattering to thermal emission.still, even up to 20 um the nebula is oriented approximately along the majoraxis of the nebula seen in the hst and isaac images, suggesting that the torusmust be very cold, in agreement with the very red iso spectrum. the 20 um imageshows a roughly spherically symmetric extended halo, approximately 6'' indiameter, which is probably due to a previous phase of mass-loss on the agb,suggesting a transition from a (more) spherically symmetric to a (more) axialsymmetric form of mass-loss at the end of the agb. we estimate the maximum dustparticle sizes in the torus and in the reflection nebula to be 1.3 and 0.09 umrespectively. the size of the particles in the torus is large compared totypical ism values, but in agreement with high mass-loss rate objects like afgl4106 and hd161796. we discuss the possible reason for the difference inparticle size between the torus and the reflection nebula.

astro-ph;0501247	three-micron spectra of agb stars and supergiants in nearby galaxies	the dependence of stellar molecular bands on the metallicity is studied usinginfrared l-band spectra of agb stars (both carbon-rich and oxygen-rich) andm-type supergiants in the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc) andin the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the spectra cover sio bands foroxygen-rich stars, and acetylene (c2h2), ch and hcn bands for carbon-rich agbstars. the equivalent width of acetylene is found to be high even at lowmetallicity. the high c2h2 abundance can be explained with a highcarbon-to-oxygen (c/o) ratio for lower metallicity carbon stars. in contrast,the hcn equivalent width is low: fewer than half of the extra-galactic carbonstars show the 3.5micron hcn band, and only a few lmc stars show high hcnequivalent width. hcn abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbonelemental abundances. the amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initialmass, and stars with high luminosity (i.e. high initial mass) could have a highhcn abundance. ch bands are found in both the extra-galactic and galacticcarbon stars. none of the oxygen-rich lmc stars show sio bands, except onepossible detection in a low quality spectrum. the limits on the equivalentwidths of the sio bands are below the expectation of up to 30angstrom for lmcmetallicity. several possible explanations are discussed. the observationsimply that lmc and smc carbon stars could reach mass-loss rates as high astheir galactic counterparts, because there are more carbon atoms available andmore carbonaceous dust can be formed. on the other hand, the lack of siosuggests less dust and lower mass-loss rates in low-metallicity oxygen-richstars. the effect on the ism dust enrichment is discussed.

astro-ph;0507641	the symmetric dust shell and the central star of the bipolar planetary  nebula ngc 6537	we present high-resolution images of the strongly bipolar planetary nebulangc 6537, obtained with hubble space telescope and with the infrared adaptiveoptics system on the very large telescope. the central star is detected for thefirst time. using the multi-band photometry and constraints from the dynamicalage of the nebula, we derive a temperature in the range 1.5-2.5 10^5 k, aluminosity~10^3 l_sun and a core mass m_c~0.7-0.9 m_sun. the progenitor mass isprobably in the range m_i = 3-7 m_sun. the extinction map shows a largelysymmetric, and compact dust structure, which is most likely a shell, located atthe neck of the bipolar flow, only 4 arcsec from the star. the dust shelltraces a short-lived phase of very high mass loss at the end of the agb. thedynamical age of the shell and bipolar lobes are very similar but themorphologies are very different. the data suggests that the mass loss duringthe ejection of the compact shell was largely spherically symmetric, and thepronounced bipolarity formed afterwards. the dynamical ages of the bipolarlobes and dust shell are similar, which is consistent with suggestions thatbipolar structures form in a run-away event at the very last stages of the agbmass loss. the inner edge of the dust shell is ionized, and pah emission isseen just outside the ionized gas. we associate the pah emission with thephoto-dissociation region of the molecular shell.

astro-ph;0603607	mid-infrared spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we have observed a sample of 36 objects in the small magellanic cloud (smc)with the infrared spectrometer on the spitzer space telescope. nineteen ofthese sources are carbon stars. an examination of the near- and mid-infraredphotometry shows that the carbon-rich and oxygen-rich dust sources follow twoeasily separated sequences. a comparison of the spectra of the 19 carbon starsin the smc to spectra from the infrared space observatory (iso) of carbon starsin the galaxy reveals significant differences. the absorption bands at 7.5 umand 13.7 um due to c2h2 are stronger in the smc sample, and the sic dustemission feature at 11.3 um is weaker. our measurements of the mgs dustemission feature at 26-30 um are less conclusive, but this feature appears tobe weaker in the smc sample as well. all of these results are consistent withthe lower metallicity in the smc. the lower abundance of sic grains in the smcmay result in less efficient carbon-rich dust production, which could explainthe excess c2h2 gas seen in the spectra. the sources in the smc with thestrongest sic dust emission tend to have redder infrared colors than the othersources in the sample, which implies more amorphous carbon, and they also tendto show stronger mgs dust emission. the weakest sic emission features tend tobe shifted to the blue; these spectra may arise from low-density shells withlarge sic grains.

astro-ph;0606296	spitzer observations of acetylene bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the  large magellanic cloud	we investigate the molecular bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on board thespitzer space telescope (sst) over the 5--38 micron range. all 26low-resolution spectra show acetylene (c2h2) bands at 7 and 14 micron. thehydrogen cyanide (hcn) bands at these wavelengths are very weak or absent. thisis consistent with low nitrogen abundances in the lmc. the observed 14 micronc2h2 band is reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 k. thereis no clear dilution of the 14 micron band by circumstellar dust emission. this14 micron band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope inthese high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous findings forgalactic stars. the c2h2,column density, derived from the 13.7 micron band,shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3x10^-6 to 5x10^{-5} msun yr-1. this iscomparable with the total mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from thespectral energy distribution. additionally, we compare the line strengths ofthe 13.7 micron c2h2 band of our lmc sample with those of a galactic sample.despite the low metallicity of the lmc, there is no clear difference in thec2h2 abundance among lmc and galactic stars. this reflects the effect of the3rd dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to high c/oratios at low metallicity.

0809.2853	an akari search for intracluster dust of globular clusters	we report the observations of 12 globular clusters with the akari/fis. ourgoal is to search for emission from the cold dust within clusters. we detectdiffuse emissions toward ngc 6402 and 2808, but the iras 100-micron maps showthe presence of strong background radiation. they are likely emitted from thegalactic cirrus, while we cannot rule out the possible association of a bump ofemission with the cluster in the case of ngc 6402. we also detect 28 point-likesources mainly in the wide-s images (90 micron). at least several of them arenot associated with the clusters but background galaxies based on some externalcatalogs. we present the seds by combining the near-and-mid infrared dataobtained with the irc if possible. the seds suggest that most of the pointsources are background galaxies. we find one candidate of the intracluster dustwhich has no mid-infrared counterpart unlike the other point-like sources,although some features such as its point-like appearance should be explainedbefore we conclude its intracluster origin. for most of the other clusters, wehave confirmed the lack of the intracluster dust. we evaluate upper limits ofthe intracluster dust mass to be between 1.0e-05 and 1.0e-03 solar massdepending on the dust temperature. the lifetime of the intracluster dustinferred from the upper limits is shorter than 5 myr (t=70k) or 50 myr (35k).such short lifetime indicates some mechanism(s) are at work to remove theintracluster dust. we also discuss its impact on the chemical evolution ofglobular clusters.
