0901.0792	serendipity observations of far infrared cirrus emission in the spitzer  infrared nearby galaxies survey: analysis of far-infrared correlations	we present an analysis of far-infrared dust emission from diffuse cirrusclouds. this study is based on serendipitous observations at 160 microns athigh galactic latitude with the multiband imaging photometer (mips) onboard thespitzer space telescope by the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings).these observations are complemented with iris data at 100 and 60 microns andconstitute one of the most sensitive and unbiased samples of far infraredobservations at small scale of diffuse interstellar clouds. outside regionsdominated by the cosmic infrared background fluctuations, we observe asubstantial scatter in the 160/100 colors from cirrus emission. we compared the160/100 color variations to 60/100 colors in the same fields and find a trendof decreasing 60/100 with increasing 160/100. this trend can not be accountedfor by current dust models by changing solely the interstellar radiation field.it requires a significant change of dust properties such as grain sizedistribution or emissivity or a mixing of clouds in different physicalconditions along the line of sight. these variations are important as apotential confusing foreground for extragalactic studies.

0903.1272	a complete view of galaxy evolution: panchromatic luminosity functions  and the generation of metals	when and how did galaxies form and their metals accumulate? over the lastdecade, this has moved from an archeological question to a live investigation:there is now a broad picture of the evolution of galaxies in dark matter halos:their masses, stars, metals and supermassive blackholes. galaxies have beenfound and studied in which these formation processes are taking place mostvigorously, all the way back in cosmic time to when the intergalactic medium(igm) was still largely neutral. however, the details of how and why theinterstellar medium (ism) in distant galaxies cools, is processed, recycled andenriched in metals by stars, and fuels active galactic nuclei (agns) remainuncertain. in particular, the cooling of gas to fuel star formation, and thechemistry and physics of the most intensely active regions is hidden from viewat optical wavelengths, but can be seen and diagnosed at mid- &amp; far-infrared(ir) wavelengths. rest-frame ir observations are important first to identifythe most luminous, interesting and important galaxies, secondly to quantifyaccurately their total luminosity, and finally to use spectroscopy to trace theconditions in the molecular and atomic gas out of which stars form. in order tomap out these processes over the full range of environments and large-scalestructures found in the universe - from the densest clusters of galaxies to theemptiest voids - we require tools for deep, large area surveys, of millions ofgalaxies out to z~5, and for detailed follow-up spectroscopy. the necessarytools can be realized technically. here, we outline the requirements forgathering the crucial information to build, validate and challenge models ofgalaxy evolution.

0706.3501	the incidence of highly-obscured star-forming regions in sings galaxies	using the new capabilities of the spitzer space telescope and extensivemultiwavelength data from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings),it is now possible to study the infrared properties of star formation in nearbygalaxies down to scales equivalent to large hii regions. we are therefore ableto determine what fraction of large, infrared-selected star-forming regions innormal galaxies are highly obscured and address how much of the star formationwe miss by relying solely on the optical portion of the spectrum. employing anew empirical method for deriving attenuations of infrared-selectedstar-forming regions we investigate the statistics of obscured star formationon 500pc scales in a sample of 38 nearby galaxies. we find that the medianattenuation is 1.4 magnitudes in h-alpha and that there is no evidence for asubstantial sub-population of uniformly highly-obscured star-forming regions.the regions in the highly-obscured tail of the attenuation distribution(a_h-alpha &gt; 3) make up only ~4% of the sample of nearly 1800 regions, thoughvery embedded infrared sources on the much smaller scales and lowerluminosities of compact and ultracompact hii regions are almost certainlypresent in greater numbers. the highly-obscured cases in our sample aregenerally the bright, central regions of galaxies with high overall attenuationbut are not otherwise remarkable. we also find that a majority of the galaxiesshow decreasing radial trends in h-alpha attenuation. the small fraction ofhighly-obscured regions seen in this sample of normal, star-forming galaxiessuggests that on 500pc scales the timescale for significant dispersal or breakup of nearby, optically-thick dust clouds is short relative to the lifetime ofa typical star-forming region.

1103.3711	extended schmidt law: role of existing stars in current star formation	we propose an "extended schmidt law" with explicit dependence of the starformation efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) on the stellar mass surface density. thisrelation has a power-law index of 0.48+-0.04 and an 1-sigma observed scatter onthe sfe of 0.4 dex, which holds over 5 orders of magnitude in the stellardensity for individual global galaxies including various types especially thelow-surface-brightness (lsb) galaxies that deviate significantly from thekennicutt-schmidt law. when applying it to regions at sub-kpc resolution of asample of 12 spiral galaxies, the extended schmidt law not only holds for lsbregions but also shows significantly smaller scatters both within and acrossgalaxies compared to the kennicutt-schmidt law. we argue that this new relationpoints to the role of existing stars in regulating the sfe, thus encodingbetter the star formation physics. comparison with physical models of starformation recipes shows that the extended schmidt law can be reproduced by somemodels including gas free-fall in a stellar-gravitational potential andpressure-supported star formation. by implementing this new law into theanalytic model of gas accretion in lambda cdm, we show that it can re-producethe observed main sequence of star-forming galaxies (a relation between the sfrand stellar mass) from z=0 up to z=2.

1202.4699	the lesser role of shear in star formation: insight from the galactic  ring survey	we analyse the role played by shear in regulating star formation in thegalaxy on the scale of individual molecular clouds. the clouds are selectedfrom the 13^co j=1-0 line of the galactic ring survey. for each cloud, weestimate the shear parameter which describes the ability of densityperturbations to grow within the cloud. we find that for almost all molecularclouds considered, there is no evidence that shear is playing a significantrole in opposing the effects of self-gravity. we also find that the shearparameter of the clouds does not depend on their position in the galaxy.furthermore, we find no correlations between the shear parameter of the cloudswith several indicators of their star formation activity. no significantcorrelation is found between the shear parameter and the star formationefficiency of the clouds which is measured using the ratio of the massive youngstellar objects luminosities, measured in the red msx survey, to the cloudmass. there are also no significant correlations between the shear parameterand the fraction of their mass that is found in denser clumps which is a proxyfor their clump formation efficiency, nor with their level of fragmentationexpressed in the number of clumps per unit mass. our results strongly suggestthat shear is playing only a minor role in affecting the rates and efficienciesat which molecular clouds convert their gas into dense cores and thereafterinto stars.

1401.6223	the search for shock-excited h2 in virgo spirals experiencing ram  pressure stripping	we investigate the presence of shock-excited h2 in four virgo clustergalaxies that show clear evidence of ongoing ram pressure stripping.mid-infrared (mir) spectral mapping of the rotational h2 emission lines wereperformed using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on board the spitzer spacetelescope. we target four regions along the leading side of galaxies where theintracluster medium (icm) appears to be pushing back the individual galaxy'sinterstellar medium (ism). for comparison purposes, we also study two regionson the trailing side of these galaxies, a region within an edge-on disk and anextraplanar star-forming region. we find a factor of 2.6 excess of warm h2/pahin our sample relative to the observed fractions in other nearby galaxies. weattribute the h2/pah excess to contributions of shock-excited h2 which islikely to have been triggered by ongoing ram pressure interaction in our samplegalaxies. ram pressure driven shocks may also be responsible for the elevatedfractions of [feii/neii] found in our sample.

1410.5504	inefficient star formation in extremely metal poor galaxies	the first galaxies contain stars born out of gas with little or no metals.the lack of metals is expected to inhibit efficient gas cooling and starformation but this effect has yet to be observed in galaxies with oxygenabundance relative to hydrogen below a tenth of that of the sun. extremelymetal poor nearby galaxies may be our best local laboratories for studying indetail the conditions that prevailed in low metallicity galaxies at earlyepochs. carbon monoxide (co) emission is unreliable as tracers of gas at lowmetallicities, and while dust has been used to trace gas in low-metallicitygalaxies, low-spatial resolution in the far-infrared has typically led to largeuncertainties. here we report spatially-resolved infrared observations of twogalaxies with oxygen abundances below 10 per cent solar, and show that starsform very inefficiently in seven star-forming clumps of these galaxies. thestar formation efficiencies are more than ten times lower than found in normal,metal rich galaxies today, suggesting that star formation may have been veryinefficient in the early universe.

1411.1065	early science with the large millimeter telescope: exploring the effect  of agn activity on the relationships between molecular gas, dust, and star  formation	the molecular gas, h$_2$, that fuels star formation in galaxies is difficultto observe directly. as such, the ratio of $l_{\rm ir}$ to $l^\prime_{\rm co}$is an observational estimation of the star formation rate compared with theamount of molecular gas available to form stars, which is related to the starformation efficiency and the inverse of the gas consumption timescale. we testwhat effect an ir luminous agn has on the ratio $l_{\rm ir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$in a sample of 24 intermediate redshift galaxies from the 5 mjy unbiasedspitzer extragalactic survey (5muses). we obtain new co(1-0) observations withthe redshift search receiver on the large millimeter telescope. we diagnose thepresence and strength of an agn using spitzer irs spectroscopy. we find thatremoving the agn contribution to $l_{\rm ir}^{\rm tot}$ results in a mean$l_{\rm ir}^{\rm sf}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$ for our entire sample consistent withthe mean $l_{\rm ir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$ derived for a large sample of starforming galaxies from $z\sim0-3$. we also include in our comparison therelative amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission for our sample anda literature sample of local and high redshift ultra luminous infrared galaxiesand find a consistent trend between $l_{6.2}/l_{\rm ir}^{\rm sf}$ and $l_{\rmir}^{\rm sf}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$, such that small dust grain emission decreaseswith increasing $l_{\rm ir}^{\rm sf}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$ for both local and highredshift dusty galaxies.

1504.04041	asteroid lightcurves from the palomar transient factory survey: rotation  periods and phase functions from sparse photometry	we fit 54,296 sparsely-sampled asteroid lightcurves in the palomar transientfactory to a combined rotation plus phase-function model. each lightcurveconsists of 20+ observations acquired in a single opposition. using 805asteroids in our sample that have reference periods in the literature, we findthe reliability of our fitted periods is a complicated function of the period,amplitude, apparent magnitude and other attributes. using the 805-asteroidground-truth sample, we train an automated classifier to estimate (along withmanual inspection) the validity of the remaining 53,000 fitted periods. by thismethod we find 9,033 of our lightcurves (of 8,300 unique asteroids) havereliable periods. subsequent consideration of asteroids with multiplelightcurve fits indicate 4% contamination in these reliable periods. for 3,902lightcurves with sufficient phase-angle coverage and either a reliably-fitperiod or low amplitude, we examine the distribution of several phase-functionparameters, none of which are bimodal though all correlate with the bond albedoand with visible-band colors. comparing the theoretical maximal spin rate of afluid body with our amplitude versus spin-rate distribution suggests that, ifheld together only by self-gravity, most asteroids are in general less densethan 2 g/cm$^3$, while c types have a lower limit of between 1 and 2 g/cm$^3$,in agreement with previous density estimates. for 5-20km diameters, s typesrotate faster and have lower amplitudes than c types. if both populations sharethe same angular momentum, this may indicate the two types' differing abilityto deform under rotational stress. lastly, we compare our absolute magnitudesand apparent-magnitude residuals to those of the minor planet center's nominal$g=0.15$, rotation-neglecting model; our phase-function plus fourier-seriesfitting reduces asteroid photometric rms scatter by a factor of 3.

1510.08070	an excess of mid-infrared emission from the type iax sn 2014dt	supernovae type iax (sne iax) are less energetic and less luminous thantypical thermonuclear explosions. a suggested explanation for the observedcharacteristics of this subclass is a binary progenitor system consisting of aco white dwarf primary accreting from a helium star companion. asingle-degenerate explosion channel might be expected to result in a densecircumstellar medium (csm), although no evidence for such a csm has yet beenobserved for this subclass. here we present recent spitzer observations of thesn iax 2014dt obtained by the spirits program nearly one year post-explosionthat reveal a strong mid-ir excess over the expected fluxes of more normal sneia. this excess is consistent with 1e-5 m_solar of newly formed dust, whichwould be the first time that newly formed dust has been observed to form in anormal type ia. the excess, however, is also consistent with a dusty csm thatwas likely formed in pre-explosion mass-loss, thereby suggesting a singledegenerate progenitor system. compared to other sne ia that show significantshock interaction (sne ia-csm) and interacting core-collapse events (sne iin),this dust shell in sn 2014dt is less massive. we consider the implications thatsuch a pre-existing dust shell has for the progenitor system, including abinary system with a mass donor that is a red giant, a red supergiant, and anasymptotic giant branch star.

astro-ph;0010377	evidence for the heating of atomic interstellar gas by pahs	we report a strong correlation between the [cii] 158 micron cooling line andthe mid-infrared flux in the 5-10 micron range in a wide variety ofstar-forming galaxies. the mid-infrared flux is dominated by aromatic featureemission (afe), which is thought to arise from large polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon molecules or `pahs' and generally associated with the smallestinterstellar grains. the [cii] line is the dominant gas coolant in most regionsof atomic interstellar gas, and therefore reflects the heating input to thegas. the ratio of these two quantities, [cii]/afe, remains nearly constant withthe ratio of the iras 60 micron band flux to the 100 micron band flux,r(60/100). this is in contrast to the drop in the [cii]/fir ratio withincreasing r(60/100), which signal higher dust temperatures and more intenseradiation fields. we interpret the stable [cii]/afe ratio as evidence that gasheating is dominated by the pahs or small grains which are also afe carriersover a wide range of conditions. the trend of decreasing [cii]/fir withincreasing radiation field suggests a decrease in the importance of pahs orsmall grains relative to large grains both in gas heating and in dust cooling.we summarize the observed trends and suggest two plausible scenarios.

astro-ph;0205085	the infrared spectral energy distribution of normal star-forming  galaxies: calibration at far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths	new far-infrared and submillimeter data are used to solidify and to extend tolong wavelengths the empirical calibration of the infrared spectral energydistribution (sed) of normal star-forming galaxies. as was found by dale et al.(2001), a single parameter family, characterized by f_nu(60 microns)/f_nu(100microns), is adequate to describe the range of normal galaxy spectral energydistributions observed by iras and iso from 3 to 100 microns. however,predictions based on the first generation models at longer wavelengths (122 to850 microns) are increasingly overluminous compared to the data for smallerf_nu(60 microns)/f_nu(100 microns), or alternatively, for weaker globalinterstellar radiation fields. after slightly modifying thefar-infrared/submillimeter dust emissivity in those models as a function of theradiation field intensity to better match the long wavelength data, a suite ofseds from 3 microns to 20 cm in wavelength is presented. results from relevantapplications are also discussed, including submillimeter-based photometricredshift indicators, the infrared energy budget and simple formulae forrecovering the bolometric infrared luminosity, and dust mass estimates ingalaxies. regarding the latter, since galaxy infrared seds are notwell-described by single blackbody curves, the usual methods of estimating dustmasses can be grossly inadequate. the improved model presented herein is usedto provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.

astro-ph;0509145	van der kruit to spitzer: a new look at the fir-radio correlation	we present an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlation within thestar-forming disks of four nearby, nearly face-on galaxies (ngc~2403, ngc~3031,ngc~5194, and ngc~6946). using {\it spitzer} mips imaging and wsrt radiocontinuum data, we are able to probe variations in the logarithmic70~$\mu$m/22~cm ($q_{70}$) flux density ratios across each disk at sub-kpcscales. we find general trends of decreasing $q_{70}$ with declining surfacebrightness and with increasing radius. we also find that the dispersion in$q_{70}$ within galaxies is comparable to what is measured {\it globally} amonggalaxies at around 0.2 dex. we have also performed preliminary phenomenologicalmodeling of cosmic ray electron (cr$e^{-}$) diffusion using an image-smearingtechnique, and find that smoothing the infrared maps improves their correlationwith the radio maps. the best fit smoothing kernels for the two less activestar-forming galaxies (ngc~2403 and ngc~3031) have much larger scale-lengthsthan that of the more active star-forming galaxies (ngc~5194 and ngc~6946).this difference may be due to the relative deficit of recent cr$e^{-}$injection into the interstellar medium (ism) for the galaxies having largelyquiescent disks.

astro-ph;0604604	warm dust and spatially variable pah emission in the dwarf starburst  galaxy ngc 1705	we present spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705obtained as part of sings. the galaxy morphology is very different shortwardand longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying redstellar population, with the central super star cluster (ssc) dominating theluminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from twooff-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the ssc. these regions show littleextinction at optical wavelengths. the galaxy has a relatively low global dustmass (~2e5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 timeslower than the milky way average). the off-nuclear dust emission appears to bepowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for theexcitation of the observed h alpha emission; these photons are unassociatedwith the ssc (though a contribution from embedded sources to the ir luminosityof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). low-resolution irsspectroscopy shows moderate-strength pah emission in the 11.3 micron band inthe eastern peak; no pah emission is detected in the ssc or the western dustemission complex. there is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scalingand subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable pah emissionstrengths revealed by the irs data suggest caution in the interpretation ofdiffuse 8 micron emission as arising from pah carriers alone. the metallicityof ngc 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by engelbracht andcollaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatiallyvariable pah emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8micron emission. a radio continuum non-detection, ngc 1705 deviatessignificantly from the canonical far-ir vs. radio correlation.

astro-ph;0607669	the spectral energy distribution of dust emission in the edge-on spiral  galaxy ngc 4631 as seen with spitzer and jcmt	we explore the nature of variations in dust emission within an individualgalaxy using 3.6 - 160 micron spitzer space telescope observations and 450 and850 micron james clerk maxwell telescope observations of the edge-on sd spiralgalaxy ngc 4631 with the goals of understanding the relation between polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pah) and dust emission, studying the variations in thecolors of the dust emission, and searching for possible excess submillimeteremission compared to what is anticipated based on dust models applied to themid- and far-infrared data. pah emission at 8 micron is found to correlate bestwith hot dust emission at 24 micron on kiloparsec scales, although the relationbreaks down on scales equal to hundreds of parsecs, possibly because ofdifferences in the mean free paths between the photons that excite the pahs andheat the dust and possibly because the pahs are destroyed by the hard radiationfields in the centers of some star formation regions. the ratio of 8 micron pahemission to 160 micron cool dust emission appears to be a function of radius.the 70/160 and 160/450 micron flux density ratios are remarkably constant eventhough the surface brightness varies by a factor of 25 in each wave band, whichsuggests that the emission is from dust heated by a nearly-uniform radiationfield. globally, we find an excess of 850 micron emission relative to whatwould be predicted by dust models. the 850 micron excess is highest in regionswith low 160 micron surface brightness, although the strength and statisticalsignificance of this result depends on the model fit to the data. we rule outvariable emissivity functions or ~4 k dust as the possible origins of this 850micron emission, but we do discuss the other possible mechanisms that couldproduce the emission.

astro-ph;0608249	the nature of infrared emission in the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822  as revealed by spitzer	we present spitzer imaging of the metal-deficient (z ~30% z_sun) local groupdwarf galaxy ngc 6822. on spatial scales of ~130 pc, we study the nature of ir,h alpha, hi, and radio continuum emission. nebular emission strength correlateswith ir surface brightness; however, roughly half of the ir emission isassociated with diffuse regions not luminous at h alpha (as found in previousstudies). the global ratio of dust to hi gas in the ism, while uncertain at thefactor of ~2 level, is ~25 times lower than the global values derived forspiral galaxies using similar modeling techniques; localized ratios of dust tohi gas are about a factor of five higher than the global value in ngc 6822.there are strong variations (factors of ~10) in the relative ratios of h alphaand ir flux throughout the central disk; the low dust content of ngc 6822 islikely responsible for the different h alpha/ir ratios compared to those foundin more metal-rich environments. the h alpha and ir emission is associated withhigh-column density (&gt; ~1e21 cm^-2) neutral gas. increases in ir surfacebrightness appear to be affected by both increased radiation field strength andincreased local gas density. individual regions and the galaxy as a whole fallwithin the observed scatter of recent high-resolution studies of the radio-farir correlation in nearby spiral galaxies; this is likely the result of depletedradio and far-ir emission strengths in the ism of this dwarf galaxy.

astro-ph;0608684	probing cool and warm infrared galaxies using photometric and structural  measures	we have analyzed a sample of nearby cool and warm infrared (ir) galaxiesusing photometric and structural parameters. the set of measures includefar-infrared color ($c = \log_{10}[s_{60\mu m}/s_{100\mu m}]$), total irluminosity ($l_{tir}$), radio surface brightness as well as radio,near-infrared, and optical sizes. in a given luminosity range cool and warmgalaxies are considered as those sources that are found approximately $1\sigma$ below and above the mean color in the far-infrared $c - l_{tir}$diagram. we find that galaxy radio surface brightness is well correlated withcolor whereas size is less well correlated with color. our analysis indicatesthat ir galaxies that are dominated by cool dust are large, massive spiralsthat are not strongly interacting or merging and presumably the ones with theleast active star formation. dust in these cool objects is less centrallyconcentrated than in the more typical luminous and ultra-luminous ir galaxiesthat are dominated by warm dust. our study also shows that low luminosity earlytype unbarred and transitional spirals are responsible for the large scatter inthe $c - l_{tir}$ diagram. among highly luminous galaxies, late type unbarredspirals are predominately warm, and early type unbarred and barred aresystematically cooler. we highlight the significance of $c - l_{tir}$ diagramin terms of local and high redshifts sub-millimeter galaxies.

astro-ph;0612297	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared luminous galaxies at z~2  i: the spectra	we present the mid-infrared (mir) spectra obtained with the spitzer infraredspectrograph (irs) for a sample of 52 sources, selected as infrared luminous,z&gt;1 candidates in the extragalactic first look survey (xfls). the sampleselection criteria are f(24um) &gt; 0.9mjy, nu fnu(24um)/nu fnu(8um) &gt; 3.16 and nufnu(24um)/nu fnu(0.7um) &gt; 10. of the 52 spectra, 47 (90%) produced measurableredshifts based solely on the mid-ir spectral features, with the majority(35/47=74%) at 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.2. keck spectroscopy of a sub-sample (17/47) agrees withthe mid-ir redshift measurements. the observed spectra fall crudely into threecategories -- (1) 33% (17/52) have strong pah emission, and are probablypowered by star formation with total ir luminosity roughly a factor of 5 higherthan the local starburst ulirgs. (2) 33% (17/52) have only deep silicateabsorption at 9.8um, indicative of deeply embedded dusty systems. the energeticnature of the heating sources in these systems can not be determined by thesedata alone. (3) the remainder 34% are mid-ir continuum dominated systems witheither weak pah emission and/or silicate absorption. this third of the sampleare probably agns. from the silicate absorption feature, we estimate thatroughly two-thirds of the sample have optical depth tau(9.8um) &gt; 1. their$l_{1600\aa}$ and $l_{\rm ir}$ suggest that our sample is among the mostluminous and most dust enshrouded systems of its epoch . our study has revealeda significant population of dust enshrouded galaxies at z~2, whose enormousenergy output, comparable to that of quasars, is generated by agn as well asstarburst. this ir luminous population has very little overlap with sub-mm anduv-selected populations (abridged).

astro-ph;9507089	high resolution iras maps and ir emission of m31 --- i. morphology and  sources	the morphology of the ir emission and the properties of discrete fir sourcesin m31 disk are studied using the hires maps from iras. very thin and brightfir arm segments are shown in these maps, which have similar structure as thehi gas but with much enhanced arm/inter-arm contrast, typically a factor of 5on the 60$\mu$m image. we identify 39 unconfused sources (excluding thenucleus) and 14 confused sources (7 pairs) at 60 $\mu$m by direct gaussianfittings to the image. iras colors of 10 bright isolated sources are studied,which are presumably representative of the discrete sources in general. thecolors follow the well known anticorrelation between the 60micron/100micronflux ratio and the 12micron/25micron flux ratio. all sources coincide withoptical hii regions. a comparison with h$\alpha$ observations shows that thetotal luminosity (in the wavelength range 8 --- 1000$\mu$m) associated with hiiregions is $7.2\pm 2.9 \; 10^8$l_sun, namely $30\pm 14$\% of the total iremission of m31. this luminosity translates into a present-day star formationrate of 0.36$\pm 0.14$ m_sun/yr, about an order of magnitude lower than that ofthe milky way galaxy.

astro-ph;9507090	high resolution iras maps and ir emission of m31 --- ii. diffuse  component and interstellar dust	large-scale dust heating and cooling in the diffuse medium of m31 is studiedusing the hires iras maps in conjunction with uv, optical (ubv) and the himaps. a dust heating/cooling model is developed based on a radiative transfermodel which assumes a `sandwich' configuration of dust and stars and takesfully into account the effect of scattering of dust grains. the model isapplied to a complete sample of 'cells' (small areas of size $2'\times 2'$),generated from the above maps. the sample covers the m31 disk in thegalactocentric radius range 2 --- 14 kpc, and includes only the cells for whichthe contribution of the discrete sources to the 60$\mu m$ surface brightness isnegligible ($&lt; 20$\%). this effectively excludes most of the bright arm regionsfrom our analysis. we find that: (1) the mean optical depth (viewed from theinclination angle of 77$^\circ$) increases with radius from $\tau_v\sim 0.7$ atr=2kpc outwards, reaches a peak of ~1.6 near 10kpc, and stays quite flat out to14kpc, where the signal falls below the 5sigma level. (2) a correlation between$\tau_v$ and hi surface density is suggested by the similarity between theirradial profiles. significant differences are found between the radial profilesof the h_2 gas (estimated from co) and of the dust (from $\tau_v$), which aremost probably due to the large uncertainty in the co-to-h_2 conversion factor,and to the under-representation of h_2-rich regions in the sample of cells ofdiffuse regions. (3) the $\tau_v / n(hi)$ ratio decreases with increasingradius in the disk of m31, with an exponential law fit yielding an e-foldingscale length of $9.6\pm 0.4$ kpc. (4) the optical depth adjusted for thisgradient, $\tau_{v,c}$, is strongly and linearly correlated with n(hi) over oneand a half order of magnitude of column density, indicating that at a given

astro-ph;9806194	emission features and source counts of galaxies in mid-infrared	in this work we incorporate the newest iso results on the mid-infraredspectral-energy-distributions (mir seds) of galaxies into models for the numbercounts and redshift distributions of mir surveys. a three-component model, withempirically determined mir sed templates of (1) a cirrus/pdr component (2) astarburst component and (3) an agn component, is developed for infrared(3--120\micron) seds of galaxies. the model includes a complete iras 25\micronselected sample of 1406 local galaxies ($z \leq 0.1$; shupe et al. 1998a).results based on these 1406 spectra show that the mir emission features causesignificant effects on the redshift dependence of the k-corrections for fluxesin the wire 25\micron band and isocam 15\micron band. this in turn will affectdeep counts and redshift distributions in these two bands, as shown by thepredictions of two evolution models (a luminosity evolution model with$l\propto (1+z)^3$ and a density evolution model with $\rho\propto (1+z)^4$).the dips-and-bumps on curves of mir number counts, caused by the emissionfeatures, should be useful indicators of evolution mode. the strong emissionfeatures at $\sim 6$--8\micron will help the detections of relatively highredshift ($z\sim 2$) galaxies in mir surveys. on the other hand, determinationsof the evolutionary rate based on the slope of source counts, and studies onthe large scale structures using the redshift distribution of mir sources, willhave to treat the effects of the mir emission features carefully. we have alsoestimated a 15\micron local luminosity function from the predicted 15\micronfluxes of the 1406 galaxies using the bivariate (15\micron vs. 25\micronluminosities) method. this luminosity function will improve our understandingof the isocam 15\micron surveys.

astro-ph;9908100	towards an understanding of the mid-infrared surface brightness of  normal galaxies	we report a mid-infrared color and surface brightness analysis of ic 10, ngc1313, and ngc 6946, three of the nearby galaxies studied under the infraredspace observatory key project on normal galaxies. images with &lt; 9 arcsecond(170 pc) resolution of these nearly face-on, late-type galaxies were obtainedusing the lw2 (6.75 mu) and lw3 (15 mu) isocam filters. though their globali_nu(6.75 mu)/i_nu(15 mu) flux ratios are similar and typical of normalgalaxies, they show distinct trends of this color ratio with mid-infraredsurface brightness. we find that i_nu(6.75 mu)/i_nu(15 mu) ~&lt; 1 only occurs forregions of intense heating activity where the continuum rises at 15 micron andwhere pah destruction can play an important role. the shape of thecolor-surface brightness trend also appears to depend, to the second-order, onthe hardness of the ionizing radiation. we discuss these findings in thecontext of a two-component model for the phases of the interstellar medium andsuggest that star formation intensity is largely responsible for themid-infrared surface brightness and colors within normal galaxies, whereasdifferences in dust column density are the primary drivers of variations in themid-infrared surface brightness between the disks of normal galaxies.
