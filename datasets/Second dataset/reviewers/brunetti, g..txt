0902.3709	diffuse baryonic matter beyond 2020	the hot, diffuse gas that fills the largest overdense structures in theuniverse -- clusters of galaxies and a web of giant filaments connecting them-- provides us with tools to address a wide array of fundamental astrophysicaland cosmological questions via observations in the x-ray band. clusters aresensitive cosmological probes. to utilize their full potential for precisioncosmology in the following decades, we must precisely understand their physics-- from their cool cores stirred by jets produced by the central supermassiveblack hole (itself fed by inflow of intracluster gas), to their outskirts,where the infall of intergalactic medium (igm) drives shocks and acceleratescosmic rays. beyond the cluster confines lies the virtually unexplored warmigm, believed to contain most of the baryonic matter in the present-dayuniverse. as a depository of all the matter ever ejected from galaxies, itcarries unique information on the history of energy and metal production in theuniverse. currently planned major observatories, such as astro-h and ixo, willmake deep inroads into these areas, but to see the most interesting parts ofthe picture will require an almost science-fiction-grade facility with tens ofm^2 of effective area, subarcsecond angular resolution, a matching imagingcalorimeter and a super high-dispersion spectrograph, such as generation-x.

0905.0588	deep 1.4 ghz follow up of the steep spectrum radio halo in abell 521	in a recent paper we reported on the discovery of a radio halo with verysteep spectrum in the merging galaxy cluster abell 521 through observationswith the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt). we showed that the steepspectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of therelativistic electrons and supports a turbulent acceleration scenario. at thattime, due to the steep spectrum, the available observations at 1.4 ghz(archival nrao - very large array - vla cnb-configuration data) were notadequate to accurately determine the flux density associated with the radiohalo. in this paper we report the detection at 1.4 ghz of the radio halo inabell 521 using deep vla observations in the d-configuration. we use these newdata to confirm the steep-spectrum of the object. we consider abell 521 theprototype of a population of very-steep spectrum halos. this population ispredicted assuming that turbulence plays an important role in the accelerationof relativistic particles in galaxy clusters, and we expect it will be unveiledby future surveys at low frequencies with the lofar and lwa radio telescopes.

0905.2418	radio halos from simulations and hadronic models i: the coma cluster	we use the results from a constrained, cosmological mhd simulation of thelocal universe to predict the radio halo and the gamma-ray flux from the comacluster and compare it to current observations. the simulated magnetic fieldwithin the coma cluster is the result of turbulent amplification of themagnetic field during build-up of the cluster. the magnetic seed fieldoriginates from star-burst driven, galactic outflows. the synchrotron emissionis calculated assuming a hadronic model. we follow four approaches withdifferent distributions for the cosmic-ray proton (crp) population withingalaxy clusters. the radial profile the radio halo can only be reproduced witha radially increasing energy fraction within the cosmic ray proton population,reaching $&gt;$100% of the thermal energy content at $\approx$ 1mpc, e.g. the edgeof the radio emitting region. additionally the spectral steepening of theobserved radio halo in coma cannot be reproduced, even when accounting for thenegative flux from the thermal sz effect at high frequencies. therefore thehadronic models are disfavored from present analysis. the emission of$\gamma$-rays expected from our simulated coma is still below the currentobservational limits (by a factor of $\sim$6) but would be detectable in thenear future.

0909.2343	on the evolution of giant radio halos and their connection with cluster  mergers	giant radio halos are diffuse, mpc-scale, synchrotron sources located in thecentral regions of galaxy clusters and provide the most relevant example ofcluster non-thermal activity. radio and x-ray surveys allow to investigate thestatistics of halos and may contribute to constrain their origin and evolution.we investigate the distribution of clusters in the plane x-ray (thermal, l_x)vs synchrotron (p_{1.4})luminosity, where clusters hosting giant radio halostrace the p_{1.4}--l_x correlation and clusters without radio halos populate aregion that is well separated from that spanned by the above correlation. theconnection between radio halos and cluster mergers suggests that the clustermpc-scale synchrotron emission is amplified during these mergers and thensuppressed when clusters become more dynamically relaxed. in this context, byanalysing the distribution in the p_{1.4}--l_x plane of clusters from x-rayselected samples with adequate radio follow up, we constrain the typicaltime-scale of evolution of diffuse radio emission in clusters and discuss theimplications for the origin of radio halos. we conclude that clustersynchrotron emission is suppressed (and amplified) in a time-scalesignificantly smaller than 1 gyr. we show that this constraint appearsdifficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the halo's radio power issuppressed due to dissipation of magnetic field in galaxy clusters. on theother hand, in agreement with models where turbulent acceleration plays a role,present constraints suggest that relativistic electrons are accelerated inmpc-scale regions, in connection with cluster mergers and for a time-intervalof about 1 gyr, and then they cool in a relatively small time-scale, when thehosting cluster becomes more dynamically relaxed.

0909.3449	constraining relativistic protons and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters  through radio and gamma-ray observations : the case of a2256	giant radio halos are the most relevant examples of diffuse synchrotronemission from galaxy clusters. a number of these sources have very steepspectrum, with spectral index $\alpha \geq 1.5-1.6$ ($f(\nu) \propto\nu^{-\alpha}$), and are ideal targets to test current models for the origin ofthe relativistic particles. a2256 hosts the nearest radio halo with very steepspectrum, with $\alpha =1.61$, and a very large population of relativisticprotons in the cluster would be necessary to explain the halo as due tosynchrotron emission from secondary particles. in this case the 0.1-1 gev$\gamma$--ray luminosity is expected 10-20 times larger than that of clustershosting radio halos with similar radio power at ghz frequencies but withspectra more typical of the presently observed halo population, $\alpha \sim1.2$. under these assumptions incoming fermi/glast observations are expected todetect a2256, provided that the magnetic field in the central cluster region is$\leq$10-15 $\mu$g. we show that this will allow for a prompt test of hadronicmodels for the origin of radio halos, and for complementary constraints on boththe cluster magnetic field and the physics of particle acceleration mechanisms.

0910.2025	unveiling radio halos in galaxy clusters in the lofar era	giant radio halos are mega-parsec scale synchrotron sources detected in afraction of massive and merging galaxy clusters. radio halos provide one of themost important pieces of evidence for non-thermal components in large scalestructure. statistics of their properties can be used to discriminate amongvarious models for their origin. therefore, theoretical predictions of theoccurrence of radio halos are important as several new radio telescopes areabout to begin to survey the sky at low frequencies with unprecedentedsensitivity. in this paper we carry out monte carlo simulations to model theformation and evolution of radio halos in a cosmological framework. we extendprevious works on the statistical properties of radio halos in the context ofthe turbulent re-acceleration model. first we compute the fraction of galaxyclusters that show radio halos and derive the luminosity function of radiohalos. then, we derive differential and integrated number count distributionsof radio halos at low radio frequencies with the main goal to explore thepotential of the upcoming lofar surveys. by restricting to the case of clustersat redshifts &lt;0.6, we find that the planned lofar all sky survey at 120 mhz isexpected to detect about 350 giant radio halos. about half of these halos havespectral indices larger than 1.9 and substantially brighten at lowerfrequencies. if detected they will allow for a confirmation that turbulenceaccelerates the emitting particles. we expect that also commissioning surveys,such as msss, have the potential to detect about 60 radio halos in clusters ofthe rosat brightest cluster sample and its extension (ebcs). these surveys willallow us to constrain how the rate of formation of radio halos in theseclusters depends on cluster mass.

1003.0336	radio halos from simulations and hadronic models ii: the scaling  relations of radio halos	we use results from a constrained, cosmological mhd simulation of the localuniverse to predict radio halos and their evolution for a volume limited set ofgalaxy clusters and compare to current observations. the simulated magneticfield inside the clusters is a result of turbulent amplification within them,with the magnetic seed originating from star-burst driven, galactic outflows.we evaluate three models, where we choose different normalizations for thecosmic ray proton population within clusters. similar to our previous analysisof the coma cluster (donnert et al. 2010), the radial profile and themorphological properties of observed radio halos can not be reproduced, evenwith a radially increasing energy fraction within the cosmic ray protonpopulation. scaling relations between x-ray luminosity and radio power can bereproduced by all models, however all models fail in the prediction of clusterswith no radio emission. also the evolutionary tracks of our largest clusters inall models fail to reproduce the observed bi-modality in radio luminosity. thisprovides additional evidence that the framework of hadronic, secondary modelsis disfavored to reproduce the large scale diffuse radio emission of galaxyclusters. we also provide predictions for the unavoidable emission of$\gamma$-rays from the hadronic models for the full cluster set. none of suchsecondary models is yet excluded by the observed limits in $\gamma$-rayemission, emphasizing that large scale diffuse radio emission is a powerfultool to constrain the amount of cosmic ray protons in galaxy clusters.

1008.0184	acceleration of primary and secondary particles in galaxy clusters by  compressible mhd turbulence: from radio halos to gamma rays	radio observations discovered large scale non thermal sources in the centralmpc regions of dynamically disturbed galaxy clusters (radio halos). themorphological and spectral properties of these sources suggest that theemitting electrons are accelerated by spatially distributed and gentlemechanisms, providing some indirect evidence for turbulent acceleration in theinter-galactic-medium (igm). only deep upper limits to the energy associatedwith relativistic protons in the igm have been recently obtained through gammaand radio observations. yet these protons should be (theoretically) the mainnon-thermal particle component in the igm implying the unavoidable production,at some level, of secondary particles that may have a deep impact on the gammaray and radio properties of galaxy clysters. following brunetti and lazarian(2007), in this paper we consider the advances in the theory of mhd turbulenceto develop a comprehensive picture of turbulence in the igm and extend ourprevious calculations of particle acceleration by compressible mhd turbulenceby considering self-consistently the reacceleration of both primary andsecondary particles. under these conditions we expect that radio to gamma rayemission is generated from galaxy clusters with a complex spectrum that dependson the dynamics of the thermal gas and dark matter. the non-thermal emissionresults in very good agreement with radio observations and with presentconstraints from hard x-ray and gamma ray observations. in our model giantradio halos are generated in merging (turbulent) clusters only. however, incase secondaries dominate the electron component in the igm, we expect that thelevel of the mpc-scale synchrotron emission in more relaxed clusters is alreadyclose to that of the radio upper limits derived by present observations ofclusters without radio halos.

1010.5950	massive and refined. ii. the statistical properties of turbulent motions  in massive galaxy clusters with high spatial resolution	we study the properties of chaotic motions in the intra cluster medium usinga set of 20 galaxy clusters simulated with large dynamical range, using theadaptive mesh refinement code enzo (e.g. norman et al.2007). the adopted setupallows us to study the spectral and spatial properties of turbulent motions ingalaxy clusters with unprecedented detail, achieving an maximum availablereynolds number of the order of r=500-1000 for the largest eddies. thecorrelations between the energy of these motions in the intra cluster mediumand the dynamical state of the host systems are studied, and the statisticalproperties of turbulent motions and their evolution with time support thatmajor merger events are responsible for the injection of the bulk of turbulentkinetic energy inside cluster. turbulence is found to account for a 20-30 percent of the thermal energy in merging clusters, while it accounts for a 5 percent in relaxed clusters. a comparison of the energies of turbulence andmotions in our simulated clusters with present upper-limits in real nearbyclusters, recently derived with xmm-newton (sanders et al.2010), is provided.when the same spatial scales of turbulent motions are compared, the data fromsimulations result well within the range presently allowed by observations.finally, we comment on the possibility that turbulence may acceleraterelativistic particles leading to the formation of giant radio halos inturbulent (merging) clusters. based on our simulations we confirm previoussemi-analytical studies that suggest that the fraction of turbulent clusters isconsistent with that of clusters hosting radio halos.

1011.1193	radio halos and the importance of future observations at low frequency	radio observations discovered large scale non thermal sources in the centralmpc regions of dynamically disturbed galaxy clusters (radio halos). themorphological and spectral properties of these sources suggest that theemitting electrons are accelerated by spatially distributed and gentlemechanisms, providing some indirect evidence for turbulent acceleration in theinter-galactic-medium (igm). radio and x-ray surveys allow to investigate thestatistics of radio halos and unveil a bimodal behaviour of the radioproperties of galaxy clusters: merging clusters host radio halos and trace thewell known radio--x correlation, while more relaxed clusters do not host radiohalos and populate a region well separated from that spanned by the abovecorrelation. this appears consistent with the hypothesis that relativisticelectrons can be reaccelerated by mhd turbulence generated during clustermergers. in the context of this model the population of radio halos consists ofa mixture of halos with different spectral properties, most of them with verysteep spectrum and visible only at low radio frequencies. for this reason thefuture lofar surveys may provide a robust test to this theoretical hypothesis.

1011.1198	particle reacceleration by compressible turbulence in galaxy clusters:  effects of reduced mean free path	direct evidence for in situ particle acceleration mechanisms in theinter-galactic-medium (igm) is provided by the diffuse mpc--scale synchrotronemissions observed from galaxy clusters. it has been proposed that mhdturbulence, generated during cluster-cluster mergers, may be a source ofparticle reacceleration in the igm. calculations of turbulent acceleration mustaccount self-consistently for the complex non--linear coupling betweenturbulent waves and particles. this has been calculated in some detail underthe assumption that turbulence interacts in a collisionless way with the igm.in this paper we explore a different picture of acceleration by compressibleturbulence in galaxy clusters, where the interaction between turbulence and theigm is mediated by plasma instabilities and maintained collisional at scalesmuch smaller than the coulomb mean free path. in this regime most of the energyof fast modes is channeled into the reacceleration of relativistic particlesand the acceleration process approaches a universal behaviour beingself-regulated by the back-reaction of the accelerated particles on turbulenceitself. assuming that relativistic protons contribute to several percent (orless) of the cluster energy, consistent with the fermi observations of nearbyclusters, we find that compressible turbulence at the level of a few percent ofthe thermal energy can reaccelerate relativistic electrons at gev energies,that are necessary to explain the observed diffuse radio emission in the formof giant radio halos.

0704.3490	new scaling relations in cluster radio halos and the re-acceleration  model	in this paper we derive new expected scaling relations for clusters withgiant radio halos in the framework of the re-acceleration scenario in asimplified, but physically motivated, form, namely: radio power (p_r) vs sizeof the radio emitting region (r_h), and p_r vs total cluster mass (m_h)contained in the emitting region and cluster velocity dispersion (sigma_h) inthis region.  we search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and x-raydata available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giantradio halos. in particular we find a good correlation between p_r and r_h and avery tight ``geometrical'' scaling between m_h and r_h. from these correlationsp_r is also expected to scale with m_h and sigma_h and this is confirmed by ouranalysis. we show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled withexpectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic fieldstrength in the radio halo volume with m_h. a byproduct correlation between r_hand sigma_h is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. inaddition, we find that observationally r_h scales non-linearly with the virialradius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of thecluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thusthat the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

1306.2319	the hot and energetic universe: the evolution of galaxy groups and  clusters	major astrophysical questions related to the formation and evolution ofstructures, and more specifically of galaxy groups and clusters, will still beopen in the coming decade and beyond: what is the interplay of galaxy,supermassive black hole, and intergalactic gas evolution in the most massiveobjects in the universe - galaxy groups and clusters? what are the processesdriving the evolution of chemical enrichment of the hot diffuse gas inlarge-scale structures? how and when did the first galaxy groups in theuniverse, massive enough to bind more than 10^7 k gas, form? focussing on theperiod when groups and clusters assembled (0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5), we show that, due to thecontinuum and line emission of this hot intergalactic gas at x-ray wavelengths,athena+, combining high sensitivity with excellent spectral and spatialresolution, will deliver breakthrough observations in view of theaforementioned issues. indeed, the physical and chemical properties of the hotintra-cluster gas, and their evolution across time, are a key to understand theco-evolution of galaxy and supermassive black hole within their environments.

1306.4379	revisiting scaling relations for giant radio halos in galaxy clusters	many galaxy clusters host megaparsec-scale radio halos, generated byultrarelativistic electrons in the magnetized intracluster medium. correlationsbetween the power of radio halos and the thermal properties of the hostingclusters were established in the last decade, including the connection betweenthe presence of a halo and cluster mergers. the x-ray luminosity and redshiftlimited extended gmrt radio halo survey provides a rich and unique dataset forstatistical studies of the halos. we uniformly analyze the radio and x-ray datafor the gmrt cluster sample, and use the new planck sz catalog, to revisit thecorrelations between the power of halos and the thermal properties of galaxyclusters. we find that the radio power of halos at 1.4 ghz scales with thecluster x-ray (0.1--2.4 kev) luminosity computed within r_500 as p_1.4l_500^2.0. our bigger and more homogenous sample confirms that the x-rayluminous (l_500 &gt; 5x10^44 erg/s) clusters branch into two populations --- radiohalos lie on the correlation, while clusters with upper limits to radio-haloemission are well below that correlation. this bimodality remains if we excisecool cores from the x-ray luminosities. correlating with planck data, we findthat p_1.4 scales with the cluster integrated sz signal within r_500 as p_1.4y_500^2.1, in line with previous findings. however, contrary to previousstudies that were limited by incompleteness and small sample size, we find thatthe "sz-luminous" y_500 &gt; 6x10^-5 mpc^2 clusters show a bimodal behaviorsimilar to that in the radio-x-ray diagram. bimodality of both correlations canbe traced to clusters dynamics, with radio halos found exclusively in mergingclusters. these results confirm the key role of mergers for the origin of giantradio halos, suggesting that they trigger the relativistic particleacceleration.

1401.7519	cosmic rays in galaxy clusters and their non-thermal emission	radio observations prove the existence of relativistic particles and magneticfield associated with the intra-cluster-medium (icm) through the presence ofextended synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos and peripheral relics.this observational evidence has fundamental implications on the physics of theicm. non-thermal components in galaxy clusters are indeed unique probes of veryenergetic processes operating within clusters that drain gravitational andelectromagnetic energy into cosmic rays and magnetic fields. these componentsstrongly affect the (micro-)physical properties of the icm, including viscosityand electrical conductivities, and have also potential consequences on theevolution of clusters themselves. the nature and properties of cosmic rays ingalaxy clusters, including the origin of the observed radio emission oncluster-scales, have triggered an active theoretical debate in the last decade.only recently we can start addressing some of the most important questions inthis field, thanks to recent observational advances, both in the radio and athigh energies. the properties of cosmic rays and of cluster non-thermalemissions depend on the dynamical state of the icm, the efficiency of particleacceleration mechanisms in the icm and on the dynamics of these cosmic rays. inthis review we discuss in some detail the acceleration and transport of cosmicrays in galaxy clusters and the most relevant observational milestones thathave provided important steps on our understanding of this physics. finally,looking forward to the possibilities from new generations of observationaltools, we focus on what appear to be the most important prospects for the nearfuture from radio and high-energy observations.

1509.03299	the challenge of turbulent acceleration of relativistic particles in the  intra-cluster medium	acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (cre) in the intra-cluster-medium (icm)is probed by radio observations that detect diffuse, mpc-scale, synchrotronsources in a fraction of galaxy clusters. giant radio halos are the mostspectacular manifestations of non-thermal activity in the icm and are currentlyexplained assuming that turbulence driven during massive cluster-clustermergers reaccelerates cre at several gev. this scenario implies a hierarchy ofcomplex mechanisms in the icm that drain energy from large-scales intoelectromagnetic fluctuations in the plasma and collisionless mechanisms ofparticle acceleration at much smaller scales. in this paper we focus on thephysics of acceleration by compressible turbulence. the spectrum and dampingmechanisms of the electromagnetic fluctuations, and the mean-free-path (mfp) ofcre are the most relevant ingredients that determine the efficiency ofacceleration. these ingredients in the icm are however poorly known and we showthat calculations of turbulent acceleration are also sensitive to theseuncertainties. on the other hand this fact implies that the non-thermalproperties of galaxy clusters probe the complex microphysics and the weaklycollisional nature of the icm.

1510.01479	agn duty cycle estimates for the ultra-steep spectrum radio relic vlss  j1431.8+1331	steep spectrum radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (agn) maycontain remnants of past agn activity episodes. novel instruments like the lowfrequency array (lofar) are enabling studies of these fascinating structures tobe made at tens to hundreds of mhz with sufficient resolution to analyse theircomplex morphology. our goal is to characterize the integrated and resolvedspectral properties of vlss j1431+1331 and estimate source ages based onsynchrotron radio emission models, thus putting constraints on the agn dutycycle. using a broad spectral coverage, we have derived spectral and curvaturemaps, and used synchrotron ageing models to determine the time elapsed from thelast time the source plasma was energized. we used lofar, giant metrewave radiotelescope (gmrt) and jansky very large array (vla) data. based on our ageinganalysis, we infer that the agn that created this source currently has very lowlevels of activity or that it is switched off. the derived ages for the largersource component range from around 60 to 130 myr, hinting that the agn activitydecreased or stopped around 60 myr ago. our analysis suggests that vlssj1431.8+1331 is an intriguing, two-component source. the larger component seemsto host a faint radio core, suggesting that the source may be an agn radiorelic. the spectral index we observe from the smaller component is distinctlyflatter at lower frequencies than the spectral index of the larger component,suggesting the possibility that the smaller component may be a shocked plasmabubble. from the integrated source spectrum, we deduce that its shape and slopecan be used as tracers of the activity history of this type of steep spectrumradio source.

astro-ph;0008518	particle reacceleration in coma cluster: radio properties and hard x-ray  emission	the radio spectral index map of the coma halo shows a progressive steepeningof the spectral index with increasing radius. such a steepening cannot besimply justified by models involving continuous injection of fresh particles inthe coma halo or by models involving diffusion of fresh electrons from thecentral regions. we propose a {\it two phase} model in which the relativisticelectrons injected in the coma cluster by some processes (starbursts, agns,shocks, turbulence) during a {\it first phase} in the past are systematicallyreaccelerated during a {\it second phase} for a relatively long time ($\sim$ 1gyr) up to the present time. we show that for reacceleration time scales of$\sim 0.1$ gyr this hypothesis can well account for the radio properties ofcoma c. for the same range of parameters which explain coma c we havecalculated the expected fluxes from the inverse compton scattering of the cmbphotons finding that the hard x-ray tail discovered by bepposax may beaccounted for by the stronger reacceleration allowed by the model. thepossibility of extending the main model assumptions and findings to the case ofthe other radio haloes is also discussed, the basic predictions beingconsistent with the observations.

astro-ph;0104004	anisotropic inverse compton scattering in powerful radio galaxies: the  case of 3c 295	inverse compton (ic) scattering of nuclear photons with relativisticelectrons in the lobes of powerful radio galaxies and quasars can givedetectable extended x-ray emission from the radio lobes if relativisticelectrons with a lorentz factor gamma about 300 are present (brunetti, setti,comastri 1997). in general these electrons are not detected since they emitsynchrotron radiation at frequencies below the radio band, so that the study ofthis effect provides a unique tool to measure the energy distribution of theelectron population in the radio lobes at gamma lower than 1000. in this paperwe reanalyze the chandra observation of the powerful and compact radio galaxy3c 295 for which the ic scattering of nuclear photons is expected to be animportant mechanism. we find strong evidence for extended and asymmetricalx-ray emission associated with the radio lobes in the energy band 0.1--2 kev.we show that both the luminosity and morphology of the extended x-ray emissionassociated with the radio lobes, not compatible with other x-ray mechanisms,can be best interpreted by the ic scattering with nuclear photons. we also showthat the relativistic electron energy distribution obtained from thesynchrotron radio emission can be extrapolated down to gamma about 100 thusproviding a first direct evidence on the electron spectrum in the lobes down tolower energies.

astro-ph;0404509	cluster mergers, radio halos and hard x-ray tails: a statistical  magneto-turbulent model	there is now firm evidence that the icm consists of a mixture of hot plasma,magnetic fields and relativistic particles. the most important evidences fornon-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters comes from the diffuse mpc-scalesynchrotron radio emission (radio halos) observed in a growing number ofmassive clusters (feretti 2003) and from hard x-ray (hxr) excess emission(detected in a few cases) which can be explained in terms of ic scattering ofrelativistic electrons off the cosmic microwave background photons(fusco-femiano et al. 2003). there are now growing evidences that giant radiohalos may be naturally accounted for by synchrotron emission from relativisticelectrons reaccelerated by some kind of turbulence generated in the clustervolume during merger events (brunetti 2003). with the aim to investigate theconnection between thermal and non-thermal properties of the icm, we havedeveloped a statistical magneto-turbulent model which describes the evolutionof the thermal and non-thermal emission from clusters. we calculate the energyand spectrum of the magnetosonic waves generated during cluster mergers, theacceleration and evolution of relativistic electrons and thus the resultingsynchrotron and inverse compton spectra. here we give a brief description ofthe main results, while a more detailed discussion will be presented in aforthcoming paper. einstein-de sitter cosmology, $h_o=50$ km$s^{-1}$$mpc^{-1}$, $q_o=0.5$, is assumed.

astro-ph;0412451	bow shock and radio halo in the merging cluster a520	chandra observations of the merging galaxy cluster a520 reveal a prominentbow shock with m=2.1+0.4-0.3. this is only the second clear example of asubstantially supersonic merger shock front in clusters. comparison of thex-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidenceof the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock, offering an interestingexperimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halogeneration. the halo in a520 apparently consists of two spatially distinctparts, the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structurerelated to the shock, where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons forsubsequent turbulent re-acceleration. the radio edge may be caused by electronacceleration by the shock. if so, the synchrotron spectrum should have a slopeof 1.2 right behind the edge with quick steepening further away from the edge.alternatively, if shocks are inefficient accelerators, the radio edge may beexplained by an increase in the magnetic field and density of pre-existingrelativistic electrons due to gas compression. in the latter model, thereshould be radio emission in front of the shock with the same spectrum as thatbehind it, but 10-20 times fainter. if future sensitive radio measurements donot find such pre-shock emission, then the electrons are indeed accelerated (orre-accelerated) by the shock, and one will be able to determine itsacceleration efficiency. we also propose a method to estimate the magneticfield strength behind the shock, based on measuring the dependence of the radiospectral slope upon the distance from the shock. in addition, the radio edgeprovides a way to constrain the diffusion speed of the relativistic electrons.

astro-ph;0412475	cluster mergers and non-thermal phenomena: expectations from a  statistical magneto-turbulent model	the most important evidences for non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusterscomes from the spectacular synchrotron radio emission diffused over mpc scaleobserved in a growing number of massive clusters. a promising possibility toexplain giant radio halos is given by the presence of relativistic electronsreaccelerated by some kind of turbulence generated in the cluster volume duringmerger events. with the aim to investigate the connection between thermal andnon-thermal properties of the icm, in this paper we develope a statisticalmagneto-turbulent model which describes in a self-consistent way the evolutionof the thermal icm and that of the non-thermal emission from clusters. makinguse of the extended press &amp; schechter formalism, we follow cluster mergers andestimate the injection rate of the fluid turbulence generated during theseenergetic events. we then calculate the evolution of the spectrum of therelativistic electrons in the icm during the cluster life by taking intoaccount both the electron-acceleration due to the merger-driven turbulence andthe relevant energy losses of the electrons. we end up with a syntheticpopulation of galaxy clusters for which the evolution of the icm and of thenon-thermal spectrum emitted by the accelerated electrons is calculated. thegeneration of detectable non-thermal radio and hard x-ray emission in thesimulated clusters is found to be possible during major merger events forreliable values of the model parameters. in addition the occurrence of radiohalos as a function of the mass of the parent clusters is calculated andcompared with observations. in this case it is found that the modelexpectations are in good agreement with observations.

astro-ph;0507480	turbulent gas motions in galaxy cluster simulations: the role of sph  viscosity	smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) employs an artificial viscosity toproperly capture hydrodynamical shock waves. in its original formulation, theresulting numerical viscosity is large enough to suppress structure in thevelocity field on scales well above the nominal resolution limit, and to dampthe generation of turbulence by fluid instabilities. this could artificiallysuppress random gas motions in the intracluster medium (icm), which are drivenby infalling structures during the hierarchical structure formation process. weshow that this is indeed the case by analysing results obtained with an sphformulation where an individual, time-variable viscosity is used for eachparticle (monaghan 1997). using test calculations involving strong shocks, wedemonstrate that this scheme captures shocks as well as the originalformulation of sph, but, in regions away from shocks, the numerical viscosityis much smaller. in a set of nine high-resolution simulations of cosmologicalgalaxy cluster formation, we find that this low--viscosity formulation of sphproduces substantially higher levels of turbulent gas motions in the icm,reaching a kinetic energy content in random gas motions (measured within a 1mpccube) of up to 5%-30% of the thermal energy content, depending on cluster mass.this has also significant effects on radial gas profile. we find a centralflattening of the entropy profile and a reduction of the central gas density inthe low--viscosity scheme. interestingly, this tends to reduce the differencesseen in sph and adaptive mesh refinement simulations of cluster formation.finally, invoking a model for particle acceleration by mhd waves driven byturbulence, we find efficient electron acceleration to power diffuse radioemission.

astro-ph;9809038	evidence for inverse compton emission in the powerful radio galaxy 3c  219	spectral analysis of rosat pspc and asca archive data and a recent rosat hriobservation of the powerful frii radio galaxy 3c 219 reveal an absorbedpoint-like source, coincident with the nucleus, and a non-thermal extendedcomponent aligned with the radio structure. the point-like source can bereadily interpreted as a hidden quasar in the nucleus, giving further supportto the unification scheme of frii radio galaxies and radio loud quasars. thecoincidence between the x-ray (0.1-10 kev) and radio spectral index suggestthat most of the emission associated with the extended component is due to theinverse compton process in the radio lobes. the extended circumnuclear emissioncan be understood as compton scattering of the ir-optical radiation emitted bythe hidden quasar and surrounding dusty/molecular torus. this is the firstobservational evidence supporting the existence of this effect, which alsoprobes the relativistic electron spectrum at energies much lower than thoseinvolved in the synchrotron radio emission. the observed x-ray flux can bematched by assuming that the energy density of the relativistic particlesexceed the equipartition value by about a factor of 10. at larger distancesfrom the nucleus ($\geq 70$kpc) the inverse compton scattering with the cosmicmicrowave background photons becomes more important and may explain theobserved x-ray features if positive fluctuations in the column densities ofrelativistic electrons are present. alternatively, one cannot exclude with thepresent data a thermal contribution by hot clumpy gas surrounding the radiolobes.

astro-ph;9907125	particle reacceleration in the coma cluster and the radio, euv and hard  x-ray emissions	the radio spectral index map of the coma halo shows a progressive steepeningof the spectral index with increasing radius. such a steepening cannot besimply justified by models involving continuous injection of fresh particles inthe coma halo or by models involving diffusion of fresh electrons from thecentral regions. we propose a scenario in which the relativistic particlesinjected in the coma cluster by some processes (merger, accretion shocks,turbulence) are systematically reaccelerated for a relatively long time ($\sim$1gyr). we show that such a scenario can account for the synchrotron radiospectral index distribution, for the radio halo size at different frequencies,and for the total (integrated) radio spectrum of the coma halo. we also showthat for a suitable choice of the parameters the model can also account for thehard x-ray flux observed by bepposax via the inverse compton scattering of thecosmic microwave background radiation by the synchrotron electrons. thepossibility to account for the euv flux detected with the euve satellite by theinverse compton emission is also discussed.

astro-ph;9908236	anisotropic inverse compton scattering from the trans-relativistic to  the ultra-relativistic regime and application to the radio galaxies	the problem of the anisotropic inverse compton scattering between amonochromatic photon beam and relativistic electrons is revisited and formallysolved without approximations. solutions are given for the single scatteringwith an electron beam and with a population of electrons isotropicallydistributed, under the assumption that the energy distribution of therelativistic particles follows a simple power law as it is the case in manyastrophysical applications. both the thomson approximation and theklein-nishina regime are considered for the scattering of an unpolarized photonbeam. the equations are obtained without the ultra-relativistic approximationand are compared with the ultra-relativistic solutions given in the literature.the main characteristics of the power distribution and spectra of the scatteredradiation are discussed for relevant examples. in the thomson case for anisotropic electron population simple formulae holding down tomildly-relativistic energies are given. as an application the formulae of theanisotropic inverse compton scattering are used to predict the properties ofthe x and $\gamma$-ray spectra from the radio lobes of strong fr ii radiogalaxies due to the interaction of the relativistic electrons with the incomingphotons from the nucleus. the dependence of the emitted power on therelativistic electron energy distribution and on its evolution with time isdiscussed.

0810.4288	a low-frequency radio halo associated with a cluster of galaxies	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in theuniverse, containing about 10^15 solar masses of hot (10^8 k) gas, galaxies anddark matter in a typical volume of about 10 mpc^3. magnetic fields andrelativistic particles are mixed with the gas as revealed by giant radiohaloes, which arise from diffuse, megaparsec-scale synchrotron radiation atcluster center. radio haloes require that the emitting electrons areaccelerated in situ (by turbulence), or are injected (as secondary particles)by proton collisions into the intergalactic medium. they are found only in afraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics, which suggests aconnection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. here we report a radiohalo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster abell 521. thishalo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequencycut-off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4 ghz(the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied).the spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of therelativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, whichsuggests that many radio haloes in the universe should emit mainly at lowfrequencies.
