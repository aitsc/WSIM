0902.2582	modeling the chemical evolution of a collapsing prestellar core in two  spatial dimensions	the physical conditions in a collapsing cloud can be traced by observationsof molecular lines. to correctly interpret these observations the abundancedistributions of the observed species need to be derived. the chemistry in acollapsing molecular cloud is not in a steady state as the density andtemperature evolve. we therefore need to follow chemical reactions, both in thegas phase and on dust grains, as well as gas-grain interactions, to predict theabundance distributions. our aim is to model the abundances of molecules, inthe gas phase and on grain mantles in the form of ice, from prestellar corecollapse to disk formation. we use a 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation asa physical model from which we take the density, temperature, and the flow ofthe gas. trace particles, moving along with the gas, are used to follow thechemistry during prestellar core collapse and disk formation. the evolution ofthe abundances and the composition of ices on grain mantles were compared toobservations. we also investigated the initial abundances to be adopted in moredetailed modeling of protoplanetary disks by following the chemical evolutionof trace particles accreting onto the disk. fractional abundances of hco+,n2h+, h2co, hc3n, and ch3oh from our model with grain surface reactions providea good match to observations, while abundances of co, cs, so, hcn, and hnc showbetter agreement without grain surface reactions. the observed mantlecomposition of dust grains is best reproduced when we include surfacereactions. the initial chemical abundances to be used for detailed modeling ofa protoplanetary disk are found to be different from those in dark interstellarclouds. ices with a binding energy lower than about 1200 k sublimate beforeaccreting onto the disk, while those with a higher binding energy do not.

0905.3650	diffuse radio emission in the merging cluster macs j0717.5+3745: the  discovery of the most powerful radio halo	hierarchical models of structure formation predict that galaxy clusters growvia mergers of smaller clusters and galaxy groups, as well as throughcontinuous accretion of gas. macs j0717.5+3745 is an x-ray luminous and complexmerging cluster, located at a redshift of 0.55. here we present giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) radio observations at 610 mhz of this cluster. the mainaim of the observations is to search for diffuse radio emission within thegalaxy cluster macs j0717.5+3745 related to the ongoing merger. these gmrtobservations are complemented by very large array (vla) archival observationsat 1.4, 4.9 and 8.5 ghz. we have discovered a radio halo in the cluster macsj0717.5+3745 with a size of about 1.2 mpc. the radio power p_1.4 ghz is 5 x10^25 w/hz, which makes it the most powerful radio halo known till date. a 700kpc radio structure, which we classify as a radio relic, is located in betweenthe merging substructures of the system. the location of this relic roughlycoincides with regions of the intra-cluster medium (icm) that have asignificant enhancement in temperature as shown by chandra. the major axis ofthe relic is also roughly perpendicular to the merger axis. this shows that therelic might be the result of a merger-related shock wave, where particles areaccelerated via the diffuse shock acceleration (dsa) mechanism. alternatively,the relic might trace an accretion shock of a large-scale galaxy filament tothe south-west. the global spectral index of radio emission within the clusteris found to be -1.24 +/-0.05 between 4.9 ghz and 610 mhz. we derive a value of5.8 microgauss for the equipartition magnetic field strength at the location ofthe radio halo.

0910.2970	a search for steep spectrum radio relics and halos with the gmrt	context: diffuse radio emission, in the form of radio halos and relics,traces regions in clusters with shocks or turbulence, probably produced bycluster mergers. some models of diffuse radio emission in clusters indicatethat virtually all clusters should contain diffuse radio sources with a steepspectrum. external accretion shocks associated with filamentary structures ofgalaxies could also accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and henceproduce diffuse synchrotron emitting regions. here we report on giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) observations of a sample of steep spectrum sources fromthe 74 mhz vlss survey. these sources are diffuse and not associated withnearby galaxies.  aims: the main aim of the observations is to search for diffuse radioemission associated with galaxy clusters or the cosmic web.  methods: we carried out gmrt 610 mhz continuum observations of unidentifieddiffuse steep spectrum sources.  results: we have constructed a sample of diffuse steep spectrum sources,selected from the 74 mhz vlss survey. we identified eight diffuse radio sourcesprobably all located in clusters. we found five radio relics, one cluster witha giant radio halo and a radio relic, and one radio mini-halo. by complementingour observations with measurements from the literature we find correlationsbetween the physical size of relics and the spectral index, in the sense thatsmaller relics have steeper spectra. furthermore, larger relics are mostlylocated in the outskirts of clusters while smaller relics are located closer tothe cluster center.

0910.4967	the discovery of diffuse steep spectrum sources in abell 2256	context: hierarchical galaxy formation models indicate that during theirlifetime galaxy clusters undergo several mergers. here we report on thediscovery of three diffuse radio sources in the periphery of abell 2256, usingthe gmrt.  aims: the aim of the observations was to search for diffuse ultra-steepspectrum radio sources within the galaxy cluster abell 2256.  methods: we have carried out gmrt 325 mhz radio continuum observations ofabell 2256. v, r and i band images of the cluster were taken with the 4.2m wht.  results: we have discovered three diffuse elongated radio sources locatedabout 1 mpc from the cluster center. two are located to the west of the clustercenter, and one to the southeast. the sources have a measured physical extentof 170, 140 and 240 kpc, respectively. the two western sources are also visiblein deep low-resolution 115-165 mhz wsrt images, although they are blended intoa single source. for the combined emission of the blended source we find anextreme spectral index of -2.05\pm 0.14 between 140 and 351 mhz. the extremelysteep spectral index suggests these two sources are most likely the result ofadiabatic compression of fossil radio plasma due to merger shocks.  conclusions: the discovery of the steep spectrum sources implies theexistence of a population of faint diffuse radio sources in (merging) clusterswith such steep spectra that they have gone unnoticed in higher frequency(\gtrsim 1 ghz) observations. an exciting possibility therefore is that suchsources will determine the general appearance of clusters in low-frequency highresolution radio maps as will be produced by for example lofar or lwa.

1101.3865	diffuse steep-spectrum sources from the 74 mhz vlss survey	galaxy clusters grow by a sequence of mergers with other clusters and galaxygroups. during these mergers, shocks and/or turbulence are created within theintracluster medium (icm). in this process, particles could be accelerated tohighly relativistic energies. the synchrotron radiation from these particles isobserved in the form of radio relics and halos that are generally characterizedby a steep radio spectral index. shocks can also revive fossil radio plasmafrom a previous episode of agn activity, creating a so-called radio phoenix.here we present multi-frequency radio observations of diffuse steep-spectrumradio sources selected from the 74 mhz vlss survey. previous gmrt observationsshowed that some of these sources had filamentary and elongated morphologies,which are expected for radio relics.  we carried out radio continuum observations at 325 mhz with the gmrt.observations with the vla and wsrt were taken at 1.4 ghz in full polarizationmode. optical images around the radio sources were taken with the wht and inttelescopes. most of the sources in our sample consist of old radio plasma fromagns located in small galaxy clusters. the sources can be classified as agnrelics or radio phoenices. the spectral indices across most of the radiosources display large variations. we conclude that diffuse steep-spectrum radiosources are not only found in massive x-ray luminous galaxy clusters but alsoin smaller systems. future low-frequency surveys will uncover large numbers ofsteep-spectrum radio relics related to previous episodes of agn activity.[abridged]

1107.5597	radio continuum observations of new radio halos and relics from the nvss  and wenss surveys	radio halos and relics are diffuse radio sources found in galaxy clustersshowing significant substructure at x-ray wavelengths. these sources provideimportant information about non-thermal processes taking place in the icm.until now only a few dozen relics and halos are known, while models predictthat a much larger number of these sources exist. in this paper we present theresults of an extensive observing campaign to search for new diffuse radiosources in galaxy clusters. we discovered 6 new radio relics, including aprobable double relic system, and 2 radio halos. in addition, we confirm thepresence of diffuse radio emission in four galaxy clusters. by constructing asample of 35 radio relics we find that relics are mostly found along the majoraxis of the x-ray emission from the icm, while their orientation isperpendicular to this axis. this is consistent with the scenario that relicstrace merger shock waves. the major and minor axis ratio distribution of theicm for clusters with relics is also broader than that of the noras-reflexsample. we compared the x-ray luminosity and redshift distributions of clusterswith relics to an x-ray selected sample from the noras and reflex surveys. wefind tentative evidence for an increase of the cluster's relic fraction withx-ray luminosity and redshift.

1108.1398	using double radio relics to constrain galaxy cluster mergers: a model  of double radio relics in ciza j2242.8+5301	galaxy clusters grow by mergers with other clusters and galaxy groups. thesemergers create shock waves within the intracluster medium (icm) that canaccelerate particles to extreme energies. in the presence of magnetic fields,relativistic electrons form large regions emitting synchrotron radiation,so-called radio relics. behind the shock front, synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) losses cause the radio spectral index to steepen away from the shockfront. an example of such a cluster is ciza j2242.8+5301, where very clearspectral steepening in the downstream region is observed. here we presenthydrodynamical simulations of idealized binary cluster mergers with the aim ofconstraining the merger scenario for this cluster. from our simulations, wefind that ciza j2242.8+5301 is probably undergoing a merger in the plane of thesky (less then 10 deg from edge-on) with a mass ratio of about 2:1, and animpact parameter &lt; 400 kpc. we find that the core passage of the clustershappened about 1 gyr ago. we conclude that double relics relics can setconstraints on the mass ratios, impact parameters, timescales, and viewinggeometry of binary cluster mergers, which is particularly useful when detailedx-ray observations are not available. in addition, the presence of large radiorelics can be used to constrain the degree of clumping in the outskirts of theicm, which is important to constrain the baryon fraction, density and entropyprofiles, around the virial radius and beyond. we find that the amplitude ofdensity fluctuations, with sizes of &lt; 200 kpc, in the relic in cizaj2242.8+5301 is not larger than 30%.

1111.1721	how many radio relics await discovery?	upcoming radio telescopes will allow to study the radio sky at lowfrequencies with unprecedent sensitivity and resolution. new surveys areexpected to discover a large number of new radio sources. here we investigatethe abundance of radio relics, i.e. steep-spectrum diffuse radio emissioncoming from the periphery of galaxy clusters, which are believed to trace shockwaves induced by cluster mergers. with the advent of comprehensive relicsamples a framework is needed to analyze statistically the relic abundance. tothis end, we introduce the probability to find a relic located in a galaxycluster with given mass and redshift allowing us to relate the halo massfunction of the universe with the radio relic number counts. up to date about45 relics have been reported and we compile the resulting counts, n(&gt;s_1.4). inprinciple, the parameters of the distribution could be determined using asufficiently large relic sample. however, since the number of known relics isstill small for that purpose we use the marenostrum universe simulation todetermine the relic radio power scaling with cluster mass and redshift. ourmodel is able to reproduce the recently found tentative evidence for anincrease in the fraction of clusters hosting relics, both with x-ray luminosityand redshift, using an x-ray flux limited cluster sample. moreover, we findthat a considerable fraction of faint relics (s_1.4 &lt; ~10 mjy) reside inclusters with an x-ray flux below ~3e-12 erg/s/cm^2. finally, we estimate thenumber of radio relics which await discovery by future low frequency surveysproposed for lofar and wsrt. we estimate that the wodan survey proposed forwsrt may discover 900 relics and that the lofar-tier 1-120 mhz survey maydiscover about 2500 relics. however, the actual number of newly discoveredrelics will crucially depend on the existence of sufficiently complete galaxycluster catalogues.

1202.2272	radio relics in cosmological simulations	radio relics have been discovered in many galaxy clusters. they are believedto trace shock fronts induced by cluster mergers. cosmological simulationsallow us to study merger shocks in detail since the intra-cluster medium isheated by shock dissipation. using high resolution cosmological simulations,identifying shock fronts and applying a parametric model for the radio emissionallows us to simulate the formation of radio relics. we analyze a simulatedshock front in detail. we find a rather broad mach number distribution. themach number affects strongly the number density of relativistic electrons inthe downstream area, hence, the radio luminosity varies significantly acrossthe shock surface. the abundance of radio relics can be modeled with the helpof the radio power probability distribution which aims at predicting radiorelic number counts. since the actual electron acceleration efficiency is notknown, predictions for the number counts need to be normalized by the observednumber of radio relics. for the characteristics of upcoming low frequencysurveys we find that about thousand relics are awaiting discovery.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

1211.6722	the nature of filamentary cold gas in the core of the virgo cluster	we present a multi-wavelength study of the emission-line nebulae locatedsoutheast of the nucleus of m87, the central dominant galaxy of the virgocluster. we report the detection of far-infrared (fir) [cii] line emission fromthe nebulae using observations made with herschel pacs. the infrared lineemission is extended and cospatial with optical h{\alpha}+[nii],far-ultraviolet civ lines, and soft x-ray emission. the filamentary nebulaeevidently contain multi-phase material spanning a temperature range of at least5 orders of magnitude, from ~100 k to ~10^7 k. this material has most likelybeen uplifted by the agn from the center of m87. the thermal pressure of the10^4 k phase appears to be significantly lower than that of the surrounding hotintra-cluster medium (icm) indicating the presence of additional turbulent andmagnetic pressure in the filaments. if the turbulence in the filaments issubsonic then the magnetic field strength required to balance the pressure ofthe surrounding icm is b~30-70 {\mu}g. the spectral properties of the softx-ray emission from the filaments indicate that it is due to thermal plasmawith kt~0.5-1 kev, which is cooling by mixing with the cold gas and/orradiatively. charge exchange can be ruled out as a significant source of softx-rays. both cooling and mixing scenarios predict gas with a range oftemperatures. this is at first glance inconsistent with the apparent lack ofx-ray emitting gas with kt&lt;0.5 kev. however, we show that the missing very softx-ray emission could be absorbed by the cold gas in the filaments with anintegrated hydrogen column density of ~1.6x10^21 cm^-2, providing a naturalexplanation for the apparent temperature floor to the x-ray emission at kt~0.5kev. the fir through ultra-violet line emission is most likely primarilypowered by the icm particles penetrating the cold gas following a shearinginduced mixing process.

1302.2321	differential frequency-dependent delay from the pulsar magnetosphere	some radio pulsars show clear drifting subpulses, in which subpulses are seento drift in pulse longitude in a systematic pattern. here we examine how thedrifting subpulses of psr b0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency. weshow that the subpulse period (p3) is constant on timescales of days, monthsand years, and between 14-5100 mhz. despite this, the shapes of the driftbandschange radically with frequency. previous studies have concluded that, whilethe subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly atlow frequencies (&lt; 500 mhz), a discrete step of 180 degrees in subpulse phaseis observed at higher frequencies (&gt; 820 mhz) near to the peak of the averagepulse profile. we use lofar, gmrt, gbt, wsrt and effelsberg 100-m data toexplore the frequency-dependence of this phase step. we show that the size ofthe subpulse phase step increases gradually, and is observable even at lowfrequencies. we attribute the subpulse phase step to the presence of twoseparate driftbands, whose relative arrival times vary with frequency - onedriftband arriving 30 pulses earlier at 20 mhz than it does at 1380 mhz, whilstthe other arrives simultaneously at all frequencies. the drifting pattern whichis observed here cannot be explained by either the rotating carousel model orthe surface oscillation model, and could provide new insight into the physicalprocesses happening within the pulsar magnetosphere.

1302.3128	lofar detections of low-frequency radio recombination lines towards  cassiopeia a	cassiopeia a was observed using the low-band antennas of the low frequencyarray (lofar) with high spectral resolution. this allowed a search for radiorecombination lines (rrls) along the line-of-sight to this source. fivecarbon-alpha rrls were detected in absorption between 40 and 50 mhz with asignal-to-noise ratio of &gt; 5 from two independent lofar datasets. the derivedline velocities (v_lsr ~ -50 km/s) and integrated optical depths (~ 13 s^-1) ofthe rrls in our spectra, extracted over the whole supernova remnant, areconsistent within each lofar dataset and with those previously reported. forthe first time, we are able to extract spectra against the brightest hotspot ofthe remnant at frequencies below 330 mhz. these spectra show significantlyhigher (15-80 %) integrated optical depths, indicating that there issmall-scale angular structure on the order of ~1 pc in the absorbing gasdistribution over the face of the remnant. we also place an upper limit of 3 x10^-4 on the peak optical depths of hydrogen and helium rrls. these resultsdemonstrate that lofar has the desired spectral stability and sensitivity tostudy faint recombination lines in the decameter band.

1303.1533	challenges to our understanding of radio relics: x-ray observations of  the toothbrush cluster	the cluster 1rxs j0603.3+4214 is a merging galaxy cluster that hosts threeradio relics and a giant radio halo. the northern relic, the toothbrush, is1.9-mpc long and has an unusual linear morphology. according to simplediffusive shock acceleration theory, its radio spectral index indicates a machnumber of 3.3-4.6. here, we present results from a deep xmm-newton observationof the cluster. we observe two distinct cluster cores that have survived themerger. the presence of three shocks at or near the locations of the radiorelics is confirmed by density and temperature discontinuities. however, theobservation poses several puzzles that challenge our understanding of radiorelics: (i) at the toothbrush, the shock mach number is not larger than 2, inapparent conflict with the shock strength predicted from the radio spectrum;(ii) at the toothbrush, the shock front is, in part, spatially offset from theradio emission; (iii) at the eastern relic, we detect a temperature jumpcorresponding to a mach number of approximately 2.5, but there is no associatedsurface brightness discontinuity. we discuss possible explanations for thesefindings.

1303.6230	calibrating high-precision faraday rotation measurements for lofar and  the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes	faraday rotation measurements using the current and next generation oflow-frequency radio telescopes will provide a powerful probe of astronomicalmagnetic fields. however, achieving the full potential of these measurementsrequires accurate removal of the time-variable ionospheric faraday rotationcontribution. we present ionfr, a code that calculates the amount ofionospheric faraday rotation for a specific epoch, geographic location, andline-of-sight. ionfr uses a number of publicly available, gps-derived totalelectron content maps and the most recent release of the internationalgeomagnetic reference field. we describe applications of this code for thecalibration of radio polarimetric observations, and demonstrate the highaccuracy of its modeled ionospheric faraday rotations using lofar pulsarobservations. these show that we can accurately determine some of thehighest-precision pulsar rotation measures ever achieved. precision rotationmeasures can be used to monitor rotation measure variations - either intrinsicor due to the changing line-of-sight through the interstellar medium. thiscalibration is particularly important for nearby sources, where the ionospherecan contribute a significant fraction of the observed rotation measure. we alsodiscuss planned improvements to ionfr, as well as the importance of ionosphericfaraday rotation calibration for the emerging generation of low-frequency radiotelescopes, such as the ska and its pathfinders.

1307.5580	the brightness and spatial distributions of terrestrial radio sources	faint undetected sources of radio-frequency interference (rfi) might becomevisible in long radio observations when they are consistently present overtime. thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomicalsignals of interest. this issue is especially important for epoch ofreionisation (eor) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted hi signalsfrom the time of the earliest structures in the universe. we explore the rfisituation at 30-163 mhz by studying brightness histograms of visibility dataobserved with lofar, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used incosmology. an empirical rfi distribution model is derived that allows thesimulation of rfi in radio observations. the brightness histograms show an rfidistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponentaround -1.5. with several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniformdistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existingpropagation models. extrapolation of the power law implies that the currentlofar eor observations should be severely rfi limited if the strength of rfisources remains strong after time integration. this is in contrast with actualobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to belimited by rfi. therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there areundetected rfi sources that will become visible in long observations.consequently, there is no indication that rfi will prevent an eor detectionwith lofar.

1406.7242	lofar sparse image reconstruction	context. the low frequency array (lofar) radio telescope is a giant digitalphased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in europe. itprovides discrete sets of fourier components of the sky brightness. recoveringthe original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverseproblem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methodsaims. recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete natureof radio interferometry measurement and the "compressed sensing" (cs) theory,which supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measuredvisibilities. empowered by proximal theory, cs offers a sound framework forefficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fastalgorithms. combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (dde) in thescope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based onthis framework methods. we implemented a sparse reconstruction method in thestandard lofar imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolutionperformance of this new imager with that of clean-based methods (clean andms-clean) with simulated and real lofar data results. we show that i) sparsereconstruction performs as well as clean in recovering the flux of pointsources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean squareerror is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with aneffective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the clean images.conclusions. sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic andwide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (ofsimulated and real lofar datasets). this sparse reconstruction method iscompatible with modern interferometric imagers that handle dde corrections (a-and w-projections) required for current and future instruments such as lofarand ska

1412.6337	diffuse radio emission in the complex merging galaxy cluster abell 2069	galaxy clusters with signs for a recent merger show in many cases extendeddiffuse radio features. this emission originates from relativistic electronswhich suffer synchrotron losses due to the intra-cluster magnetic field. themechanisms of the particle acceleration and the properties of the magneticfield are still poorly understood. we search for diffuse radio emission ingalaxy clusters. here, we study the complex galaxy cluster abell 2069, forwhich x-ray observations indicate a recent merger. we investigate the cluster'sradio continuum emission by deep westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt)observations at 346 mhz and a giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt)observation at 322 mhz. we find an extended diffuse radio feature roughlycoinciding with the main component of the cluster. we classify this emission asa radio halo and estimate its lower limit flux density to 25 +/- 9 mjy.moreover, we find a second extended diffuse source located at the cluster'scompanion and estimate its flux density to 15 +/- 2 mjy. we speculate that thisis a small halo or a mini-halo. if true, this cluster is the first example of adouble-halo in a single galaxy cluster.

1501.00043	abell 1033: birth of a radio phoenix	extended steep-spectrum radio emission in a galaxy cluster is usuallyassociated with a recent merger. however, given the complex scenario of galaxycluster mergers, many of the discovered sources hardly fit into the strictboundaries of a precise taxonomy. this is especially true for radio phoenixesthat do not have very well defined observational criteria. radio phoenixes areaged radio galaxy lobes whose emission is reactivated by compression or othermechanisms. here, we present the detection of a radio phoenix close to themoment of its formation. the source is located in abell 1033, a peculiar galaxycluster which underwent a recent merger. to support our claim, we presentunpublished westerbork synthesis radio telescope and chandra observationstogether with archival data from the very large array and the sloan digital skysurvey. we discover the presence of two sub-clusters displaced along the n-sdirection. the two sub-clusters probably underwent a recent merger which is thecause of a moderately perturbed x-ray brightness distribution. a steep-spectrumextended radio source very close to an agn is proposed to be a newly born radiophoenix: the agn lobes have been displaced/compressed by shocks formed duringthe merger event. this scenario explains the source location, morphology,spectral index, and brightness. finally, we show evidence of a densitydiscontinuity close to the radio phoenix and discuss the consequences of itspresence.

1501.01179	the physics of the cold neutral medium: low-frequency carbon radio  recombination lines with the square kilometre array	the square kilometre array (ska) will transform our understanding of the roleof the cold, atomic gas in galaxy evolution. the interstellar medium (ism) isthe repository of stellar ejecta and the birthsite of new stars and, hence, akey factor in the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. cold, diffuse, atomicclouds are a key component of the ism, but so far this phase has been difficultto study, because its main tracer, the hi 21 cm line, does not constrain thebasic physical information of the gas (e.g., temperature, density) well. theska opens up the opportunity to study this component of the ism through acomplementary tracer in the form of low-frequency (&lt;350 mhz) carbon radiorecombination lines (crrl). these crrls provide a sensitive probe of thephysical conditions in cold, diffuse clouds. the superb sensitivity, largefield of view, frequency resolution and coverage of the ska allows forefficient surveys of the sky, that will revolutionize the field oflow-frequency recombination line studies. by observing these lines with the skawe will be able determine the thermal balance, chemical enrichment, andionization rate of the cold, atomic medium from degree-scales down to scalescorresponding to individual clouds and filaments in our galaxy, the magellanicclouds and beyond. furthermore, being sensitive only to the cold, atomic gas,observations of low-frequency crrls with the ska will aid in disentangling thewarm and cold constituents of the hi 21 cm emission.

1503.07694	chandra and xmm-newton observations of the merging cluster of galaxies  plck g036.7+14.9	we present chandra and xmm-newton observations of plck g036.7+14.9 from thechandra-planck legacy program. the high resolution x-ray observations revealtwo close subclusters, g036n and g036s, which were not resolved by previousrosat, optical, or recent planck observations. we perform detailed imaging andspectral analyses and use a simplified model to study the kinematics of thissystem. the basic picture is that plck g036.7+14.9 is undergoing a major merger(mass ratio close to unity) between the two massive subclusters, with themerger largely along the line-of-sight and probably at an early stage. g036nhosts a small, moderate cool-core, while g036s has at most a very weakcool-core in the central 40 kpc region. the difference in core cooling times isunlikely to be caused by the ongoing merger disrupting a pre-existing cool-corein g036s. g036n also hosts an unresolved radio source in the center, which maybe heating the gas if the radio source is extended. the planck derived mass ishigher than the x-ray measured mass of either subcluster, but is lower than thex-ray measured mass of the whole cluster, due to the fact that planck does notresolve plck g036.7+14.9 into subclusters and interprets it as a singlecluster. this mass discrepancy could induce significant bias to the massfunction if such previously unresolved systems are common in the planck clustersample. high resolution x-ray observations are necessary to identify thefraction of such systems and correct such a bias for the purpose of precisioncosmological studies.

1504.06642	the peculiar radio galaxy 4c 35.06: a case for recurrent agn activity?	using observations obtained with the low fequency array (lofar), thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and archival very large array (vla)data, we have traced the radio emission to large scales in the complex source4c 35.06 located in the core of the galaxy cluster abell 407. at higher spatialresolution (~4"), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offsetby about 11 kpc (in projection).  at 62 mhz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to210 kpc. at 1.4 ghz and intermediate spatial resolution (~30"), the structureappears to have a helical morphology.  we have derived the characteristics of the radio spectral index across thesource. we show that the source morphology is most likely the result of atleast two episodes of agn activity separated by a dormant period of around 35myr.  the agn is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of abell407. we propose that it is intermittently active as it moves in the denseenvironment in the cluster core. using lofar, we can trace the relic plasmafrom that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than everbefore.  using the the wsrt, we detect hi in absorption against the center of theradio source. the absorption profile is relatively broad (fwhm of 288 km/s),similar to what is found in other clusters.  understanding the duty cycle of the radio emission as well as the triggeringmechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provideimportant constraints to quantify the impact of agn feedback on galaxyevolution. the study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphologicaland spectral information promises to bring new important insights in thisfield.

1507.08932	calibrating the absolute amplitude scale for air showers measured at  lofar	air showers induced by cosmic rays create nanosecond pulses detectable atradio frequencies. these pulses have been measured successfully in the past fewyears at the low frequency array (lofar) and are used to study the propertiesof cosmic rays. for a complete understanding of this phenomenon and theunderlying physical processes, an absolute calibration of the detecting antennasystem is needed. we present three approaches that were used to check andimprove the antenna model of lofar and to provide an absolute calibration ofthe whole system for air shower measurements. two methods are based oncalibrated reference sources and one on a calibration approach using thediffuse radio emission of the galaxy, optimized for short data-sets. anaccuracy of 19% in amplitude is reached. the absolute calibration is alsocompared to predictions from air shower simulations. these results are used toset an absolute energy scale for air shower measurements and can be used as abasis for an absolute scale for the measurement of astronomical transients withlofar.

0807.1057	time-dependent co depletion during the formation of protoplanetary disks	understanding the gas abundance distribution is essential when tracing starformation using molecular line observations. changing density and temperatureconditions cause gas to freeze-out onto dust grains, and this needs to be takeninto account when modeling a collapsing molecular cloud. this study aims toprovide a realistic estimate of the co abundance distribution throughout thecollapse of a molecular cloud. we provide abundance profiles and syntheticspectral lines which can be compared to observations. we use a 2dhydrodynamical simulation of a collapsing cloud and subsequent formation of aprotoplanetary disk as input for the chemical calculations. from the resultingabundances, synthetic spectra are calculated using a molecular excitation andradiation transfer code. we compare three different methods to calculate theabundance of co. our models also consider cosmic ray desorption and the effectsof an increased co binding energy. the resulting abundance profiles arecompared to observations from the literature and are found to agree well. theresulting abundance profiles agree well with analytic approximations, and thecorresponding line fluxes match observational data. our developed method tocalculate abundances in hydrodynamical simulations should greatly aid incomparing these to observations, and can easily be generalized to includegas-phase reaction networks.
