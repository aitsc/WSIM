0902.1534	multi-wavelength study of x-ray luminous clusters at z ~ 0.3 i. star  formation activity of cluster galaxies	the current paradigm of cosmic formation and evolution of galaxy clustersforesees growth mostly through merging. galaxies in the infall region or in thecore of a cluster undergo transformations owing to different environmentalstresses. for two x-ray luminous clusters at redshift z ~ 0.3 with oppositex-ray morphologies, rxcj0014.3-3022 and rxcj2308.3-0211, we assess differencesin galaxy populations as a function of cluster topography. cluster large-scalestructure and substructure are determined from the combined photometry in theb, v, and r bands, and from multi-object optical spectroscopy at lowresolution. a spectral index analysis is performed, based on the [oii] andhdelta features, and the d4000 break, available for more than 100 membergalaxies per cluster. combination of spectral indices and fuv-optical coloursprovides a picture of the star formation history in galaxies. in spite of thepotential presence of a small fraction of galaxies with obscured star formationactivity, the average star-formation history of cluster members is found todepend on cluster-centric distance and on substructure. there is a sharpincrease in star formation activity along two well-defined filamentarystructures of the merging cluster rxcj0014.3-3022, out to its virial radius andbeyond, produced by luminous (l ~ l*) and sub-l* galaxies. conversely, theregular cool-core cluster rxcj2308.3-0211 mostly hosts galaxies which eitherpopulate the red sequence or are becoming passive. these results suggest theexistence of a correspondence between assembly state and overall age of thestellar populations of galaxies inside the virialized region and in thesurrounding large scale structure of massive clusters at z ~ 0.3.

0903.3599	weak lensing observations of potentially x-ray underluminous galaxy  clusters	optically selected clusters of galaxies display a relation between theiroptical mass estimates and their x-ray luminosities lx that has a largescatter. a substantial fraction of optically selected clusters have lxestimates or upper limits significantly below the values expected from thelx-mass relation established for x-ray selected clusters, i.e., these clustersare x-ray underluminous for their mass. we attempt to confirm or falsify thex-ray underluminous nature of two clusters, abell 315 and abell 1456, by usingweak gravitational lensing as a third and independent measure of the clusters'masses. we obtained optical wide-field imaging data and selected backgroundgalaxies using their colors and measured the shear exerted by the tidal fieldof the foreground galaxy clusters. we then fitted parametrized models to ourshear catalogs. after accounting for projections of large-scale structure andhalo triaxiality, we find that a 315 is significantly x-ray underluminous forits mass, while no significant lensing signal was detected for a 1456. were-evaluate earlier kinematic and x-ray analyses of these two clusters anddiscuss the nature of the x-ray underluminous cluster a 315 and why a 1456 wasprobably erroneously identified as being x-ray underluminous.

0905.2853	the orbital velocity anisotropy of cluster galaxies: evolution	in nearby clusters early-type galaxies follow isotropic orbits, while theorbits of late-type galaxies are characterized by slightly radial anisotropy.little is known about the orbits of the different populations of clustergalaxies at redshift above z~0.3. here we investigate the redshift evolution ofthe orbits of cluster galaxies using two samples of galaxy clusters spanningsimilar (evolutionary corrected) mass ranges at different redshifts. thelow-redshift (z~0.0-0.1) sample is extracted from the enacs catalog and thehigh-redshift (z~0.4-0.8) sample is mostly made of clusters from the ediscs.for each of these samples, we solve the jeans equation for hydrostaticequilibrium separately for two cluster galaxy populations, characterized by thepresence and, respectively, absence of emission-lines in their spectra ('elgs'and 'nelgs' hereafter). using two tracers of the gravitational potential allowsto partially break the well known mass-velocity anisotropy degeneracy.  we find no significant evolution for the orbits of elgs. on the other handthe orbits of nelgs do evolve, from radial to isotropic with time. we speculatethat this evolution may be driven by the secular mass growth of galaxy clustersduring their fast accretion phase. the mass density profiles of the clustersare well fit by nfw models both in the low-z and in the high-z samples. thebest-fit nfw concentrations and their redshift evolution are in agreement withthe predictions of lambda cdm cosmological simulations. the evolution of thenumber density profile of nelgs is opposite to that of the mass densityprofile, becoming less concentrated with time, probably a result of thetransformation of elgs into nelgs [abridged].

0906.4443	very deep spectroscopy of the coma cluster line of sight: exploring new  territories	environmental effects have an important influence on cluster galaxies, butstudies at very faint magnitudes (r&gt;21) are almost exclusively based onimaging. we present here a very deep spectroscopic survey of galaxies on theline of sight to coma, based on redshifts obtained with vlt/vimos for 715galaxies in the unprecedented magnitude range 21&lt;r&lt;23 (absolute magnitude -14to -12). we confirm the substructures previously identified in coma by adami etal. (2005a), and identify three new ones. we detect many groups behind coma: alarge structure at z~0.5, the sdss great wall, and a large and very youngstructure at z~0.054. these structures account for the mass maps derived from arecent weak lensing analysis by gavazzi et al. (2009). the orbits of dwarfgalaxies are probably anisotropic and radial, and could originate from fieldgalaxies radially falling into the cluster. spectral characteristics of comadwarf galaxies show that red or absorption line galaxies have larger stellarmasses and are older than blue or emission line galaxies. r&lt;22 galaxies showless prominent absorption lines than r&gt;22 galaxies. this trend is less clearfor field galaxies, suggesting that part of the faint coma galaxies could havebeen recently injected from the field following the ngc 4911 group infall. wepresent a list of five ultra compact dwarf galaxy candidates. we also globallyconfirm spectroscopically our previous results on the galaxy luminosityfunctions and find that dwarf galaxies follow a red sequence similar to thatdrawn by bright galaxies. dwarf galaxies are very abundant in coma, and arepartly field galaxies that have fallen onto the cluster along filaments.

0912.0365	the evolution of mass profiles of galaxy clusters	we determine the average mass profile of galaxy clusters at two differentredshifts and compare its evolution with cosmological model predictions. we usetwo samples of galaxy clusters spanning similar (evolutionary corrected) massranges at different redshifts. the sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.0-0.1)clusters is extracted from the eso nearby abell cluster survey (enacs) catalog.the sample of high-redshift (z ~ 0.4-0.8) clusters is mostly made of clustersfrom the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs). we determine the averagemass-profiles for these two cluster samples by solving the jeans equation forhydrostatic equilibrium, using galaxies as tracers. by using two cluster galaxypopulations, characterized by the presence and, respectively, absence ofemission-lines in their spectra ('elgs' and 'nelgs' hereafter), we are able topartially break the mass-profile orbital-anisotropy degeneracy. we find thatthe mass-profiles of both the nearby and the distant clusters are reasonablywell fitted by a navarro, frenk and white (nfw) model. the best-fit values ofthe nfw concentration parameter are as predicted by cosmological numericalsimulations; cluster mass-density profiles become more concentrated with time.the evolution of the number-density profile of nelgs proceeds in the oppositesense, becoming less concentrated with time. in our analysis we also recoverthe orbital anisotropy of nelgs and elgs . we find that in low-z clusters nelgsfollow almost isotropic orbits and elgs have more radially-elongated orbits. inhigh-z clusters both nelgs and elgs follow radially-elongated orbits. wediscuss these results in terms of the predicted secular mass growth of galaxyclusters and the transformation of elgs into nelgs.

1008.5318	the daft/fada survey. i.photometric redshifts along lines of sight to  clusters in the z=[0.4,0.9] interval	as a contribution to the understanding of the dark energy concept, the darkenergy american french team (daft, in french fada) has started a large projectto characterize statistically high redshift galaxy clusters, infer cosmologicalconstraints from weak lensing tomography, and understand biases relevant forconstraining dark energy and cluster physics in future cluster and cosmologicalexperiments. the purpose of this paper is to establish the basis of referencefor the photo-z determination used in all our subsequent papers, including weaklensing tomography studies. this project is based on a sample of 91 highredshift (z&gt;0.4), massive clusters with existing hst imaging, for which we arepresently performing complementary multi-wavelength imaging. this allows us inparticular to estimate spectral types and determine accurate photometricredshifts for galaxies along the lines of sight to the first ten clusters forwhich all the required data are available down to a limit of i_ab=24/24.5 withthe lephare software. the accuracy in redshift is of the order of 0.05 for therange 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.5. we verified that the technique applied to obtain photometricredshifts works well by comparing our results to with previous works. inclusters, photoz accuracy is degraded for bright absolute magnitudes and forthe latest and earliest type galaxies. the photoz accuracy also only slightlyvaries as a function of the spectral type for field galaxies. as a consequence,we find evidence for an environmental dependence of the photoz accuracy,interpreted as the standard used spectral energy distributions being not verywell suited to cluster galaxies. finally, we modeled the lcdcs 0504 mass withthe strong arcs detected along this line of sight.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1409.5795	the evolution of star formation activity in galaxy groups	we study the evolution of the total star formation (sf) activity, totalstellar mass and halo occupation distribution in massive halos by using one ofthe largest x-ray selected sample of galaxy groups with secure spectroscopicidentification in the major blank field surveys (ecdfs, cdfn, cosmos, aegis).we provide an accurate measurement of sfr for the bulk of the star-forminggalaxies using very deep mid-infrared spitzer mips and far-infrared herschelpacs observations. for undetected ir sources, we provide a well-calibrated sfrfrom sed fitting. we observe a clear evolution in the level of sf activity ingalaxy groups. the total sf activity in the high redshift groups (0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1) ishigher with respect to the low redshift (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5) sample at any mass by0.8+/-0.12 dex. a milder difference (0.35+/-0.1 dex) is observed between thelow redshift bin and the groups at z~0. we show that the level of sf activityis declining more rapidly in the more massive halos than in the more commonlower mass halos. we do not observe any evolution in the halo occupationdistribution and total stellar mass- halo mass relations in groups. the pictureemerging from our findings suggests that the galaxy population in the mostmassive systems is evolving faster than galaxies in lower mass halos,consistently with a "halo downsizing" scenario.

1412.0023	constraining the galaxy mass content in the core of a383 using velocity  dispersion measurements for individual cluster members	we use velocity dispersion measurements of 21 individual cluster members inthe core of abell 383, obtained with mmt hectospec, to separate the galaxy andthe smooth dark halo (dh) lensing contributions. while lensing usuallyconstrains the overall, projected mass density, the innovative use of velocitydispersion measurements as a proxy for masses of individual cluster membersbreaks inherent degeneracies and allows us to (a) refine the constraints onsingle galaxy masses and on the galaxy mass-to-light scaling relation and, as aresult, (b) refine the constraints on the dm-only map, a high-end goal of lensmodelling. the knowledge of cluster member velocity dispersions improves thefit by 17% in terms of the image reproduction $\chi^2$, or 20% in terms of therms. the constraints on the mass parameters improve by ~10% for the dh, whilefor the galaxy component, they are refined correspondingly by ~50%, includingthe galaxy halo truncation radius. for an l$^*$ galaxy with m$^*_b$=-20.96, forexample, we obtain best fitting truncation radius r$^*_{tr}=20.5^{+9.6}_{-6.7}$kpc and velocity dispersion $\sigma^*=324\pm17 km/s$. moreover, by performingthe surface brightness reconstruction of the southern giant arc, we improve theconstraints on r$_{tr}$ of two nearby cluster members, which have measuredvelocity dispersions, by more than ~30%. we estimate the stripped mass forthese two galaxies, getting results that are consistent with numericalsimulations. in the future, we plan to apply this analysis to other galaxyclusters for which velocity dispersions of member galaxies are available.

1503.01339	morphological fractions of galaxies in wings clusters: revisiting the  morphology-density paradigm	we present the morphology-density and morphology-radius relations (t-sigmaand t-r, respectively) obtained from the wings database of galaxies in nearbyclusters. aiming to achieve the best statistics, we exploit the whole sample ofgalaxies brighter than mv=-19.5 (5,504 objects), stacking up the 76 clusters ofthe wings survey altogether. using this global cluster sample, we find that thet-sigma relation holds only in the inner cluster regions (r&lt;1/3xr200), whilethe t-r relation keeps almost unchanged over the whole range of local density.a couple of tests and two sets of numerical simulations support the robustnessof these results against the effects of the limited cluster area coverage ofthe wings imaging. the above mentioned results hold for all cluster masses(x-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion) and all galaxy stellar masses (m).the strength of the t-sigma relation (where present) increases with increasingm, while this effect is not found for the t-r relation. noticeably, theabsence/presence of subclustering determines the presence/absence of thet-sigma relation outside the inner cluster regions, leading us to the generalconclusion that the link between morphology and local density is preserved justin dynamically evolved regions. we hypothesize that some mechanism ofmorphological broadening/redistribution operates in the intermediate/outerregions of substructured (non relaxed) clusters, producing a strong weakeningof the t-sigma relation.

1503.05607	clash-vlt: substructure in the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847 from  kinematics of galaxy populations	in the effort to understand the link between the structure of galaxy clustersand their galaxy populations, we focus on macsj1206.2-0847 at z~0.44 and probeits substructure in the projected phase space through the spectrophotometricproperties of a large number of galaxies from the clash-vlt survey. ouranalysis is mainly based on an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 445 membergalaxies, mostly acquired with vimos@vlt as part of our eso large programme,sampling the cluster out to a radius ~2r200 (4 mpc). we classify 412 galaxiesas passive, with strong hdelta absorption (red and blue galaxies, and withemission lines from weak to very strong. a number of tests for substructuredetection are applied to analyze the galaxy distribution in the velocity space,in 2d space, and in 3d projected phase-space. studied in its entirety, thecluster appears as a large-scale relaxed system with a few secondary, minoroverdensities in 2d distribution. we detect no velocity gradients or evidenceof deviations in local mean velocities. the main feature is the wnw-eseelongation. the analysis of galaxy populations per spectral class highlights amore complex scenario. the passive galaxies and red strong hdelta galaxiestrace the cluster center and the wnw-ese elongated structure. the red stronghdelta galaxies also mark a secondary, dense peak ~2 mpc at ese. the emissionline galaxies cluster in several loose structures, mostly outside r200. theobservational scenario agrees with macs j1206.2-0847 having wnw-ese as thedirection of the main cluster accretion, traced by passive galaxies and redstrong hdelta galaxies. the red strong hdelta galaxies, interpreted aspoststarburst galaxies, date a likely important event 1-2 gyr before the epochof observation. the emission line galaxies trace a secondary, ongoing infallwhere groups are accreted along several directions.

1505.02165	next generation cosmology: constraints from the euclid galaxy cluster  survey	we study the characteristics of the galaxy cluster samples expected from theeuropean space agency's euclid satellite and forecast constraints oncosmological parameters describing a variety of cosmological models. the methodused in this paper, based on the fisher matrix approach, is the same one usedto provide the constraints presented in the euclid red book (laureijs etal.2011). we describe the analytical approach to compute the selection functionof the photometric and spectroscopic cluster surveys. based on the photometricselection function, we forecast the constraints on a number of cosmologicalparameter sets corresponding to different extensions of the standard lambdacdmmodel. the dynamical evolution of dark energy will be constrained to deltaw_0=0.03 and delta w_a=0.2 with free curvature omega_k, resulting in a(w_0,w_a) figure of merit (fom) of 291. including the planck cmb covariancematrix improves the constraints to delta w_0=0.02, delta w_a=0.07 and afom=802. the amplitude of primordial non-gaussianity, parametrised by f_nl,will be constrained to \delta f_nl ~ 6.6 for the local shape scenario, fromeuclid clusters alone. using only euclid clusters, the growth factor parameter\gamma, which signals deviations from gr, will be constrained to delta\gamma=0.02, and the neutrino density parameter to delta omega_\nu=0.0013 (ordelta \sum m_\nu=0.01). we emphasise that knowledge of the observable--massscaling relation will be crucial to constrain cosmological parameters from acluster catalogue. the euclid mission will have a clear advantage in thisrespect, thanks to its imaging and spectroscopic capabilities that will enableinternal mass calibration from weak lensing and the dynamics of clustergalaxies. this information will be further complemented by wide-areamulti-wavelength external cluster surveys that will already be available wheneuclid flies.

1510.05659	clash-vlt: environment-driven evolution of galaxies in the z=0.209  cluster abell 209	the analysis of galaxy properties and the relations among them and theenvironment, can be used to investigate the physical processes driving galaxyevolution. we study the cluster a209 by using the clash-vlt spectroscopic datacombined with subaru photometry, yielding to 1916 cluster members down to astellar mass of 10^{8.6} msun. we determine: i) the stellar mass function ofstar-forming and passive galaxies; ii) the intra-cluster light and itsproperties; iii) the orbits of low- and high-mass passive galaxies; and iv) themass-size relation of etgs. the stellar mass function of the star-forminggalaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passivegalaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. the color distribution of theintra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. theanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies havetangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the bcg. the mass-sizerelation of low-mass passive etgs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,and its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies. low-massgalaxies are also more compact within the scale radius of 0.65 mpc. the ratiobetween stellar and number density profiles shows a mass segregation in thecenter. the comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profilesindicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction. our results areconsistent with a scenario in which the "environmental quenching" of low-massgalaxies is due to mechanisms such as harassment out to r200, starvation andram-pressure stripping at smaller radii, as supported by the analysis of themass function, of the dynamical orbits and of the mass-size relation of passiveearly-types in different regions. our analyses support the idea that theintra-cluster light is formed through the tidal disruption of subgiantgalaxies.

1511.01899	non-linearity and environmental dependence of the star forming galaxies  main sequence	using data from four deep fields (cosmos, aegis, ecdfs, and cdfn), we studythe correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate(sfr) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z&lt;1.1$. to accuratelyestimate the galaxy sfr, we use the deepest available spitzer/mips 24 andherschel/pacs datasets. we distinguish group environments ($m_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$m_{\odot}$) based on the available deep x-raydata and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. weconfirm that the main sequence (ms) of star forming galaxies is not a linearrelation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses ($m_*&gt;10^{10.4-10.6}$ $m_{\odot}$), across all environments. at high redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1$ ), the ms varies little with environment. at low redshift ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean ms towards theregion of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-denseenvironments. we find that the flattening of the ms toward low sfr is due to anincreased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. instead, thedeviation of group galaxies from the ms at low redshift is caused by a largefraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lowerdensity environments. our results suggest that above a mass threshold ($\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$m_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environmentact together in driving the evolution of the sf activity towards lower level.the presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes arealready in place beyond $z\sim$1. the environmental effects appear, instead, atlower redshifts and have a long time-scale.

1512.04555	clash-vlt: a highly precise strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster  rxc j2248.7-4431 (abell s1063) and prospects for cosmography	we perform a comprehensive study of the total mass distribution of the galaxycluster rxcj2248 ($z=0.348$) with a set of high-precision strong lensingmodels, which take advantage of extensive spectroscopic information on manymultiply lensed systems. in the effort to understand and quantify inherentsystematics in parametric strong lensing modelling, we explore a collection of22 models where we use different samples of multiple image families,parametrizations of the mass distribution and cosmological parameters. as inputinformation for the strong lensing models, we use the clash hst imaging dataand spectroscopic follow-up observations, carried out with the vimos and musespectrographs, to identify bona-fide multiple images. a total of 16 backgroundsources, over the redshift range $1.0-6.1$, are multiply lensed into 47 images,24 of which are spectroscopically confirmed and belong to 10 individualsources. the cluster total mass distribution and underlying cosmology in themodels are optimized by matching the observed positions of the multiple imageson the lens plane. we show that with a careful selection of a sample ofspectroscopically confirmed multiple images, the best-fit model reproducestheir observed positions with a rms of $0.3$ in a fixed flat $\lambda$cdmcosmology, whereas the lack of spectroscopic information lead to biases in thevalues of the model parameters. allowing cosmological parameters to varytogether with the cluster parameters, we find (at $68\%$ confidence level)$\omega_m=0.25^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$ and $w=-1.07^{+0.16}_{-0.42}$ for a flat$\lambda$cdm model, and $\omega_m=0.31^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and$\omega_\lambda=0.38^{+0.38}_{-0.27}$ for a universe with $w=-1$ and freecurvature. using toy models mimicking the overall configuration of rxcj2248, weestimate the impact of the line of sight mass structure on the positional rmsto be $0.3\pm 0.1$.(abridged)

astro-ph;0304407	the origin of x-ray emission of two distant (z&gt;1) cluster candidate with  xmm-newton	we present here a study of xmm-newton data of two distant galaxy clustercandidates. one of these was discovered serendipitously in near infrared data,cl j0533-2411, the other one corresponds to the cluster eis j0533-2412 part ofthe eis cluster survey. the estimated redshift of cl j0533-2411 is z=1.2-1.7.eis j0533-2412 is a rich system (lambda_cl=299), with a spectroscopicallyconfirmed redshift of z=1.3. both galaxy concentrations show firm x-raydetections, located within 30" of their optical center. however, we cannotresolve the sources with xmm-newton. if the x-ray emission originates from thex-ray emitting intra-cluster medium (icm) it would be extremely concentratedwhich is rather unlikely (core radii below 14 h_{65}^{-1}kpc and 40h_{65}^{-1}kpc, respectively). we argue that the x-ray sources are more likelyagn members of the galaxy concentrations. we set an upper limit for thebolometric luminosity of a hot icm in the range ~0.7-2.1 10^{44}h_{65}^{-2}erg/s for cl j0533-2411, depending on the exact redshift. for eisj0533-2412 the limit is l_bol=(6.2+/-1.4) 10^{43} h_{65}^{-2}erg/s. weinterpret our result in the following way: eis j0533-2412 (and possibly clj0533-2411) are proto-clusters and show matter overdensities before collapse,which explains the low significance of extended x-ray emission.

(1998) we have obtained acceptable and wellconstrained fits to the observed spectral energy distributions (seds) of 41 ofthese sources, for which additional optical/near-infrared magnitudes, and, insome cases, redshifts, were available. we have then determined the totalinfrared luminosities and star formation rates (sfrs) of these 41 sources, ofwhich 27 are cluster members and 14 are field galaxies at a median redshiftz~0.6.  the seds of most of the isocam cluster members are best fit by models withnegligible star formation in the last ~1 gyr. the 7 faintest cluster membershave a slightly higher, but still very mild, star-formation activity. theisocam-selected cluster galaxies appear to be an unbiased subsample of theoverall cluster population. if a2218 is undergoing a merger, as suggested bysome optical and x-ray analyses, then this merger does not seem to affect themid-infrared properties of its galaxies.  the seds of most isocam-selected field sources are best fit by models withsignificant ongoing (and recent) star formation, resembling those of massivestar-forming spirals or (post)starburst galaxies. their median sfr is 22 solarmasses per year. eight of the 14 field sources are luminous ir galaxies.(abridged)

(1999). these observations have been reanalyzed using a methodspecifically designed for the detection of faint sources that had been appliedto other clusters. five new sources were detected and the resulting cumulativetotal of ten sources all have optical counterparts. the mid-infrared sourcesare identified with three cluster members, three foreground galaxies, anextremely red object, a star and two galaxies of unknown redshift. the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of the galaxies are fit with models from aselection, using the program grasil. best-fits are obtained, in general, withmodels of galaxies with ongoing star formation. for three cluster members theinfrared luminosities derived from the model seds are between ~5.7x10^10 lsunand 1.4x10^11 lsun, corresponding to infrared star formation rates between 10and 24 msun yr^-1. the two cluster galaxies that have optical classificationsare in the butcher-oemler region of the color-magnitude diagramme. the threeforeground galaxies have infrared luminosities between 1.5x10^10 lsun and9.4x10^10 lsun yielding infrared star formation rates between 3 and 16 msunyr^-1. two of the foreground galaxies are located in two foreground galaxyenhancements (boschin et al. 2004). including abell 2219, six distant clustersof galaxies have been mapped with isocam and luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs)have been found in three of them. the presence of lirgs in abell 2219strengthens the association between luminous infrared galaxies in clusters andrecent or ongoing cluster merger activity.

astro-ph;0506201	rass-sdss galaxy cluster survey. iv. a ubiquitous dwarf galaxy  population in clusters	we analyze the luminosity functions (lfs) of a subsample of 69 clusters fromthe rass-sdss galaxy cluster catalog. when calculated within the clusterphysical sizes, given by r200 or r500, all the cluster lfs appear to have thesame shape, well fitted by a composite of two schechter functions with a markedupturn and a steepening at the faint-end. previously reportedcluster-to-cluster variations of the lf faint-end slope are due to the use of ametric cluster aperture for computing the lf of clusters of different masses.  we determine the composite lf for early- and late-type galaxies, where thetyping is based on the galaxy u-r colors. the late-type lf is well fitted by asingle schechter function with a steep slope (alpha=-2.0 in the r band, withinr200}). the early-type lf instead cannot be fitted by a single schechterfunction, and a composite of two schechter functions is needed. the faint-endupturn of the global cluster lf is due to the early-type cluster galaxies. theshape of the bright-end tail of the early-type lf does not seem to depend uponthe local galaxy density or the distance from the cluster center. the late-typelf shows a significant variation only very near the cluster center. on theother hand, the faint-end tail of the early-type lf shows a significant andcontinuous variation with the environment. we provide evidence that the processresponsible for creating the excess population of dwarf early type galaxies inclusters is a threshold process that occurs when the density exceeds ~500 timesthe critical density of the universe. we interpret our results in the contextof the 'harassment' scenario, where faint early-type cluster galaxies arepredicted to be the descendants of tidally-stripped late-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0605151	on the efficiency and reliability of cluster mass estimates based on  member galaxies	we study the efficiency and reliability of cluster mass estimators that arebased on the projected phase-space distribution of galaxies in a clusterregion. to this aim, we analyse a data-set of 62 clusters extracted from aconcordance lcdm cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. galaxies (or darkmatter particles) are first selected in cylinders of given radius (from 0.5 to1.5 mpc/h) and ~200 mpc/h length. cluster members are then identified byapplying a suitable interloper removal algorithm.  two cluster mass estimators are considered: the virial mass estimator (mvir),and a mass estimator (msigma) based entirely on the cluster velocity dispersionestimate. mvir overestimates the true mass by ~10%, and msigma underestimatesthe true mass by ~15%, on average, for sample sizes of &gt; 60 cluster members.for smaller sample sizes, the bias of the virial mass estimator substantiallyincreases, while the msigma estimator becomes essentially unbiased. thedispersion of both mass estimates increases by a factor ~2 as the number ofcluster members decreases from ~400 to ~20. the bias in the mvir estimates isreduced in clusters without significant evidence for subclustering, and whenonly early-type galaxies are selected.  radially-dependent incompleteness can drastically affect mvir estimates, butleaves the msigma estimates almost unaffected. other observational effects,like centering and velocity errors, and different observational apertures, havelittle effect on the mass estimates.

astro-ph;0606260	rass-sdss galaxy cluster survey. vii. on the cluster mass to light ratio  and the halo occupation distribution	we explore the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy clusters and its relation to thecluster mass. we study the relations among the optical luminosity ($l_{op}$),the cluster mass ($m_{200}$) and the number of cluster galaxies within$r_{200}$ ($n_{gal}$) in a sample of 217 galaxy clusters with confirmed 3doverdensity. we correct for projection effects, by determining the galaxysurface number density profile in our cluster sample. this is best fitted by acored king profile in low and intermediate mass systems. the core radiusdecreases with cluster mass, and, for the highest mass clusters, the profile isbetter represented by a generalized king profile or a cuspy navarro, frenk &amp;white profile. we find a very tight proportionality between $l_{op}$ and$n_{gal}$, which, in turn, links the cluster mass-to-light ratio to the halooccupation distribution $n_{gal}$ vs. $m_{200}$. after correcting forprojection effects, the slope of the $l_{op}-m_{200}$ and $n_{gal}-m_{200}$relations is found to be $0.92\pm0.03$, close, but still significantly lessthan unity. we show that the non-linearity of these relations cannot beexplained by variations of the galaxy luminosity distributions and of thegalaxy m/l with the cluster mass. we suggest that the nonlinear relationbetween number of galaxies and cluster mass reflects an underlying nonlinearrelation between number of subhaloes and halo mass.

(2004), which is based on sdss spectra. we only considergalaxies with m_r &lt;= -20.25 in our analysis, and exclude agns. we find thatboth sigma_sfr and m_star are correlated with all the cluster globalquantities. a partial correlation analysis show that all the correlations areinduced by the fundamental one between sigma_sfr and n_gal, hence there is noevidence that the cluster properties affect the mean sfr or m_star per galaxy.the relations between sigma_sfr and m_star, on one side, and both n_gal andm_200, on the other side, are linear, i.e. we see no evidence that differentclusters have different sfr or different m_star per galaxy and per unit mass.the fraction f_sf does not depend on any cluster property considered, while f_bdoes depend on l_x. we note that a significant fraction of star-forming clustergalaxies are red (~25% of the whole cluster galaxy population). we concludethat the global cluster properties are unable to affect the sf properties ofcluster galaxies, but the presence of the x-ray luminous intra-cluster mediumcan affect their colors, perhaps through the ram-pressure stripping mechanism.

astro-ph;0609191	properties of the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of  clusters	we present a study of the galaxy population predicted by hydrodynamicalsimulations for a set of 19 galaxy clusters based on the gadget-2 tree+sphcode. these simulations include gas cooling, star formation, a detailedtreatment of stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, as well as sn energyfeedback in the form of galactic winds. we compute the spectro-photometricproperties of the simulated galaxies. all simulations have been performed fortwo choices of the stellar initial mass function: a standard salpeter imf, anda top-heavier imf. several of the observational properties of the galaxypopulation in nearby clusters are reproduced fairly well by simulations. asalpeter imf is successful in accounting for the slope and the normalization ofthe color-magnitude relation for the bulk of the galaxy population. simulatedclusters have a relation between mass and optical luminosity which generallyagrees with observations, both in normalization and slope. we find thatgalaxies are generally bluer, younger and more star forming in the clusteroutskirts, thus reproducing the observational trends. however, simulatedclusters have a total number of galaxies which is significantly smaller thanthe observed one, falling short by about a factor 2-3. finally, the brightestcluster galaxies are always predicted to be too massive and too blue, whencompared to observations, due to gas overcooling in the core cluster regions,even in the presence of a rather efficient sn feedback.

astro-ph;0610738	the agn fraction - velocity dispersion relation in clusters of galaxies	some previous investigations have found that the fraction (f_agn) of activegalactic nuclei (agns) is lower in clusters than in the field. this can resultfrom the suppression of galaxy-galaxy mergers in high-velocity dispersion(sigma_v) clusters, if the formation and/or fueling of agns is directly relatedto the merging process. we investigate the existence of a relation betweenf_agn and sigma_v in galaxy clusters in order to shed light on the formationand evolution processes of agns and cluster galaxies. using data from the sloandigital sky survey we determine f_agn and sigma_v for the clusters in twosamples, extracted from the catalogs of popesso et al. (2006a) and miller etal. (2005), and excluding clusters with significant evidence for substructures.we find a significant f_agn-sigma_v anti-correlation. clusters with sigma_vlower and, respectively, higher than 500 km/s have agn fractions of $0.21 \pm0.01$ and $0.15 \pm 0.01$, on average. the f_agn-sigma_v relation can bedescribed by a model that assumes f_agn is proportional to the galaxies mergingrate, plus a constant. since f_agn increases with decreasing sigma_v, agns arelikely to have played a significant role in heating the intra-cluster mediumand driving galaxy evolution in cluster precursors and groups.

astro-ph;9411025	on the galaxy luminosity function in the central regions of the coma  cluster	we have obtained new redshifts for 265 objects in the central48~$\times$~25~arcmin$^2$ region of the coma cluster. when supplemented withliterature data, our redshift sample is 95~\% complete up to a magnitudeb$_{26.5}$=18.0 (the magnitudes are taken from the photometric sample of godwinet al. 1983). using redshift-confirmed membership for 205 galaxies, and thelocation in the colour-magnitude diagram for another 91 galaxies, we have builta sample of cluster members which is complete up to b$_{26.5}$=20.0. we showthat the coma cluster luminosity function cannot be adequately fitted by asingle schechter (1976) function, because of a dip in the magnitudedistribution at b$_{26.5}$$\sim$17. the superposition of an erlang (or a gauss)and a schechter function provides a significantly better fit. we compare theluminosity function of coma to those of other clusters, and of the field.luminosity functions for rich clusters look similar, with a maximum at $m_{b}\simeq -19.5 + 5 \times \log h_{50}$, while the virgo and the field luminosityfunctions show a nearly monotonic behaviour. these differences may be producedby physical processes related to the environment which affect the luminositiesof a certain class of cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;9507031	velocity dispersions and x-ray temperatures of galaxy clusters	using a large and well-controlled sample of clusters of galaxies, weinvestigate the relation between cluster velocity dispersions and x-raytemperatures of intra-cluster gas. in order to obtain a reliable estimate ofthe total velocity dispersion of a cluster, independent of the level ofanisotropies in galaxy orbits, we analyze the integrated velocity dispersionprofiles over increasing distances from the cluster centers. distortions in thevelocity fields, the effect of close clusters, the presence of substructures,and the presence of a population of (spiral) galaxies not in virial equilibriumwith the cluster potential are taken into account. using our final sample of 37clusters, for which a reliable estimate of the velocity dispersion could beobtained, we derive a relation between the velocity dispersions and the x-raytemperatures, with a scatter reduced by more than 30 % with respect to previousworks. a chi square fit to the temperature-velocity dispersion relation doesnot exclude the hypothesis that the ratio between galaxy and gas energy density(the so-called spectral beta) is a constant for all clusters. in particular,the value of beta=1, corresponding to energy equipartition, is acceptable.

astro-ph;9512111	unveiling hidden structures in the coma cluster	we have assembled a large data-set of 613 galaxy redshifts in the comacluster, the largest presently available for a cluster of galaxies. we havedefined a sample of cluster members complete to b$_{26.5}=20.0$, using amembership criterion based on the galaxy velocity, when available, or on thegalaxy magnitude and colour, otherwise. such a data set allows us to definenearly complete samples within a region of 1~\mpc\ radius, with a sufficientnumber of galaxies per sample to make statistical analyses possible. using thissample and the {\em rosat} pspc x--ray image of the cluster, we havere-analyzed the structure and kinematics of coma, by applying the wavelet andadaptive kernel techniques. a striking coincidence of features is found in thedistributions of galaxies and hot intracluster gas. the two central dominantgalaxies, ngc4874 and ngc4889, are surrounded by two galaxy groups, mostlypopulated with galaxies brighter than b$_{26.5}=17$ and well separated invelocity space. on the contrary, the fainter galaxies tend to form a singlesmooth structure with a central peak coinciding in position with a secondarypeak detected in x--rays, and located between the two dominant galaxies; wesuggest to identify this structure with the main body of the coma cluster. acontinuous velocity gradient is found in the central distribution of thesefaint galaxies, a probable signature of tidal interactions rather thanrotation. there is evidence for a bound population of bright galaxies aroundother brightest cluster members. altogether, the coma cluster structure seemsto be better traced by the faint galaxy population, the bright galaxies beinglocated in subclusters. we discuss this evidence in terms of an ongoingaccretion of groups onto the cluster.

astro-ph;9610168	the eso nearby abell cluster survey. iii. distribution and kinematics of  emission-line galaxies	we have studied the frequency of occurrence, the kinematics and the spatialdistribution of emission-line galaxies (elg) in clusters in the eso nearbyabell cluster survey (enacs). more than 90% of the elg are spirals, but the elgrepresent only 30% of all spirals. the true elg fraction in clusters is 0.10;this is consistent with that in the field (0.21) as a result of differences inmorphological mix. the average elg fraction decreases with increasing velocitydispersion of the cluster. only 1/5 of the clusters shows a significantdifference in the average velocities of the elg and the other (non-elg)galaxies; in a similar fraction of the clusters significant differences invelocity dispersion are seen. yet, the velocity dispersion of the elg is, onaverage, 20% larger than that of the non-elg. this larger velocity dispersionis largely intrinsic, i.e. it is not likely to be the result of velocityoffsets of the elg. the surface density of the elg is significantly less peakedtowards the centre than that of the non-elg. the elg are distributed fairlysmoothly within the cluster with at most 25% in compact substructures. thedistribution and kinematics of the elg yield virial mass estimates that, onaverage, are 50% higher than those based on the non-elg. this probably meansthat the elg are on more radial orbits than the non-elg. all observedproperties of the elg are consistent with most of them being on their firstapproach of the high-density cluster core.

astro-ph;9709256	the fundamental plane of clusters of galaxies	we have used the eso nearby abell cluster survey (enacs) in combination withthe cosmos galaxy catalogue, to investigate the existence of a fundamentalplane (fp) for rich clusters of galaxies. the 20 clusters with the most regularprojected galaxy distributions appear to define a quite narrow fp, which issimilar to the fp found by schaeffer et al., who used other clusters. ourcluster fp appears to be different from that of ellipticals, as well as fromthe virial prediction. the latter fact may have several physical explanations,or a combination thereof. if m/l varies with l this will change the fp slopeaway from the virial slope. differences in dynamical structure between clusterswill also produce deviations from the virial fp. in view of the longvirialization time-scales in all but the very central parts of galaxy clusters,the deviation of the cluster fp from the virial expectation may also resultfrom clusters not being totally virialized. the scatter of the observationsaround the cluster fp is fairly small. an important part of the observedscatter is likely to be intrinsic. if this intrinsic spread were dueexclusively to deviations from the hubble flow it would imply cluster peculiarvelocities of at most about 1000 km.s-1.

astro-ph;9709268	segregations in clusters of galaxies	we analyse a sample of about 2000 galaxies in 40 regular clusters, to lookfor evidence of segregation with respect to galaxy luminosities andmorphological types. we find evidence of luminosity segregation for galaxiesbrighter than $m_r &lt; -21.5$, i.e. typically the four brightest members of eachcluster. we also find evidence of morphological segregation: both thecore-radius and the velocity dispersion increase along the hubble sequence(ellipticals - s0 - early spirals - late spirals). galaxies of different typeshave different velocity dispersion profiles, being steeper for later typegalaxies. simple modelling allows us to show that elliptical (and, to a lesserextent, s0) orbits are mostly tangential in the cluster core, and nearlyisotropic outside, while spiral (in particular late-spiral) orbits arepredominantly radial. a viable interpretation of our results is that (1) latespirals, at variance with other type galaxies, are a non-virialized clusterpopulation, still on partially radial infalling orbits, (2) the ellipticalphase-space distribution is evolving towards energy equipartition through theprocess of dynamical friction, (3) s0 and early-spirals have intermediatedistributions between these two extremes.

astro-ph;9804172	enacsvii, galaxy density profiles of rich clusters of galaxies	we have analyzed the projected galaxy distributions in a subset of the enacs/cosmos cluster sample. we made maximum-likelihood fits to the distribution ofcosmos galaxies for 4 theoretical profiles, with `cores' (generalized king- andhubble-profiles) and with `cusps' (generalized navarro et al., or nfw, and devaucouleurs profiles). we use the likelihood ratio to investigate whether theobservations are better described by profiles with cusps or with cores. takingthe king and nfw profiles as model of either class, we find that about 75% ofthe clusters are better fitted by the king profile than by the nfw profile.however, for the individual clusters the preference for the king profile israrely significant. when we limit ourselves to the central regions it appearsthat the significance increases drastically, with 65% of the clusters showing astrong preference for a king over an nfw profile. we constructed compositeclusters from the cosmos and enacs data, taking special care to avoid thecreation or the destruction of cusps. we scale by different ways (projecteddistances, core radii, r_{200}).in all three cases we find that the kingprofile is clearly preferred over the nfw profile. however, this preference isnot shared by the brightest galaxies. we conclude that these galaxies arerepresented almost equally well by king and nfwprofiles, but that thedistribution of the fainter galaxies clearly shows a core rather than a cusp.finally, we compared the outer slope of the galaxy distributions in ourclusterswith results for model calculations with different cosmological parameters. weconclude that the observed profile slope indicates a low value for omega_0.this is consistent with the direct estimate of omega_0 based on the m/l ratiosof the individual clusters.

astro-ph;9810480	an ultra-deep isocam observation through a cluster-lens	we present results of ultra-deep isocam observations through a cluster-lensat 7 and 15 micron with the infrared space observatory (iso) satellite. theseobservations reveal a large number of luminous mid-infrared (mir) sources.cross-identification in the optical and near-infrared (nir) wavebands showsthat about half of the 7 micron sources are cluster galaxies. the other 7micron and almost all 15 micron sources are identified as lensed distantgalaxies. thanks to the gravitational amplification they constitute thefaintest mir detected sources, allowing us to extend the number counts in boththe 7 and 15 micron bands. in particular, we find that the 15 micron countshave a steep slope alpha_15 = -1.5 +/- 0.3 and are large, with n_15 (&gt;30microjy}) = 13 +/- 5 per square arcmin. these numbers rule out non-evolutionarymodels and favour very strong evolution. down to our counts limit, we foundthat the resolved 7 and 15 microns background radiation intensity isrespectively (2 +/-0.5) 10^(-9) and (5 +/-1) 10^(-9) w m^(-2) sr^(-1).

astro-ph;9810500	the eso nearby abell cluster survey: properties of the galaxies	in this paper we summarize the main properties of the enacs (the eso nearbyabell cluster survey), which was one of the eso keyprogrammes carried out inthe first half of the 1990's, and we discuss some recent work on the propertiesof the galaxies in the rich clusters in the enacs sample. we stress theimportance of the enacs sample as a local, volume-limited sample of rich acoclusters, which in many respects can serve as a local calibration of theproperties of optically selected rich clusters. however, by itself the enacshas also provided several useful insights into the properties of a sample ofrich clusters, and of the galaxies in them.  here, we describe recent results on the properties of the galaxies in theenacs clusters: in particular their morphological types (inferred from thespectrum) and their projected distribution. combining the morphological datawith ccd photometry and internal velocity dispersions, we will study thefundamental plane of early-type galaxies. we discuss some preliminary resultsabout the universality of the fundamental planes in a few enacs clusters.

astro-ph;9810501	the eso nearby abell cluster survey: kinematics of galaxies in clusters	we summarize several results based on the velocity data-set for clustergalaxies provided by enacs (the eso nearby abell cluster survey). we describethe distribution of velocity dispersions of a complete sample of rich galaxyclusters, and compare it to the distribution of cluster x-ray temperatures, andwith predictions of theoretical models. we then address the issue of theexistence of a fundamental plane (fp) for rich clusters, first suggested byschaeffer et al. we confirm the existence of this fp with the enacs data-set.the cluster fp is different from the fp of elliptical galaxies, and from thevirial prediction. some implications of the cluster fp are discussed. finally,we describe the phase-space distributions of different populations of clustergalaxies. different galaxy classes are defined according to their morphologicalor spectral type, and the presence of emission-lines. star-forming (late-type)galaxies have a velocity dispersion profile that (in combination with theirwider spatial distribution) is suggestive of first infall into the cluster. onthe contrary, quiescent (early-type) galaxies show evidence of a dynamicallyrelaxed distribution.

(1999). these results support the a2390 result that the resolved 7 and15 microns background radiation intensities are 1.7 (+/- 0.5) x 10^-9 and 3.3(+/- 1.3) x 10^-9 w/m^2/sr, respectively, integrating from 30 microjy to 50mjy.
