0901.1789	on the evolution of the molecular line profiles induced by the  propagation of c-shock waves	we present the first results of the expected variations of the molecular lineemission arising from material recently affected by c-shocks (shockprecursors). our parametric model of the structure of c-shocks has been coupledwith a radiative transfer code to calculate the molecular excitation and lineprofiles of shock tracers such as sio, and of ion and neutral molecules such ash13co+ and hn13c, as the shock propagates through the unperturbed medium. ourresults show that the sio emission arising from the early stage of the magneticprecursor typically has very narrow line profiles slightly shifted in velocitywith respect to the ambient cloud. this narrow emission is generated in theregion where the bulk of the ion fluid has already slipped to larger velocitiesin the precursor as observed toward the young l1448-mm outflow. this stronglysuggests that the detection of narrow sio emission and of an ion enhancement inyoung shocks, is produced by the magnetic precursor of c-shocks. in addition,our model shows that the different velocity components observed toward thisoutflow can be explained by the coexistence of different shocks at differentevolutionary stages, within the same beam of the single-dish observations.

0909.0871	unveiling the main heating sources in the cepheus a hw2 region	we present high angular resolution pdbi images (beam of ~0.33'') of thej=27-26 line from several vibrational levels (v7=1 and v6=1) of hc3n towardcepheus a hw2. these images reveal the two main heating sources in the cluster:one centered in the disk collimating the hw2 radio jet (the hw2 disk), and theother associated with a hot core 0.3'' northeast hw2 (the hc). this is thefirst time that vibrationally excited emission of hc3n is spatially resolved ina disk. the kinematics of this emission shows that the hw2 disk rotatesfollowing a keplerian law. we derive the temperature profiles in the twoobjects from the excitation of hc3n along the hw2 disk and the hc. theseprofiles reveal that both objects are centrally heated and show temperaturegradients. the inner and hotter regions have temperatures of 350+-30k and270+-20k for the hw2 disk and the hc, respectively. in the cooler and outerregions, the temperature drops to 250+-30k in the hw2 disk, and to 220+-15k inthe hc. the estimated luminosity of the heating source of the hw2 disk is~2.2e4lo, and 3000lo for the hc. the most massive protostar in the hw2 regionis the powering source of the hw2 radio jet. we discuss the formation ofmultiple systems in this cluster. the proximity of the hc to hw2 suggest thatthese sources likely form a binary system of b stars, explaining the observedprecession of the hw2 radio jet.

0707.1308	discovery of interstellar propylene (ch_2chch_3): missing links in  interstellar gas-phase chemistry	we report the discovery of propylene (also called propene, ch_2chch_3) withthe iram 30-m radio telescope toward the dark cloud tmc-1. propylene is themost saturated hydrocarbon ever detected in space through radio astronomicaltechniques. in spite of its weak dipole moment, 6 doublets (a and e species)plus another line from the a species have been observed with main beamtemperatures above 20 mk. the derived total column density of propylene is 410^13 cm^-2, which corresponds to an abundance relative to h_2 of 4 10^-9,i.e., comparable to that of other well known and abundant hydrocarbons in thiscloud, such as c-c_3h_2. although this isomer of c_3h_6 could play an importantrole in interstellar chemistry, it has been ignored by previous chemical modelsof dark clouds as there seems to be no obvious formation pathway in gas phase.the discovery of this species in a dark cloud indicates that a thoroughanalysis of the completeness of gas phase chemistry has to be done.

0704.1617	high-resolution study of a star-forming cluster in the cep-a hw2 region	due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the cepheus a eaststar-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formationprocesses. based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattenedmolecular gas distribution around the yso hw2 may be a 350-au-radius massiveprotostellar disk. goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of thisstructure. we have employed the plateau de bure interferometer to acquire(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such asmethyl cyanide (ch3cn) and silicon monoxide (sio), towards the hw2 position. onthe 1-arcsecond (about 725 au) scale, the flattened distribution of moleculargas around hw2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the planeof the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one ispowering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line ofsight. the presence of a protostellar disk around hw2 is not ruled out, butsuch structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or usingdifferent molecular tracers.

1005.1263	molecular gas chemistry in agn. ii. high-resolution imaging of sio  emission in ngc1068: shocks or xdr?	this paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from themolecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (cnd) of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068.single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of siliconmonoxide(sio) in the cnd of ngc1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude withrespect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in thegalaxy. we aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the sio enhancement. wehave imaged with the iram plateau de bure interferometer the emission of thesio(2-1) and cn(2--1) lines in ngc1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,respectively. we have also obtained complementary iram 30m observations of hncoand methanol (ch3oh) lines. sio is detected in a disk of 400pc size around theagn. sio abundances in the cnd of (1-5)xe-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitudeabove those measured in the starburst ring. the overall abundance of cn in thecnd is high: (0.2-1)xe-07. the abundances of sio and cn are enhanced at theextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the agn(r&lt;70pc). abundances measured for cn and sio, and the correlation of cn/co andsio/co ratios with hard x-ray irradiation, suggest that the cnd of ngc1068 hasbecome a giant x-ray dominated region (xdr). the extreme properties ofmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of ngc1068 result from theinterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.whereas xdr chemistry offers a simple explanation for cn and sio in ngc1068,the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. the inclusion of dust grainchemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of othermolecular species, like hcn, which are under-predicted by xdr models.

1005.1671	strong absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride: herschel/hifi  observations of the sight-line to g10.6-0.4 (w31c)	we report the detection of strong absorption by interstellar hydrogenfluoride along the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source g10.6-0.4(w31c). we have used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, toobserve the 1232.4763 ghz j=1-0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band5a receiver. the resultant spectrum shows weak hf emission from g10.6-0.4 atlsr velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption byforeground material at lsr velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. the spectrumis similar to that of the 1113.3430 ghz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,although at some frequencies the hf (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearlyexceeds that of para-h2o. the optically-thick hf absorption that we haveobserved places a conservative lower limit of 1.6e+14 cm-2 on the hf columndensity along the sight-line to g10.6-0.4. our lower limit on the hf abundance,6e-9 relative to hydrogen nuclei, implies that hydrogen fluoride accounts forbetween ~ 30 and 100% of the fluorine nuclei in the gas phase along thissight-line. this observation corroborates theoretical predictions that -because the unique thermochemistry of fluorine permits the exothermic reactionof f atoms with molecular hydrogen - hf will be the dominant reservoir ofinterstellar fluorine under a wide range of conditions.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1007.1523	herschel observations in the ultracompact hii region mon r2: water in  dense photon-dominated regions (pdrs)	mon r2, at a distance of 830 pc, is the only ultracompact hii region (uc hii)where the photon-dominated region (pdr) between the ionized gas and themolecular cloud can be resolved with herschel. hifi observations of theabundant compounds 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+, cs, ch, and nh have been used toderive the physical and chemical conditions in the pdr, in particular the waterabundance. the 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+ and cs observations are welldescribed assuming that the emission is coming from a dense (n=5e6 cm-3,n(h2)&gt;1e22 cm-2) layer of molecular gas around the uc hii. based on ouro-h2-18o observations, we estimate an o-h2o abundance of ~2e-8. this is theaverage ortho-water abundance in the pdr. additional h2-18o and/or water linesare required to derive the water abundance profile. a lower density envelope(n~1e5 cm-3, n(h2)=2-5e22 cm-2) is responsible for the absorption in the nh1_1-0_2 line. the emission of the ch ground state triplet is coming from bothregions with a complex and self-absorbed profile in the main component. theradiative transfer modeling shows that the 13co and hco+ line profiles areconsistent with an expansion of the molecular gas with a velocity law, v_e =0.5x (r/rout)^{-1} km/s, although the expansion velocity is poorly constrained bythe observations presented here.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1009.1450	detection of oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ towards orion~kl	we report observations of the reactive molecular ions oh$^+$, h$_2$o$^+$, andh$_3$o$^+$ towards orion kl with herschel/hifi. all three $n=1-0$fine-structure transitions of oh$^+$ at 909, 971, and 1033ghz and bothfine-structure components of the doublet {\it ortho}-h$_2$o$^+$ $1_{11}-0_{00}$transition at 1115 and 1139ghz were detected; an upper limit was obtained forh$_3$o$^+$. oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ are observed purely in absorption, showing anarrow component at the source velocity of 9 kms$^{-1}$, and a broadblueshifted absorption similar to that reported recently for hf and {\itpara}-h$_{2}^{18}$o, and attributed to the low velocity outflow of orion kl. weestimate column densities of oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ for the 9 km s$^{-1}$component of $9 \pm 3 \times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $7 \pm 2 \times10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$, and those in the outflow of $1.9 \pm 0.7 \times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $1.0 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$. upper limits of$2.4\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $8.7\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ were derived forthe column densities of {\it ortho} and {\it para}-h$_3$o$^+$ from transitionsnear 985 and 1657ghz. the column densities of the three ions are up to an orderof magnitude lower than those obtained from recent observations of w31c andw49n. the comparatively low column densities may be explained by a higher gasdensity despite the assumption of a very high ionization rate.

0709.0542	the largest oxigen bearing organic molecule repository	we present the first detection of complex aldehydes and isomers in threetypical molecular clouds located within 200pc of the center of our galaxy.  we find very large abundances of these complex organic molecules (coms) inthe central molecular zone (cmz), which we attribute to the ejection of comsfrom grain mantles by shocks. the relative abundances of the different comswith respect to that of ch3oh are strikingly similar for the three sources,located in very different environments in the cmz. the similar relativeabundances point toward a unique grain mantle composition in the cmz. studyingthe galactic center clouds and objects in the galactic disk having largeabundances of coms, we find that more saturated molecules are more abundantthan the non-saturated ones. we also find differences between the relativeabundance between coms in the cmz and the galactic disk, suggesting differentchemical histories of the grain mantles between the two regions in the galaxyfor the complex aldehydes. different possibilities for the grain chemistry onthe icy mantles in the gc clouds are briefly discussed. cosmic rays can play animportant role in the grain chemistry. with these new detections, the molecularclouds in the galactic center appear to be one of the best laboratories forstudying the formation of coms in the galaxy.

1012.3753	the submillimeter array 1.3 mm line survey of arp 220	we present the first aperture synthesis unbiased spectral line survey towardan extragalactic object. the survey covered the 40 ghz frequency range between202 and 242 ghz of the 1.3 mm atmospheric window. we find that 80% of theobserved band shows molecular emission, with 73 features identified from 15molecular species and 6 isotopologues. the 13c isotopic substitutions of hc3nand transitions from h2(18)o, 29sio, and ch2co are detected for the first timeoutside the galaxy. within the broad observed band, we estimate that 28% of thetotal measured flux is due to the molecular line contribution, with co onlycontributing 9% to the overall flux. we present maps of the co emission at aresolution of 2.9"x1.9" which, though not enough to resolve the two nuclei,recover all the single-dish flux. the 40 ghz spectral scan has been modelledassuming lte conditions and abundances are derived for all identified species.the chemical composition of arp 220 shows no clear evidence of an agn impact onthe molecular emission but seems indicative of a purely starburst-heated ism.the overabundance of h2s and the low isotopic ratios observed suggest achemically enriched environment by consecutive bursts of star formation, withan ongoing burst at an early evolutionary stage. the large abundance of water(~10^-5), derived from the isotopologue h2(18)o, as well as the vibrationallyexcited emission from hc3n and ch3cn are claimed to be evidence of massive starforming regions within arp 220. moreover, the observations put strongconstraints on the compactness of the starburst event in arp 220. we estimatethat such emission would require ~2-8x10^6 hot cores, similar to those found inthe sgr b2 region in the galactic center, concentrated within the central 700pc of arp 220.

1107.2067	variability of the sio thermal line emission toward the young l1448-mm  outflow	the detection of narrow sio thermal emission toward young outflows has beenproposed to be a signature of the magnetic precursor of c-shocks. recentmodeling of the sio emission across c-shocks predicts variations in the sioline intensity and line shape at the precursor and intermediate-velocityregimes in only few years. we present high-angular resolution (3.8"x3.3")images of the thermal sio j=2-1 emission toward the l1448-mm outflow in twoepochs (november 2004-february 2005, march-april 2009). several siocondensations have appeared at intermediate velocities (20-50 km/s) toward thered-shifted lobe of the outflow since 2005. toward one of the condensations(clump d), systematic differences of the dirty beams between 2005 and 2009could be responsible for the sio variability. at higher velocities (50-80km/s), sio could also have experienced changes in its intensity. we proposethat the sio variability toward l1448-mm is due to a real sio enhancement byyoung c-shocks at the internal working surface between the jet and the ambientgas. for the precursor regime (5.2-9.2 km/s), several narrow and faint siocomponents are detected. narrow sio tends to be compact, transient and showselongated (bow-shock) morphologies perpendicular to the jet. we speculate thatthese features are associated with the precursor of c-shocks appearing at theinterface of the new sio components seen at intermediate velocities.

1209.1672	kinetic temperatures toward x1/x2 orbit interceptions regions and giant  molecular loops in the galactic center region	context: it is well known that the kinetic temperatures, tkin, of themolecular clouds in the galactic center region are higher than in typical diskclouds. however, the tkin of the molecular complexes found at higher latitudestowards the giant molecular loops in the central region of the galaxy is so farunknown. the gas of these high latitude molecular clouds (hereafter referred toas halo clouds) is located in a region where the gas in the disk may interactwith the gas in the halo in the galactic center region.  aims: to derive tkin in the molecular clouds at high latitude and understandthe physical process responsible for the heating of the molecular gas both inthe central molecular zone (the concentration of molecular gas in the inner 500pc) and in the giant molecular loops.  methods: we measured the metastable inversion transitions of nh3 from (1,1)to (6,6) toward six positions selected throughout the galactic central disk andhalo. we used rotational diagrams and large velocity gradient modeling toestimate the kinetic temperatures toward all the sources. we also observedother molecules like sio, hnco, cs, c34s, c18o, and 13co, to derive thedensities and to trace different physical processes (shocks, photodissociation,dense gas) expected to dominate the heating of the molecular gas.  results: we derive for the first time tkin of the high latitude cloudsinteracting with the disk in the galactic center region. we find highrotational temperatures in all the observed positions. we derive two kinetictemperature components (150 k and 40 k) for the positions in the centralmolecular zone, and only the warm kinetic temperature component for the cloudstoward the giant molecular loops. the fractional abundances derived from thedifferent molecules suggest that shocks provide the main heating mechanismthroughout the galactic center, also at high latitudes

1211.6659	evidence for co shock excitation in ngc 6240 from herschel spire  spectroscopy	we present herschel spire fts spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infraredgalaxy ngc 6240. in total 20 lines are detected, including co j=4-3 throughj=13-12, 6 h2o rotational lines, and [ci] and [nii] fine-structure lines. theco to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in ngc 6240 than mrk 231.although the co ladders of ngc 6240 and mrk 231 are very similar, uv and/orx-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gasin ngc 6240. we applied both c and j shock models to the h2 v=1-0 s(1) andv=2-1 s(1) lines and the co rotational ladder. the co ladder is best reproducedby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_h=5 *10^4 cm^-3. we find that the solution best fitting the h2 lines is degenerate:the shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1and n_h=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. the h2 lines thus need a much morepowerful shock than the co lines. we deduce that most of the gas is currentlymoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction(&lt; 1 percent) of the ism is exposed to the high velocity shocks. this impliesthat the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. we argue that ahigh co line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

1212.0792	a new radio recombination line maser object toward the monr2 hii region	we report the detection of a new radio recombination line (rrl) maser objecttoward the irs2 source in the monr2 ultracompact hii region. the continuumemission at 1.3mm and 0.85mm and the h30a and h26a lines were observed with thesubmillimeter array (sma) at angular resolutions of about 0.5"-3". the smaobservations show that the monr2-irs2 source is very compact and remainsunresolved at spatial scales &lt;=400au. its continuum power spectrum atmillimeter wavelengths is almost flat (alpha=-0.16, with s_nu proportional tonu^alpha), indicating that this source is dominated by optically thin free-freeemission. the h30a and h26a rrl emission is also compact and peaks toward theposition of the monr2-irs2 source. the measured rrl profiles are double-peakedwith the h26a line showing a clear asymmetry in its spectrum. since the derivedline-to-continuum flux ratios (80 and 180kms-1 for h30a and h26a, respectively)exceed the lte predictions, the rrls toward monr2-irs2 are affected by maseramplification. the amplification factors are however smaller than those foundtoward the emission line star mwc349a, indicating that monr2-irs2 is a weaklyamplified maser. radiative transfer modelling of the rrl emission toward thissource shows that the rrl masers arise from a dense and collimated jet embeddedin a cylindrical ionized wind, oriented nearly along the direction of theline-of-sight. high-angular resolution observations at sub-millimeterwavelengths are needed to unveil weakly amplified rrl masers in very youngmassive stars.

1302.2763	the role of low-mass star clusters in massive star formation. the orion  case	to distinguish between the different theories proposed to explain massivestar formation, it is crucial to establish the distribution, the extinction,and the density of low-mass stars in massive star-forming regions. we analyzedeep x-ray observations of the orion massive star-forming region using thechandra orion ultradeep project (coup) catalog. we studied the stellardistribution as a function of extinction, with cells of 0.03 pc x 0.03 pc, thetypical size of protostellar cores. we derived stellar density maps andcalculated cluster stellar densities. we found that low-mass stars clustertoward the three massive star-forming regions: the trapezium cluster (tc), theorion hot core (ohc), and omc1-s. we derived low-mass stellar densities of10^{5} stars pc^{-3} in the tc and omc1-s, and of 10^{6} stars pc^{-3} in theohc. the close association between the low-mass star clusters with massive starcradles supports the role of these clusters in the formation of massive stars.the x-ray observations show for the first time in the tc that low-mass starswith intermediate extinction are clustered toward the position of the mostmassive star, which is surrounded by a ring of non-extincted low-mass stars.this 'envelope-core' structure is also supported by infrared and opticalobservations. our analysis suggests that at least two basic ingredients areneeded in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and a cluster oflow-mass stars. the scenario that better explains our findings assumes highfragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales that forms alow-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion. finally,although coalescence does not seem a common mechanism for building up massivestars, we show that a single stellar merger may have occurred in the evolutionof the ohc cluster, favored by the presence of disks, binaries, and gasaccretion.

1307.5283	x-ray embedded stars as driving sources of outflow-driven turbulence in  omc1-s	outflows arising from very young stars affect their surroundings andinfluence the star formation in the parental core. multiple molecular outflowsand herbig-haro (hh) objects have been observed in orion, many of themoriginating from the embedded massive star-forming region known as omc1-s. thedetection of the outflow driving sources is commonly difficult, because theyare still hidden behind large extinction, preventing their direct observationat optical and even near and mid-ir wavelengths. with the aim of improving theidentification of the driving sources of the multiple outflows detected inomc1-s, we used the catalog provided by deep x-ray observations, which haveunveiled the very embedded population of pre-main sequence stars. we comparedthe position of stars observed by the chandra orion ultra deep project (coup)in omc1-s with the morphology of the molecular outflows and the directions ofmeasured proper motions of hh optical objects. we find that 6 out of 7molecular outflows reported in omc1-s (detection rate of 86 %) have anextincted x-ray coup star located at the expected position of the drivingsource. in several cases, x-rays detected the possible driving sources for thefirst time. this clustered embedded population revealed by chandra is veryyoung, with an estimated average age of few 10^{5} yr. it is also likelyresponsible for the multiple hh objects, which are the optical correspondenceof flows arising from the cloud. we show that the molecular outflows driven bythe members of the omc1-s cluster can account for the observed turbulence atcore-scales and regulate the star formation efficiency. we discuss the effectsof outflow feedback in the formation of massive stars, concluding that theinjected turbulence in omc1-s is compatible with a competitive accretionscenario.

0802.0594	parametrization of c-shocks. evolution of the sputtering of grains	context: the detection of narrow sio lines toward the young shocks of thel1448-mm outflow has been interpreted as a signature of the magnetic precursorof c-shocks. in contrast with the low sio abundances (&lt;10e-12) in the ambientgas, the narrow sio emission at almost ambient velocities reveals enhanced sioabundances of 10e-11. this enhancement has been proposed to be produced by thesputtering of the grain mantles at the first stages of c-shocks. however,modelling of the sputtering of grains has usually averaged the sio abundancesover the dissipation region of c-shocks, which cannot explain the recentobservations. aims: to model the evolution of the gas phase abundances of sio,ch3oh and h2o, produced by the sputtering of grains as the shock propagatesthrough the ambient gas. methods: we propose a parametric model to describe thephysical structure of c-shocks as a function of time. using the knownsputtering yields for water mantles (with minor constituents like silicon andch3oh) and olivine cores by collisions with h2, he, c, o, si, fe and co, wefollow the evolution of the abundances of silicon, ch3oh and h2o ejected fromgrains. results: the evolution of these abundances shows that co seems to bethe most efficient sputtering agent in low velocity shocks. the velocitythreshold for the sputtering of silicon from the grain mantles is reduced by5-10 km s-1 by co compared to other models. the sputtering by co can generatesio abundances of 10e-11 at the early stages of low velocity shocks, consistentwith those observed in the magnetic precursor of l1448-mm. our model alsosatisfactorily reproduce the progressive enhancement of sio, ch3oh and h2oobserved in this outflow by the coexistence of two shocks with vs=30 and60kms-1 within the same region.

1510.02904	chemical features in the circumnuclear disk of the galactic center	the circumnuclear disk (cnd) of the galactic center is exposed to manyenergetic phenomena coming from the supermassive black hole sgr a* and stellaractivities. these energetic activities can affect the chemical composition inthe cnd by the interaction with uv-photons, cosmic-rays, x-rays, and shockwaves. we aim to constrain the physical conditions present in the cnd bychemical modeling of observed molecular species detected towards it. weanalyzed a selected set of molecular line data taken toward a position in thesouthwest lobe of the cnd with the iram 30m and apex 12-meter telescopes andderived the column density of each molecule using a large velocity gradient(lvg) analysis. the determined chemical composition is compared with atime-dependent gas-grain chemical model based on the ucl\_chem code thatincludes the effects of shock waves with varying physical parameters. moleculessuch as co, hcn, hco$^+$, hnc, cs, so, sio, no, cn, h$_2$co, hc$_3$n,n$_2$h$^+$ and h$_3$o$^+$ are detected and their column densities are obtained.total hydrogen densities obtained from lvg analysis range between $2 \times10^4$ and $1 \times 10^6\,$cm$^{-3}$ and most species indicate values aroundseveral $\times 10^5\,$cm$^{-3}$, which are lower than values corresponding tothe roche limit, which shows that the cnd is tidally unstable. the chemicalmodels show good agreement with the observations in cases where the density is$\sim10^4\,$cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray ionization rate is high, $&gt;10^{-15}\,$s$^{-1}$, or shocks with velocities $&gt; 40\,$km s$^{-1}$ have occurred.comparison of models and observations favors a scenario where the cosmic-rayionization rate in the cnd is high, but precise effects of other factors suchas shocks, density structures, uv-photons and x-rays from the sgr a* must beexamined with higher spatial resolution data.

astro-ph;0001173	large-scale shocks in the starburst galaxy ngc253. interferometer  mapping of a 600 pc sio/h13co+ circumnuclear disk	this paper presents the first high-resolution sio map made in an externalgalaxy. the nucleus of the nearby barred spiral ngc253 has been observedsimultaneously in the v=0, j=2-1 line of sio and in the j=1-0 line of h13co+with the iram interferometer, with a resolution of 7.5"x2.6". emission from sioand h13co+ is extended in the nucleus of ngc253. the bulk of the sio/h13co+emission arises from a 600pcx250pc circumnuclear disk (cnd) with a doubleringed structure. the inner ring, of radius r=60pc, viewed edge-on alongpa=51deg, hosts the nuclear starburst; the outer pseudo-ring opens out as aspiral-like arc up to r=300pc. the kinematics of the gaseous disk,characterized by strong non-circular motions, is interpreted in terms of theresonant response of the gas to the barred potential. the inner ring wouldcorrespond to the inner inner lindblad resonance(iilr), whereas the outerregion is linked to the onset of a trailing spiral wave across the outer ilr(oilr). most notably, we report the detection of a molecular gas counterpart ofthe giant outflow of hot gas, previously seen in x-ray and optical lines, andtentatively identified as a dust chimney in the the 450mu continuum band.thesio shows a high average fractional abundance in the cnd of x(sio)=1.5x10e-10.this is more than an order of magnitude above the predicted value of a pdr.moreover, x(sio) varies at least by an order of magnitude between the innerstarburst region, which dominates the global emission, where we derivex(sio)=1--2x10e-10, and the outer region, where x(sio) reaches a few 10e-9. sioabundance is also significantly enhanced in the outflow (x(sio)=3--5x10e-10).different mechanisms are explored to explain the unlike chemical processing ofmolecular gas within the nucleus.

astro-ph;0009195	a ridge of recent massive star formation between sgr b2m and sgr b2n	we present single dish and interferometric maps of several rotationaltransitions of hc3n vibrationally excited levels towards sgr b2. the singledish maps show, for the first time, new four bright clumps (sgr b2r1 to b2r4)in the ridge connecting the main cores sgr b2m and sgr b2n, and a lowbrightness extended region to the west of the ridge (sgr b2w). the physicalproperties and the kinematics of all hot cores have been derived from the hc3n*lines. our high angular resolution images show that the sgr b2n hot core breaksin two different hot cores, sgr b2n1 and n2, with different radial velocitiesand separated by 2 arcsec in declination. we find that the excitation of thehc3n* emission in all hot cores can be represented by a single temperature andthat the linewidth of the hc3n* rotational lines arising from differentvibrational levels systematically decreases as the energy of the vibrationallevel increases. the systematic trend in the linewidth is likely related to theincrease of the velocity as the distance to the exciting source increases. thedifferent hc3n abundances in the hot cores reflect different stages ofevolution due to time dependent chemistry and/or photo-dissociation by uvradiation from nearby hii regions. we propose that sgr b2m and b2n contain acluster of 20-30 hot cores and that the sgr b2r1-b2r4 hot cores representisolated formation of massive stars.

astro-ph;0011163	on the history of the interplay between hd 56925 and ngc 2359	ngc 2359 is an optical nebula excited by the powerful wind and the radiationof the wolf-rayet star hd 56925. we have investigated the interaction betweenthis massive star and the surrounding neutral gas by analyzing the large-scale21cm-hi emission and by mapping the nebula in the j = 1-0 and the j = 2-1 linesof co. we found a conspicuous (70 x 37 pc) hi shell, expanding at 12 km/s,likely produced during the main-sequence phase of the star. the molecular gastowards ngc 2359 shows three velocity components. two of these components, a1and a2, have narrow linewidths (1-2 km/s) and radial velocities of 35-38 and64-68 km/s, respectively. the third component is detected at radial velocitiesbetween 50 and 58 km/s and has a broader profile (up to 5.5 km/s). furthermore,this component is morphologicaly related with the nebula and has a velocitygradient of a few km/s. we have also estimated the physical parameters of themolecular gas by means of a lvg modelling of the co emission. the gas projectedonto the southern hii region of the nebula has low co column density and israther hot, probably up to 80 k. several profiles of the 13co j = 1-0 line nearthe peak of the emission, together with a weak emission bridge between thebroad and one of the narrow components (component a2), suggest the presence ofa shock front acting in the southern part of the nebula. this shock was likelyproduced in a previous rsg/lbv phase of hd 56925.

astro-ph;0107156	large scale ionization of the radio arc region by the quintuplet and the  arches cluster	(short version) we present an analysis of selected fine structure linesobserved iso toward the radio arc in the galactic center region (gcr). we studythe density of the ionized gas and the large scale ionization structure in aregion of ~30x30 pc^2 by means of the neiii 15.6 mum/neii 12.8 mum and niii 57mum/nii 122 mum line ratios. the electron densities (n_e) derived from the oiiilines ratio indicate the presence of diffuse ionized material with n_e of\~10^{1.8-2.6} cm^{-3}. the niii/nii ratio show two clear gradients, onepointing toward the quintuplet cluster and the other pointing toward the archescluster. the model used to explain the ionization structure shows that thelarge scale ionization of the whole region can be accounted for by the uvradiation produced by the quintuplet and the arches cluster. any otherionization mechanism should play a minor role. we also investigate theinfluence of the clusters on the bubble of warm dust seen in the msx infraredimages. the warm dust is well correlated with the ionized gas indicating thatthe dust is also heated by the radiation from both clusters. furthermore, theelliptical rather than circular symmetry of some structures like the thermalfilaments can also be explained when one considers the combined effects of boththe arches and the quintuplet clusters. the bubble is filled with continuumemission of hard x rays and with emision from the 6.4 kev line of neutral orlow ionized fe.

astro-ph;0201009	sio chimneys and supershells in m82	in this letter we present the first images of the emission of sio and h13co+in the nucleus of the starburst galaxy m82. contrary to other molecular speciesthat mainly trace the distribution of the star-forming molecular gas within thedisk, the sio emission extends noticeably out of the galaxy plane. the bulk ofthe sio emission is restricted to two major features. the first feature,referred to as the sio supershell, is an open shell of 150 pc diameter, located120 pc west from the galaxy center.  the sio supershell represents the inner front of a molecular shell expandingat 40 km/s, produced by mass ejection around a supercluster of young starscontaining supernova remnant snr 41.95+57.5. the second feature is a verticalfilament, referred to as the sio chimney, emanating from the disk at 200 pceast from the galaxy center. the sio chimney reaches a 500 pc vertical height,and it is associated with the most prominent chimney identified in radiocontinuum maps. the kinematics, morphology, and fractional abundances of thesio gas features in m82 can be explained in the framework of shocked chemistrydriven by local episodes of gas ejection from the starburst disk.

astro-ph;0510290	large-scale molecular shocks in galaxies: the sio interferometer map of  ic342	(abridged) we present the first high-resolution (5.6''x5.1'') images of theemission of silicon monoxide (sio) in the nearby spiral ic342, obtained withthe iram plateau de bure interferometer. we have mapped the emission of thesio(2-1) and h13co+(1-0) lines in a 0.9kpcx1.3kpc region around the nucleus ofic342. the bulk of the line emission comes from a 290pc spiral arm and a r~80pcnuclear ring. the distribution of sio clouds is mostly anticorrelated with thecontinuum emission at 87ghz, dominated by thermal free-free bremsstrahlung. thesio/h13co+ intensity ratio increases by an order of magnitude from the nuclearring to the spiral arm. furthermore the gas kinematics show significantdifferences between sio and h13co+ over the spiral arm, where the linewidths ofsio are 2 times larger than that of h13co+. the average abundance of sio in theinner r~320pc, x(sio)&gt;2x10^{-10}, evidences that shock chemistry is at work inic342. we have compared the emission of sio with another tracer of molecularshocks: the emission of methanol (ch3oh). the significant difference of thex(sio) measured between the spiral arm (~a few 10^{-9}) and the nuclear ring(~10^{-10}) is not echoed by a comparable variation in the sio/ch3oh intensityratio. this implies that the typical shock velocities should be similar in bothregions. in contrast, the fraction of shocked molecular gas should be 5-7 timeslarger in the spiral arm (up to ~10% of the available molecular gas mass overthe arm region) compared to the nuclear ring. we conclude that the large-scaleshocks revealed by the sio map of ic342 are mostly unrelated with starformation and arise instead in a pre-starburst phase. shocks are driven bycloud-cloud collisions along the potential well of the ic342 bar. the generalimplications for the current understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.

astro-ph;0605623	extragalactic chemistry of molecular gas: lessons from the local  universe	observational constraints provided by high resolution and high sensitivityobservations of external galaxies made in the millimeter and submillimeterrange have started to put on a firm ground the study of extragalactic chemistryof molecular gas. in particular, the availability of multi-species andmulti-line surveys of nearby galaxies is central to the interpretation ofexistent and forthcoming millimeter observations of the high redshift universe.probing the physical and chemical status of molecular gas in starbursts andactive galaxies (agn) requires the use of specific tracers of the relevantenergetic phenomena that are known to be at play in these galaxies: large-scaleshocks, strong uv fields, cosmic rays and x-rays. we present below the firstresults of an ongoing survey, allying the iram 30m telescope with the plateaude bure interferometer(pdbi), devoted to study the chemistry of molecular gasin a sample of starbursts and agn of the local universe. these observationshighlight the existence of a strong chemical differentiation in the moleculardisks of starbursts and agn.

astro-ph;0609538	first measurements of the electron density enhancements expected in  c-shocks	magnetic precursors of c-shocks accelerate, compress and heat molecular ions,modifying the kinematics and the physical conditions of the ion fluid withrespect to the neutral one. electron densities are also expected to besignificantly enhanced in shock precursors. in this letter, we presentobservations of strongly polar ion and neutral molecules such as sio, h13co+,hn13c and h13cn, which reveal the electron density enhancements associated withthe precursor of the young l1448-mm outflow. while in the ambient gas theexcitation of the ions and neutrals is explained by collisional excitation byh2 with a single density of 10e5cme-3, h13co+ shows an over excitation in theshock precursor component that requires h2 densities of a factor of &gt;10 largerthan those derived from the neutral species. this over excitation in h13co+ canbe explained if we consider an additional excitation by collisions withelectrons and an electron density enhancement in the precursor stage by afactor of 500, i.e. a fractional ionization of 5x10e-5. these results show thatmultiline observations can be used to study the evolution of the ion andelectron fluids at the first stages of the c-shock interaction.

astro-ph;9704006	sio emission from the galactic center molecular clouds	we have mapped the j=1-0 line of sio in a 1 degree x 12 arcmin. (lxb) regionaround the galactic center (gc) with an angular resolution of 2 arcmin.(approx. 4 pc). in contrast to the spatial distribution of other high dipolemoment molecules like cs, whose emission is nearly uniform, the sio emission isvery fragmented and it is only associated with some molecular clouds. inparticular, it is remarkable that the sio emission closely follows thenon-thermal radio arc in the gc. the sio clouds are more extended than the beamwith typical sizes between 4 and 20 pc. high angular resolution (26 arcsec.)mapping in the j=1-0 line of sio toward the molecular clouds in sgr b2 and sgra shows that the sio emission is relatively smooth with structures of typically2 pc. from the line intensities of the j=1-0, j=3-2 and j=5-4 transitions ofsio we derive h2 densities for these clouds of a few 1e4 cm-3. the siofractional abundances are approx. 1e-9 for the sio clouds and 1e-10 for theother molecular clouds in the gc. the characteristics (size and h2 densities)of the sio emission in the gc are completely different from those observed inthe galactic disk, where the sio emission arises from much smaller regions withlarger h2 densities. we briefly discuss the implications of the sio emission inthe molecular clouds of the gc. we conclude that the particular chemistry inthese clouds is probably related to large scale fast shocks occurring in thegalactic center region.

astro-ph;9803054	molecular gas in the galactic center region iii. probing shocks in  molecular cores	multiline observations of c18o and sio isotopomers toward 33 molecular peaksin the galactic center region, taken at the sest, jcmt and hht telescopes, arepresented. the c18o presumably traces the total h_2 column density, while thesio traces gas affected by shocks and high temperature chemistry. the j =2-1line of sio is seen only in few regions of the galactic disk. this line iseasily detected in all galactic center sources observed. a comparison of thestrength of the rare isotopomers 29sio and 30sio to the strength of the mainisotopomer 28sio implies that the j = 2-1 transition of 28sio is opticallythick. the 29si/30si isotope ratio of 1.6 in the galactic center clouds isconsistent with the terrestrial value. large velocity gradient models show thatthe dense component (n_(h_2) &gt; 10^4cm-3) in typical molecular cores in thegalactic center is cool (tkin ~ 25k), contrary to what is usually found ingiant molecular clouds in the disk, where the densest cores are the hottest.high kinetic temperatures, &gt; 100k, known to exist from nh_3 studies, are onlypresent at lower gas densities of a few 10^3cm-3, where sio is highlysubthermal. assuming that c18o traces all of the molecular gas, it is foundthat in all cases but one, sio emission is compatible with arising in gas athigher density that is (presently) relatively cool. the relative abundance ofsio is typically 10^-9, but differs significantly between individual sources.it shows a dependence on the position of the source within the galactic centerregion. high abundances are found in those regions for which bar potentialmodels predict a high likelihood for cloud-cloud collisions. these results canbe used to relate the amount of gas that has encountered shocks within the last~ 10^6 years to the large scale kinematics in the inner ~500pc of the galaxy.

astro-ph;9902345	low velocity ionized winds from regions around young o stars	we have observed seven ultracompact hii regions in hydrogen recombinationlines in the millimeter band. toward four of these regions, there is a highvelocity (full width to half maximum 60-80 km/s) component in the lineprofiles. the high velocity gas accounts for 35-70% of the emission measurewithin the beam. we compare these objects to an additional seven similarsources we have found in the literature. the broad recombination line objects(brlos) make up about 30% of all sources in complexes containing ultracompacthii regions. comparison of spectral line and continuum data implies that thebrlos coincide with sources with rising spectral indices, &gt;=0.4 up to 100 ghz.both the number of brlos and their frequency of occurrence within hii regioncomplexes, when coupled with their small size and large internal motions, meanthat the apparent contradiction between the dynamical and population lifetimesfor brlos is even more severe than for ultracompact hii regions. we evaluate anumber of models for the origin of the broad recombination line emission. thelifetime, morphology, and rising spectral index of the sources argue for photo-evaporated disks as the cause for brlos. existing models for such regions,however, do not account for the large amounts of gas observed at supersonicvelocities.

astro-ph;9904098	jets and high-velocity bullets in the orion a outflows. is the irc2  outflow powered by a variable jet?	we present high sensitivity maps of the high velocity (hv) co emission towardthe molecular outflows around irc2 and orion-s in the orion a molecular cloud.the maps reveal the presence of hv bullets in both outflows with velocitiesbetween 40-80kms-1 from the ambient gas velocity. the blue and redshifted co hvbullets associated with the irc2 outflow are distributed in thin (12"-20",0.02-0.04pc) elliptical ring-like structures with a size of ~10"x50"(0.02x0.1pc). the co emission at the most extreme blue and redshiftedvelocities (ehv) peaks 20" north of source i, just inside the rings of the hvbullets.  the low velocity h2o masers and the h2* bullets around irc2 are located atthe inner edges of the ring of co hv bullets and surrounding the ehv coemission. furthermore, the high velocity h2o masers are very well correlatedwith the ehv co emission. this morphology is consistent with a model of a jetdriven molecular outflow oriented close to the line of sight.  in the orion-s outflow, the morphology of the co hv bullets shows a bipolarstructure in the southeast-northwest direction, and the h2o masers are foundonly at low velocities in the region between the exciting source and the co hvbullets.  the morphology of the co hv bullets, the radial velocities and the spatialdistribution of the h2o masers in both outflows, as well as the h2* featuresaround irc2, are consistent with a model in which these outflows are driven bya jet variable in direction.in this scenario, the large traverse velocitymeasured for the h2o masers in the irc2 outflow, ~18kms-1, supports theevolutionary connection between the jet and the shell-like outflows.

astro-ph;9910156	jet driven molecular outflows in orion	we present high sensitivity and high angular resolution images of the highvelocity (vlsr&gt;30kms^-1) co emission in the j=1-0 and j=2-1 lines of the orionkl region. these results reveal the morphology of the high-velocity co emissionat the most extreme velocities. high velocity emission have been only detectedin two regions: bn/kl (irc2/i) and orion-s.  the orion-s region contains a very young (dynamical age of 10^3years), veryfast (~110kms^-1) and very compact (&lt;0.16pc) bipolar outflow. from themorphology of the high-velocity gas we estimate that the position of thepowering source must be ~20'' north of fir4. for the irc2/i molecular outflowthe morphology of the moderate velocity (&lt;60kms^-1) gas shows a weak bipolarityaround irc2/i. the gas at the most extreme velocities does not show anybipolarity around irc2/i, if any, it is found ~30'' north from these sources.the blue and redshifted gas at moderate velocities shows similar spatialdistribution with a systematic trend for the size of the high-velocity gas todecrease as the terminal radial velocity increases. the size-velocityrelationship is fitted with a simple velocity law which considers a highlycollimated jet and entrained material outside the jet moving in the radialdirection. we also find that most of the co outflowing at moderate velocitiesis located at the head of the jet. our results and the spatial distribution andkinematics of the shock tracers in this outflow can be explained if the irc2/ioutflow is driven by a precessing jet oriented along the line of sight.

0812.3688	hnco abundances in galaxies: tracing the evolutionary state of  starbursts	the chemistry in the central regions of galaxies is expected to be stronglyinfluenced by their nuclear activity. to find the best tracers of nuclearactivity is of key importance to understand the processes taking place in themost obscured regions of galactic nuclei. in this work we present multi-lineobservations of cs, c34s, hnco and c18o in a sample of 11 bright galaxiesprototypical for different types of activity. the 32s/34s isotopic ratio is~10, supporting the idea of an isotopical 34s enrichment due to massive starformation in the nuclear regions of galaxies. although c32s and c34s do notseem to be significantly affected by the activity type, the hnco abundanceappears highly contrasted among starburst. we observed hnco abundancevariations of nearly two orders of magnitude. the hnco molecule is shown to bea good tracer of the amount of molecular material fueling the starburst andtherefore can be used as a diagnostics of the evolutionary state of a nuclearstarburst.
