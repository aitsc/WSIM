0902.2794	sn 2008ha: an extremely low luminosity and extremely low energy  supernova	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well asoptical spectra of the peculiar supernova (sn) 2008ha. sn 2008ha had a very lowpeak luminosity, reaching only m_v = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only~2000 km/s near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy perunit mass of ejecta. spectroscopically, sn 2008ha is a member of the sn2002cx-like class of sne, a peculiar subclass of sne ia; however, sn 2008ha isthe most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower linevelocities than the typical member, which is already ~2 mag fainter and hasline velocities ~5000 km/s smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal snia. sn 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantlyshorter than either sn 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal sne ia (~19.5days). the bolometric light curve of sn 2008ha indicates that sn 2008ha peakedat l_peak = (9.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^40 ergs/s, making sn 2008ha perhaps the leastluminous sn ever observed. from its peak luminosity and rise time, we inferthat sn 2008ha generated (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3 m_sun of 56ni, had a kineticenergy of ~2 x 10^48 ergs, and ejected 0.15 m_sun of material. we classifythree new (and one potential) members of the sn 2002cx-like class, expandingthe sample to 14 (and one potential) members. the host-galaxy morphologydistribution of the class is consistent with that of sne ia, ib, ic, and ii.several models for generating low-luminosity sne can explain the observationsof sn 2008ha; however, if a single model is to describe all sn 2002cx-likeobjects, either electron capture in ne-mg white dwarfs causing a core collapse,or deflagration of c-o white dwarfs with sn 2008ha being a partial deflagrationand not unbinding the progenitor star, are preferred. abridged.

0906.2200	spectral evolution of the extraordinary type iin supernova 2006gy	we present a detailed analysis of the extremely luminous type iin supernovasn2006gy using spectra obtained between days 36 and 237 after explosion. wederive the temporal evolution of the effective temperature, radius, expansionspeeds, and bolometric luminosity, as well as the progenitor wind density andtotal swept-up mass overtaken by the shock. sn2006gy can be interpreted in thecontext of shock interaction with a dense csm, but with quite extreme valuesfor the csm mass of 20 msun and an explosion kinetic energy of at least 5e51erg. a key difference between sn2006gy and other sneiin is that, owing to itslarge csm mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. at earlytimes, h-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, andphotons diffuse out through the opaque csm. the pivotal transition to opticallythin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in theblackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell. from theevolution of pre-shock velocities, we deduce that the csm was ejected by theprogenitor in a 1e49 erg precursor event 8yr before explosion. the large csmmass rules out models involving stars with initial masses around 10msun. withthe full mass budget, even massive m_zams=30-40 msun progenitor stars areinadequate. at roughly solar metallicity, substantial mass loss probablyoccurred during the star's life, so sn 2006gy's progenitor is more consistentwith lbv eruptions or pulsational pair-instability ejections in stars withinitial masses above 100 msun. this requires significant revision to currentparadigms of massive-star evolution.

0907.1083	variable sodium absorption in a low-extinction type ia supernova	recent observations have revealed that some type ia supernovae exhibitnarrow, time-variable na i d absorption features. the origin of the absorbingmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gasin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implicationsfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. we present the third detection ofsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopyof the type ia supernova sn 2007le from keck and the het. the data span ~3months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. we find thatone component of the na d absorption lines strengthened significantly withtime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. thechanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier timeswhen the uv flux from the sn peaks. as with sn 2006x, we detect no change inthe ca ii h&amp;k lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effectsimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.unlike the previous two sne exhibiting variable absorption, sn 2007le is nothighly reddened (e_b-v = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar ratherthan interstellar absorption. photoionization models show that the data areconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pcfrom the explosion. these results broadly support the single-degeneratescenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass lossfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellargas. we also present tentative evidence for narrow halpha emission associatedwith the sn, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.[abridged]

0707.0393	supernovae in the subaru deep field: an initial sample, and type ia  rate, out to redshift 1.6	large samples of high-redshift supernovae (sne) are potentially powerfulprobes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and sn physics. we presentinitial results from a new deep sn survey, based on re-imaging in the r, i', z'bands, of the 0.25 deg2 subaru deep field (sdf), with the 8.2-m subarutelescope and suprime-cam. in a single new epoch consisting of two nights ofobservations, we have discovered 33 candidate sne, down to a z'-band magnitudeof 26.3 (ab). we have measured the photometric redshifts of the sn hostgalaxies, obtained keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,and classified the sne using the bayesian photometric algorithm of poznanski etal. (2007) that relies on template matching. after correcting for biases in theclassification, 55% of our sample consists of type ia supernovae and 45% ofcore-collapse sne. the redshift distribution of the sne ia reaches z ~ 1.6,with a median of z ~ 1.2. the core-collapse sne reach z ~ 1.0, with a median ofz ~ 0.5. our sn sample is comparable to the hubble space telescope/goods sampleboth in size and redshift range. the redshift distributions of the sne in thesdf and in goods are consistent, but there is a trend (which requiresconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z sne ia in the sdf. thistrend is also apparent when comparing the sn ia rates we derive to those basedon goods data. our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift thatcould be tracking the star-formation rate. additional epochs on this field,already being obtained, will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds, anddetermine whether or not there is a decline in the sn ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

0908.4274	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  hubble diagram and cosmological parameters	we present measurements of the hubble diagram for 103 type ia supernovae(sne) with redshifts 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.42, discovered during the first season (fall2005) of the sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey. these datafill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift sn ia surveys. wecombine the sdss-ii measurements with new distance estimates for published sndata from the essence survey, the supernova legacy survey, the hubble spacetelescope, and a compilation of nearby sn ia measurements. combining the snhubble diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the sdssluminous red galaxy sample and with cmb temperature anisotropy measurementsfrom wmap, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and omega_m, assuming aspatially flat cosmological model (fwcdm) with constant dark energy equation ofstate parameter, w. for the fwcdm model and the combined sample of 288 sne ia,we find w = -0.76 +- 0.07(stat) +- 0.11(syst), omega_m = 0.306 +- 0.019(stat)+- 0.023(syst) using mlcs2k2 and w = -0.96 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.12(syst), omega_m= 0.265 +- 0.016(stat) +- 0.025(syst) using the salt-ii fitter. we trace thediscrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame uv modelcombined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; thesedifferences mostly affect the distance estimates for the snls and hstsupernovae. we present detailed discussions of systematic errors for bothlight-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies inrest-frame $u$-band. for the salt-ii approach, we also see strong evidence forredshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta). restricting theanalysis to the 136 sne ia in the nearby+sdss-ii samples, we find much betteragreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties.

0912.0263	sn 2006bt: a perplexing, troublesome, and possibly misleading type ia  supernova	sn 2006bt displays characteristics unlike those of any other known type iasupernova (sn ia). we present optical light curves and spectra of sn 2006btwhich demonstrate the peculiar nature of this object. sn 2006bt has broad,slowly declining light curves indicative of a hot, high-luminosity sn, butlacks a prominent second maximum in the i band as do low-luminosity sne ia. itsspectra are similar to those of low-luminosity sne ia, containing features thatare only present in cool sn photospheres. light-curve fitting methods suggestthat sn 2006bt is reddened by a significant amount of dust; however, itoccurred in the outskirts of its early-type host galaxy and has no strong na dabsorption in any of its spectra, suggesting a negligible amount of host-galaxydust absorption. c ii is possibly detected in our pre-maximum spectra, but at amuch lower velocity than other elements. the progenitor was likely very old,being a member of the halo population of a galaxy that shows no signs of recentstar formation. sne ia have been very successfully modeled as a one-parameterfamily, and this is fundamental to their use as cosmological distanceindicators. sn 2006bt is a challenge to that picture, yet its relatively normallight curves allowed sn 2006bt to be included in cosmological analyses. wegenerate mock sn ia datasets which indicate that contamination by similarobjects will both increase the scatter of a sn ia hubble diagram andsystematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters. however, spectraand rest-frame i-band light curves should provide a definitive way to identifyand eliminate such objects.

0912.0732	early and late-time observations of sn 2008ha: additional constraints  for the progenitor and explosion	we present a new maximum-light optical spectrum of the the extremely lowluminosity and exceptionally low energy type ia supernova (sn ia) 2008ha,obtained one week before the earliest published spectrum. previous observationsof sn 2008ha were unable to distinguish between a massive star and white dwarforigin for the sn. the new maximum-light spectrum, obtained one week before theearliest previously published spectrum, unambiguously shows featurescorresponding to intermediate mass elements, including silicon, sulfur, andcarbon. although strong silicon features are seen in some core-collapse sne,sulfur features, which are a signature of carbon/oxygen burning, have alwaysbeen observed to be weak in such events. it is therefore likely that sn 2008hawas the result of a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.carbon features at maximum light show that unburned material is present tosignificant depths in the sn ejecta, strengthening the case that sn 2008ha wasa failed deflagration. we also present late-time imaging and spectroscopy thatare consistent with this scenario.

1002.0635	the diversity of massive star outbursts i: observations of sn 2009ip,  ugc 2773 ot2009-1, and their progenitors	despite both being outbursts of luminous blue variables (lbvs), sn 2009ip andugc 2773 ot2009-1 have very different progenitors, spectra, circumstellarenvironments, and possibly physical mechanisms that generated the outbursts.  from pre-eruption hst images, we determine that sn 2009ip and ugc 2773ot2009-1 have initial masses of &gt;60 and &gt;25 m_sun, respectively. opticalspectroscopy shows that at peak sn 2009ip had a 10,000 k photosphere and itsspectrum was dominated by narrow h balmer emission, similar to classical lbvgiant outbursts, also known as "supernova impostors." the spectra of ugc 2773ot2009-1, which also have narrow h alpha emission, are dominated by a forest ofabsorption lines, similar to an f-type supergiant. blueshifted absorption linescorresponding to ejecta at a velocity of 2000 - 7000 km/s are present in laterspectra of sn 2009ip -- an unprecedented observation for lbv outbursts,indicating that the event was the result of a supersonic explosion, rather thana subsonic outburst. the velocity of the absorption lines increases between twoepochs, suggesting that there were two explosions in rapid succession. a rapidfading and rebrightening event concurrent with the onset of the high-velocityabsorption lines is consistent with the double-explosion model. a near-infraredexcess is present in the spectra and photometry of ugc 2773 ot2009-1 that isconsistent with ~2100 k dust emission. we compare the properties of these twoevents and place them in the context of other known massive star outbursts suchas eta car, ngc 300 ot2008-1, and sn 2008s. this qualitative analysis suggeststhat massive star outbursts have many physical differences which can manifestas the different observables seen in these two interesting objects.

0708.0140	optical and near-infrared observations of the highly reddened, rapidly  expanding type ia supernova 2006x in m100	we present extensive optical (ubvri), near-infrared (jk) light curves andoptical spectroscopy of the type ia supernova (sn) 2006x in the nearby galaxyngc 4321 (m100). our observations suggest that either sn 2006x has anintrinsically peculiar color evolution, or it is highly reddened [e(b -v)_{host} = 1.42+/-0.04 mag] with r_v = 1.48+/-0.06, much lower than thecanonical value of 3.1 for the average galactic dust. sn 2006x also has one ofthe highest expansion velocities ever published for a sn ia. compared with theother sne ia we analyzed, sn 2006x has a broader light curve in the u band, amore prominent bump/shoulder feature in the v and r bands, a more pronouncedsecondary maximum in the i and near-infrared bands, and a remarkably smallerlate-time decline rate in the b band. the b - v color evolution shows anobvious deviation from the lira-phillips relation at 1 to 3 months aftermaximum brightness. at early times, optical spectra of sn 2006x displayedstrong, high-velocity features of both intermediate-mass elements (si, ca, ands) and iron-peak elements, while at late times they showed a relatively bluecontinuum, consistent with the blue u-b and b-v colors at similar epochs. alight echo and/or the interaction of the sn ejecta and its circumstellarmaterial may provide a plausible explanation for its late-time photometric andspectroscopic behavior. using the cepheid distance of m100, we derive a hubbleconstant of 72.7+/-8.2 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}(statistical) from the normalizeddereddened luminosity of sn 2006x. we briefly discuss whether abnormal dust isa universal signature for all sne ia, and whether the most rapidly expandingobjects form a subclass with distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties.

1004.2262	spectroscopic discovery of the broad-lined type ic supernova 2010bh  associated with the low-redshift grb 100316d	we present the spectroscopic discovery of a broad-lined type ic supernova (sn2010bh) associated with the nearby long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) 100316d.at z = 0.0593, this is the third-nearest grb-sn. nightly optical spectraobtained with the magellan telescopes during the first week after explosionreveal the gradual emergence of very broad spectral features superposed on ablue continuum. the supernova features are typical of broad-lined sne ic andare generally consistent with previous supernovae associated with low-redshiftgrbs. however, the inferred velocities of sn 2010bh at 21 days after explosionare a factor of ~2 times larger than those of the prototypical sn 1998bw atsimilar epochs, with v ~ 26,000 km/s, indicating a larger explosion energy or adifferent ejecta structure. a near-infrared spectrum taken 13.8 days afterexplosion shows no strong evidence for he i at 1.083 microns, implying that theprogenitor was largely stripped of its helium envelope. the host galaxy is oflow luminosity (m_r ~ -18.5 mag) and low metallicity (z &lt; 0.4 z_solar), similarto the hosts of other low-redshift grb-sne.

1005.4687	the effect of host galaxies on type ia supernovae in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we present an analysis of the host galaxy dependencies of type ia supernovae(sne ia) from the full three year sample of the sdss-ii supernova survey. werediscover, to high significance, the strong correlation between host galaxytypeand the width of the observed sn light curve, i.e., fainter, quicklydeclining sne ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly decliningia's favor star-forming galaxies. we also find evidence (at between 2 to 3sigma) that sne ia are ~0.1 magnitudes brighter in passive host galaxies, thanin star-forming hosts, after the sn ia light curves have been standardizedusing the light curve shape and color variations: this difference in brightnessis present in both the salt2 and mcls2k2 light curve fitting methodologies. wesee evidence for differences in the sn ia color relationship between passiveand star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the mlcs2k2 technique, we see thatsne ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of r_v ~1, while sne ia instar-forming hosts require r_v ~2. the significance of these trends depends onthe range of sn colors considered. we demonstrate that these effects can beparameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a confidence of&gt;4 sigma) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical fitto our data. our results suggest that future cosmological analyses of sn iasamples should include host galaxy information.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1010.2749	a mismatch in the ultraviolet spectra between low-redshift and  intermediate-redshift type ia supernovae as a possible systematic uncertainty  for supernova cosmology	we present keck high-quality rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) through opticalspectra of 21 type ia supernovae (sne ia) in the redshift range 0.11 &lt; z &lt; 0.37and a mean redshift of 0.22 that were discovered during the sloan digital skysurvey-ii (sdss-ii) sn survey. using the broad-band photometry of the sdsssurvey, we are able to reconstruct the sn host-galaxy spectral energydistributions (seds), allowing for a correction for the host-galaxycontamination in the sn ia spectra. comparison of composite spectra constructedfrom a subsample of 17 high-quality spectra to those created from alow-redshift sample with otherwise similar properties shows that the keck/sdsssne ia have, on average, extremely similar rest-frame optical spectra but showa uv flux excess. this observation is confirmed by comparing synthesizedbroad-band colors of the individual spectra, showing a difference in meancolors at the 2.4 - 4.4 sigma level for various uv colors. we further see aslight difference in the uv spectral shape between sne with low-mass andhigh-mass host galaxies. additionally, we detect a relationship between theflux ratio at 2770 and 2900 a and peak luminosity that differs from thatobserved at low redshift. we find that changing the uv sed of an sn ia withinthe observed dispersion can change the inferred distance moduli by ~0.1 mag.this effect only occurs when the data probe the rest-frame uv. we suggest thatthis discrepancy could be due to differences in the host-galaxy population ofthe two sn samples or to small-sample statistics.

0704.2249	dust formation and he ii 4686 emission in the dense shell of the  peculiar type ib supernova 2006jc	we present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual type ib snbased on late-time spectra of sn 2006jc. the progenitor suffered an lbv-likeoutburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is aconsequence of the sn blast wave overtaking that lbv-like shell. the keyevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-ir continuumsource fit by 1600 k graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides ofhe i emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted linesas dust obscures receding material. this provides the strongest case yet fordust formation in any sn ib/c. both developments occurred between 51 and 75 dafter peak, while other sne observed to form dust did so after a few hundreddays. geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-upshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expandingsn ejecta. rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided byextremely high shell densities, as indicated by he i line ratios. the briefepoch of dust formation is accompanied by he ii 4686 emission and enhancedx-ray emission. these clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in thisobject was not due to properties of the sn itself, but instead -- like mostpeculiarities of sn 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environmentcreated by an lbv-like eruption 2 yr before the sn.

1011.4517	measuring ejecta velocity improves type ia supernova distances	we use a sample of 121 spectroscopically normal type ia supernovae (sne ia)to show that their intrinsic color is correlated with their ejecta velocity, asmeasured from the blueshift of the si ii 6355 feature near maximum brightness,v_si. the sn ia sample was originally used by wang et al. (2009) to show thatthe relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absenceof intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for twosubsamples split by v_si (defined as "normal" and "high-velocity"). we verifythis result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law whenextremely reddened events (e(b-v) &gt; 0.35 mag) are excluded. we also show that(1) the high-velocity subsample is offset by ~0.06 mag to the red from thenormal subsample in the (b_max - v_max) - m_v plane, (2) the b_max - v_maxcumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identicalshapes, but the high-velocity subsample is offset by ~0.07 mag to the red inb_max - v_max, and (3) the bluest high-velocity sne ia are ~0.10 mag redderthan the bluest normal sne ia. together, this evidence indicates a differencein intrinsic color for the subsamples. accounting for this intrinsic colordifference reduces the scatter in hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 magfor sne ia with a_v &lt; 0.7 mag. the scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 magby exclusively using sne ia from the normal subsample. additionally, thisresult can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of r_v foundin large sn ia samples. we explain the correlation between ejecta velocity andcolor as increased line blanketing in the high-velocity sne ia, causing them tobecome redder. we discuss some implications of this result, and stress theimportance of spectroscopy for future sn ia cosmology surveys, with particularfocus on the design of wfirst.

1103.2885	dust and the type ii-plateau supernova 2004dj	we present mid-infrared (mir) spectroscopy of a type ii-plateau supernova, sn2004dj, obtained with the spitzer space telescope, spanning 106--1393 d afterexplosion. mir photometry plus optical/near-ir observations are also reported.an early-time mir excess is attributed to emission from non-silicate dustformed within a cool dense shell (cds). most of the cds dust condensed between50 d and 165 d, reaching a mass of 0.3 x 10^{-5} msun. throughout theobservations much of the longer wavelength (&gt;10 microns) part of the continuumis explained as an ir echo from interstellar dust. the mir excess strengthenedat later times. we show that this was due to thermal emission from warm,non-silicate dust formed in the ejecta. using optical/near-ir line-profiles andthe mir continua, we show that the dust was distributed as a disk whose radiusappeared to be slowly shrinking. the disk radius may correspond to a graindestruction zone caused by a reverse shock which also heated the dust. thedust-disk lay nearly face-on, had high opacities in the optical/near-irregions, but remained optically thin in the mir over much of the periodstudied. assuming a uniform dust density, the ejecta dust mass by 996 d was 0.5+/- 0.1) x 10^{-4} msun, and exceeded 10^{-4}msun by 1393 d. for a dust densityrising toward the center the limit is higher. nevertheless, this study suggeststhat the amount of freshly-synthesized dust in the sn 2004dj ejecta isconsistent with that found from previous studies, and adds further weight tothe claim that such events could not have been major contributors to the cosmicdust budget.

1107.3555	velocity evolution and the intrinsic color of type ia supernovae	to understand how best to use observations of type ia supernovae (sne ia) toobtain precise and accurate distances, we investigate the relations betweenspectra of sne ia and their intrinsic colors. using a sample of 1630 opticalspectra of 255 sne, based primarily on data from the cfa supernova program, weexamine how the velocity evolution and line strengths of si ii 6355 and ca iih&amp;k are related to the b-v color at peak brightness. we find that themaximum-light velocity of si ii 6355 and ca ii h&amp;k and the maximum-lightpseudo-equivalent width of si ii 6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, withintrinsic color having a linear relation with the si ii 6355 measurements. caii h&amp;k does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocitysne tend to be intrinsically bluer. combining the spectroscopic measurementsdoes not improve intrinsic color inference. the intrinsic color scatter islarger for higher-velocity sne ia --- even after removing a linear trend withvelocity --- indicating that lower-velocity sne ia are more "standard crayons."employing information derived from sn ia spectra has the potential to improvethe measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological propertiesinferred from them.

0710.2338	constraining cosmic evolution of type ia supernovae	we present the first large-scale effort of creating composite spectra ofhigh-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia) and comparing them to low-redshiftcounterparts. through the essence project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88high-redshift sne ia with excellent light-curve information. in addition, wehave obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift sne through a multiple-decade effortat lick and keck observatories, and we have used 45 uv spectra obtained byhst/iue. the low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to theessence spectra. in all instances, the essence and lick composite spectraappear very similar. the addition of galaxy light to the lick composite spectraallows a nearly perfect match of the overall spectral-energy distribution withthe essence composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift sne are morecontaminated with host-galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. thisis caused by observing objects at all redshifts with the same slit width, whichcorresponds to different projected distances. after correcting for thegalaxy-light contamination, subtle differences in the spectra remain. we haveestimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates fork-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. the variance in the composite spectra give anestimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum-light sn spectra of~3% in the optical and growing toward the uv. the difference between themaximum light low and high-redshift spectra constrain sn evolution between oursamples to be &lt; 10% in the rest-frame optical.

1110.5809	evidence for type ia supernova diversity from ultraviolet observations  with the hubble space telescope	we present ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy and photometry of four type iasupernovae (sne 2004dt, 2004ef, 2005m, and 2005cf) obtained with the uv prismof the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. this datasetprovides unique spectral time series down to 2000 angstrom. significantdiversity is seen in the near maximum-light spectra (~ 2000--3500 angstrom) forthis small sample. the corresponding photometric data, together with archivaldata from swift ultraviolet/optical telescope observations, provide furtherevidence of increased dispersion in the uv emission with respect to theoptical. the peak luminosities measured in uvw1/f250w are found to correlatewith the b-band light-curve shape parameter dm15(b), but with much largerscatter relative to the correlation in the broad-band b band (e.g., ~0.4 magversus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 &lt; dm15 &lt; 1.7 mag). sn 2004dt is found as anoutlier of this correlation (at &gt; 3 sigma), being brighter than normal sne iasuch as sn 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/f250w and uvm2/f220wfilters, respectively. we show that different progenitor metallicity orline-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy.viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have asignificant influence on the flux emitted in the uv region. detailed modelingis needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.

1202.0003	the relation between ejecta velocity, intrinsic color, and host-galaxy  mass for high-redshift type ia supernovae	recently, using a large low-redshift sample of type ia supernovae (sne ia),we discovered a relation between sn ia ejecta velocity and intrinsic color thatimproves the distance precision of sne ia and reduces potential systematicbiases related to dust reddening. no sn ia cosmological results have yet made acorrection for the "velocity-color" relation. to test the existence of such arelation and constrain its properties at high redshift, we examine a sample of75 sne ia discovered and observed by the sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii)supernova survey and supernova legacy survey (snls). from each spectrum, wemeasure ejecta velocities at maximum brightness for the ca h&amp;k and si ii 6355features, v_ca^0 and v_si^0, respectively. using sn light-curve parameters, wedetermine the intrinsic b_max - v_max for each sn. similar to what was found atlow-redshift, we find that sne ia with higher ejecta velocity tend to beintrinsically redder than sne ia with lower ejecta velocity. the distributionsof ejecta velocities for sne ia at low and high redshift are similar,indicating that current cosmological results should have little bias related tothe velocity-color relation. additionally, we find a slight (2.4-sigmasignificant) trend between sn ia ejecta velocity and host-galaxy mass such thatsne ia in high-mass host galaxies tend to have lower ejecta velocities asprobed by v_ca^0. these results emphasize the importance of spectroscopy for snia cosmology.

1202.3140	the low-velocity, rapidly fading type ia supernova 2002es	sn 2002es is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn ia) with acombination of observed characteristics never before seen in a sn ia. atmaximum light, sn 2002es shares spectroscopic properties with the underluminoussn 1991bg subclass of sne ia, but with substantially lower expansion velocities(~6000 km/s) more typical of the sn 2002cx subclass. photometrically, sn 2002esdiffers from both sn 1991bg-like and sn 2002cx-like supernovae. although atmaximum light it is subluminous (m_b=-17.78 mag), sn 2002es has a relativelybroad light curve (dm15(b)=1.28 +/- 0.04 mag), making it a significant outlierin the light-curve width vs. luminosity relationship. we estimate a 56ni massof 0.17 +/- 0.05 m_sun synthesized in the explosion, relatively low for a snia. one month after maximum light, we find an unexpected plummet in thebolometric luminosity. the late-time decay of the light curves is inconsistentwith our estimated 56ni mass, indicating that either the light curve was notcompletely powered by 56ni decay or the ejecta became optically thin togamma-rays within a month after maximum light. the host galaxy is classified asan s0 galaxy with little to no star formation, indicating the progenitor of sn2002es is likely from an old stellar population. we also present a lessextensive dataset for sn 1999bh, an object which shares similar observedproperties. both objects were found as part of the lick observatory supernovasearch, allowing us to estimate that these objects should account for ~2.5% ofsne ia within a fixed volume. we find that current theoretical models areunable to explain the observed of characteristics of sn 2002es.

1202.5301	the first maximum-light ultraviolet through near-infrared spectrum of a  type ia supernova	we present the first maximum-light ultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared(nir) type ia supernova (sn ia) spectrum. this spectrum of sn 2011iv wasobtained nearly simultaneously by the hubble space telescope at uv/opticalwavelengths and the magellan baade telescope at nir wavelengths. these dataprovide the opportunity to examine the entire maximum-light sn iaspectral-energy distribution. since the uv region of a sn ia spectrum isextremely sensitive to the composition of the outer layers of the explosion,which are transparent at longer wavelengths, this unprecedented spectrum canprovide strong constraints on the composition of the sn ejecta, and similarlythe sn explosion and progenitor system. sn 2011iv is spectroscopically normal,but has a relatively fast decline (delta m_15 (b) = 1.69 +/- 0.05 mag). wecompare sn 2011iv to other sne ia with uv spectra near maximum light andexamine trends between uv spectral properties, light-curve shape, and ejectavelocity. we tentatively find that sne with similar light-curve shapes butdifferent ejecta velocities have similar uv spectra, while those with similarejecta velocities but different light-curve shapes have very different uvspectra. through a comparison with explosion models, we find that both asolar-metallicity w7 and a zero-metallicity delayed-detonation model provide areasonable fit to the spectrum of sn 2011iv from the uv to the nir.

1203.2916	linking type ia supernova progenitors and their resulting explosions	comparing the ejecta velocities at maximum brightness and narrowcircumstellar/interstellar na d absorption line profiles of a sample of 23 typeia supernovae (sne ia), we determine that the properties of sn ia progenitorsystems and explosions are intimately connected. as demonstrated by sternberget al. (2011), half of all sne ia with detectable na d absorption at thehost-galaxy redshift in high-resolution spectroscopy have na d line profileswith significant blueshifted absorption relative to the strongest absorptioncomponent, which indicates that a large fraction of sn ia progenitor systemshave strong outflows. in this study, we find that sne ia with blueshiftedcircumstellar/interstellar absorption systematically have higher ejectavelocities and redder colors at maximum brightness relative to the rest of thesn ia population. this result is robust at a 98.9-99.8% confidence level,providing the first link between the progenitor systems and properties of theexplosion. this finding is further evidence that the outflow scenario is thecorrect interpretation of the blueshifted na d absorption, adding additionalconfirmation that some sne ia are produced from a single-degenerate progenitorchannel. an additional implication is that either sn ia progenitor systems havehighly asymmetric outflows that are also aligned with the sn explosion or sneia come from a variety of progenitor systems where sne ia from systems withstrong outflows tend to have more kinetic energy per unit mass than those fromsystems with weak or no outflows.

1206.2643	a spectroscopic study of type ibc supernova host galaxies from  untargeted surveys	we present the largest spectroscopic study of the host environments of typeibc supernovae (sn ibc) discovered exclusively by untargeted sn searches. paststudies of sn ibc host environments have been biased towards high-mass,high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on sne discovered in galaxy-targeted snsearches. our new observations more than double the total number ofspectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published foruntargeted sn ibc host environments, and extend to a median redshift abouttwice as large as previous statistical studies (z = 0.04). for the 12 sne iband 21 sne ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities oflog(o/h)+12 = 8.48 and 8.61, respectively, but determine that the discrepancyin the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant.this median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the massloss via metal-line driven winds (&lt;30%), suggesting this does not play thedominant role in distinguishing sn ib and ic progenitors. however, the medianmetallicity of the 7 broad-lined sn ic (sn ic-bl) in our sample issignificantly lower, log(o/h)+12 = 8.34. the age of the young stellarpopulation of sn ic-bl host environments also seems to be lower than for sn iband ic, but our age sample is small. a synthesis of sn ibc host environmentspectroscopy to date does not reveal a significant difference in sn ib and icmetallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities forsn ic-bl. this combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted sn searchesintroduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicitydistribution of sn progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematiceffects that play smaller roles. we discuss the path forward for makingprogress on sn ibc progenitor studies in the lsst era.

0711.2570	the detection of a light echo from the type ia supernova 2006x in m100	we report the discovery of a light echo (le) from the type ia supernova (sn)2006x in the nearby galaxy m100. the presence of the le is supported byanalysis of both the advanced camera for surveys (acs) images taken with the{\it hubble space telescope (hst)} at $\sim$300 d after maximum brightness andthe keck optical spectrum obtained at a similar phase. in the image procedure,both the radial-profile analysis and the point-spread-function (psf)subtraction method resolve significant excess emission at 2--5 acs pixels($\sim0.05''-0.13''$) from the center. in particular, the psf-subtracted acsimages distinctly appear to have an extended, ring-like echo. due tolimitations of the image resolution, we cannot confirm any structure or fluxwithin 2 acs pixels from the sn. the late-time spectrum of sn 2006x can bereasonably fit with two components: a nebular spectrum of a normal sn ia and asynthetic le spectrum. both image and spectral analysis show a rather bluecolor for the emission of the le, suggestive of a small average grain size forthe scattering dust. using the cepheid distance to m100 of 15.2 mpc, we findthat the dust illuminated by the resolved le is $\sim$27--170 pc from the sn.the echo inferred from the nebular spectrum appears to be more luminous thanthat resolved in the images (at the $\sim2\sigma$ level), perhaps suggestingthe presence of an inner echo at $&lt;$2 acs pixels ($\sim0.05''$). it is notclear, however, whether this possible local echo was produced by a distinctdust component (i.e., the local circumstellar dust) or by a continuous, largerdistribution of dust as with the outer component. nevertheless, our detectionof a significant echo in sn 2006x confirms that this supernova was produced ina dusty environment having unusual dust properties.

1212.6261	on spectral line profiles in type ia supernova spectra	we present a detailed analysis of spectral line profiles in type ia supernova(sn ia) spectra. we focus on the feature at ~3500 - 4000 a, which is commonlythought to be caused by blueshifted absorption of ca h&amp;k. unlike some otherspectral features in sn ia spectra, this feature often has two overlapping(blue and red) components. it is accepted that the red component comes fromphotospheric calcium. however, it has been proposed that the blue component iscaused by either high-velocity calcium (from either abundance or densityenhancements above the photosphere of the sn) or si ii 3858. by looking atmultiple data sets and model spectra, we conclude that the blue component ofthe ca h&amp;k feature is caused by si ii 3858 for most sne ia. the strength of thesi ii 3858 feature varies strongly with the light-curve shape of a sn. as aresult, the velocity measured from a single-gaussian fit to the full lineprofile correlates with light-curve shape. the velocity of the ca h&amp;k componentof the profile does not correlate with light-curve shape, contrary to previousclaims. we detail the pitfalls of assuming that the blue component of the cah&amp;k feature is caused by calcium, with implications for our understanding of snia progenitors, explosions, and cosmology.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1306.4050	color dispersion and milky way reddening among type ia supernovae	past analyses of type ia supernovae (sne ia) have identified an irreduciblescatter of 5-10% in distance widely attributed to an intrinsic dispersion inluminosity. another, equally valid, source of this scatter is intrinsicdispersion in color. misidentification of the true source of this scatter canbias both the retrieved color-luminosity relation and cosmological parametermeasurements. the size of this bias depends on the magnitude of the intrinsiccolor dispersion relative to the distribution of colors that correlate withdistance. we produce a realistic simulation of a misattribution of intrinsicscatter, and find a negative bias in the recovered color-luminosity relation,beta, of dbeta -1.0 (~33%) and a positive bias in the equation of stateparameter, w, of dw +0.04 (~4%). we re-analyze current published data sets withthe assumptions that the distance scatter is predominantly the result of color.unlike previous analyses, we find that the data are consistent with a milky wayreddening law r_v=3.1, and that a milky way dust model better predicts theasymmetric color-luminosity trends than the conventional luminosity scatterhypothesis. we also determine that accounting for color variation reduces thecorrelation between various host galaxy properties and hubble residuals by~20%.

1309.2630	classifying supernovae using only galaxy data	we present a new method for probabilistically classifying supernovae (sne)without using sn spectral or photometric data. unlike all previous studies toclassify sne without spectra, this technique does not use any sn photometry.instead, the method relies on host-galaxy data. we build upon the well-knowncorrelations between sn classes and host-galaxy properties, specifically thatcore-collapse sne rarely occur in red, luminous, or early-type galaxies. usingthe nearly spectroscopically complete lick observatory supernova search sampleof sne, we determine sn fractions as a function of host-galaxy properties.using these data as inputs, we construct a bayesian method for determining theprobability that a sn is of a particular class. this method improves a commonclassification figure of merit by a factor of &gt;2, comparable to the bestlight-curve classification techniques. of the galaxy properties examined,morphology provides the most discriminating information. we further validatethis method using sn samples from the sloan digital sky survey and the palomartransient factory. we demonstrate that this method has wide-rangingapplications, including separating different subclasses of sne and determiningthe probability that a sn is of a particular class before photometry or evenspectra can. since this method uses completely independent data fromlight-curve techniques, there is potential to further improve the overallpurity and completeness of sn samples and to test systematic biases of thelight-curve techniques. further enhancements to the host-galaxy method,including additional host-galaxy properties, combination with light-curvemethods, and hybrid methods should further improve the quality of sn samplesfrom past, current, and future transient surveys.

1309.4457	hubble space telescope and ground-based observations of the type iax  supernovae sn 2005hk and sn 2008a	we present hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based optical andnear-infrared observations of sn 2005hk and sn 2008a, typical members of thetype iax class of supernovae (sne). here we focus on late-time observations,where these objects deviate most dramatically from all other sn types. insteadof the dominant nebular emission lines that are observed in other sne at latephases, spectra of sne 2005hk and 2008a show lines of fe ii, ca ii, and fe imore than a year past maximum light, along with narrow [fe ii] and [ca ii]emission. we use spectral features to constrain the temperature and density ofthe ejecta, and find high densities at late times, with n_e &gt;~ 10^9 cm^-3. suchhigh densities should yield enhanced cooling of the ejecta, making theseobjects good candidates to observe the expected "infrared catastrophe," ageneric feature of sn ia models. however, our hst photometry of sn 2008a doesnot match the predictions of an infrared catastrophe. moreover, our hstobservations rule out a "complete deflagration" that fully disrupts the whitedwarf for these peculiar sne, showing no evidence for unburned material at latetimes. deflagration explosion models that leave behind a bound remnant canmatch some of the observed properties of sne iax, but no published model isconsistent with all of our observations of sne 2005hk and 2008a.

1311.0147	on the source of the dust extinction in type ia supernovae and the  discovery of anomalously strong na i absorption	high-dispersion observations of the na i d 5890, 5896 and k i 7665, 7699interstellar lines, and the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms in thespectra of 32 type ia supernovae are used as an independent means of probingdust extinction. we show that the dust extinction of the objects where thediffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms is detected is consistent with thevisual extinction derived from the supernova colors. this strongly suggeststhat the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar materialassociated with the progenitor system. one quarter of the supernovae displayanomalously large na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dustextinction derived from their colors. remarkably, all of the cases of unusuallystrong na i d absorption correspond to "blueshifted" profiles in theclassification scheme of sternberg et al. (2011). this coincidence suggeststhat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the casesof anomalously large na i column densities. two supernovae with unusuallystrong na i d absorption showed essentially normal k i column densities for thedust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be auniversal characteristic. overall, we find the most accurate predictor ofindividual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuseinterstellar band at 5780 angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for itsuse. finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the naabundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate anddouble-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.

1312.3984	the type iib supernova 2013df and its cool supergiant progenitor	we have obtained early-time photometry and spectroscopy of supernova (sn)2013df in ngc 4414. the sn is clearly of type iib, with notable similarities tosn 1993j. from its luminosity at secondary maximum light, it appears that less$^{56}$ni ($\lesssim 0.06\ m_{\odot}$) was synthesized in the sn 2013dfexplosion than was the case for the sne iib 1993j, 2008ax, and 2011dh. based ona comparison of the light curves, the sn 2013df progenitor must have been moreextended in radius prior to explosion than the progenitor of sn 1993j. thetotal extinction for sn 2013df is estimated to be $a_v=0.30$ mag. themetallicity at the sn location is likely to be solar. we have conducted hubblespace telescope (hst) target of opportunity observations of the sn with thewide field camera 3, and from a precise comparison of these new observations toarchival hst observations of the host galaxy obtained 14 years prior toexplosion, we have identified the progenitor of sn 2013df to be a yellowsupergiant, somewhat hotter than a red supergiant progenitor for a normal typeii-plateau sn. from its observed spectral energy distribution, assuming thatthe light is dominated by one star, the progenitor had effective temperature$t_{\rm eff} = 4250 \pm 100$ k and a bolometric luminosity $l_{\rmbol}=10^{4.94 \pm 0.06}\ l_{\odot}$. this leads to an effective radius $r_{\rmeff} = 545 \pm 65\ r_{\odot}$. the star likely had an initial mass in the rangeof 13 to 17 $m_{\odot}$; however, if it was a member of an interacting binarysystem, detailed modeling of the system is required to estimate this mass moreaccurately. the progenitor star of sn 2013df appears to have been relativelysimilar to the progenitor of sn 1993j.

0802.1743	late-time observations of sn2006gy: still going strong	owing to its extremely high luminosity and long duration, sn2006gy radiatedmore energy in visual light than any other known sn. two hypotheses to explainits high luminosity -- that it was powered by shock interaction with csm asimplied by its type iin spectrum, or that it was fueled by radioactive decayfrom a large mass of 56ni synthesized in a pair-instability sn -- predicteddifferent late-time properties. here we present observations of sn2006gyobtained more than a year after discovery. we were unable to detect it atvisual wavelengths, but clear near-ir k and h-band detections show that it isstill at least as luminous as the peak of a normal sn ii. we also presentspectra giving an upper limit to the late-time ha luminosity of about 1e39erg/s. based on the weak late-time ha, x-ray, and radio emission, combined withthe difficulty of explaining the shift to ir wavelengths, we can rule outongoing csm interaction as the primary late-time power source. instead, wepropose that the evolution of sn2006gy is consistent with one of two possiblescenarios: (1) a pair-instability sn plus modest csm interaction, where theradioactive decay luminosity shifts to the ir because of dust formation. (2) anir echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existingdust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to haveejected another 10 msun shell about 1500 yr before the sn.

1402.7079	type ia supernova colors and ejecta velocities: hierarchical bayesian  regression with non-gaussian distributions	we investigate the statistical dependence of the peak intrinsic colors oftype ia supernovae (sn ia) on their expansion velocities at maximum light,measured from the si ii 6355 spectral feature. we construct a new hierarchicalbayesian regression model, accounting for the random effects of intrinsicscatter, measurement error, and reddening by host galaxy dust, and implement agibbs sampler and deviance information criteria to estimate the correlation.the method is applied to the apparent colors from bvri light curves and si iivelocity data for 79 nearby sne ia. the apparent color distributions of high(hv) and normal velocity (nv) supernovae exhibit significant discrepancies forb-v and b-r, but not other colors. hence, they are likely due to intrinsiccolor differences originating in the b-band, rather than dust reddening. themean intrinsic b-v and b-r color differences between hv and nv groups are 0.06+/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.02 mag, respectively. a linear model finds significantslopes of -0.021 +/- 0.006 and -0.030 +/- 0.009 mag/(1000 km/s) for intrinsicb-v and b-r colors versus velocity, respectively. since the ejecta velocitydistribution is skewed towards high velocities, these effects implynon-gaussian intrinsic color distributions with skewness up to +0.3. accountingfor the intrinsic color-velocity correlation results in corrections to a_vextinction estimates as large as -0.12 mag for hv sne ia and +0.06 mag for nvevents. velocity measurements from sn ia spectra have potential to diminishsystematic errors from the confounding of intrinsic colors and dust reddeningaffecting supernova distances.

1405.3677	extensive hst ultraviolet spectra and multi-wavelength observations of  sn 2014j in m82 indicate reddening and circumstellar scattering by typical  dust	sn 2014j in m82 is the closest detected type ia supernova (sn ia) in at least28 years and perhaps in 410 years. despite its small distance of 3.3 mpc, sn2014j is surprisingly faint, peaking at v = 10.6 mag, and assuming a typical snia luminosity, we infer an observed visual extinction of a_v = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mag.but this picture, with r_v = 1.6 +/- 0.2, is too simple to account for allobservations. we combine 10 epochs (spanning a month) of hst/stis ultravioletthrough near-infrared spectroscopy with hst/wfc3, kait, and fancam photometryfrom the optical to the infrared and 9 epochs of high-resolution tresspectroscopy to investigate the sources of extinction and reddening for sn2014j. we argue that the wide range of observed properties for sn 2014j iscaused by a combination of dust reddening, likely originating in theinterstellar medium of m82, and scattering off circumstellar material. for thismodel, roughly half of the extinction is caused by reddening from typical dust(e(b-v ) = 0.45 mag and r_v = 2.6) and roughly half by scattering off lmc-likedust in the circumstellar environment of sn 2014j.

1408.1089	a luminous, blue progenitor system for a type-iax supernova	type-iax supernovae (sn iax) are stellar explosions that arespectroscopically similar to some type-ia supernovae (sn ia) at maximum light,except with lower ejecta velocities. they are also distinguished by lowerluminosities. at late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from othersn, but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-masselements) suggests a physical connection to normal sn ia. these are not rare;sn iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal sn ia rate. the leadingmodels for sn iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen whitedwarfs that do not completely unbind the star, implying they are "lesssuccessful" cousins of normal sn ia, where complete disruption is observed.here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of thetype-iax sn 2012z in deep pre-explosion imaging. its luminosity, colors,environment, and similarity to the progenitor of the galactic helium nova v445puppis, suggest that sn 2012z was the explosion of a white dwarf accreting froma helium-star companion. observations in the next few years, after sn 2012z hasfaded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernovawas actually the explosive death of a massive star.

1408.1091	possible detection of the stellar donor or remnant for the type iax  supernova 2008ha	type iax supernovae (sne iax) are thermonuclear explosions that are relatedto sne ia, but are physically distinct. the most important differences are thatsne iax have significantly lower luminosity (1% - 50% that of typical sne ia),lower ejecta mass (~0.1 - 0.5 m_sun), and may leave a bound remnant. the mostextreme sn iax is sn 2008ha, which peaked at m_v = -14.2 mag, about 5 mag belowthat of typical sne ia. here, we present hubble space telescope (hst) images ofugc 12682, the host galaxy of sn 2008ha, taken 4.1 years after the peakbrightness of sn 2008ha. in these deep, high-resolution images, we detect asource coincident (0.86 hst pixels; 0.043"; 1.1 sigma) with the position of sn2008ha with m_f814w = -5.4 mag. we determine that this source is unlikely to bea chance coincidence, but that scenario cannot be completely ruled out. if thissource is directly related to sn 2008ha, it is either the luminous boundremnant of the progenitor white dwarf or its companion star. the source isconsistent with being an evolved &gt;3 m_sun initial mass star, and issignificantly redder than the sn iax 2012z progenitor system, the firstdetected progenitor system for a thermonuclear sn. if this source is thecompanion star for sn 2008ha, there is a diversity in sn iax progenitorsystems, perhaps related to the diversity in sn iax explosions. if the sourceis the bound remnant of the white dwarf, it must have expanded significantly.regardless of the nature of this source, we constrain the progenitor system ofsn 2008ha to have an age of &lt;80 myr.

1408.1706	the changing fractions of type ia supernova nuv-optical subclasses with  redshift	uv and optical photometry of type ia supernovae (sne ia) at low redshift haverevealed the existence of two distinct color groups, nuv-red and nuv-blueevents. the color curves differ primarily by an offset, with the nuv-blue u-color curves bluer than the nuv-red curves by 0.4 mag. for a sample of 23 low-zsne~ia observed with swift, the nuv-red group dominates by a ratio of 2:1. wecompare rest-frame uv/optical spectrophotometry of intermediate and high-z sneia with uvot photometry and hst spectrophotometry of low-z sne ia, finding thatthe same two color groups exist at higher-z, but with the nuv-blue events asthe dominant group. within each red/blue group, we do not detect any offset incolor for different redshifts, providing insight into how sn~ia uv emissionevolves with redshift. through spectral comparisons of sne~ia with similar peakwidths and phase, we explore the wavelength range that produces the uv/optcolor differences. we show that the ejecta velocity of nuv-red sne is largerthan that of nuv-blue objects by roughly 12% on average. this velocitydifference can explain some of the uv/optical color difference, but differencesin the strengths of spectral features seen in meanspectra require additionalexplanation. because of the different b-v colors for these groups, nuv-red snewill have their extinction underestimated using common techniques. this, inturn, leads to under-estimation of the optical luminosity of the nuv-bluesne~ia, in particular, for the high-redshift cosmological sample. notaccounting for this effect should thus produce a distance bias that increaseswith redshift and could significantly bias measurements of cosmologicalparameters.

1408.2651	twins for life? a comparative analysis of the type ia supernovae 2011fe  and 2011by	the nearby type ia supernovae (sne ia) 2011fe and 2011by had nearly identicalphotospheric phase optical spectra, light-curve widths, and photometriccolours, but at peak brightness sn 2011by reached a fainter absolute magnitudein all optical bands and exhibited lower flux in the near-ultraviolet (nuv).based on those data, foley &amp; kirshner (2013) argue that the progenitors of sne2011by and 2011fe were supersolar and subsolar, respectively, and that sn2011fe generated 1.7 times the amount of 56ni as sn 2011by. with this work, weextend the comparison of these sne ia to 10 days before and 300 days aftermaximum brightness with new spectra and photometry. we show that the nebularphase spectra of sne 2011fe and 2011by are almost identical, and do not supporta factor of 1.7 difference in 56ni mass. instead, we find it plausible that thetully-fisher distance for sn 2011by is an underestimate, in which case thesesne ia may have reached similar peak luminosity, formed similar amounts of56ni, and had lower metallicity progenitors than previously estimated.regardless of the true distance to sn 2011by, we find that the relativeprogenitor metallicity difference remains well supported by their disparity innuv flux, which we show to be even stronger at pre-maximum epochs --- althoughcontributions from differences in total ejecta mass, viewing angle, orprogenitor density cannot be ruled out. we also demonstrate that, independentof distance modulus, sn 2011by exhibits a late-time luminosity excess thatcannot be explained by a light echo, but is more likely to be the result ofgreater energy trapping by the nucleosynthetic products of sn 2011by.

astro-ph;0206368	photospheric-phase spectropolarimetry and nebular-phase spectroscopy of  the peculiar type ic supernova 2002ap	the early-time optical spectrum of the type ic supernova (sn) 2002ap wascharacterized by unusually broad features, leading some authors to designate ita "hypernova." we present optical spectropolarimetry of this object 16 and 37days after the estimated date of explosion. after correcting for interstellarpolarization, we find evidence for a high level of intrinsic continuumpolarization at both epochs: p &gt;~ 1.3% on day 16 and p &gt;~ 1.0% on day 37.prominent line polarization is also seen, especially in the trough of the ca iinear-infrared triplet during the second epoch. when interpreted in terms of theoblate, electron-scattering model atmospheres of hoeflich (1991), our resultsimply an asymmetry of at least 20% (day 16) and 17% (day 37). the data suggesta fair degree of axisymmetry, although the polarization angle of the dominantpolarization axes are different by about 55 deg. between the two epochs,implying a complex morphology for the thinning ejecta. in particular, thereexists some spectropolarimetric evidence for a different distribution of carelative to iron-group elements. we also present flux spectra of sn 2002aptaken 131 and 140 days after the explosion. the spectra are characterized by avery weak continuum and broad emission lines, indicating that sn 2002ap hasentered the nebular phase. the spectral features are substantially similar tothose of ``normal'' sne ic in the nebular phase, and the emission lines are notsignificantly broader. however, some of the broad lines are very sharplypeaked, and may possess a narrow component (probably unresolved by our spectra,fwhm &lt;~ 400 km/s that is redshifted by ~ 580$ km/s with respect to the systemicvelocity of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0505504	the calibration of the swift/uvot optical observations: a recipe for  photometry	swift/uvot has the capability to provide critical insight into the physics ofthe early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). but without precisecalibration of the uvot to standard photometric systems, it is impossible toleverage late- time, ground-based follow-up data to the early-time uvotobservations. in this paper, we present a calibration of the swift/uvotphotometry to the standard johnson ubv system for the uvot ubv filters,and astep-by-step photometry recipe for analyzing these data. we base our analysison aperture photometry performed on the ground-based and uvot observations ofthe local standard stars in the fields of supernovae (sne) 2005am and 2005cf,and a number of landolt standard stars.we find that the optimal photometryaperture radius for uvot data is small (2".5 for unbinned data,3".0 for 2x2binned data),and show that the coincidence- loss (c-loss) correction isimportant even for relatively faint magnitudes (mag 16 to 19). based on atheoretically motivated model,we fit the c-loss correction with two parameters,the photometric zero point (zp) and the saturation magnitude (m_inf), andderive tight constraints for both parameters [sigma(zp) = 0.01 mag andsigma(m_inf) = 0.02 mag)].we find that the color term correction is notnecessary for the uvot b and v filters,but is necessary for the u filter forblue objects [(u - v) &lt; 0.4 mag]. we also apply our calibration results to theuvot observations of grb 050603. there is a scatter of ~0.04--0.08 mag in ourfinal uvot photometry, the cause of which is unclear, but may be partly due tothe spatial variation in the pixel sensitivity of the uvot detector.

astro-ph;0506470	evidence for spectropolarimetric diversity in type ia supernovae	we present single-epoch, post-maximum spectropolarimetry of four type iasupernovae (sne ia) that span a range of spectral and photometric properties:sn 2002bf and sn 2004dt exhibit unusually high-velocity (hv) absorption lines.sn 1997dt is probably somewhat subluminous, and sn 2003du is slightlyoverluminous. we detect polarization modulations across strong lines in allfour objects, demonstrating that all are intrinsically polarized. however, thenature and degree of the polarization varies considerably. including all sne iastudied thus far, the following order emerges in terms of increasing strengthof line-polarization features: ordinary/overluminous &lt; subluminous &lt; hv sne ia,with the strength of the line-polarization features increasing from 0.2% in theslightly overluminous sn 2003du to 2% in both of the hv sne ia in our study.the most convincing explanation for the line polarization of all objects ispartial obscuration of the photosphere by clumps of intermediate-mass elements(imes) forged in the explosion; the polarization characteristics of the hv sneia in particular effectively rule out a simple ellipsoidal asphericity as theroot cause of their line polarization. that sne ia are separable into differentgroups based on their spectropolarimetric characteristics may help narrow downprogenitor possibilities and/or explosion physics. in particular, the recentlyproposed gravitationally confined detonation model may provide an attractiveexplanation for many of the observed polarization characteristics of hv sne ia.

0809.0601	the chemical abundances of tycho g in supernova remnant 1572	we present an analysis of the chemical abundances of the star tycho g in thedirection of the remnant of supernova (sn) 1572, based on keck high-resolutionoptical spectra. the stellar parameters of this star are found to be those of ag-type subgiant with $t_{\mathrm{eff}} = 5900 \pm 100$ k, \loggl $ = 3.85 \pm0.30$ dex, and $\mathrm{[fe/h]} = -0.05 \pm 0.09$. this determination agreeswith the stellar parameters derived for the star in a previous survey for thepossible companion star of sn 1572 (ruiz-lapuente et al. 2004). the chemicalabundances follow the galactic trends, except for ni, which is overabundantrelative to fe, $[{\rm ni/fe}] $ $=$ 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04. co is slightlyoverabundant (at a low significance level). these enhancements in fe-peakelements could have originated from pollution by the supernova ejecta. we finda surprisingly high li abundance for a star that has evolved away from the mainsequence. we discuss these findings in the context of companion stars ofsupernovae.

astro-ph;0509731	sn 2005bf: a possible transition event between type ib/c supernovae and  gamma ray bursts	we present u'g'r'i'bv photometry and optical spectroscopy of the type ib/icsn 2005bf covering the first ~100 days following discovery. the u'g'bv lightcurves displayed a double-peaked morphology, which is among type ib/icsupernovae. the bolometric light curve indicates that sn 2005bf was aremarkably luminous event. spectroscopically, sn 2005bf underwent a uniquetransformation from a type ic-like event at early times to a typical type ibsupernova at later phases. the initial maximum in u'g'bv was accompanied by thepresence in the spectrum of high velocity absorption lines of fe ii, ca ii, andh i. the photospheric velocity derived from spectra at early epochs wasunusually low compared with ordinary type ib supernovae. we describeone-dimensional computer simulations which attempt to account for theseremarkable properties. the most favored model is that of a very energetic (2 x10^{51} erg), asymmetric explosion of a massive (8.3 m_sun) wolf-rayet wn starthat had lost most of its hydrogen envelope. we speculate that an unobservedrelativistic jet was launched producing a two-component explosion consisting of1) a polar explosion containing a small fraction of the total mass and movingat high velocity, and 2) the explosion of the rest of the star. at first, onlythe polar explosion is observed, producing the initial maximum and the highvelocity absorption-line spectrum resembling a type ic event. at late times,this fast-moving component becomes optically-thin, revealing the slower-movingexplosion of the rest of the star and transforming the observed spectrum tothat of a typical type ib supernova. if this scenario is correct, then sn2005bf is the best example to date of a transition object between normal typeib/ic supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0603083	spectropolarimetry of the peculiar type ia sn 2005hk	we present keck spectropolarimetry of the unusual type ia supernova (sn ia)2005hk several days before maximum light. an analysis of the highsignal-to-noise-ratio total-flux spectrum shows the object's extreme similarityto the peculiar sn 2002cx. sn 2005hk has an optical spectrum dominated by feiii lines and only weak lines of intermediate-mass elements, unlike a normal snia at this epoch. the photospheric velocity measured from the minima of strongabsorption lines is very low for an sn ia (~6000 km s^{-1}), solidifying theconnection to sn 2002cx. the spectrum-synthesis code synow was used to identifythe presence of iron-peak elements, intermediate-mass elements, and possiblyunburned carbon at similar velocities in the outer ejecta of sn 2005hk. manyweak spectral features remain unidentified. the spectropolarimetry shows a lowlevel of continuum polarization (~0.4%) after correction for the interstellarcomponent and only a weak fe iii line feature is detected. the level ofcontinuum polarization is normal for an sn ia, implying that the unusualfeatures of sn 2005hk cannot be readily explained by large asymmetries.

astro-ph;0603297	a non-spherical core in the explosion of supernova sn 2004dj	an important and perhaps critical clue to the mechanism driving the explosionof massive stars as supernovae is provided by the accumulating evidence forasymmetry in the explosion. indirect evidence comes from high pulsarvelocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, andasymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. spectropolarimetry provides adirect probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generallyindicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. large polarizationshave been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type ic) supernovae, whichconfirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive starswith intact hydrogen envelopes (type ii-p supernovae) have shown only weakpolarizations at the early times observed. here we report multi-epochspectropolarimetry of a classic type ii-p supernova that reveals the abruptappearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed inthe thinning ejecta (~90 days after explosion). we infer a departure fromspherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. combined withearlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be ageneric feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericityin type ii-p supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque,hydrogen envelope.

astro-ph;0611079	on the absence of wind signatures in grb afterglow spectra: constraints  on the wolf-rayet winds of grb progenitors	we investigate available constraints on the circumstellar medium (csm) aroundlong-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) progenitors from afterglow spectra. wefirst establish a statistical sample of five grb afterglow spectra that havebeen collected and analyzed with no prior knowledge of the line-of-sightproperties. this sample is then adopted for a uniform search of wolf-rayet windsignatures, as represented by civ 1548, 1550 absorption doublets at dv=-1000 to-5000 km/s from the grbs (hereafter civ_{15}). we report the detection of asingle civ_{15} absorber at dv ~ -1500 km/s from grb 050730 and none in therest. our search yields an estimate of 20% for the incidence of civ_{15}absorbers with rest-frame absorption equivalent width ew(civ 1548)&gt;0.2 ang neargrb host galaxies, consistent with the incidence of intergalactic civ_{15} nearclassical damped lya absorbers toward quasar sightlines. including the twociv_{15} absorbers previously known toward grb 021004, we further demonstratethat the presence of h^0, c^+, and si^+ together with the absence of excitedc^+ or si^+ argue against a csm origin. the null result is consistent with theexpectation that the circumburst medium is fully ionized by the afterglowradiation field. we examine possible scenarios for the survival of the c^{3+}ions, including a clumpy wind model. we find that a clumpy wind is unable toeffectively shield the ionizing radiation and allow c^{3+} to survive at r&lt;10pc from the afterglow. we conclude that the lack of csm-originated civ_{15}absorbers is consistent with wolf-rayet winds terminating at &lt; 30 pc from theirprogenitor stars.

astro-ph;0612617	sn 2006gy: discovery of the most luminous supernova ever recorded,  powered by the death of an extremely massive star like eta carinae	(abridged) we report our discovery and observations of the peculiar type iinsupernova sn2006gy in ngc1260, revealing that it reached a peak magnitude of-22, making it the most luminous supernova ever recorded. it is not yet clearwhat powers the total radiated energy of 1e51 erg, but we argue that anymechanism -- thermal emission, circumstellar interaction, or 56ni decay --requires a very massive progenitor star. the circumstellar interactionhypothesis would require truly exceptional conditions around the star probablyexperienced an lbv eruption like the 19th century eruption of eta carinae.alternatively, radioactive decay of 56ni may be a less objectionablehypothesis. that power source would imply a large ni mass of 22 msun, requiringthat sn2006gy was a pair-instability supernova where the star's core wasobliterated. sn2006gy is the first supernova for which we have good reason tosuspect a pair-instability explosion. based on a number of lines of evidence,we rule out the hypothesis that sn 2006gy was a ``type iia'' event. instead, wepropose that the progenitor may have been a very massive evolved object likeeta carinae that, contrary to expectations, failed to completely shed itsmassive hydrogen envelope before it died. our interpretation of sn2006gyimplies that the most massive stars can explode earlier than expected, duringthe lbv phase, preventing them from ever becoming wolf-rayet stars. sn2006gyalso suggests that the most massive stars can create brilliant supernovaeinstead of dying ignominious deaths through direct collapse to a black hole.

astro-ph;0701049	on the progenitors of two type ii-p supernovae in the virgo cluster	direct identification of the progenitors of supernovae (sne) is rare becauseof the required spatial resolution and depth of the archival data prior to thesn explosions. here we report on the identification of the progenitors of twonearby sne in the virgo cluster: sn 2006my in ngc 4651 and sn 2006ov in m61. weobtained high-quality ground-based images of sn 2006my with thecanada-france-hawaii telescope, and are able to locate the site of the sn onpre-sn {\it hubble space telescope} ({\it hst}) wide field planetary camera 2images to a high precision (1$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\pm0\farcs$05). wepinpoint the site of sn 2006ov to within 0$\farcs$02 from {\it hst} advancedcamera for surveys images of the sn. we detected a red supergiant progenitorfor each sn within the error circles, with an inferred zero-age main-sequencemass ($m_{\rm zams}$) of $10^{+5}_{-3}$ $m_\odot$ and $15^{+5}_{-3}$ $m_\odot$for the progenitors of sne 2006my and 2006ov, respectively. the mass estimatesfor the progenitors of both sne confirm a suggested trend that the most commontype ii-plateau sne originate from low-mass supergiants with $m_{\rm zams}\approx 8$--20 $m_\odot$.

astro-ph;0702117	signatures of delayed detonation, asymmetry, and electron capture in the  mid-infrared spectra of supernovae 2003hv and 2005df	we present the first mid-infrared (5.2-15.2 micron) spectra of type iasupernovae (sne 2003hv and 2005df). the detection of ni emission in sn 2005df135 days after the explosion provides direct observational evidence ofhigh-density nuclear burning forming a significant amount of stable ni in atype ia supernova. the observed emission line profiles in the sn 2005dfspectrum indicate a chemically stratified ejecta structure. the sn 2005df arlines also exhibit a two-pronged emission profile implying that the ar emissiondeviates significantly from spherical symmetry. the spectrum of sn 2003hv alsoshows signs of asymmetry, exhibiting blueshifted [co iii] which matches theblueshift of [fe ii] lines in nearly coeval nir spectra. finally, localthermodynamic equilibrium abundance estimates for the yield of radioactive 56nigive ~0.5 msun, for sn 2003hv, but only ~0.13-0.22 msun for the apparentlysubluminous sn 2005df, supporting the notion that the luminosity of sne ia isprimarily a function of the radioactive 56ni yield.  the chemically stratified ejecta structure observed in sn 2005df matches thepredictions of delayed-detonation (dd) models, but is entirely incompatiblewith current three-dimensional deflagration models. furthermore the degree thatthis layering persists to the innermost regions of the supernova is difficultto explain even in a dd scenario, where the innermost ejecta are still theproduct of deflagration burning. thus, while these results are roughlyconsistent with a delayed detonation, it is clear that a key piece of physicsis still missing from our understanding of the earliest phases of sn iaexplosions.

0810.4923	improved standardization of type ii-p supernovae: application to an  expanded sample	in the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using avariety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent systematicuncertainties. owing to progenitor histories and explosion physics differingfrom those of type ia sne (sne ia), type ii-plateau supernovae (sne ii-p) areunlikely to be affected by evolution in the same way. based on a new analysisof 17 sne ii-p, and on an improved methodology, we find that sne ii-p are goodstandardizable candles, almost comparable to sne ia. we derive a tight hubblediagram with a dispersion of 10% in distance, using the simple correlationbetween luminosity and photospheric velocity introduced by hamuy &amp; pinto 2002.we show that the descendent method of nugent et al. 2006 can be furthersimplified and that the correction for dust extinction has low statisticalimpact. we find that our sn sample favors, on average, a very steep dust lawwith total to selective extinction r_v&lt;2. such an extinction law has beenrecently inferred for many sne ia. our results indicate that a distancemeasurement can be obtained with a single spectrum of a sn ii-p during theplateau phase combined with sparse photometric measurements.
