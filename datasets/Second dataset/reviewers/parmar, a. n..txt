0707.3363	very deep x-ray observations of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 4u 0142+614	we report on two new xmm-newton observations of the anomalous x-ray pulsar(axp) 4u 0142+614 performed in march and july 2004, collecting the mostaccurate spectrum for this source to date. furthermore, we analyse two shortarchival observations performed in february 2002 and january 2003 (the latteralready reported by gohler et al. 2005) in order to study the long termbehaviour of this axp. 4u 0142+614 appears to be relatively steady in fluxbetween 2002 and 2004, and the phase-averaged spectrum does not show anysignificant variability between the four epochs. we derive the deepest upperlimits to date on the presence of lines in the 4u 0142+614 spectrum as afunction of energy: equivalent width in the 1-3 kev energy range &lt; 4 ev and &lt; 8ev for narrow and broad lines, respectively. a remarkable energy dependence inboth the pulse profile and the pulsed fraction is detected, and consequentlypulse-phase spectroscopy shows spectral variability as a function of phase. bymaking use of xmm-newton and integral data, we successfully model the 1-250 kevspectrum of 4u 0142+614 with three models presented in rea et al. (2007a),namely the canonical absorbed blackbody plus two power-laws, a resonantcyclotron scattering model plus one power-law and two log-parabolic functions.

1204.5840	maxi j1659-152: the shortest orbital period black-hole transient in  outburst	maxi j1659-152 is a bright x-ray transient black-hole candidate binary systemdiscovered in september 2010. we report here on maxi, rxte, swift, andxmm-newton observations during its 2010/2011 outburst. we find that during thefirst one and a half week of the outburst the x-ray light curves display dropsin intensity at regular intervals, which we interpret as absorption dips. aboutthree weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen. these dipshave, however, a spectral behaviour opposite to that of the absorption dips,and are related to fast spectral state changes (hence referred to as transitiondips). the absorption dips recur with a period of 2.414+/-0.005 hrs, which weinterpret as the orbital period of the system. this implies that maxi j1659-152is the shortest period black-hole candidate binary known to date. theinclination of the accretion disk with respect to the line of sight isestimated to be 65-80 degrees. we propose the companion to the black-holecandidate to be close to an m5 dwarf star, with a mass and radius of about0.15-0.25 m_sun and 0.2-0.25 r_sun, respectively. we derive that the companionhad an initial mass of about 1.5 m_sun, which evolved to its current mass inabout 5-6 billion years. the system is rather compact (orbital separation oflarger than ~1.33 r_sun), and is located at a distance of 8.6+/-3.7 kpc, with aheight above the galactic plane of 2.4+/-1.0 kpc. the characteristics of shortorbital period and high galactic scale height are shared with two othertransient black-hole candidate x-ray binaries, i.e., xte j1118+480 and swiftj1735.5-0127. we suggest that all three are kicked out of the galactic planeinto the halo, rather than being formed in a globular cluster.

1311.5751	xmm-newton publication statistics	we assessed the scientific productivity and data usage statistics ofxmm-newton by examining 3272 refereed papers published until the end of 2012that directly use xmm-newton data. the sao/nasa astrophysics data system (ads)was accessed for information on each paper including the number of citations.for each paper, the xmm-newton observation identifiers and instruments weredetermined and used extract detailed information from the xmm-newton archive onthe parameters of the observations. the information obtained from these sourceswas then combined to allow the scientific productivity of the mission to beassessed. since three years after the launch, about 300 refereed papers peryear were published that directly use xmm-newton data. after more than 13 yearsin operation, this rate shows no decline. since 2002, around 100 scientists peryear have become lead authors for the first time. each refereed xmm-newtonpaper receives around four citations per year in the first few years with along-term citation rate of three citations per year, more than five years afterpublication. about half of the articles citing xmm-newton articles are notprimarily x-ray observational papers. the distribution of elapsed time betweenobservations taken under the guest observer programme and first article peaksat 2 years with a possible second peak at 3.25 years. observations taken underthe target of opportunity programme are published significantly faster, afterone year on average. 90% of science time taken until the end of 2009 has beenused in at least one article. most observations were used more than once,yielding on average a factor of two in usage on available observing time peryear. about 20% of all slew observations have been used in publications. thescientific productivity of xmm-newton remains extremely high with no evidencethat it is decreasing after more than 13 years of operations.

0805.4124	xmm-newton observations of the low-mass x-ray binary xb1832-330 in the  galactic globular cluster ngc 6652	we report on two xmm-newton observations performed in 2006 of the luminouslow-mass x-ray binary xb1832-330 which is located in the galactic globularcluster ngc 6652 and is probably an ultracompact binary (orbital period lessthan 1 hour). the aim of these observations is to investigate the low-energyabsorption towards ngc6652 and in particular to search for ne-rich materiallocal to the binary, which has been suggested as a possible spectral signatureof neon rich degenerate companions. xmm-newton observed the source twice, in2006 september and october. high resolution spectroscopy with the rgs was usedto estimate the ratio of the neutral neon to oxygen column densities to searchfor an anomalous ne abundance in this x-ray binary. we find no evidence foranomalous ne/o ratios, finding ne/o=0.18+/-0.06 and ne/o=0.17+/-0.03 (1 sigmauncertainties), in the two observations, respectively. these values areconsistent with that in the interstellar medium. timing analysis of epic datasuggests possible periodicities at 9170+/-235 s and 18616 +/- 531 s, which needconfirmation. a by-product of these observations consists of the spatialanalysis of the source field, which resulted in the detection of 46 faintsources within the epic field of view, which are not present in the secondxmm-newton serendipitous source catalogue. all these faint sources are likelyforeground objects. we performed the first high spectral resolutionobservations of xb1832-33, a probable ultracompact binary, without finding anyevidence for an anomalous ne abundance.

astro-ph;0003020	ambiguities in fits to the complex x-ray spectra of starburst galaxies	spectral fits to x-ray data from both ngc 253 and m 82 provide ambiguousresults. the so-called ``best fit'' results depend on the instrument with whichthe data were obtained and obviously on the choice of spectral modelcomposition. we show that different spectral models can be fit equally well tobepposax data of both galaxies. metallicities are unreliable in general, with astrong dependence on the choice of model. preference to one particular spectralmodel can only be given by combining spectroscopic and imaging x-ray data fromall available satellites (rosat, asca, and bepposax). based on spectra of ngc253, we demonstrate that a model consisting of two or more thermal plasmacomponents plus a hard power law continuum and fe k alpha line emission canexplain all observations. these model components represent the integralspectrum of thermal gas and compact sources in starburst galaxies that are mostlikely supernova remnants and x-ray binaries. the same model can fit the x-raydata of m 82, but there the evidence, from rosat imaging, of the existence ofcompact sources which might represent high-mass x-ray binaries is weaker. thisimplies that its hard x-ray emission, which is extended in rosat images, might- if truly diffuse - be dominated by a very hot (several kev energy) thermalgas component.

astro-ph;0006307	bepposax spectroscopy of the ngc7078 (m15) globular cluster x-ray source  x2127+119	results of a 1999 november 16--17 bepposax observation of the low-mass x-raybinary x2127+119 located in the globular cluster ngc7078 are presented. thesystem is believed to be one where the central neutron star is normallyobscured by the accretion disk, and only x-rays scattered into our line ofsight by an extended accretion disk corona (adc) are observed. the 0.1--10 kevlightcurve is energy dependent and shows two partial eclipses separated by the17.1 hr orbital period. the 0.1--100 kev spectrum is unusually complex, but canbe successfully modeled using a partially covered power-law and disk-blackbodymodel. together with a column consistent with the interstellar value tongc7078, about 60% of the source is covered by an additional column of 1e22atom/cm2. the absorbed component may be x-rays that pass through the outerlayers of the accretion disk. the energy dependent intensity variations by afactor of ~2 may be modeled as due to a changing normalization of thedisk-blackbody. none of the other spectral parameters appear to clearly dependon luminosity. the same spectral model is also able to fit an archival ascaspectrum.

astro-ph;0012383	bepposax study of the broad-band properties of luminous globular cluster  x-ray sources	we have performed a detailed study of the broadband spectra of the luminousglobular cluster x-ray sources using bepposax. with the exception of x2127+119,located in ngc7078, all the other spectra are well represented by a twocomponent model consisting of a disk-blackbody and comptonized emission. themeasured low-energy absorptions are in good agreement with those predicted fromoptical measurements of the host globular clusters. this implies that there islittle intrinsic x-ray absorption within the binaries themselves, and that theabove spectral model provides a good representation of the low-energy continua.the sources can be divided into two groups. in the first group, composed of 3ultra-compact (orbital period &lt;1hr) sources, the disk-blackbody temperaturesand inner-radii appear physically realistic and the comptonization seed photonstemperatures and radii of the emission areas are consistent with the disktemperatures and inner radii. for all the other sources, the disk-blackbodyparameters appear not to be physically realistic and the comptonizationparameters are unrelated to those of the disk-blackbody emission. if this is aspectral signature of ultra-compact binaries, this implies that no otherultra-compact binaries are present among those studied here. it is unclear whythis difference between the two types of binaries should exist.

astro-ph;0101057	bepposax spectroscopy of the luminous x-ray sources in m33	the nearby galaxy m33 was observed by the imaging x-ray instruments on-boardbepposax. two observations at different phases of the 105.9 day intensity cycleof the luminous central source x-8 failed to reveal the expected modulation,suggesting that it is probably transitory. similar behavior has been observedfrom several x-ray binary sources. this strengthens somewhat the idea that m33x-8 is a black hole accreting from a binary companion. the 0.2-10 kev spectrumof m33 x-8 can best be modeled by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of1.89 +0.40 -0.79 and a disk-blackbody with a temperature, kt, of 1.10 +/0 0.05kev and a projected inner-disk radius of 55.4 +6.0 -7.7 km. this spectral shapeis in good agreement with earlier asca results. the 2-10 kev spectra of m33x-4, x-5, x-7, x-9 and x-10 are all consistent with power-law or bremsstrahlungmodels, whilst that of x-6 appears to be significantly more complex and may bereasonably well modeled with a disk-blackbody with kt = 1.7 +/- 0.2 kev and aprojected inner-disk radius of 7 +/- 2 km. the spectrum of m33 x-9 is ratherhard with a photon index of 1.3. compared to earlier einstein and rosatobservations, m33 x-7 and x-9 varied in intensity, m33 x-4, x-6, and x-10 mayhave varied and m33 x-5 remained constant.

astro-ph;0107338	bepposax observation of the eclipsing dipping x-ray binary x1658-298	results of a 2000 august 12-13 bepposax observation of the 7.1 hr eclipsing,dipping, bursting, transient, low-mass x-ray binary (lmxrb) x1658-298 arepresented. the spectrum outside of eclipses, dips and bursts can be modeled bythe combination of a soft disk-blackbody and a harder comptonized componentwith a small amount (1.3 10e21 atom/cm2) of low-energy absorption. in contrast,an rxte observation 18 months earlier during the same outburst, measured anabsorption of 5.0 10e22 atom/cm2. such a change is consistent with a thinningof the accretion disk as the outburst progresses. structured residuals from thebest-fit spectral model are present which are tentatively identified withne-k/fe-l and fe-k shell emission. the spectral changes during dips are complexand may be modeled by a strong (~3 10e23 atom/cm2) increase in absorption ofthe comptonized component only, together with reductions in normalizations ofboth spectral components. this behavior is in contrast to the ``complexcontinuum'' model for x-ray dip sources, where the softer blackbody componentrapidly suffers strong absorption. it is however, similar to that found duringrecent xmm-newton observations of the eclipsing, dipping, lmxrb exo0748-676.

astro-ph;0107372	bepposax spectroscopy of mr 2251-178: a test for ionized reflection in  radio quiet qsos	we present the 0.1-200 kev bepposax spectrum of mr 2251-178 observed at twoepochs in 1998 separated by 5 months. both epochs show identical spectral shapeand x-ray flux. analysis of the combined spectra allow us to confirm thepresence of the ionized fe k-alpha line detected by asca and to test thepresence of reflection from ionized material. the best self-consistent spectralfit is obtained when including a contribution from a mildly ionized reflector(xi(0.01-100) ~ 1625 erg cm s-1, i.e. u(0.1-10) ~ 0.14) with a reflectionfraction r_ion ~ 0.11. an exponential cut-off to the direct power-law continuumis then required at e ~ 100 kev. the low energy spectrum is absorbed by ionizedmatter with a column density n_w = (8.1 (-1.2/+2.1))*10^21 cm^-2 and an x-rayionization parameter u(0.1-10)= 0.06 +/- 0.01. the warm absorber column isslightly lower than that measured with asca. this change could be caused bybulk motion. the bepposax absorber ionization parameter globally agrees withthe ``u versus flux'' correlation found for mr 2251-178 with exosat, ginga andasca. this suggests that the absorber is in a state of instantaneous ionizationequilibrium.

astro-ph;0207546	strongly absorbed quiescent x-ray emission from the x-ray transient xte  j0421+56 (ci cam) observed with xmm-newton	we have observed the x-ray transient xte j0421+56 in quiescence withxmm-newton. the observed spectrum is highly unusual being dominated by anemission feature at ~6.5 kev. the spectrum can be fit using a partially coveredpower-law and gaussian line model, in which the emission is almost completelycovered (covering fraction of 0.98_{-0.06}^{+0.02}) by neutral material and isstrongly absorbed with an n_h of (5_{-2}^{+3}) x 10^{23} atom cm^{-2}. thisabsorption is local and not interstellar. the gaussian has a centroid energy of6.4 +/- 0.1 kev, a width &lt; 0.28 kev and an equivalent width of 940^{+650}_{-460} ev. it can be interpreted as fluorescent emission line fromiron. using this model and assuming xte j0421+56 is at a distance of 5 kpc, its0.5-10 kev luminosity is 3.5 x 10^{33} erg s^{-1}. the optical monitor onboardxmm-newton indicates a v magnitude of 11.86 +/- 0.03. the spectra of x-raytransients in quiescence are normally modeled using advection dominatedaccretion flows, power-laws, or by the thermal emission from a neutron starsurface. the strongly locally absorbed x-ray emission from xte j0421+56 istherefore highly unusual and could result from the compact object beingembedded within a dense circumstellar wind emitted from the supergiant b[e]companion star. the uncovered and unabsorbed component observed below 5 kevcould be due either to x-ray emission from the supergiant b[e] star itself, orto the scattering of high-energy x-ray photons in a wind or ionized corona,such as observed in some low-mass x-ray binary systems.

astro-ph;9710355	evidence for a late-time outburst of the x-ray afterglow of gb970508  from bepposax	the gamma-ray burst gb970508 was observed simultaneously by the gamma rayburst monitor (grbm) and one of the x-ray wide field cameras (wfc) aboardbepposax. the latter provided a position within 1.9' radius. a series offollow-up observations with the narrow field intruments (nfi) was thenperformed in a period from 6 hours to 6 days after the main event. a previouslyunknown source, which we associate with the afterglow of the grb, wasdiscovered in the error box. we find that, after the initial burst, x-rayemission is still present and decays as t^(-1.1) up to 6 times 10^4 s. this isfollowed by a burst of activity with a duration 10^5 s. the energy produced inthis event is a substantial fraction of the total energy of the grb, whichmeans that the afterglow is not a remnant of the initial burst (the grb) thatfades away smoothly. our results support the idea that the processes generatingthe grb and its afterglow are the same.

astro-ph;9809013	evidence for ionized reprocessing in the x-ray spectrum of the seyfert 1  galaxy 1e1615+061	the seyfert 1 galaxy 1e1615+061 was observed to display a very steep andintense soft x-ray spectrum during a heao-1 a2 observation in the 1978. such anexceptionally soft x-ray state has never been observed subsequently, but thesource has continued to exhibit a large (up to a factor 6) range of x-rayintensity variability. the overall uv/x-ray spectrum of this source, observedduring a multiwavelength campaign in 1991-1992, can be well fit with aself-consistent, low-m-dot accretion disk model. in this model, the soft x-raysresult were suggested to arise from reflection of the nuclear emission bymildly ionized material in the inner regions of the disk. in this paper wereport the results of an asca observation in 1995 august, which give a directconfirmation of such a scenario. the spectrum may be modeled as a power-lawwith a photon index of 1.8, together with absorption consistent with thegalactic line of sight value, substantial reflection from ionized material andan iron fluorescent k-alpha emission line. the centroid energy (~6.6--6.8 kev)implies a ionization stage &gt;fe xix. the line profile is consistent with thatexpected from a kinematically and gravitationally distorted line around a blackhole. these results provide the first direct evidence for the existence ofconsiderable amount of ionized material around the nucleus of a "broad" seyfert1 galaxy.

astro-ph;9809356	the absorption properties of gamma-ray burst afterglows measured by  bepposax	we present an analysis of the x-ray absorption properties of 6 gamma-rayburst (grb) afterglows measured with bepposax. between 8 hrs and 20 hrs afterthe initial grb trigger, individual spectra can be described by a power-lawwith a photon index of ~2 and absorption marginally consistent with thegalactic value. taken collectively, the data are inconsistent with zeroabsorption at the &gt;99.999 confidence level. the data are only marginallyconsistent with a distribution of column densities varying as the totalgalactic absorption in the direction of each of the bursts (chi^2 =9.6 for 6degrees of freedom). the data are consistent with cosmological models in whichgrb occur within host galaxies. by simultaneously fitting a power-law spectralmodel with absorption fixed at the galactic value and additional, redshifted,absorption to all 6 afterglow spectra, the best-fit average absorption withinthe host objects is found to be (1.01 ^0.28_0.51) 10^22 atom cm^-2. this valueis compatible with the host galaxy column densities inferred from optical datafor grb970508, grb971214 and grb980329, supporting the hypothesis that grboccur within heavily absorbed star forming regions of their host galaxies.

astro-ph;9905245	bepposax broad-band observations of gamma cassiopeiae	we report broad-band x-ray measurements of the be star gamma cassiopeiae bythe bepposax x-ray astronomy satellite. the observations took place on 1998july, 18-23. the 0.1-200 kev x-ray spectrum is reasonably well fit by anoptically thin thermal plasma model of temperature 12.5 +/- 0.6 kev withsignificant residuals around 0.3 kev and 1 kev. the former is interpreted asthe variable soft component reported by rosat, although there is no evidencefor variability at the 5 % level. for a blackbody interpretation, the fittedtemperature is 100 +320 -13 ev, in agreement with the rosat value of 200 +/- 10ev. however, a mekal interpretation gives a significantly lower temperature of(48 +/- 11 ev). the fitted abundances are about half solar values, in agreementwith previous measurements. at higher energies, the spectrum does not requirenon-thermal components and the observation of a line at 6.8 kev supports theasca interpretation of the source as an accreting white dwarf. assuming asource distance of 188 pc, the bolometric luminosity in the 2-10 kev band is 610^32 erg/s. simultaneous optical measurements by the wendelstein observatorynear munich, indicate that the source continues to be in a late but rathernormal be phase, with no obvious signs of a transition to the be-shell phase.the measured magnitudes at b, v and r wavelengths of 2.18 +/- 0.06, 2.23 +/-0.02 and 2.36 + /- 0.03, respectively, confirm this.

astro-ph;9906245	luminous supersoft x-ray emission from the recurrent nova u scorpii	bepposax detected luminous 0.2-2.0 kev supersoft x-ray emission from therecurrent nova u sco ~19-20 days after the peak of the optical outburst infebruary 1999. u sco is the first recurrent nova to be observed during aluminous supersoft x-ray phase. non-lte white dwarf atmosphere spectral models(together with a ~0.5 kev optically thin thermal component) were fitted to thebepposax spectrum. we find that the fit is acceptable assuming enriched he andan enhanced n/c ratio. this implies that the cno cycle was active during theoutburst, in agreement with a thermonuclear runaway scenario. the best-fittemperature is ~9 10^5 k and the bolometric luminosity those predicted forsteady nuclear burning on a wd close to the chandrasekhar mass. the fact thatu~sco was detected as a supersoft x-ray source is consistent with steadynuclear burning continuing for at least one month after the outburst. thismeans that only a fraction of the previously accreted h and he was ejectedduring the outburst and that the wd can grow in mass, ultimately reaching thechandrasekhar limit. this makes u~sco a candidate type ia supernova progenitor.

astro-ph;9907067	an anomalous low-state from the globular cluster x-ray source x1732-304  (terzan 1)	during a bepposax observation of the x-ray burst source x1732-304 located inthe globular cluster terzan 1 in 1999 april, the source was detected in ananomalously low-state with an x-ray luminosity of 1.4 x 10^33 erg/s$, about 300times fainter than the lowest previously reported measure of the persistentflux. the spectral shape and intensity of this low-state emission is similar tothat of a number of neutron star soft x-ray transients in quiescence, beingwell fit by a ~0.34 kev blackbody together with a power-law with a photon indexof ~1.0. these similarities suggest that the same mechanism, such as theinhibition of accretion due to the propeller effect, is also operating inx1732-304. alternatively, the x1732-304 low-state may be due to obscuration ofthe line of sight to the central neutron star, with only scattered and/orreflected x-rays being detected. the possibility that the source detected bybepposax is not x1732-304, but a nearby dim source of the cluster field (whatwould make the observed dimming of x1732-304 even more remarkable) is alsodiscussed.

astro-ph;9907158	a bepposax study of the pulsating transient x0115+63: the first x-ray  spectrum with four cyclotron harmonic features	the recurrent hard pulsating x-ray transient \s was observed with \b on march19, when the source was at a 2--10 kev flux level of $\sim$310~mcrab. we reporton the high energy spectrum of the source, concentrating on cyclotron resonantscattering features. the spectrum is strongly pulse phase dependent andabsorption features are detected at virtually all phases. in particular, fourabsorption-like features at 12.74 kev, 24.16 kev, 35.74 kev, and 49.5 kev areobserved in the descending edge of the main peak of the pulse profile. theratios between the centroid energies of the lines with respect to the first are1:(1.9):(2.8):(3.9). these values are close to the harmonic relation expectedfrom cyclotron resonant scattering in a strong magnetic field, whenrelativistic effects are taken into account. the equivalent widths of thesecond, third, and fourth harmonics are found to be larger than that of thefirst harmonic, confirming the key role of two-photon processes in the spectralformation. these results provide the first evidence for {\it four harmonicallyspaced lines} in the spectrum of an accreting x-ray pulsar, yielding theclearest confirmation to date of their magnetic origin.

astro-ph;9908094	the broad-band spectrum of oao1657-415 with bepposax: in search of  cyclotron lines	we report on a 30 ks observation of the high-mass x-ray binary pulsaroao1657-415 performed by bepposax on september 1998. the wide band spectrum iswell fit by both a cutoff power law, or a power law modified by a high energycutoff, plus a fluorescence iron line at 6.5 kev. the two models arestatistically equivalent. the inclusion of a cyclotron resonance feature at ~36kev -- corresponding to a magnetic field strength 3.2 (1+z) x 10^12 g, where zis the gravitational redshift -- improves significantly the x^2 for the cutoffmodel but only marginally for the power law plus high energy cutoff model. thestatistical significance of our data is not adequate to discriminate betweenthe two models, and even the "normalized crab ratio" technique, successfullyused to pinpoint cyclotron features in the spectra of other x-ray pulsars, isnot conclusive in answering the question whether the feature is real or it isan artifact due to an improper modeling of the continuum used to fit the data.

astro-ph;9909039	x-ray observations during a her x-1 anomalous low-state	results of a 1999 july 8-10 bepposax observation during an anomalouslow-state of her x-1 are presented. the standard on-state power-law andblackbody continuum model is excluded at high confidence unless partialcovering is included. this gives a power-law photon index of 0.63 +/- 0.02 andimplies that 0.28 +/- 0.03 of the flux undergoes additional absorption of (27+/- 7) 10^22 atom/cm2. 11% of the observed 0.1-10 kev flux is from the 0.068+/- 0.015 kev blackbody. 1.237747(2) s pulses with a semi-amplitude of 2.1 +/-0.8% are detected at &gt;99.5% confidence and confirmed by rxte measurements. thisimplies that her x-1 underwent substantial spin-down close to the start of theanomalous low-state. the spectral and temporal changes are similar to thoserecently reported from 4u1626-67. these may result from a strongly warped diskthat produces a spin-down torque. the x-ray source is then mostly viewedthrough the inner regions of the accretion disk. a similar mechanism could beresponsible for the her x-1 anomalous low-states. shadowing by such anunusually warped disk could produce observable effects in the optical and uvemission from the companion star.

astro-ph;9909138	bepposax spectroscopy of the globular cluster x-ray source x1746-371  (ngc6441)	during a bepposax observation of the x-ray source x1746-371 located in theglobular cluster ngc6441 a type i x-ray burst, parts of 4 intensity dips, andenergy dependent flaring were detected. the dips repeat every 5.8 +0.3 -0.9 hrand show no obvious energy dependence. if the dips are due to electronscattering this energy independence implies an abundance &gt;130 times less thansolar, confirming an earlier measurement. since the overall cluster abundanceis close to solar this low abundance is unexpected. photoionization of theabsorbing material, obscuration of an extended source, and variations inmultiple components that combine to produce an apparent energy independence areall excluded. thus, the nature of the dips remains uncertain. the best-fitmodel to the overall 0.3-30 kev spectrum is a disk-blackbody with a temperatureof 2.82 +/- 0.04 kev, together with a cutoff power-law with a photon index of-0.32 +/- 0.80 and a cutoff energy of 0.90 +/- 0.26 kev. absorption, consistentwith the optical extinction to ngc6441 of (0.28 +/- 0.04) 10^22 atom/cm2 isrequired. all previous best-fit spectral models for this source are excluded athigh confidence. the spectrum is dominated by the blackbody-like component,with the cutoff power-law only contributing an average of 12% of the 1-10 kevflux. during flaring intervals the contribution of this component decreases to\~6% with variations in the intensity of the blackbody-like component beingresponsible for most of the flaring activity.

astro-ph;9909208	an x-ray study of the dipping low mass x-ray binary xb 1323-619	during a bepposax observation of the low-mass x-ray binary dip source xb1323-619 a total of 10 type i x-ray bursts and parts of 12 intensity dips wereobserved. during non-bursting, non-dipping intervals, the 1-150 kev bepposaxspectrum can be modelled by a cutoff power-law with a photon index of 1.48 +/-0.01, a cutoff energy of 44.1 +5.1/-4.4 kev together with a blackbody with ktof 1.77 +/- 0.25 kev contributing ~15% of the 2-10 kev flux. absorptionequivalent to 3.88 +/- 0.16x10^22 h atom cm^(-2) is required. the dips repeatwith a period of 2.938 +/- 0.020 hr and span 40% of the orbital cycle. duringdips the maximum reduction in 2-10 kev intensity is ~65%. the spectral changesduring dips are complex and cannot be modelled by a simple absorber because ofthe clear presence of part of the non-dip spectrum which is not absorbed.spectral evolution in dipping can be well modelled by progressive covering ofthe cutoff power-law component which must be extended, plus rapid absorption ofthe point-source blackbody. one of the bursts is double and 4 of the burstsoccurred during dipping intervals. these bursts have 2-10 kev peak count ratesreduced by only 22% on average from those occurring outside the dips, and arenot heavily absorbed. one explanation for this lack of absorption is that thebursts temporarily ionize the absorbing material responsible for the dips.

astro-ph;9910341	bepposax spectroscopy of the hercules x-1 short-on state	we present results of a 5.7 day duration bepposax observation of the short-onstate of her x-1 and a short observation during the decline of the precedingmain-on state. the 0.1-10 kev spectra can be fit with a power-law and blackbodymodel together with fe emission features at 1.0 kev and 6.5 kev. during thelater stages of the short-on state there are long intervals when the absorptionis $\approxgt$$5 \times 10^{22}$ atom cm$^{-2}$. these intervals become longerand occur ~0.3 day earlier in each orbital cycle as the short-on stateprogresses. during the intervals of high absorption the 0.1 kev blackbody isstill clearly detected. this may indicate the presence of separate scatteredand absorbed spectral components, although other explanations such as partialcovering or a partially ionized absorber cannot be excluded. during the rest ofthe short-on state the ratio of flux in the blackbody compared to the power-lawis consistent with that in the main-on state. this supports the view that muchof the 35 day modulation is caused by an energy independent process, such aselectron scattering. the discovery of strong absorption late in the short-onstate is consistent with the predictions of the warped disk model (petterson1977, see also schandl &amp; meyer 1994) where the end of the short-on state iscaused by the accretion disk moving into the line of sight to the neutron star.the pulse phase difference between the blackbody and the power-law maxima is250 +/- 20 degrees in both observations (separated by 0.43 of a 35 day cycle).this constant phase difference is consistent with the blackbody originating atthe inner edge of a precessing accretion disk.

0810.0432	variations in the dip properties of the low-mass x-ray binary xb 1254-69  observed with xmm-newton and integral	we have analysed data from five xmm-newton observations of xb 1254-69, one ofthem simultaneous with integral, to investigate the mechanism responsible forthe highly variable dips durations and depths seen from this low-mass x-raybinary. deep dips were present during two observations, shallow dips during oneand no dips were detected during the remaining two observations. at high (1-4s) time resolution ``shallow dips'' are seen to include a few, very rapid, deepdips whilst the ``deep'' dips consist of many similar very rapid, deep,fluctuations. the folded v-band optical monitor light curves obtained when thesource was undergoing deep, shallow and no detectable dipping exhibitsinusoid-like variations with different amplitudes and phases. we fit epicspectra obtained from "persistent" or dip-free intervals with a modelconsisting of disc-blackbody and thermal comptonisation components togetherwith gaussian emission features at 1 and 6.6 kev modified by absorption due tocold and photo-ionised material. none of the spectral parameters appears to bestrongly correlated with the dip depth except for the temperature of the discblackbody which is coolest (kt ~ 1.8 kev) when deep dips are present andwarmest (kt ~ 2.1 kev) when no dips are detectable. we propose that the changesin both disc temperature and optical modulation could be explained by thepresence of a tilted accretion disc in the system. we provide a revisedestimate of the orbital period of 0.16388875 +/- 0.00000017 day.
