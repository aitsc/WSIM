0906.4700	results from droxo. ii. - [ne ii] and x-ray emission from rho ophiuchi  young stellar objects	the infrared [ne ii] and [ne iii] fine structure lines at 12.81um and 15.55umare predicted to trace the circumstellar disk gas subject to x-ray heating andionization. we investigate the origin of these lines by comparing observationswith models of x-ray irradiated disks and by searching for empiricalcorrelations between the line luminosities and stellar and circumstellarparameters. we measure neon line fluxes and x-ray luminosities for 28 youngstellar objects in the rho ophiuchi star formation region for which goodquality infrared spectra and x-ray data have been obtained, the former with thespitzer irs and the latter with the deep rho ophiuchi xmm-newton observation.  we detect the [ne ii] and the [ne iii] lines in 10 and 1 cases, respectively.line luminosities show no correlation with x-ray emission. the luminosity ofthe [ne ii] line for one star, and that of both the [ne ii] and [ne iii] linesfor a second star, match the predictions of published models of x-rayirradiated disks; for the remaining 8 objects the [ne ii] emission is 1-3 dexhigher than predicted on the basis of their l_x. class i objects showsignificantly stronger [ne ii] lines than class ii and class iii ones. acorrelation is moreover found between the [ne ii] line emission and the diskmass accretion rates. this might point toward a role of accretion-generated uvemission in the generation of the line or to other mechanisms related to massinflows from circumstellar disks and envelopes and/or to the associated massoutflows (winds and jets). we conclude that the x-ray luminosity is not theonly parameter that determines the [ne ii] emission. explaining the strong [neii] emission of class i objects likely requires the inclusion in the models ofadditional physical components such as the envelope, inflows, and outflows.

0909.0218	x-ray optical depth diagnostics of t tauri accretion shocks	in classical t tauri stars, x-rays are produced by two plasma components: ahot low-density plasma, with frequent flaring activity, and a high-densitylower temperature plasma. the former is coronal plasma related to the stellarmagnetic activity. the latter component, never observed in non-accreting stars,could be plasma heated by the shock formed by the accretion process. howeverits nature is still being debated. our aim is to probe the soft x-ray emissionfrom the high-density plasma component in classical t tauri stars to checkwhether this is plasma heated in the accretion shock or whether it is coronalplasma. high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy allows us to measure individual linefluxes. we analyze x-ray spectra of the classical t tauri stars mp muscae andtw hydrae. our aim is to evaluate line ratios to search for optical deptheffects, which are expected in the accretion-driven scenario. we also derivethe plasma emission measure distributions emd, to investigate whether and howthe emd of accreting and non accreting young stars differ. the results arecompared to those obtained for the non-accreting weak-line t tauri star twa 5.we find evidence of resonance scattering in the strongest lines of mp mus,supporting the idea that soft x-rays are produced by plasma heated in theaccretion shock. we also find that the emd of mp mus has two peaks: a cool peakat temperatures expected for plasma heated in the accretion shock, and a hotpeak typical of coronal plasma. the shape of the emd of mp mus appears to bethe superposition of the emd of a pure coronal source, like twa 5, and an emdalike that of tw hydrae, which is instead dominated by shock-heated plasma.

0708.2399	x-ray flaring from the young stars in cygnusob2	aims: we characterize individual and ensemble properties of x-ray flares fromstars in the cygob2 and onc star-forming regions. method: we analyzed x-raylightcurves of 1003 cygob2 sources observed with chandra for 100 ksec and of1616 onc sources detected in the ``chandra orion ultra-deep project'' 850 ksecobservation. we employed a binning-free maximum likelihood method to segmentthe light-curves into intervals of constants signal and identified flares onthe basis of both the amplitude and the time-derivative of the sourceluminosity. we then derived and compared the flare frequency and energydistribution of cygob2 and onc sources. the effect of the length of theobservation on these results was investigated by repeating the statisticalanalysis on five 100 ksec-long segments extracted from the onc data. results:we detected 147 and 954 flares from the cygob2 and onc sources, respectively.the flares in cygob2 have decay times ranging from ~0.5 to about 10 hours. theflare energy distributions of all considered flare samples are described athigh energies well by a power law with index alpha=-(2.1+-0.1). at lowenergies, the distributions flatten, probably because of detectionincompleteness. we derived average flare frequencies as a function of flareenergy. the flare frequency is seen to depend on the source's intrinsic x-rayluminosity, but its determination is affected by the length of the observation.the slope of the high-energy tail of the energy distribution is, however,affected little. a comparison of cygob2 and onc sources, accounting forobservational biases, shows that the two populations, known to have similarx-ray emission levels, have very similar flare activity.

1111.4420	x-ray view of ic348 in the light of an updated cluster census	we study the properties of the coronae of the low-mass stars in the young(~2-3myr), nearby (~310pc) open cluster ic348 combining x-ray andoptical/infrared data. the four existing chandra observations of ic348 aremerged, thus providing a deeper and spatially more complete x-ray view thanprevious x-ray studies of the cluster. we have compiled a comprehensive catalogof ic348 members taking into account recent updates to the cluster census. ourdata collection comprises fundamental stellar parameters, infrared excessindicating the presence of disks, halpha emission as a tracer of chromosphericemission or accretion and mass accretion rates. we have detected 290 x-raysources in four merged chandra exposures, of which 187 are associated withknown cluster members. only four of the x-ray sources are brown dwarfs(spectral type m6 and later). the detection rate is highest for diskless classiii stars and increases with stellar mass. this may be explained with higherx-ray luminosities for higher mass and later evolutionary stage that is evidentin the x-ray luminosity functions. in particular, we find that for the lowestexamined masses (0.1-0.25 msun) there is a difference between the x-rayluminosity functions of accreting and non-accreting stars (classified on thebasis of their halpha emission strength) as well as those of disk-bearing anddiskless stars (classified on the basis of the slope of the spectral energydistribution). these differences disappear for higher masses. this is relatedto our finding that the l_x/l_bol ratio is non-constant across themass/luminosity sequence of ic348 with a decrease towards lower luminositystars. our analysis of an analogous stellar sample in the orion nebula clustersuggests that the decline of l_x/l_ bol for young stars at the low-mass end ofthe stellar sequence is likely universal.

1210.6770	x-ray variability of pms stars - toward an explanation of the different  x-ray properties of ctts and wtts	the intense x-ray emission from coronae and accretion shocks in young pmsstars is likely to play an important role in the evolution and dispersal ofcircumstellar disks. several aspects of the physics of this x-ray emissionremain mysterious, e.g., whether and how much accretion affects coronalemission.  we studied the x-ray variability of ~1 myr old low-mass pms stars as afunction of timescale, stellar rotation, and stellar characteristics, in orderto gain insights on the working of pms coronae, their x-ray emission, and thecircumstellar environment in which they are immersed.  we have exploited the ~850 ksec long chandra observation of the orion nebulacluster obtained by the coup collaboration in jan. 2003, and statisticallyanalyzed the x-ray lightcurves of low-mass stars in several subsamples. inparticular, we characterized the different x-ray behavior of stars with andwithout circumstellar accretion disks.  accreting stars (classical t tauri stars, cttss) are found to be morevariable than non accreting ones (weak-lined t tauri stars, wttss) at alltimescales and in all the x-ray energy bands considered. variability is seen toincrease with time-scale up to ~10 days, i.e. the longest probed. signatures ofrotational modulation are observed for both cttss and wttss, and most clearlyfor cttss in the soft x-ray band. lower mass stars are more variable thanhigher mass ones.  we propose that the difference in variability between cttss and wttss may beexplained assuming that the x-ray emission of ctts is affected by time-variableabsorption due circumstellar structures, such as warps in the inner disk and/oraccretion streams. this suggestion is appealing because, in the hypothesis thatthe coronae of cttss and wttss are similar, it may also explain why cttss havelower and more scattered x-ray emission levels with respect to wttss.

0807.0116	circumstellar disks in the outer galaxy: the star-forming region ngc  1893	it is still debated whether star formation process depends on environment. inparticular it is yet unclear whether star formation in the outer galaxy, wherethe environmental conditions are, theoretically, less conducive, occurs in thesame way as in the inner galaxy. we investigate the population of ngc1893, ayoung cluster ~3-4 myr in the outer part of the galaxy (galactic radius &gt;11kpc), to explore the effects of environmental conditions on star formingregions. we present infrared observations acquired using the irac cameraonboard the spitzer space telescope and analyze the color-color diagrams toestablish the membership of stars with excesses. we also merge this informationwith that obtained from chandra acis-i observations, to identify the class iiipopulation. we find that the cluster is very rich, with 242 pms classicalt-tauri stars and 7 class 0/i stars. we identify 110 class iii candidatecluster members in the acis-i field of view. we estimate a disk fraction forngc1893 of about 67%, similar to fractions calculated for nearby star formingregions of the same age. although environmental conditions are unfavorable,star formation can clearly be very successful in the outer galaxy, allowingcreation of a very rich cluster like ngc1893.

astro-ph;0302329	time evolution of x-ray coronal activity in pms stars; a possible  relation with the evolution of accretion disks	we investigate the evolution of x-ray stellar activity from the age of theyoungest known star forming regions (sfr), &lt; 1myr, to about 100 myr, i.e. thezero age main sequence (zams) for a ~ 1m_sun star. we consider five sfr ofvarying age (rho ophiuchi, the orion nebula cluster, ngc 2264, chamaeleon i,and eta chamaeleontis) and two young clusters (the pleiades and ngc 2516).optical and x-ray data for these regions are retrieved both from archivalobservations and recent literature, and reanalyzed here in a consistent mannerso to minimize systematic differences in the results. we study trends of l_xand l_x/l_bol as a function of stellar mass and association age. for low massstars (m &lt; 1m_sun) we observe an increase in l_x/l_bol in the first 3-4 myr anda subsequent leveling off at the saturation level (l_x/l_bol ~ -3). slowlyevolving very low mass stars then retain saturated levels down to the oldestages here considered, while for higher mass stars activity begins to decline atsome age after ~10^7 years. we find our data consistent with the followingtentative picture: low mass pms stars with no circumstellar accretion disk havesaturated activity, consistently with the activity-rossby number relationderived for ms stars. accretion and/or the presence of disks somehow lowers theobserved activity levels; disk dissipation and/or the decrease of massaccretion rate in the first few myrs of pms evolution is therefore responsiblefor the observed increase of l_x/l_bol with time.

astro-ph;0506164	rotational modulation of x-ray emission in orion nebula young stars	we investigate the spatial distribution of x-ray emitting plasma in a sampleof young orion nebula cluster stars by modulation of their x-ray light-curvesdue to stellar rotation. the study, part of the chandra orion ultradeep project(coup), is made possible by the exceptional length of the observation: 10 daysof acis integration during a time span of 13 days, yielding a total of 1616detected sources in the 17x17 arcmin field of view. we here focus on asubsample of 233 x-ray-bright stars with known rotational periods. we searchfor x-ray modulation using the lomb normalized periodogram method.  x-ray modulation related to the rotation period is detected in at least 23stars with periods between 2 and 12 days and relative amplitudes ranging from20% to 70%. in 16 cases, the x-ray modulation period is similar to the stellarrotation period while in seven cases it is about half that value, possibly dueto the presence of x-ray emitting structures at opposite stellar longitudes.these results constitute the largest sample of low mass stars in which x-rayrotational modulation has been observed. the detection of rotational modulationindicates that the x-ray emitting regions are distributed inhomogeneneously inlongitude and do not extend to distances significantly larger than the stellarradius. modulation is observed in stars with saturated activity levels(l_x/l_bol ~ 10^(-3)) showing that saturation is not due to the filling of thestellar surface with x-ray emitting regions.

astro-ph;0601177	deep x-ray survey of the young open cluster ngc 2516 with xmm-newton	we report on a deep x-ray survey of the young (~ 140 myr), rich open clusterngc 2516 obtained with the epic camera on board the xmm-newton satellite. bycombining data from six observations, a high sensitivity, greater than a factor5 with respect to recent chandra observations, has been achieved. we detected431 x-ray sources and 234 of them have as optical counterparts cluster starsspanning the entire ngc 2516 main sequence. the x-ray luminosities of clusterstars span the range log lx (erg/s) = 28.4 - 30.8. the representativetemperatures span the 0.3 - 0.6 kev (3.5 - 8 mk) range for the cool componentand 1.0 - 2.0 kev (12 -- 23 mk) for the hot one; similar values are found inother young open clusters like the pleiades, ic 2391, and blanco 1. while nosignificant differences are found in x-ray spectra, ngc 2516 solar type starsare definitely less luminous in x-rays than the nearly coeval pleiades. thecomparison with a previous rosat survey evidence the lack of variabilityamplitudes larger than a factor 2 in solar type stars in a ~11 yr time scale ofthe cluster and thus activity cycles like in the sun are probably absent ordifferent by period and amplitude in young stars.

astro-ph;0603027	chandra x-ray observations of young clusters. iii. ngc 2264 and the  orion flanking fields	chandra observations of solar-like pre-main sequence (pms) stars in the orionflanking fields (age ~1 myr) and ngc 2264 (~3 myr) are compared with theresults of the coup survey of similar objects in the onc (~0.5 myr). thecorrelations between log lx and mass found for pms stars on convective tracksin these clusters are consistent with the relationships found for the onc,indicating little change in the median values of either log lx or log lx/lbolduring the first ~3-5 myr of evolution down convective tracks. the fraction ofstars with extreme values of lx, more than 10 times higher than the average fora given lbol or with log lx/lbol greater than the canonical saturation value of-2.9, is however larger by a factor of two in the younger onc when comparedwith the orion ff and ngc 2264.  pms stars in ngc 2264 on radiative tracks have lx/lbol values that aresystematically lower by a factor of ~10 times than those found for stars ofsimilar mass on convective tracks. the dramatic decrease in flux fromconvective to radiative phases of pms evolution is likely related to majorstructural changes which influence the efficiency of magnetic field generationand thus the level of magnetic activity.  as in the onc, we find that stars with measured periods have, on average,higher x-ray luminosities. however, there is a wide range in lx and lx/lbol forboth periodic and non-periodic stars of similar mass. among stars with measuredperiods, the level of x-ray emission does not correlate with the rotation rate.  for this data set, we find no statistically significant correlation betweenx-ray flux and (a) the presence or absence of circumstellar accretion disks, or(b) disk accretion rates as assessed from ultraviolet excesses.

astro-ph;0603186	the discovery of an expanding x-ray source in the hh 154 protostellar  jet	we have performed, in october 2005, a deep chandra x-ray observation of hh154. comparison with the previous (2001) chandra observation allows to detectproper motion down to the level predicted by models of x-ray emitting shocks inthe jet. the 2005 chandra observation of hh 154 shows unexpected morphologicalchanges of the x-ray emission in comparison with the 2001 data. two componentsare present: a stronger, point-like component with no detectable motion and aweaker component which has expanded in size by approximately 300 au over the 4years time base of the two observations. this expansion corresponds toapproximately 500 km/s, very close to the velocity of the x-ray emitting shockin the simple theoretical models. the 2005 data show a more complex system thaninitially thought (and modeled), with multiple components with differentproperties. the observed morphology is possibly indicating a pulsed jetpropagating through a non-homogeneous medium, likely with medium densitydecreasing with distance from the driving source. detailed theoretical modelingand deeper x-ray observations will be needed to understand the physics of thisfascinating class of sources.

astro-ph;0604243	acis-i observations of ngc2264. membership and x-ray properties of pms  stars	we analyze a deep, 100 ksec long, chandra acis observation of ngc2264. wedetect 420 sources, 85% of which are associated with known optical and nircounterparts. more than 90% of these counterparts are ngc2264 members, thussignificantly increasing the known low mass cluster population by about 100objects. among the sources without counterpart, ~50% are likely members,several of which we expect to be previously unknown protostellar objects. weconfirm several previous findings on the x-ray activity of low mass pms stars:x-ray luminosity is related to stellar mass, although with a large scatter;l_x/l_bol is close to but almost invariably below the saturation level, 1e-3. acomparison between ctts and wtts shows several differences: ctts are on averageless active than wtts; their emission may also be more time variable and is onaverage slightly harder. however, we find evidence in some ctts of extremelycool, ~0.1-0.2 kev, plasma which we speculate is heated by accretion shocks. weconclude that activity in low mass pms stars, while generally similar to thatof saturated ms stars, may be affected by mass accretion in several ways:accretion is likely responsible for very soft x-ray emission directly producedin the accretion shock; it may reduce the average energy output of solar-likecoronae, at the same time making them hotter and more dynamic.

astro-ph;0607298	xmm-newton survey of two upper scorpius regions	we study x-ray emission from young stars by analyzing deep xmm-newtonobservations of two regions of the upper scorpius association, having an age of5 myr. based on near infrared and optical photometry we identify 22 upperscorpius photometric members among the 224 detected x-ray sources. we derivecoronal properties of upper scorpius stars by performing x-ray spectral andtiming analysis. the study of four strong and isolated stellar flares allows usto derive the length of the flaring loops. among the 22 upper scorpius stars,13 are identified as upper scorpius photometric members for the first time. thesample includes 7 weak-line t tauri stars and 1 classical t tauri star, whilethe nature of the remaining sources is unknown. except for the intermediatemass star hd 142578, all the detected usco sources are low mass stars ofspectral type ranging from g to late m. the x-ray emission spectrum of the mostintense upper scorpius sources indicates metal depleted plasma with temperatureof ~10 mk, resembling the typical coronal emission of active main sequencestars. at least 59% of the detected members of the association have variablex-ray emission, and the flaring coronal structures appear shorter than orcomparable to the stellar radii already at the upper scorpius age. we also findindication of increasing plasma metallicity (up to a factor 20) during strongflares. we identify a new galaxy cluster among the 224 x-ray source detected:the x-ray spectrum of its intra cluster medium indicates a redshift of0.41+/-0.02.

astro-ph;0610352	unveiling the cygnus ob2 stellar population with chandra	the aim of this work is to identify the so far unknown low mass stellarpopulation of the ~2myr old cygnus ob2 region, and to investigate the x-ray andnear-ir stellar properties of its members. we analyzed a 97.7 ksec chandraacis-i observation pointed at the core of the cygnus ob2 region. x-rayvariability ans spectral analysis of sources was characterized through theks-test and xspec thermal models, respectively. we detected 1003 x-ray sources.of these, 775 have near-ir counterparts associated with cygnus ob2 members. weestimate a typical absorption toward cygnus ob2 of av~7.0 mag. although theregion is young, very few stars (~4.4 %) show disk-induced excesses in thenear-ir. x-ray variability is detected in ~13 % of the sources. flares accountfor at least 60 % of the variability. o- that early b-type stars are notsignificantly variable. typical x-ray spectral parameters are log(nh)~22.25 andkt~1.35 kev. variable and flaring sources have harder spectra with mediankt=3.3 and 3.8 kev, respectively. ob stars are typically softer (kt~0.75 kev).x-ray luminosities range between 1e+30 and 1e+31 erg/s for intermediate- andlow-mass stars, and 2.5x10^30 and between 6.3e+33 erg/s for ob stars. thecygnus ob2 region has a very rich population of low-mass x-ray emitting stars.circumstellar disks seem to be very scarce.

astro-ph;0610354	the stellar content of the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	context: the comparison of observed counts in a given sky direction withpredictions by galactic models yields constraints to the spatial distributionand the stellar birthrate of young stellar populations. in this work we presentthe results of the analysis of the stellar content of the xmm-newton brightserendipitous survey (xbss). this unbiased survey includes a total of 58stellar sources selected in the 0.5 -- 4.5 kev energy band, having a limitingsensitivity of $10^{-2}$ cnt s$^{-1}$ and covering an area of 28.10 sq. deg.aims: our main goal is to understand the recent star formation history of thegalaxy in the vicinity of the sun. methods: we compare the observations withthe predictions obtained with xcount, a model of the stellar x-ray content ofthe galaxy. the model predicts the number and properties of the stars to beobserved in terms of magnitude, colour, population and$f_\mathrm{x}/f_\mathrm{v}$ ratio distributions of the coronal sources detectedwith a given instrument and sensitivity in a specific sky direction. results:as in other shallow surveys, we observe an excess of stars not predicted by ourgalaxy model. comparing the colours of the identified infrared counterpartswith the model predictions, we observe that this excess is produced by yellow(g+k) stars. the study of the x-ray spectrum of each source reveals a mainpopulation of stars with coronal temperature stratification typical ofintermediate-age stars. as no assumptions have been made for the selection ofthe sample, our results must be representative of the entire solarneighbourhood. some stars show excess circumstellar absorption indicative ofyouth.

astro-ph;0610401	correlation between the spatial distribution of the circumstellar disks  and the massive stars in the open cluster ngc 6611. compiled catalog and  cluster parameters	context: the observation of young stars with circumstellar disks suggeststhat the disks are dissipated, starting from the inner region, by the radiationof the central star and eventually by the formation of rocky planetesimals,over a time scale of several million years. it was also shown that strong uvradiation emitted by nearby massive stars can heat a circumstellar disk up tosome thousand degrees, inducing the photoevaporation of the gas. this processstrongly reduces the dissipation time scale. aims: we study whether thereexists a correlation between the spatial distribution of stars withcircumstellar disks and the position of massive stars with spectral classearlier than b5, in the open cluster ngc 6611. methods: we created a multibandcatalog of the cluster, down to v~23, using optical data from a wfi observationat 2.2m of eso in the bvi bands, the 2mass public point source catalog and anarchival x-ray observation made with chandra/acis. we selected the stars withinfrared excess (due to the emission of a circumstellar disk) using suitablecolor indices independent of extinction, and studied their spatialdistribution. results: the spatial distribution of the stars with k band excess(due to the presence of a circumstellar disk) is anti correlated with that ofthe massive stars: the disks are more frequent at large distances from thesestars. we argue that this is in agreement with the hypothesis that thecircumstellar disks are heated by the uv radiation from the massive stars andphotoevaporated.

astro-ph;0703439	coronal abundances in orion nebula cluster stars	following the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) observation, we havestudied the chemical composition of the hot plasma in a sample of 146 x-raybright pre-main sequence stars in the orion nebula cluster. we reportmeasurements of individual element abundances for a subsample of 86slightly-absorbed and bright x-ray sources, using low resolution x-ray spectraobtained from the chandra acis instrument. the x-ray emission originates from aplasma with temperatures and elemental abundances very similar to those ofactive coronae in older stars. a clear pattern of abundances vs. firstionization potential (fip) is evident if solar photospheric abundances areassumed as reference. the results are validated by extensive simulations. theobserved abundance distributions are compatible with a single pattern ofabundances for all stars, although a weak dependence on flare loop size may bepresent. the abundance of calcium is the only one which appears to varysubstantially between stars, but this quantity is affected by relatively largeuncertainties. the ensemble properties of the x-ray bright coup sources confirmthat the iron in the emitting plasma is underabundant with respect to both thesolar composition and to the average stellar photospheric values. comparison ofthe present plasma abundances with those of the stellar photospheres and thoseof the gaseous component of the nebula, indicates a good agreement for all theother elements with available measurements, and in particular for the high-fipelements (ne, ar, o, and s) and for the low-fip element si. we conclude thatthere is evidence of a significant chemical fractionation effect only for iron,which appears to be depleted by a factor 1.5--3 with respect to the stellarcomposition.

astro-ph;9707057	on the widespread weak-line t-tauri population detected in the rosat  all-sky survey	we discuss the apparent widespread presence of weak-line t-tauri stars (wtts)among stellar coronal sources detected in the rosat all-sky survey (rass), andtheir relative number with respect to young main-sequence stars in the samesamples. the approach taken in most of the current literature for identifyingand classifying wtt stars among rass x-ray sources is based on the usage oflow-resolution optical spectra only and on simple, mass-independent thresholdson the equivalent width of the lii 6707.8 a doublet. we show that this approachis likely to lead to putative wtts samples which contain a large number ofnormal, young main-sequence stars masquerading as wtts sources. youngmain-sequence stars are known to be the dominant contributor in stellar x-rayselected samples at the limiting flux levels of the rass, yet they appear to bevery rare in the rass samples discussed here. we argue that many of theputative wtts sources are actually mis-classified young main-sequence stars,and that thus there is likely not a true ``wtts question'' in the rass samples.

astro-ph;9707058	on coronal abundances derived with the sax/lecs and asca/sis detectors	we have studied the performance of global chi^2 fitting of low-resolutionx-ray spectra in retrieving intrinsic source parameters, with emphasis on thecoronal metallicity. the study has been conducted by fitting large numbers ofsimulated spectra with known characteristics, and studying the distribution ofbest-fit parameters. we have studied the behavior of the lecs detector on boardthe sax satellite and the sis detector on board the asca satellite. the fittedsource spectra have either two discrete temperature components or a power-lawtemperature distribution, with metallicity variations modeled by a singleglobal abundance parameter. the model used for the fitting has always been atwo-temperature one, with global varying abundance, to explore the influence ofthe a priori ignorance of the actual temperature stratification in the sourcebeing observed. the simulations performed explore the influence of varyingstatistics in the observed spectrum (spanning a realistic range of values) aswell as the effect of varying the intrinsic source metallicity, with values inthe range 0.15--1.0 times the solar value. we find that the source metallicitycan be retrieved within few tens of percent from asca/sis spectra of typicalsignal to noise ratio, and within few percent from sax/lecs spectra at the samesignal to noise ratio. however relatively small uncertainties in the detectorcalibrations and in the plasma emission codes are likely to potentially causelarge systematic off-sets in the value

astro-ph;9909491	an extreme x-ray flare observed on ev lac by asca in july 1998	we present a long (150 ks elapsed time) asca x-ray observation of the dm3.5estar ev lac, during which an exceptionally intense flaring event (lastingapproximately 12 ks) was observed: at the flare's peak, the x-ray count rate inthe asca gis detectors was approx. 300 times the quiescent value. the physicalparameters of the flaring region have been derived by analyzing the decay,using both a quasi-static approach and an approach based on hydrodynamicsimulations of decaying flaring loops. this second method shows that theflare's decay is compatible with its being produced in a relatively compactregion of semi-length l approx. 0.5 stellar radii), large but not exceptionaleven by solar standards. the flare decays is fast (with a e-folding time forthe light curve of &lt;= 2 ks), but nevertheless the hydrodynamic-based analysisshows strong evidence for sustained heating, with the shape of the light curvedominated by the time evolution of the heating rather than by the naturalcooling of the flaring plasma. the quasi-static method yields a much largerestimate of the loop's length (l approx. 2 stellar radii). the event shows alight curve characterized by two separate decay time constants (with theinitial decay being faster) and a significant enhancement in the plasma metalabundance at the peak of the flare. the energetics of the event areexceptional, with the peak x-ray luminosity of the event reaching up to approx.25% of the bolometric luminosity of the star, making this one of the largestx-ray flare (in relative terms) observed to date on a main-sequence star.
