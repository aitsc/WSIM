0901.1559	optical pulsations from the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e 1048.1-5937	we present high-speed optical photometry of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e1048.1-5937 obtained with ultracam on the 8.2-m very large telescope in june2007. we detect 1e 1048.1-5937 at a magnitude of i'=25.3+/-0.2, consistent withthe values found by wang et al. (2008) and hence confirming their conclusionthat the source was approximately 1 mag brighter than in 2003-2006 due to anon-going x-ray flare that started in march 2007. the increased sourcebrightness enabled us to detect optical pulsations with an identical period(6.458 s) to the x-ray pulsations. the rms pulsed fraction in our data is21+/-7%, approximately the same as the 2-10 kev x-ray rms pulsed fraction. theoptical and x-ray pulse profiles show similar morphologies and appear to beapproximately in phase with each other, the latter lagging the former by only0.06+/-0.02 cycles. the optical pulsations in 1e 1048.1-5937 are very similarin nature to those observed in 4u 0142+61. the implications of our observationsfor models of anomalous x-ray pulsars are discussed.

0901.4902	hunting high and low: xmm monitoring of the eclipsing polar hu aquarii	we want to study the temporal and spectral behaviour of hu aqr in the x-raydomain during different accretion states. we obtained spectra and light curvesfrom four different xmm-newton pointings covering intermediate and low states.the x-ray observations were accompanied with high time resolution photometryobtained with the optima and ultracam instruments. on two occasions in may 2002and 2003 hu aqr was found in an intermediate state with the accretion ratereduced by a factor of 50 compared to earlier high state measurements. x-rayspectra in the intermediate state can be described by a model containing ablackbody component and hot thermal plasma. contrary to the high state theratio between soft and hard x-ray flux is nearly balanced. in agreement withprevious measurements we observed a migration of the accretion spot and streamtowards the line connecting both stars. the brightness of hu aqr was furtherreduced by a factor of 80 during two low states in october 2003 and may 2005,where it was detected at a luminosity of only l_x = 4.7 * 10^(28) erg/sec .this luminosity would fit well with an active coronal emitter, but therelatively high plasma temperatures of 3.5 and 2.0 kev are more compatible withresidual accretion. we updated the eclipse ephemeris of hu aqr based on theeclipse egress of the accretion spot measured in various wavelength bands. the(o-c)-diagram of the observed accretion spot eclipse timings reveals complexdeviations from a linear trend, which can be explained by a constant or cyclicperiod change or a combination thereof. the quadratic term implies a perioddecrease at a rate of \dot{p}_orb = -7..-11 * 10^(-12) sec/sec. in case theobserved period change reflects a true angular momentum loss, this would be afactor of 30 larger than given by gravitational radiation.

0905.0832	pre-main-sequence variability across the radiative-convective gap	we use i band imaging to perform a variability survey of the 13 myr-oldcluster h per. we find a significant fraction of the cluster members to bevariable. most importantly, we find that variable members lie almost entirelyon the convective side of the gap in the cluster sequence between fullyconvective stars and those which have a radiative core. this result isconsistent with a scenario in which the magnetic field changes topology whenthe star changes from being fully convective, to one containing a radiativecore. when the star is convective the magnetic field appears dominated bylarge-scale structures, resulting in global-size spots that drive the observedvariability. for those stars with radiative cores we observe a marked absenceof variability due to spots, which suggests a switch to a magnetic fielddominated by smaller-scale structures, resulting in many smaller spots and thusless apparent variability. this implies that wide field variability surveys mayonly be sensitive to fully convective stars. on the one hand this reduces thechances of picking out young groups (since the convective stars are the lowermass and therefore fainter objects), but conversely the absolute magnitude ofthe head of the convective sequence provides a straightforward measure of agefor those groups which are discovered.

0905.3476	sdss unveils a population of intrinsically faint cataclysmic variables  at the minimum orbital period	we discuss the properties of 137 cataclysmic variables (cvs) which areincluded in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic data base, andfor which accurate orbital periods have been measured. 92 of these systems arenew discoveries from sdss and were followed-up in more detail over the past fewyears. 45 systems were previously identified as cvs because of the detection ofoptical outbursts and/or x-ray emission, and subsequently re-identified fromthe sdss spectroscopy. the period distribution of the sdss cvs differsdramatically from that of all the previously known cvs, in particular itcontains a significant accumulation of systems in the orbital period range80--86 min. we identify this feature as the elusive "period minimum spike"predicted by cv population models, which resolves a long-standing discrepancybetween compact binary evolution theory and observations. we show that thisspike is almost entirely due to the large number of cvs with very low accretionactivity identified by sdss. the optical spectra of these systems are dominatedby emission from the white dwarf photosphere, and display little or nospectroscopic signature from the donor stars, suggesting very low-masscompanion stars. we determine the average absolute magnitude of theselow-luminosity cvs at the period minimum to be &lt;m_g&gt;=11.6+-0.7. comparison ofthe sdss cv sample to the cvs found in the hamburg quasar survey and thepalomar green survey suggests that the depth of sdss is the key ingredientresulting in the discovery of a large number of intrinsically faintshort-period systems.

0909.4307	precise mass and radius values for the white dwarf and low mass m dwarf  in the pre-cataclysmic binary nn serpentis	we derive precise system parameters for the pre-cataclysmic binary, nn ser.  from light curve fitting we find an orbital inclination of i = 89.6 +/- 0.2deg. from the heii absorption line we find k_{wd}= 62.3 +/- 1.9 km/s. theirradiation-induced emission lines from the surface of the secondary star givea range of observed radial velocities. the corrected values give a radialvelocity of k_{sec}= 301 +/- 3 km/s, with an error dominated by the systematiceffects of the model. this leads to a binary separation of a = 0.934 +/- 0.009r_{sun}, radii of r_{wd} = 0.0211 +/- 0.0002 r_{sun} and r_{sec} = 0.149 +/-0.002 r_{sun} and masses of m_{wd} = 0.535 +/- 0.012 m_{sun} and m_{sec} =0.111 +/- 0.004 m_{sun}. the masses and radii of both components of nn ser weremeasured independently of any mass-radius relation. for the white dwarf, themeasured mass, radius and temperature show excellent agreement with a `thick'hydrogen layer of fractional mass m_{h}/{m}_{wd} = 10^{-4}. the measured radiusof the secondary star is 10% larger than predicted by models, however,correcting for irradiation accounts for most of this inconsistency, hence thesecondary star in nn ser is one of the first precisely measured very low massobjects to show good agreement with models. ultracam r', i' and z' photometrytaken during the primary eclipse determines the colours of the secondary staras (r'-i')_{sec}= 1.4 +/- 0.1 and (i'-z')_{sec} = 0.8 +/- 0.1 which correspondsto a spectral type of m4 +/- 0.5. this is consistent with the derived mass,demonstrating that there is no detectable heating of the unirradiated face,despite intercepting radiative energy from the white dwarf which exceeds itsown luminosity by over a factor of 20.

0911.1637	physical properties of ip pegasi: an eclipsing dwarf nova with an  unusually cool white dwarf	we present high speed photometric observations of the eclipsing dwarf nova ippeg taken with the triple-beam camera ultracam mounted on the william herscheltelescope. the primary eclipse in this system was observed twice in 2004, andthen a further sixteen times over a three week period in 2005. our observationswere simultaneous in the sloan u', g' and r' bands. by phase-folding andaveraging our data we make the first significant detection of the white dwarfingress in this system and find the phase width of the white dwarf eclipse tobe 0.0935 +/- 0.0003, significantly higher than the previous best value ofbetween 0.0863 and 0.0918. the mass ratio is found to be q = m2 /m1 = 0.48 +/-0.01, consistent with previous measurements, but we find the inclination to be83.8 +/- 0.5 deg, significantly higher than previously reported. we find theradius of the white dwarf to be 0.0063 +/- 0.0003 solar radii, implying a whitedwarf mass of 1.16 +/- 0.02 solar masses. the donor mass is 0.55 +/- 0.02 solarmasses. the white dwarf temperature is more difficult to determine, since thewhite dwarf is seen to vary significantly in flux, even between consecutiveeclipses. this is seen particularly in the u'-band, and is probably the resultof absorption by disc material. our best estimate of the temperature is 10,000- 15,000k, which is much lower than would be expected for a cv with thisperiod, and implies a mean accretion rate of less than 5 times 10^-11 solarmasses per year, more than 40 times lower than the expected rate.

0911.3588	rotation of young stars in cepheus ob3b	we present a photometric study of i-band variability in the young associationcepheus ob3b. the study is sensitive to periodic variability on timescales ofless than a day, to more than 20 days. after rejection of contaminating objectsusing v, i, r and narrowband h-alpha photometry, we find 475 objects withmeasured rotation periods, which are very likely pre-main-sequence members ofthe cep ob3b star forming region.  we revise the distance and age to cep ob3b, putting it on the self-consistentage and distance ladder of mayne &amp; naylor (2008). this yields a distancemodulus of 8.8 +/- 0.2 mags, corresponding to a distance of 580 +/- 60 pc, andan age of 4-5myrs.  the rotation period distribution confirms the general picture of rotationalevolution in young stars, exhibiting both the correlation between accretion(determined in this case through narrowband h-alpha photometry) and rotationexpected from disc locking, and the dependence of rotation upon mass that isseen in other star forming regions. however, this mass dependence is muchweaker in our data than found in other studies. comparison to the similarlyaged ngc 2362 shows that the low-mass stars in cep ob3b are rotating much moreslowly. this points to a possible link between star forming environment androtation properties. such a link would call into question models of stellarangular momentum evolution, which assume that the rotational perioddistributions of young clusters and associations can be assembled into anevolutionary sequence, thus ignoring environmental effects.

1006.2069	estimating the masses of extra-solar planets	all extra-solar planet masses that have been derived spectroscopically arelower limits since the inclination of the orbit to our line-of-sight is unknownexcept for transiting systems. it is, however, possible to determine theinclination angle, i, between the rotation axis of a star and an observer'sline-of-sight from measurements of the projected equatorial velocity (v sin i),the stellar rotation period (p_rot) and the stellar radius (r_star). thisallows the removal of the sin i dependency of spectroscopically derivedextra-solar planet masses under the assumption that the planetary orbits lieperpendicular to the stellar rotation axis. we have carried out an extensiveliterature search and present a catalogue of v sin i, p_rot, and r_starestimates for exoplanet host stars. in addition, we have used hipparcosparallaxes and the barnes-evans relationship to further supplement the r_starestimates obtained from the literature. using this catalogue, we have obtainedsin i estimates using a markov-chain monte carlo analysis. this allows proper1-sigma two-tailed confidence limits to be placed on the derived sin i's alongwith the transit probability for each planet to be determined. while a smallproportion of systems yield sin i's significantly greater than 1, most likelydue to poor p_rot estimations, the large majority are acceptable. we arefurther encouraged by the cases where we have data on transiting systems, asthe technique indicates inclinations of ~90 degrees and high transitprobabilities. in total, we estimate the true masses of 133 extra-solarplanets. of these, only 6 have revised masses that place them above the 13jupiter mass deuterium burning limit. our work reveals a population ofhigh-mass planets with low eccentricities and we speculate that these mayrepresent the signature of different planetary formation mechanisms at work.

1009.4132	on the alignment of debris disks and their host stars' rotation axis  -implications for spin-orbit misalignment in exoplanetary systems	it has been widely thought that measuring the misalignment angle between theorbital plane of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star was agood discriminator between different migration processes for hot-jupiters.specifically, well-aligned hot-jupiter systems (as measured by therossiter-mclaughlin effect) were thought to have formed via migration throughinteraction with a viscous disk, while misaligned systems were thought to haveundergone a more violent dynamical history. these conclusions were based on theassumption that the planet-forming disk was well-aligned with the host star.recent work by a number of authors has challenged this assumption by proposingmechanisms that act to drive the star-disk interaction out of alignment duringthe pre-main sequence phase. we have estimated the stellar rotation axis of asample of stars which host spatially resolved debris disks. comparison of ourderived stellar rotation axis inclination angles with the geometricallymeasured debris-disk inclinations shows no evidence for a misalignment betweenthe two.

1102.3836	accretion-induced luminosity spreads in young clusters: evidence from  stellar rotation	we present an analysis of the rotation of young stars in the associationscepheus ob3b, ngc 2264, ngc 2362 and the orion nebula cluster (onc). wediscover a correlation between rotation rate and position in a colour-magnitudediagram (cmd) such that stars which lie above an empirically determined medianpre-main sequence rotate more rapidly than stars which lie below this sequence.the same correlation is seen, with a high degree of statistical significance,in each association studied here. if position within the cmd is interpreted asbeing due to genuine age spreads within a cluster, then the stars above themedian pre-main sequence would be the youngest stars. this would in turn implythat the most rapidly rotating stars in an association are the youngest, andhence those with the largest moments of inertia and highest likelihood ofongoing accretion. such a result does not fit naturally into the existingpicture of angular momentum evolution in young stars, where the stars arebraked effectively by their accretion discs until the disc disperses.  instead, we argue that, for a given association of young stars, positionwithin the cmd is not primarily a function of age, but of accretion history. weshow that this hypothesis could explain the correlation we observe betweenrotation rate and position within the cmd.

1108.2052	no wide spread of stellar ages in the orion nebula cluster	the wide luminosity dispersion seen for stars at a given effectivetemperature in the h-r diagrams of young clusters and star forming regions isoften interpreted as due to significant (~10 myr) spreads in stellarcontraction age. in the scenario where most stars are born with circumstellardiscs, and that disc signatures decay monotonically (on average) overtimescales of only a few myr, then any such age spread should lead to cleardifferences in the age distributions of stars with and without discs. we haveinvestigated large samples of stars in the orion nebula cluster (onc) usingthree methods to diagnose disc presence from infrared measurements. we find nosignificant difference in the mean ages or age distributions of stars with andwithout discs, consistent with expectations for a coeval population. using asimple quantitative model we show that any real age spread must be smaller thanthe median disc lifetime. for a log-normal age distribution, there is an upperlimit of &lt;0.14 dex (at 99% confidence) to any real age dispersion, compared tothe ~=0.4 dex implied by the h-r diagram. if the mean age of the onc is 2.5myr, this would mean at least 95% of its low-mass stellar population has agesbetween 1.3--4.8 myr. we suggest that the observed luminosity dispersion iscaused by a combination of observational uncertainties and physical mechanismsthat disorder the conventional relationship between luminosity and age for premain-sequence stars. this means that individual stellar ages from the h-rdiagram are unreliable and cannot be used to directly infer a star formationhistory. irrespective of what causes the wide luminosity dispersion, thefinding that any real age dispersion is less than the median disc lifetimeargues strongly against star formation scenarios for the onc lasting longerthan a few myr.

1206.2361	pre-main-sequence isochrones -- i. the pleiades benchmark	we present a critical assessment of commonly used pre-main-sequenceisochrones by comparing their predictions to a set of well-calibratedcolour-magnitude diagrams of the pleiades in the wavelength range 0.4 to 2.5microns. our analysis shows that for temperatures less than 4000 k the modelssystematically overestimate the flux by a factor two at 0.5 microns, thoughthis decreases with wavelength, becoming negligible at 2.2 microns. in opticalcolours this will result in the ages for stars younger than 10 myr beingunderestimated by factors between two and three.  we show that using observations of standard stars to transform the data intoa standard system can introduce significant errors in the positioning ofpre-main-sequences in colour-magnitude diagrams. therefore we have compared themodels to the data in the natural photometric system in which the observationswere taken. thus we have constructed and tested a model of the system responsesfor the wide-field camera on the isaac newton telescope.  as a benchmark test for the development of pre-main-sequence models weprovide both our system responses and the pleiades sequence.

1207.5393	an accurate mass and radius measurement for an ultracool white dwarf	studies of cool white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood have placed a limiton the age of the galactic disk of 8-9 billion years. however, determiningtheir cooling ages requires the knowledge of their effective temperatures,masses, radii, and atmospheric composition. so far, these parameters could onlybe inferred for a small number of ultracool white dwarfs for which an accuratedistance is known, by fitting their spectral energy distributions (seds) inconjunction with a theoretical mass-radius relation. however, the mass-radiusrelation remains largely untested, and the derived cooling ages are hencemodel-dependent. here we report direct measurements of the mass and radius ofan ultracool white dwarf in the double-lined eclipsing binary sdssj013851.54-001621.6. we find m(wd)=0.529+/-0.010msol andr(wd)=0.0131+/-0.0003rsol. our measurements are consistent with the mass-radiusrelation and we determine a robust cooling age of 9.5 billion years for the3570k white dwarf. we find that the mass and radius of the low mass companionstar, m(sec)=0.132+/-0.003msol and r(sec)=0.165+/-0.001rsol, are in agreementwith evolutionary models. we also find evidence that this &gt;9.5 gyr old m5 staris still active, far beyond the activity lifetime for a star of its spectraltype. this is likely caused by the high tidally-enforced rotation rate of thestar. the companion star is close to filling its roche lobe and the system willevolve into a cataclysmic variable in only 70 myr. our direct measurementsdemonstrate that this system can be used to calibrate ultracool white dwarfatmospheric models.

1212.5922	finding exoplanets orbiting young active stars. i. technique	stellar activity, such as starspots, can induce radial velocity (rv)variations that can mask or even mimic the rv signature of orbiting exoplanets.for this reason rv exoplanet surveys have been unsuccessful when searching forplanets around young, active stars and are therefore failing to explore animportant regime which can help to reveal how planets form and migrate. thispaper describes a new technique to remove spot signatures from the stellarline-profiles of moderately rotating, active stars (vsini ranging from 10 to 50km/s). by doing so it allows planetary rv signals to be uncovered. we usedsimulated models of a g5v type star with differing dark spots on its surfacealong with archive data of the known active star hd49933 to validate ourmethod. the results showed that starspots could be effectively cleaned from theline-profiles so that the stellar rv jitter was reduced by more than 80%.applying this procedure to the same models and hd49933 data, but with fakeplanets injected, enabled the effective removal of starspots so that jupitermass planets on short orbital periods were successfully recovered. theseresults show that this approach can be useful in the search for hot-jupiterplanets that orbit around young, active stars with a vsini of 10 - 50 km/s.

1305.4166	transmission photometry of wasp-12b: simultaneous measurement of the  planetary radius in three bands	transmission spectroscopy has been successfully used from both the ground andin space to characterise the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. thistechnique is challenging from the ground because ground-based spectrographstend not to be designed to be photometrically stable, and effects such asvariable slit losses cause significant systematic uncertainties. an alternativeapproach is to use simultaneous photometric observations in multiple wavebandsto determine wavelength dependent transit depth differences. we report anapplication of this technique to one of the hottest known exoplanets, wasp-12b,using the triple-beam camera ultracam. we obtained simultaneous light curves insloan u', and two narrow band filters centered on 4169 and 6010 angstroms, withfwhms 52 and 118 angstroms respectively. we fit these light curves with aphotometric model and determine the planetary radius in the three differentbands. our data show no evidence for a difference in planetary radius over thewavelength range we study, and are consistent with an atmosphere that isdominated by rayleigh scattering from a high altitude haze, as well as morecomplicated atmosphere models which include the effects of molecules such astio. our planetary radius measurements have an average precision of 2.6 percent, compared to the ~1.4 - 2.4 per cent radius differences predicted by themodels over this wavelength range. we also find a consistent time of ingressand egress across our three wavebands, in contrast to the early ingress whichhas been reported for this system at shorter wavelengths.

1306.3237	pre-main-sequence isochrones -- ii. revising star and planet formation  timescales	we have derived ages for 13 young (&lt;30 myr) star-forming regions and findthey are up to a factor two older than the ages typically adopted in theliterature. this result has wide-ranging implications, including thatcircumstellar discs survive longer (~10-12 myr) and that the average class ilifetime is greater (~1 myr) than currently believed.  for each star-forming region we derived two ages from colour-magnitudediagrams. first we fitted models of the evolution between the zero-agemain-sequence and terminal-age main-sequence to derive a homogeneous set ofmain-sequence ages, distances and reddenings with statistically meaningfuluncertainties. our second age for each star-forming region was derived byfitting pre-main-sequence stars to new semi-empirical model isochrones. for thefirst time (for a set of clusters younger than 50 myr) we find broad agreementbetween these two ages, and since these are derived from two distinct massregimes that rely on different aspects of stellar physics, it gives usconfidence in the new age scale. this agreement is largely due to our adoptionof empirical colour-teff relations and bolometric corrections forpre-main-sequence stars cooler than 4000 k.  the revised ages for the star-forming regions in our sample are: ~2 myr forngc 6611 (eagle nebula; m 16), ic 5146 (cocoon nebula), ngc 6530 (lagoonnebula; m 8), and ngc 2244 (rosette nebula); ~6 myr for {\sigma} ori, cep ob3b,and ic 348; ~10 myr for {\lambda} ori (collinder 69); ~11 myr for ngc 2169; ~12myr for ngc 2362; ~13 myr for ngc 7160; ~14 myr for {\chi} per (ngc 884); and~20 myr for ngc 1960 (m 36).

1311.5236	timing variations in the secondary eclipse of nn ser	the eclipsing white dwarf plus main-sequence binary nn serpentis provides oneof the most convincing cases for the existence of circumbinary planets aroundevolved binaries. the exquisite timing precision provided by the deep eclipseof the white dwarf has revealed complex variations in the eclipse arrival timesover the last few decades. these variations have been interpreted as theinfluence of two planets in orbit around the binary. recent studies have provedthat such a system is dynamically stable over the current lifetime of thebinary. however, the existence of such planets is by no means proven andseveral alternative mechanisms have been proposed that could drive similarvariations. one of these is apsidal precession, which causes the eclipse timesof eccentric binaries to vary sinusoidally on many year timescales. in thispaper we present timing data for the secondary eclipse of nn ser and show thatthey follow the same trend seen in the primary eclipse times, ruling outapsidal precession as a possible cause for the variations. this result leavesno alternatives to the planetary interpretation for the observed periodvariations, although we still do not consider their existence as proven. ourdata limits the eccentricity of nn ser to e&lt;0.001. we also detect a 3.3+/-1.0second delay in the arrival times of the secondary eclipses relative to thebest planetary model. this delay is consistent with the expected 2.84+/-0.04second romer delay of the binary, and is the first time this effect has beendetected in a white dwarf plus m dwarf system.

1511.05559	the first millimeter detection of a non-accreting ultracool dwarf	the well-studied m9 dwarf tvlm 513-46546 is a rapid rotator (p_rot ~ 2 hr)hosting a stable, dipolar magnetic field of ~3 kg surface strength. here wereport its detection with alma at 95 ghz at a mean flux density of $56 \pm 12$ujy, making it the first ultracool dwarf detected in the millimeter band,excluding young, disk-bearing objects. we also report flux density measurementsfrom unpublished archival vla data and new optical monitoring data from theliverpool telescope. the alma data are consistent with a power-law radiospectrum that extends continuously between centimeter and millimeterwavelengths. we argue that the emission is due to the synchrotron process,excluding thermal, free-free, and electron cyclotron maser emission as possiblesources. during the interval of the alma observation that phases with themaximum of the object's optical variability, the flux density is higher at a~1.8 sigma significance level. these early results show how alma opens a newwindow for studying the magnetic activity of ultracool dwarfs, particularlyshedding light on the particle acceleration mechanism operating in theirimmediate surroundings.

1511.09205	a large, long-lived structure near the trojan l5 point in the post  common-envelope binary sdss j1021+1744	sdss j1021+1744 is a detached, eclipsing white dwarf / m dwarf binarydiscovered in the sloan digital sky survey. outside the primary eclipse, thelight curves of such systems are usually smooth and characterised by low-levelvariations caused by tidal distortion and heating of the m star component.early data on sdss j1021+1744 obtained in june 2012 was unusual in showing adip in flux of uncertain origin shortly after the white dwarf's eclipse. herewe present high-time resolution, multi-wavelength observations of 35 moreeclipses over 1.3 years, showing that the dip has a lifetime extending overmany orbits. moreover the "dip" is in fact a series of dips that vary in depth,number and position, although they are always placed in the phase interval 1.06to 1.26 after the white dwarf's eclipse, near the l5 point in this system.since sdss j1021+1744 is a detached binary, it follows that the dips are causedby the transit of the white dwarf by material around the lagrangian l5 point. apossible interpretation is that they are the signatures of prominences, aphenomenon already known from h-alpha observations of rapidly rotating singlestars as well as binaries. what makes sdss j1021+1744 peculiar is that thematerial is dense enough to block continuum light. the dips appear to havefinally faded out around 2015 may after the first detection by parsons et al.in 2012, suggesting a lifetime of years.

astro-ph;0001525	infrared spectroscopy of cataclysmic variables: iii. dwarf novae below  the period gap and novalike variables	we present k-band spectra of the short-period dwarf novae yz cnc, ly hya, bklyn, t leo, sw uma and wz sge, the novalike variables dw uma, v1315 aql, rwtri, vy scl, uu aqr and gp com, and a series of field dwarf stars with spectraltypes ranging from k2-m6.  the spectra of the dwarf novae are dominated by emission lines of hi and hei.the large velocity and equivalent widths of these lines, in conjunction withthe fact that the lines are double-peaked in the highest inclination systems,indicate an accretion disc origin. in the case of yz cnc and t leo, for whichwe obtained time-resolved data covering a complete orbital cycle, the emissionlines show modulations in their equivalent widths which are most probablyassociated with the bright spot (the region where the gas stream collides withthe accretion disc). there are no clear detections of the secondary star in anyof the dwarf novae below the period gap, yielding upper limits of 10-30% forthe contribution of the secondary star to the observed k-band flux. inconjunction with the k-band magnitudes of the dwarf novae, we use the derivedsecondary star contributions to calculate lower limits to the distances tothese systems.  the spectra of the novalike variables are dominated by broad, single-peakedemission lines of hi and hei - even the eclipsing systems we observed do notshow the double-peaked profiles predicted by standard accretion disc theory.with the exception of rw tri, which exhibits nai, cai and 12co absorptionfeatures consistent with a m0v secondary contributing 65% of the observedk-band flux, we find no evidence for the secondary star in any of the novalikevariables. the implications of this result are discussed.

astro-ph;0310173	evidence for high accretion-rates in weak-line t tauri stars?	we have discovered t tauri stars which show startling spectral variabilitybetween observations seperated by 20 years. in spectra published by bouvier &amp;appenzeller (1992) these objects showed very weak h-alpha emission, broad caiiabsorption and so called ``composite spectra'', where the spectral typeinferred from the blue region is earlier than that inferred from the red. wepresent here new spectroscopy which shows that all four stars now exhibitstrong h-alpha emission, narrow caii emission and a spectral type which isconsistent at all wavelengths.  we propose a scheme to understand these changes whereby the composite spectraof these stars can be explained by a period of active accretion onto thecentral, young star. in this scheme the composite spectrum consists of acontribution from the stellar photosphere and a contribution from a hot,optically thick, accretion component. the optically thick nature of theaccretion flow explains the weakness of the h-alpha emission during this phase.within this scheme, the change to a single spectral type at all wavelengths andemergence of strong h-alpha emission are consistent with the accretion columnsbecoming optically thin, as the accretion rate drops. there is a strong analogyhere with the dwarf novae class of interacting binaries, which show similarbehaviour during the decline from outbursts of high mass-transfer rate.  the most important consequence of this interpretation is that these objectsbring into question the association of weak-line t tauri stars (wtts) withnon-accreting or discless objects. in light of this result we consider thejustification for this paradigm.

astro-ph;0411418	contamination and exclusion in the sigma orionis young group	we present radial velocities for 38 low-mass candidate members of the sigmaorionis young group. we have measured their radial velocities bycross-correlation of high resolution (r~6000) af2/wyffos spectra of the gravitysensitive nai doublet at 8183, 8195angstroms. the total sample contained 117objects of which 54 have sufficient signal-to-noise to detect nai at anequivalent width of 3angstroms, however we only detect nai in 38 of these. thisimplies that very low-mass members of this young group display weaker naiabsorption than similarly aged objects in the upper scorpius ob association. wedevelop a technique to assess membership using radial velocities with a rangeof uncertainties that does not bias the selection when large uncertainties arepresent. the resulting membership probabilities are used to assess the issue ofexclusion in photometric selections, and we find that very few members arelikely to be excluded by such techniques.  we also assess the level of contamination in the expected pre-main sequenceregion of colour-magnitude space brighter than i = 17. we find thatcontamination by non-members in the expected pms region of the colour-magnitudediagram is small. we conclude that although radial velocity alone isinsufficient to confirm membership, high signal-to-noise observations of thenai doublet provide the opportunity to use the strength of nai absorption inconcert with radial velocities to asses membership down to the lowest masses,where lithium absorption no longer distinguishes youth.

astro-ph;0501534	do accretion discs regulate the rotation of young stars?	we present a photometric study of i-band variability in the young cluster ic348. the main purpose of the study was to identify periodic stars. in all wefind 50 periodic stars, of which 32 were previously unknown. for the first timein ic 348, we discover periods in significant numbers of lower-mass stars (m &lt;0.25 msun) and classical t-tauri stars. this increased sensitivity toperiodicities is due to the enhanced depth and temporal density of ourobservations, compared with previous studies. the period distribution is atfirst glance similar to that seen in the orion nebula cluster, with thehigher-mass stars (m &gt; 0.25 msun) showing a bi-modal period distributionconcentrated around periods of 2 and 8 days, and the lower-mass stars showing auni-modal distribution, heavily biassed towards fast rotators. closerinspection of the period distribution shows that the higher mass stars show asignificant dearth of fast rotators, compared to the orion nebula cluster,whilst the low mass stars are rotating significantly faster than those inorion. we find no correlation between rotation period and k-l colour or h-alphaequivalent width.  we also present a discussion of our own ic 348 data in the context ofpreviously published period distributions for the orion nebula cluster, theorion flanking fields and ngc 2264. we find that the previously claimedcorrelation between infrared excess and rotation period in the onc might infact result from a correlation between infrared excess and mass. we also find amarked difference in period distributions between ngc 2264 and ic 348, whichpresents a serious challenge to the disc locking paradigm, given the similarityin ages and disc fractions between the two clusters.

astro-ph;0508487	can variability account for apparent age spreads in ob association  colour-magnitude diagrams?	we have investigated the role of photometric variability in causing theapparent age spreads observed in the colour-magnitude diagrams of obassociations. we have found that the combination of binarity, photometricuncertainty and variability on timescales of a few years is not sufficient toexplain the observed spread in either of the ob associations we have studied.such effects can account for about half the observed spread in the sigmaorionis subgroup and about 1/20 of the observed spread in cep ob3b. this rulesout variability caused by stellar rotation and rotation of structures withininner accretion discs as the source of the majority of the the apparent agespreads. we also find that the variability tends to move objects parallel toisochrones in v/v-i' cmds, and thus has little influence on apparent agespreads. we conclude that the remaining unexplained spread either reflects atrue spread in the ages of the pms objects or arises as a result of longer termvariability associated with changes in accretion flow.

astro-ph;0510438	ultracam photometry of the eclipsing cataclysmic variables gy cnc, ir  com and ht cas	we present high-speed, three-colour photometry of the eclipsing cataclysmicvariables gy cnc, ir com and ht cas. we find that the sharp eclipses in gy cncand ir com are due to eclipses of the white dwarf. there is some evidence for abright spot on the edge of the accretion disc in gy cnc, but not in ir com.eclipse mapping of ht cas is presented which shows changes in the structure ofthe quiescent accretion disc. observations in 2002 show the accretion disc tobe invisible except for the presence of a bright spot at the disc edge. 2003observations, however, clearly show a bright inner disc and the bright spot tobe much fainter than in 2002. although no outburst was associated with eitherset of quiescent observations, the system was ~0.6 mjy brighter in 2003, mainlydue to the enhanced emission from the inner disc. we propose that these changesare due to variations in the mass transfer rate from the secondary star andthrough the disc. the disc colours indicate that it is optically thin in bothits inner and outer regions. we estimate the white dwarf temperature of ht casto be 15 000 +/- 1000 k in 2002 and 14 000 +/- 1000 k in 2003.
