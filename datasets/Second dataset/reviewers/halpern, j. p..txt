0902.3007	discovery of a 112 ms x-ray pulsar in puppis a: further evidence of  neutron stars weakly magnetized at birth	we report the discovery of 112-ms x-ray pulsations from rx j0822-4300, thecompact central object (cco) in the supernova remnant puppis a, in two archivalnewton x-ray multi-mirror mission observations taken in 2001. the sinusoidallight curve has a pulsed fraction of 11% with an abrupt 180 deg. change inphase at 1.2 kev. the observed phase shift and modulation are likely the resultof emission from opposing thermal hot spots of distinct temperatures.phase-resolved spectra reveal an emission feature at e(line) = 0.8 kevassociated with the cooler region, possibly due to an electron cyclotronresonance effect similar to that seen in the spectrum of the cco pulsar 1e1207.4-5209. no change in the spin period of psr j0821-4300 is detected in 7months, with a 2 sigma upper limit on the period derivative less than 8.3e-15.this implies limits on the spin-down energy loss rate of less than 2.3e35erg/s, the surface magnetic dipole field strength b_s &lt; 9.8e11 g, and thespin-down age tau &gt; 220 kyr. the latter is much longer than the snr age,indicating that psr j0821-4300 was born spinning near its present period. itsproperties are remarkably similar to those of the two other known cco pulsars,demonstrating the existence of a class of neutron stars born with weak magneticfields related to a slow original spin. these results are also of importance inunderstanding the extreme transverse velocity of psr j0821-4300, favoring thehydrodynamic instability mechanism in the supernova explosion.

0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

0911.0093	spin-down measurement of psr j1852+0040 in kesteven 79: central compact  objects as anti-magnetars	using xmm-newton and chandra, we achieved phase-connected timing of the 105ms x-ray pulsar psr j1852+0040 that provides the first measurement of thespin-down rate of a member of the class of central compact objects (ccos) insupernova remnants. we measure p-dot = 8.68(9)e-18, and find no evidence fortiming noise or variations in x-ray flux over 4.8 yr. in the dipole spin-downformalism, this implies a surface magnetic field strength b_s = 3.1e10 g, thesmallest ever measured for a young neutron star, and consistent with being afossil field. in combination with upper limits on b_s from other cco pulsars,this is strong evidence in favor of the "anti-magnetar" explanation for theirlow luminosity and lack of magnetospheric activity or synchrotron nebulae.while this dipole field is small, it can prevent accretion of sufficientfall-back material so that the observed x-ray luminosity of l_x = 5.3e33(d/7.1kpc)^2 erg/s must instead be residual cooling. the spin-down luminosity of psrj1852+0040, e-dot = 3.0e32 erg/s, is an order-of-magnitude smaller than l_x.fitting of the x-ray spectrum to two blackbodies finds small emitting radii,r_1 = 1.9 km and r_2 = 0.45 km, for components of kt_1 = 0.30 kev and kt_2 =0.52 kev, respectively. such small, hot regions are ubiquitous among ccos, andare not yet understood in the context of the anti-magnetar picture becauseanisotropic surface temperature is usually attributed to the effects of strongmagnetic fields.

0912.4985	two magnetar candidates in hess supernova remnants	we identify two candidate magnetars in archival x-ray observations of hessdetected shell-type snrs. x-ray point sources in ctb 37b coincident with hessj1713-381 and in g353.6-0.7 coincident with hess j1731-347 both have axp-likespectra, much softer than those of ordinary, rotation powered pulsars, and nooptical/ir counterparts. the spectrum of cxou j171405.7-381031 in ctb 37b has ahard excess above 6 kev, which may be similar to such components seen in someaxps. a new chandra observation of this object reveals a highly significantpulsed signal at p = 3.82 s with pulsed fraction f_p = 0.31. analysis of anxmm-newton observation of the second candidate, xmmu j173203.3-344518 ing353.6-0.7, yields only marginal evidence for a 1 s period. if it is not amagnetar, then it could be a weakly magnetized central compact object (cco).considering that these hess sources previously attributed to the snr shells arepossibly centrally peaked, we hypothesize that their pulsars may contribute todiffuse tev emission. these identifications potentially double the number ofmagnetar/snr associations in the galaxy, and can be used to investigate theenergetics and asymmetries of the supernovae that give rise to magnetars.

0708.0002	1e 1547.0-5408: a radio-emitting magnetar with a rotation period of 2  seconds	the variable x-ray source 1e 1547.0-5408 was identified by gelfand &amp; gaensler(2007) as a likely magnetar in g327.24-0.13, an apparent supernova remnant. nox-ray pulsations have been detected from it. using the parkes radio telescope,we discovered pulsations with period p = 2.069 s. using the australia telescopecompact array, we localized these to 1e 1547.0-5408. we measure dp/dt =(2.318+-0.005)e-11, which for a magnetic dipole rotating in vacuo gives asurface field strength of 2.2e14 g, a characteristic age of 1.4 kyr, and aspin-down luminosity of 1.0e35 ergs/s. together with its x-ray characteristics,these rotational parameters of 1e 1547.0-5408 prove that it is a magnetar, onlythe second known to emit radio waves. the distance is ~9 kpc, derived from thedispersion measure of 830 pc/cc. the pulse profile at a frequency of 1.4 ghz isextremely broad and asymmetric due to multipath propagation in the ism, as aresult of which only approximately 75% of the total flux at 1.4 ghz is pulsed.at higher frequencies the profile is more symmetric and has fwhm = 0.12p.unlike in normal radio pulsars, but in common with the other knownradio-emitting magnetar, xte j1810-197, the spectrum over 1.4-6.6 ghz is flator rising, and we observe large, sudden changes in the pulse shape. in acontemporaneous swift x-ray observation, 1e 1547.0-5408 was detected withrecord high flux, f_x(1-8 kev) ~ 5e-12 ergs/cm^2/s, 16 times the historicminimum. the pulsar was undetected in archival radio observations from 1998,implying a flux &lt; 0.2 times the present level. together with the transientbehavior of xte j1810-197, these results suggest that radio emission istriggered by x-ray outbursts of usually quiescent magnetars.

1009.4473	modeling the surface x-ray emission and viewing geometry of psr  j0821-4300 in puppis a	we show that a pair of thermal, antipodal hot-spots on the neutron starsurface is able to fully account for the pulsar's double blackbody spectrum andenergy-dependent pulse profile, including the observed 180 degree phasereversal at approximately 1.2 kev. by comparing the observed pulse modulationand phase to the model predictions, we strongly constrain the hot-spot pole(xi) and the line-of-sight (psi) angles with respect to the spin axis. for anominal radius of r = 12 km and distance d = 2.2 kpc, we find (xi,psi) =(86d,6d), with 1-sigma error ellipse of (2d,1d); this solution is degenerate inthe two angles. the best-fit spectral model for this geometry requires that thetemperatures of the two emission spots differ by a factor of 2 and their areasby a factor of ~ 20. including a cosine-beamed pattern for the emittedintensity modifies the result, decreasing the angles to (84d,3d); however thismodel is not statistically distinguishable from the isotropic emission case. wealso present a new upper limit on the period derivative of pdot &lt; 3.5e-16(2-sigma), which limits the global dipole magnetic field to b_s &lt; 2.0e11 g,confirming psr j0821-4300 as an "anti-magnetar." we discuss the results in thecontext of observations and theories of nonuniform surface temperature onisolated nss of both weak and strong magnetic field. to explain the nonuniformtemperature of psr j0821-4300 may require a crustal field that is much strongerthan the external, global dipole field.

0704.2255	precise timing of the x-ray pulsar 1e 1207.4-5209: a steady neutron star  weakly magnetized at birth	we analyze all x-ray timing data on 1e 1207.4-5209 in supernova remnant pks1209-51/52 gathered in 2000-2005, and find a highly stable rotation withp=424.130451(4) ms and period derivative of (9.6 +/- 9.4)e-17 s/s. this refutesprevious claims of large timing irregularities in these data. in the dipolespin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limit on period derivative implies anenergy loss rate &lt; 1.5e32 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength b_p &lt; 3.5e11g, and characteristic age tau &gt; 24 myr. this tau exceeds the remnant age by 3orders of magnitude, requiring that the pulsar was born spinning at its presentperiod. the x-ray luminosity of 1e 1207.4-5209, l(bol) ~= 2e33 ergs/s at 2 kpc,exceeds its spin-down energy loss, implying that l(bol) derives from residualcooling, and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. the upper limiton b_p is small enough to favor the electron cyclotron model for at least oneof the prominent absorption lines in its soft x-ray spectrum. this is thesecond demonstrable case of a pulsar born spinning slowly and with a weakb-field, after psr j1852+0040 in kesteven 79.

0711.1554	cco pulsars as anti-magnetars: evidence of neutron stars weakly  magnetized at birth	our new study of the two central compact object pulsars, psr j1210-5226 (p =424 ms) and psr j1852+0040 (p = 105 ms), leads us to conclude that a weak natalmagnetic field shaped their unique observational properties. in the dipolespin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limits on their period derivatives, &lt;2e-16 for both pulsars, implies surface magnetic field strengths of b_s &lt; 3e11g and spin periods at birth equal to their present periods to three significantdigits. their x-ray luminosities exceed their respective spin-downluminosities, implying that their thermal spectra are derived from residualcooling and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. for sufficientlyweak magnetic fields an accretion disk can penetrate the light cylinder andinteract with the magnetosphere while resulting torques on the neutron starremain within the observed limits. we propose the following as the origin ofradio-quiet ccos: the magnetic field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, isweaker if the ns is formed spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete sndebris. accretion excludes neutron stars born with both b_s &lt; 1e11 g and p &gt;0.1 s from radio pulsar surveys, where such weak fields are not encounteredexcept among very old (&gt; 40 myr) or recycled pulsars. we predict that thesebirth properties are common, and may be attributes of the youngest detectedneutron star, the cco in cassiopeia a, as well as an undetected infant neutronstar in the sn 1987a remnant. in view of the far-infrared light echo discoveredaround cas a and attributed to an sgr-like outburst, it is especially importantto determine via timing whether cas a hosts a magnetar or not. if not amagnetar, the cas a ns may instead have undergone a one-time phase transition(corequake) that powered the light echo.

1301.2717	the spin-down of psr j0821-4300 and psr j1210-5226: confirmation of  central compact objects as anti-magnetars	using xmm-newton and chandra, we measure period derivatives for the secondand third known pulsars in the class of central compact objects (ccos) insupernova remnants, proving that these young neutron stars have exceptionallyweak dipole magnetic field components. for the 112 ms psr j0821-4300 in puppisa, pdot = (9.28 +/- 0.36)e-18. its proper motion, mu = 61 +/- 9 mas/yr, wasalso measured using chandra. this contributes a kinematic term to the periodderivative via the shklovskii effect, which is subtracted from pdot to derivedipole bs = 2.9e10 g, a value similar to that of first measured cco psrj1852+0040 in kes 79, which has bs = 3.1e10 g. antipodal surface hot spots withdifferent temperatures and areas are deduced from the x-ray spectrum and pulseprofiles. paradoxically, such nonuniform surface temperature appears to requirestrong crustal magnetic fields, probably toroidal or quadrupolar componentsmuch stronger than the external dipole. a spectral feature, consisting ofeither an emission line at approximately 0.75 kev or absorption atapproximately 0.46 kev, is modulated in strength with the rotation. it may bedue to a cyclotron process in a magnetic field on the surface that is slightlystronger than the dipole deduced from the spin-down. we also timed anew the 424ms psr j12010-5226, resolving previous ambiguities about its spin-down rate.its pdot = (2.22 +/- 0.02)e-17, corresponding to bs = 9.8e10 g. this iscompatible with a cyclotron resonance interpretation of its prominentabsorption line at 0.7 kev and harmonics. these results deepen the mystery ofthe origin and evolution of ccos: why are their numerous descendants notevident?

0705.0065	discovery of the putative pulsar and wind nebula associated with the tev  gamma-ray source hess j1813-178	we present a chandra x-ray observation of g12.82-0.02, a shell-like radiosupernova remnant coincident with the tev gamma-ray source hess j1813-178. weresolve the x-ray emission from the co-located asca source into a point sourcesurrounded by structured diffuse emission that fills the interior of the radioshell. the morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of apulsar wind nebula. the spectrum of the compact source is well-characterized bya power-law with index gamma approx 1.3, typical of young and energeticrotation-powered pulsars. for a distance of 4.5 kpc, consistent with the x-rayabsorption and an association with the nearby star formation region w33, the2-10 kev x-ray luminosities of the putative pulsar and nebula are l(psr) =3.2e33 ergs/s and l(pwn) = 1.4e34 ergs/s, respectively. both the flux ratio ofl(pwn)/l(psr) = 4.3 and the total luminosity of this system predict a pulsarspin-down power of edot &gt; 1e37 ergs/s, placing it within the ten most energeticyoung pulsars in the galaxy. a deep search for radio pulsations using theparkes telescope sets an upper-limit of approx 0.07 mjy at 1.4 ghz for periods&gt;~ 50 ms. we discuss the energetics of this source, and consider briefly theproximity of bright h2 regions to this and several other hess sources, whichmay produce their tev emission via inverse compton scattering.

0712.4149	uv/optical detections of candidate tidal disruption events by galex and  cfhtls	we present two luminous uv/optical flares from the nuclei of apparentlyinactive early-type galaxies at z=0.37 and 0.33 that have the radiativeproperties of a flare from the tidal disruption of a star. in this paper wereport the second candidate tidal disruption event discovery in the uv by thegalex deep imaging survey, and present simultaneous optical light curves fromthe cfhtls deep imaging survey for both uv flares. the first few months of theuv/optical light curves are well fitted with the canonical t^(-5/3) power-lawdecay predicted for emission from the fallback of debris from a tidallydisrupted star. chandra acis x-ray observations during the flares detect softx-ray sources with t_bb= (2-5) x 10^5 k or gamma &gt; 3 and place limits on hardx-ray emission from an underlying agn down to l_x (2-10 kev) &lt;~ 10^41 ergs/s.blackbody fits to the uv/optical spectral energy distributions of the flaresindicate peak flare luminosities of &gt; 10^44-10^45 ergs/s. the temperature,luminosity, and light curves of both flares are in excellent agreement withemission from a tidally disrupted main sequence star onto a central black holeof several times 10^7 msun. the observed detection rate of our search over ~2.9 deg^2 of galex deep imaging survey data spanning from 2003 to 2007 isconsistent with tidal disruption rates calculated from dynamical models, and weuse these models to make predictions for the detection rates of the nextgeneration of optical synoptic surveys.

1305.3439	discovery of 47-s pulsations in the x-ray source 1rxs j225352.8+624354	we report on the discovery of pulsations at a period of ~47 s in thepersistent x-ray source 1rxs j225352.8+624354 (1rxs j2253) using five chandraobservations performed in 2009. the signal was also detected in swift and rosatdata, allowing us to infer over a 16-yr baseline an average, long-term periodincreasing rate of ~17 ms per year and therefore to confirm the signal as thespin period of an accreting, spinning-down neutron star. the pulse profile of1rxs j2253 (~50-60% pulsed fraction) is complex and energy independent (withinthe statistical uncertainties). the 1-10 kev chandra spectra are well fit by anabsorbed power-law model with photon index ~1.4 and observed flux of (2-5)e-12erg cm^-2 s^-1. the source was also detected by integral in the 17-60 kev bandat a persistent flux of ~6e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1, implying a spectral cut offaround 15 kev. we also carried out optical spectroscopic follow-up observationsof the 2mass counterpart at the nordic optical telescope. this made it possibleto first classify the companion of 1rxs j2253 as a b0-1iii-ve (most likely ab1ve) star at a distance of about 4-5 kpc (favouring an association with theperseus arm of the galaxy). the latter finding implies an x-ray luminosity of~3e34 erg s^-1, suggesting that 1rxs j2253 is a new member of the sub-class oflow-luminosity long-orbital-period persistent be/x-ray pulsars in a wide andcircular orbit (such as x persei).

1307.2146	x-ray observations of disrupted recycled pulsars: no refuge for orphaned  central compact objects	we present a chandra x-ray survey of the disrupted recycled pulsars (drps),isolated radio pulsars with p &gt; 20 ms and b_s &lt; 3e10 g. these observations weremotivated as a search for the immediate descendants of the approx. 10 centralcompact objects (ccos) in supernova remnants, three of which have similartiming and magnetic properties as the drps, but are bright, thermal x-raysources consistent with minimal neutron star cooling curves. since none of thedprs were detected, there is no evidence that they are "orphaned" ccos, neutronstars whose supernova remnants has dissipated. upper limits on their thermalx-ray luminosities are in the range log lx[erg/s] = 31.8-32.8, which impliescooling ages &gt; 1e4 - 1e5 yr, roughly 10 times the ages of the approximately 10known ccos in a similar volume of the galaxy. the order of a hundred ccodescendants that could be detected by this method are thus either intrinsicallyradio quiet, or occupy a different region of (p,b_s) parameter space from thedrps. this motivates a new x-ray search for orphaned ccos among radio pulsarswith larger b-fields, which could verify the theory that their fields areburied by fall-back of supernova ejecta, but quickly regrow to join the normalpulsar population.

1310.6789	x-ray measurement of the spin-down of calvera: a radio- and  gamma-ray-quiet pulsar	we measure spin-down of the 59 ms x-ray pulsar calvera by comparing thexmm-newton discovery data from 2009 with new chandra timing observations takenin 2013. its period derivative is p-dot = (3.19+/-0.08)e-15, which correspondsto spin-down luminosity e-dot = 6.1e35 erg/s, characteristic age tau_c =p/2p-dot = 2.9e5 yr, and surface dipole magnetic field strength b_s = 4.4e11 g.these values rule out a mildly recycled pulsar, but calvera could be anorphaned central compact object (anti-magnetar), with a magnetic field that wasinitially buried by supernova debris and is now reemerging and approachingnormal strength. we also performed unsuccessful searches for high-energygamma-rays from calvera in both imaging and timing of &gt;100 mev fermi photons.even though the distance to calvera is uncertain by an order of magnitude, anupper limit of d &lt; 2 kpc inferred from x-ray spectra implies a gamma-rayluminosity limit of &lt; 3.3e32 erg/s, which is less than that of any pulsar ofcomparable e-dot. calvera shares some properties with psr j1740+1000, a youngradio pulsar that we show by virtue of its lack of proper motion was bornoutside of the galactic disk. as an energetic, high-galactic-latitude pulsar,calvera is unique in being undetected in both radio and gamma-rays to faintlimits, which should place interesting constraints on models for particleacceleration and beam patterns in pulsar magnetospheres.

0802.0494	the magnetar 1e 1547.0-5408: radio spectrum, polarimetry, and timing	we have investigated the radio emission from the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e1547.0-5408 (psr j1550-5418) using the parkes telescope and the australiatelescope compact array. the flux density of the pulsar is roughly the samebetween 1.4 and 45 ghz, but shows time variability. the radiation is nearly100% linearly polarized between frequencies of 45 and 3.2 ghz, but from 2.3 to1.4 ghz it becomes increasingly more depolarized. the rotation measure of -1860rad/m^2 is the largest for any known pulsar, and implies an average magneticfield strength along the line of sight of 2.7 microg. the pulse profiles arecircularly polarized at all frequencies observed, more so at lower frequencies,at the ~15% level. the observed swing of the position angle of linearpolarization as a function of pulse phase suggests that in this neutron starthe rotation and magnetic axes are nearly aligned, and that its radio emissionis only detectable within a small solid angle. timing measurements indicatethat the period derivative of this 2 s pulsar has increased by nearly 40% in a6-month period. the flat spectrum and variability in flux density and pulseprofiles are reminiscent of the properties of xte j1810-197, the only otherknown radio-emitting magnetar, and are anomalous by comparison with those ofordinary radio pulsars.

astro-ph;0006206	grb 991216 joins the jet set: discovery and monitoring of its optical  afterglow	the optical light curve of the energetic gamma-ray burst grb 991216 isconsistent with jet-like behavior in which a power-law decay steepens fromt**(-1.22 +/- 0.04) at early times to t**(-1.53 +/- 0.05) in a gradualtransition at around 2 d. the derivation of the late-time decay slope takesinto account the constant contribution of a host or intervening galaxy whichwas measured 110 d after the event at r = 24.56 +/- 0.14, although the lightcurve deviates from a single power law whether or not a constant term isincluded. the early-time spectral energy distribution of the afterglow can bedescribed as f_nu ~ nu**(-0.74 +/- 0.05) or flatter between optical and x-ray,which, together with the slow initial decay, is characteristic of standardadiabatic evolution in a uniformly dense medium. assuming that a reportedabsorption-line redshift of 1.02 is correct, the apparent isotropic energy of6.7 x 10**53 erg is reduced by a factor of ~ 200 in the jet model, and theinitial half-opening angle is ~ 6 deg. grb 991216 is the third good example ofa jet-like afterglow (following grb 990123 and grb 990510), supporting a trendin which the apparently most energetic gamma-ray events have the narrowestcollimation and a uniform ism environment. this, plus the absence of evidencefor supernovae associated with jet-like afterglows, suggests that these eventsmay originate from a progenitor in which angular momentum plays an importantrole but a massive stellar envelope or wind does not, e.g., the coalescence ofa compact binary.

astro-ph;0007076	a possible x-ray and radio counterpart of the high-energy gamma-ray  source 3eg j2227+6122	the identity of the persistent egret sources in the galactic plane is largelya mystery. for one of these, 3eg j2227+6122, our complete census of x-ray andradio sources in its error circle reveals a remarkable superposition of anincomplete radio shell with a flat radio spectrum, and a compact, power-lawx-ray source with photon index gamma = 1.5 and with no obvious opticalcounterpart. the radio shell is polarized at a level of 25%. the anomalousproperties of the radio source prevent us from deriving a completelysatisfactory theory as to its nature. nevertheless, using data from rosat,asca, the vla, and optical imaging and spectroscopy, we argue that the x-raysource may be a young pulsar with an associated wind-blown bubble or bow shocknebula, and an example of the class of radio-quiet pulsars which arehypothesized to comprise the majority of egret sources in the galaxy. thedistance to this source can be estimated from its x-ray absorption as 3 kpc. atthis distance, the x-ray and gamma-ray luminosities would be 1.7x10^{33} and3.7x10^{35} erg s^{-1}, respectively, which would require an energetic pulsarto power them.  if, on the contrary, this x-ray source is not the counterpart of 3egj2227+6122, then by process of elimination the x-ray luminosity of the lattermust be less than 10^{-4} of its gamma-ray luminosity, a condition notsatisfied by any established class of gamma-ray source counterpart. this wouldrequire the existence of at least a quantitatively new type of egret source, ashas been suggested in studies of other egret fields.

astro-ph;0103026	the first observations of the second brightest quasar	we report the discovery of a new bright quasar phl 1811 as part of a followupprogram to identify bright quasars in the first radio survey. with b=13.9,r=13.9, and z=0.192, this quasar is now the second brightest quasar (inapparent magnitude) known beyond z=0.1. optically classified as a narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy (nls1), phl 1811 is unusual for an object in this class inthat it was not detected in x-rays in the rosat all sky survey or in anyprevious x-ray survey. a follow-up bepposax observation confirms that it isdeficient in x-rays compared with other quasars, but poor signal to noiseprevents a definitive characterization of the x-ray spectrum. we consider threealternative hypotheses to explain why phl 1811 is a weak x-ray source: 1.) itis a balqso and suffers x-ray absorption; 2.) like several other luminousnls1s, it exhibits high amplitude x-ray variability, and has been observed onlywhen it is in an x-ray quiescent state; 3.) it is intrinsically weak because itsimply lacks an x-ray emitting region.

astro-ph;0104109	psr j2229+6114: discovery of an energetic young pulsar in the error box  of the egret source 3eg j2227+6122	we report the detection of radio and x-ray pulsations at a period of 51.6 msfrom the x-ray source rx/ax j2229.0+6114 in the error box of the egret source3eg j2227+6122. an ephemeris derived from a single asca observation andmultiple epochs at 1412 mhz from jodrell bank indicates steady spin-down withp-dot = 7.83 x 10^(-14) s/s. from the measured p and p-dot we derive spin-downpower e-dot = 2.2 x 10^(37) erg/s, magnetic field b = 2.0 x 10^(12) g, andcharacteristic age p/2p-dot = 10,460 yr. an image from the chandra x-rayobservatory reveals a point source surrounded by centrally peaked diffuseemission that is contained within an incomplete radio shell. we assign the nameg106.6+2.9 to this new supernova remnant, which is evidently a pulsar windnebula. for a distance of 3 kpc estimated from x-ray absorption, the ratio ofx-ray luminosity to spin-down power is ~8 x 10^(-5), smaller than that of mostpulsars, but similar to the vela pulsar. if psr j2229+6114 is the counterpartof 3eg j2227+6122 then its efficiency of gamma-ray production, if isotropic, is0.016 (d/3 kpc)^2. it obeys an established trend of gamma-ray efficiency amongknown gamma-ray pulsars which, in combination with the demonstrated absence ofany other plausible counterpart for 3eg j2227+6122, makes the identificationcompelling. if confirmed, this identification bolsters the pulsar model forunidentified galactic egret sources.

astro-ph;0111577	the new gamma-ray pulsar psr j2229+6114, its pulsar wind nebula, and  comparison with the vela pulsar	with a period of 51.6 ms and spin-down power 2.2x10^{37} erg s^{-1}, psrj2229+6114 is a compelling identification for the egret source 3eg j2227+6122in which error circle it resides. striking features of the chandra x-ray imageare an incomplete elliptical arc and a possible jet, similar to the structuresthat dominate the appearance of the vela pwn. approximately 70% of the 2-10 kevx-ray emission comes from a centrally peaked, diffuse nebula of radius 100"with a power-law spectrum of photon index 1.45 +/- 0.19. the pulsar itself hasa marginally harder spectrum with photon index 0.99 +/- 0.27. for an assumeddistance of 3 kpc the ratio of x-ray luminosity to spin-down power of psrj2229+6114 is only 8 x 10^{-5}. we discuss a model in which such inefficientx-ray emission is the signature of a highly magnetized pulsar wind thatprevents an internal mhd shock, at the location of the x-ray arc, from stronglycompressing the flow. the incomplete x-ray arc is consistent with beaming froma relativistic equatorial outflow, while a surrounding radio shell is probablythe forward shock in the surrounding ism. an mev source at this location waspreviously detected by the comptel experiment on cgro. this, plus the flatx-ray spectrum in the 2-10 kev band, suggests that psr j2229+6114 is one of thebrightest pulsars at 1 mev, even while it is inconspicuous at radio throughx-ray wavelengths, and as steep as the crab above 100 mev. the apparent varietyof broad-band spectra displayed by high-energy pulsars bolsters the theory thatrotation-powered pulsars dominate the unidentified galactic egret sourcepopulation.

astro-ph;0112568	an agn identification for 3eg j2006-2321	we present a multiwavelength analysis of the high-energy gamma-ray source 3egj2006-2321. the flux of this source above 100 mev is shown to be variable ontime scales of days and months. optical observations and careful examination ofarchived radio data indicate that its radio counterpart is pmn j2005-2310, aflat-spectrum radio quasar with a 5-ghz flux density of 260 mjy. study of the$v=18.7$ optical counterpart indicates a redshift of 0.833 and variable linearpolarization. no x-ray source has been detected near the position of pmnj2005-2310, but an x-ray upper limit is derived from rosat data. this upperlimit provides for a spectral energy distribution with global characteristicssimilar to those of known gamma-ray blazars. taken together, these dataindicate that 3eg j2006-2321, listed as unidentified in the 3rd egret catalog,is a member of the blazar class of agn. the 5-ghz radio flux density of thisblazar is the lowest of the 68 egret-detected agn. the fact that egret hasdetected such a source has implications for unidentified egret sources,particularly those at high latitudes ($|b|&gt;30^{\circ}$), many of which may beblazars.

astro-ph;0206220	discovery of a 136 millisecond radio and x-ray pulsar in snr g54.1+0.3	we report the discovery of a pulsar with period p = 136 ms and dispersionmeasure 308 pc/cc in a deep observation of the supernova remnant (snr)g54.1+0.3 with the arecibo radio telescope. timing measurements of the newpulsar, j1930+1852, reveal a characteristic age of pdt/2dp = 2900 yr andspin-down luminosity de/dt = 1.2e37 erg/s. we have subsequently searchedarchival asca x-ray data of this snr, and detect pulsations with a consistentperiod. these findings ensure that psr j1930+1852 is the pulsar that powers the"crab-like" snr g54.1+.3. together with existing chandra observations of thesnr, we derive an x-ray pulsed fraction (2-10 kev) of ~27%. we also find thatthe cooling efficiency of the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) is intermediate betweenthose of the vela and crab pwne: lx (2-10 kev) ~0.002 de/dt. psr j1930+1852 isa very weak radio source, with period-averaged flux density at 1180 mhz of 60microjy. for a distance of 5 kpc, its luminosity, ~1 mjy kpc^2, is among thelowest for known young pulsars.

astro-ph;0207001	a high-energy study of the geminga pulsar	we present the results of deep x-ray and gamma-ray observations of thegeminga pulsar obtained in the final years of the asca and cgro missions, andan upper limit from rxte. a phase-connected ephemeris from the gamma-rays isderived that spans the years 1973-2000, after allowing for a minor glitch infrequency of delta f/f = 6.2 x 10^-10 in late 1996. asca observations of thehard x-ray pulse profile in 1994 and 1999 confirm this glitch. an improvedcharacterization of the hard x-ray pulse profile and spectrum from the longasca observation of 1999 confirms that there is a non-thermal x-ray componentthat is distinct from the gamma-ray spectrum as measured by egret. it can beparameterized as a power-law of photon index gamma = 1.72 +/- 0.10 with a fluxof 2.62 x 10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s in the 0.7-5 kev band and pulsed fraction 0.54 +/-0.05, similar to, but more precise than values measured previously. anextrapolation of this spectrum into the energy band observed by the rxte pca isconsistent with the non-detection of pulsed emission from geminga with thatinstrument. these results are interpreted in the context of outer-gap models,and motivations for future x-ray observations of geminga are given.

astro-ph;0207009	time-dependent optical spectroscopy of grb 010222: clues to the grb  environment	we present sequential optical spectra of the afterglow of grb 010222 obtainedone day apart using the low resolution imaging spectrometer (lris) and theechellette spectrograph and imager (esi) on the keck telescopes. threelow-ionization absorption systems are spectroscopically identified atz1=1.47688, z2=1.15628, and z3=0.92747. the higher resolution esi spectrumreveals two distinct components in the highest redshift system at z1a=1.47590and z1b=1.47688. we interpret the z1b=1.47688 system as an absorption featureof the disk of the host galaxy of grb 010222. the best fitted power-law opticalcontinuum and [zn/cr] ratio imply low dust content or a local gray dustcomponent near the burst site. in addition, we do not detect strong signaturesof vibrationally excited states of h_2. if the grb took place in a superbubbleor young stellar cluster, there are no outstanding signatures of an ionizedabsorber, either. analysis of the spectral time dependence at low resolutionshows no significant evidence for absorption-line variability. this lack ofvariability is confronted with time-dependent photoionization simulationsdesigned to apply the observed flux from grb 010222 to a variety of assumedatomic gas densities and cloud radii. the absence of time dependence in theabsorption lines implies that high-density environments are disfavored. inparticular, if the grb environment was dust free, its density was unlikely toexceed nh=10^2 cm^-3. if depletion of metals onto dust is similar to galacticvalues or less than solar abundances are present, then nh &gt; 2 x 10^4 cm^-3 isprobably ruled out in the immediate vicinity of the burst.

astro-ph;0207320	the faint optical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 020124: implications  for the nature of dark gamma-ray bursts	we present ground-based optical observations of grb 020124 starting 1.6 hoursafter the burst, as well as subsequent very large array (vla) and hubble spacetelescope (hst) observations. the optical afterglow of grb 020124 is one of thefaintest afterglows detected to date, and it exhibits a relatively rapid decay,$f_\nu\propto t^{-1.60\pm 0.04}$, followed by further steepening. in addition,a weak radio source was found coincident with the optical afterglow. the hstobservations reveal that a positionally coincident host galaxy must be thefaintest host to date, r&gt;29.5 mag. the afterglow observations can be explainedby several models requiring little or no extinction within the host galaxy,a_v~0-0.9 mag. these observations have significant implications for thestatistics of the so-called dark bursts (bursts for which no optical afterglowis detected), which are usually attributed to dust extinction within the hostgalaxy. the faintness and relatively rapid decay of the afterglow of grb020124, combined with the low inferred extinction indicate that some darkbursts are intrinsically dim and not dust obscured. thus, the diversity in theunderlying properties of optical afterglows must be observationally determinedbefore substantive inferences can be drawn from the statistics of dark bursts.

astro-ph;0209341	the asca x-ray spectrum of arp 102b and evaluation of simple models for  its associated, metastable fe ii absorber	we have observed the broad-line radio galaxy arp 102b with asca in order todetermine the absorbing column density towards its x-ray source and measure itsx-ray spectrum. the ultimate goal was to constrain the properties of the mediumresponsible for the metastable fe ii absorption lines observed in its uvspectrum. the 0.5-10 kev x-ray spectrum is described by a simple power-lawmodel of photon index 1.58+/-0.04 modified by photoelectric absorption with ancolumn density of (2.8+/-0.3)x10^{21} cm^{-2}. an fe k-alpha line is notdetected with an upper limit to its equivalent width of 200 ev (assuming fwhm =60,000 km/s. using the above column density the observed s.e.d. as constraints,we explore simple photoionization models for the absorber for a wide range ofdensities and ionization parameters in an effort to reproduce the strengths ofthe uv absorption lines. we find that densities of at least 1x10^{11} cm^{-3}are needed. however, a single ionization parameter cannot explain all of theobserved lines. an ionization parameter between 10^{-2.5} and 10^{-3.5} isneeded for the mg and fe lines and the soft x-ray absorption, but lines fromsi, c, al, and h require different density-ionization parameter combinations.according to the models, such an absorbing medium must be located very close tothe source of ionizing radiation (within 5,000 gravitational radii) and must bevery compact. as such, the properties of this absorbing medium differ fromthose of more luminous quasars, but are reminiscent of the absorber in theseyfert galaxy ngc 4151. we suggest that the absorber is in the form of thinsheets or filaments embedded in a wind wind that overlays the accretion disk ofarp 102b. this picture is consistent with all of the available constraints onthe central engine of this object.

astro-ph;0209516	high resolution grating spectroscopy of grb 020405 with chandra letgs	we present high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of grb 020405 obtained with thelow energy transmission grating spectrometer (letgs) on board the chandra x-rayobservatory starting 1.68 days after the burst. the spectrum appearsfeatureless, with no evidence for emission lines, absorption edges, or narrowradiative recombination continua. the continuum can be fitted by a power law ofphoton index gamma = 1.72 +/- 0.21 and temporal decay index alpha = 1.87 +/-0.1, with a marginally significant excess column density of cold gas n_{h}=(4.7+/- 3.7) x 10^{21} cm^{-2} at the redshift of the host galaxy. the absence ofiron lines indicates that the density of nearby surrounding material wasunlikely to be very dense (n &lt; 5 x 10^{12} cm^{-3}) at the time of the chandraobservation. in the case of recombination following photoionization in anoptically thin medium, most ionic species would be completely stripped at lowergas densities than this. in the case of a power-law spectrum reflecting off a``cold'', opaque medium of low density, negligible emission features would beproduced. alternative to these possible explanations for the lack of emissionfeatures, any x-ray line emission taking place in a dense medium in a ``nearbyreprocessor'' scenario might have been overwhelmed by the bright afterglowcontinuum. although the absence of discrete features does not unambiguouslytest for a connection between grb 020405 and nucleosynthesis, it emphasizes theneed for high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy to determine the exact emissionmechanism responsible for the reported discrete lines in other grb afterglows.

astro-ph;0303616	grb 021004: a possible shell nebula around a wolf-rayet star gamma-ray  burst progenitor	the rapid localization of grb 021004 by the hete-2 satellite allowed nearlycontinuous monitoring of its early optical afterglow decay, as well ashigh-quality optical spectra that determined a redshift of z3=2.328 for itshost galaxy, an active starburst galaxy with strong lyman-alpha emission andseveral absorption lines. spectral observations show multiple absorbers atz3a=2.323, z3b= 2.317, and z3c= 2.293 blueshifted by 450, 990, and 3,155 km/srespectively relative to the host galaxy lyman-alpha emission. we argue thatthese correspond to a fragmented shell nebula that has been radiativelyaccelerated by the gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow at a distance greater than0.3 pc from a wolf-rayet star progenitor. the chemical abundance ratiosindicate that the nebula is overabundant in carbon and silicon. the high levelof carbon and silicon is consistent with a swept-up shell nebula graduallyenriched by a wcl progenitor wind over the lifetime of the nebula prior to thegrb onset. the detection of statistically significant fluctuations and colorchanges about the jet-like optical decay further supports this interpretationsince fluctuations must be present at some level due to inhomogeneities in aclumpy stellar wind medium or if the progenitor has undergone massive ejectionprior to the grb onset. this evidence suggests that the mass-loss process in awolf-rayet star might lead naturally to an iron-core collapse with sufficientangular momentum that could serve as a suitable grb progenitor.

astro-ph;0304063	follow-up hst/stis spectroscopy of three candidate tidal disruption  events	large amplitude, high luminosity soft x-ray flares were detected by the rosatall-sky survey in several galaxies with no evidence for seyfert activity intheir ground-based optical spectra. these flares had the properties predictedfor a tidal disruption event by a central supermassive black hole: soft x-rayspectrum, time-scale of months, and large x-ray luminosity (10^42 - 10^44 ergss^-1). in order to evaluate the alternative hypothesis that these flares couldhave been some form of extreme agn variability, we obtained follow-up opticalspectroscopy of three of the flaring galaxies a decade later with the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis) and a narrow slit to search for or placestringent limits on the presence of any persistent seyfert-like emission intheir nuclei. two of the galaxies, rx j1624.9+7554 and rx j1242.6-1119, show noevidence for emission lines or a non-stellar continuum in their hubble spacetelescope (hst) nuclear spectra, consistent with their ground-basedclassification as inactive galaxies. they remain the most convincing as hostsof tidal disruption events. ngc 5905, previously known as a starburst h iigalaxy due to its strong emission lines, has in its inner 0."1 a nucleus withnarrow emission-line ratios requiring a seyfert 2 classification. this weakseyfert 2 nucleus in ngc 5905, which was masked by the many surrounding h iiregions in ground-based spectra, requires a low level of prior non-stellarphotoionization, thus raising some uncertainty about the nature of its x-rayflare, which may or may not have been a tidal disruption event. the absence ofboth broad emission lines and nuclear x-ray absorption in ngc 5905 alsocharacterizes it as a ``true'' seyfert 2 galaxy, yet one that has varied bymore than a factor of 100 in x-rays.

astro-ph;0308327	evolution of the nuclear accretion disk emission in ngc 1097: getting  closer to the black hole	we study the evolution of the broad, double-peaked halpha emission-lineprofile of the liner/seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc 1097, using 24 spectra obtainedover a time span of 11 yrs - from 1991 nov. through 2002 oct. while in thefirst 5 yrs the main variation was in the relative intensity of the blue andred peaks, in the last years we have also observed an increasing separationbetween the two peaks, at the same time as the integrated flux in the broadline has decreased. we propose a scenario in which the emission originates inan asymmetric accretion disk around a supermassive black hole, whose source ofionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximum emission to comecloser to the center (and thus to regions of higher projected velocity). we usethe observations to constrain the evolution of the accretion disk emission andto evaluate two models: the elliptical disk model previously found to reproducethe observations from 1991 to 1996 and a model of a circular disk with a singlespiral arm. we favor the latter, because the whole set of data is consistentwith a monotonic precession of the spiral pattern, which has completed almosttwo revolutions since 1991. the precession period implies a black hole mass ofapproximately 5x10^7 solar masses. finally, we have found tentative evidence ofthe emergence of an accretion disk wind, which we hope to explore further withfuture observations.

astro-ph;0309149	completion of a survey and detailed study of double-peaked emission  lines in radio-loud agns	we report the completion of a survey of radio-loud agns begun in an earlierpaper, aimed finding and studying broad, double-peaked balmer lines. we presentha spectra of 13 broad-lined objects (3 with double-peaked ha profiles). thefinal sample includes 106 radio-loud agns. 20% of the objects have ha lineswith double peaks or twin shoulders and of these, 60% can be fitted quite wellwith a model attributing the emission to a circular, relativistic, disk. wealso compare the hb and mgii profiles of 4 objects with models of photoionizedaccretion disks and find them to be in reasonable agreement. double-peakedemitters stand out on the basis of the following properties: (1) unusuallylarge contribution of starlight to the optical continuum around ha, (2)unusually large equivalent widths of low-ionization lines ([oi] and [sii]), (3)unusually large [oi]/[oiii] ratios, and (4) balmer lines on average twice asbroad as in other radio-loud agns. we evaluate models for the origin of thelines and we find accretion-disk emission to be the most successful one becauseit can explain the double-peaked line profiles and it also offers aninterpretation of the spectroscopic properties of these objects. aternativesuggestions (binary broad-line regions, bipolar outflows, anisotropicallyilluminated spherical broad-line regions) are unsatisfactory because (a) theyfail direct observational tests, (b) they cannot explain the unusual propertiesof double-peaked emitters self-consistently, or (c) their physical foundationsappear to be unsound. we suggest that in double-peaked emitters and accretion-powered liners the accretion rate is considerably lower than the eddington ratewith the consequence that the inner accretion disk takes the form of an iontorus and the wind that normally enshrouds the disk proper is absent.

astro-ph;0404506	the ultraviolet spectra of active galaxies with double-peaked emission  lines	we present the results of uv spectroscopy of agns with double-peaked balmeremission lines. in 2/3 of the objects, the far-uv resonance lines are strong,with single-peaked profiles resembling those of seyfert galaxies. the mg iiline is the only uv line with a double-peaked profile. in the remainingobjects, the far-uv resonance lines are relatively weak but stillsingle-peaked. the latter group also displays prominent uv absorption lines,indicative of a low-ionization absorber. we interpret the difference in theprofiles of the emission lines as resulting from two different regions: adense, low-ionization accretion disk (the predominant source of the balmer andmg ii lines), and a lower density, higher-ionization wind (the predominantsource of the far-uv resonance lines). these results suggest a way ofconnecting the double-peaked emitters with the greater agn population: indouble-peaked emitters the accretion rate onto the black hole is low, makingthe wind feeble and allowing the lines from the underlying disk to shinethrough. this scenario also implies that in the majority of agns, the wind isthe source of the broad emission lines.

astro-ph;0701736	the nature of the x-ray flash of august 24 2005	we present comprehensive photometric r-band observations of the fadingoptical afterglow of the x-ray flash xrf050824, from 11 minutes to 104 daysafter the burst. the r-band lightcurve of the afterglow resembles thelightcurves of long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a power-law albeitwith a rather shallow slope of alpha=0.6. our late r-band images reveal thehost galaxy with a rest-frame b-band luminosity corresponding to roughly 0.5lstar. the star-formation rate as determined from the [o ii] emission lineluminosity is about 1.8 msun per year. when accounting for the hostcontribution, the slope is alpha=0.65+-0.01 and a break in the lightcurve isalso suggested. a potential lightcurve bump at 2 weeks can be interpreted as asupernova only if this is a supernova with a fast rise and a fast decay.however, the overall fit still show excess scatter in the lightcurve due towiggles and bumps. the flat lightcurves in the optical and x-rays could beexplained by a continuous energy injection scenario with an on-axis viewingangle and a wide jet opening angle (theta_j&gt;10 deg). if the energy injectionsare episodic, this could potentially help explain the bumps and wiggles.spectroscopy of the afterglow give a redshift of z=0.828+-0.005 from bothabsorption and emission lines. the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theafterglow has a power-law shape with slope beta=0.56+-0.04. this can becompared to the x-ray spectral index which is betax=1.0+-0.1. the curvature ofthe sed constrain the dust reddening towards the burst to av&lt;0.5 mag.(abridged)

astro-ph;0702594	long-term profile variability of double peaked emission lines in active  galactic nuclei	we present up to two decades of spectroscopic monitoring of the double-peakedbroad halpha emission lines of seven broad-line radio galaxies. these extremelybroad, double-peaked lines are successfully modeled by emission from gas in theouter accretion disk, and their profiles vary on timescales of months to years.this variability is a valuable probe for understanding the structure anddynamics of the accretion disk. we characterize the long-term broad-lineprofile variability in detail, and compare the evolution of the line profileswith predictions from a few simple physical models for dynamical processes inthe accretion disk. we find no evidence for persistent, periodic variabilitythat would be indicative of a precessing elliptical disk, or a circular diskwith a long-lived, single-armed spiral or warp. we do find transient, periodicvariability on the orbital timescale, possibly resulting from shocks induced bytidal perturbations, and variability in the wings of the profile which suggestschanges in the emissivity of the inner accretion flow. dramatic but localizedprofile changes are observed during flares and high-states of broad-line flux.in 3c 332, these changes can be explained by a slow, smooth, secular change indisk illumination. in arp 102b and 3c 390.3, however, a simple disk modelcannot explain the asymmetric profile changes, suggesting a need for moresophisticated models. we also observe sharp, transient features that appear inthe blue peak of the objects, which require a well-organized velocity field.

astro-ph;0702616	polarized radio emission from the magnetar xte j1810-197	we have used the parkes radio telescope to study the polarized emission fromthe anomalous x-ray pulsar xte j1810-197 at frequencies of 1.4, 3.2, and 8.4ghz. we find that the pulsed emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized. theposition angle of linear polarization varies gently across the observed pulseprofiles, varying little with observing frequency or time, even as the pulseprofiles have changed dramatically over a period of 7 months. in the context ofthe standard pulsar "rotating vector model," there are two possibleinterpretations of the observed position angle swing coupled with the wideprofile. in the first, the magnetic and rotation axes are substantiallymisaligned and the emission originates high in the magnetosphere, as seen forother young radio pulsars, and the beaming fraction is large. in the secondinterpretation, the magnetic and rotation axes are nearly aligned and the lineof sight remains in the emission zone over almost the entire pulse phase. wedeprecate this possibility because of the observed large modulation of thermalx-ray flux. we have also measured the faraday rotation caused by the galacticmagnetic field, rm = +77 rad/m^2, implying an average magnetic field componentalong the line of sight of 0.5 microg.

astro-ph;0703336	vlba measurement of the transverse velocity of the magnetar xte  j1810-197	we have obtained observations of the magnetar xte j1810-197 with the verylong baseline array at two epochs separated by 106 days, at wavelengths of 6 cmand 3.6 cm. comparison of the positions yields a proper motion value of13.5+-1.0 mas/yr at an equatorial position angle of 209.4+-2.4 deg (east ofnorth). this value is consistent with a lower-significance proper motion valuederived from infrared observations of the source over the past three years,also reported here. given its distance of 3.5+-0.5 kpc, the implied transversevelocity corrected to the local standard of rest is 212+-35 km/s (1 sigma). themeasured velocity is slightly below the average for normal young neutron stars,indicating that the mechanism(s) of magnetar birth need not lead to highneutron star velocities. we also use australia telescope compact array, verylarge array, and these vlba observations to set limits on any diffuse emissionassociated with the source on a variety of spatial scales, concluding that theradio emission from xte j1810-197 is &gt;96% pulsed.

astro-ph;9604162	rosat pspc and hri observations of the composite starburst/seyfert 2  galaxy ngc 1672	the nearby barred spiral galaxy ngc 1672 is thought to have a weak seyfertnucleus in addition to its strong starburst activity. observations with thepspc and hri instruments on board the rosat x-ray satellite show that threex-ray sources with luminosities (1--2)\times 10^{40} erg/s are clearlyidentified with ngc 1672. the strongest x-ray source lies at the nucleus, andthe other two lie near the ends of the prominent bar, locations that are alsobright in h-alpha and near-infrared images. the nuclear source is resolved bythe hri on about the scale of the recently identified nuclear ring, and one ofthe sources at the ends of the bar is also probably resolved. the x-rayspectrum of the nuclear source is quite soft, having a raymond--smith plasmatemperature of about 0.7 kev and little evidence for intrinsic absorption. therosat band x-ray flux of the nuclear source appears to be dominated not byx-ray binary emission but rather by diffuse gas emission. while the propertiesof the nuclear source are generally supportive of a superbubble interpretation,its large density and emission measure stretch the limits that can becomfortably accommodated by such models. we do not detect direct emission fromthe putative seyfert nucleus, although an alternative model for the nuclearsource is thermal emission from gas that is photoionized by a hidden seyfertnucleus. the spectra of the other two x-ray sources are harder than that of thenuclear source, and superbubble models for them have the same strengths andweaknesses.

astro-ph;9706222	rejection of the binary broad-line region interpretation of  double-peaked emission lines in three active galactic nuclei	it has been suggested that the peculiar double-peaked balmer lines of certainbroad-line radio galaxies come from individual broad-line regions associatedwith the black holes of a supermassive binary. we continue to search forevidence of the radial velocity variations characteristic of a double-linedspectroscopic binary that are required in such a model. after spectroscopicmonitoring of three suitable candidates (arp 102b, 3c 390.3, and 3c 332)spanning two decades, we find no such long-term systematic changes in radialvelocity. a trend noticed by gaskell in one of the balmer-line peaks of 3c390.3 before 1988 did not continue after that year, invalidating his inferredorbital period and mass. instead, we find lower limits on the plausible orbitalperiods that would require the assumed supermassive binaries in all threeobjects to have total masses in excess of 10^10 solar masses. in the case of 3c390.3 the total binary mass must exceed 10^11 solar masses to satisfyadditional observational constraints on the inclination angle. such largebinary black hole masses are difficult to reconcile with other observations andwith theory. in addition, there are peculiar properties of the line profilesand flux ratios in these objects that are not explained by ordinary broad-lineregion cloud models. we therefore doubt that the double-peaked line profiles ofthe three objects arise in a pair of broad-line regions. rather, they are muchmore likely to be intimately associated with a single black hole.

astro-ph;9711283	models for x-ray emission from isolated pulsars	a model is proposed for the observed combination of power-law and thermalemission of kev x-rays from rotationally powered pulsars. for gamma-ray pulsarswith accelerators very many stellar radii above the neutron star surface, 100mev curvature gamma-rays from $e^{-}$ or $e^{+}$ flowing starward out of suchaccelerators are converted to electron-positron pairs on closed field lines allaround the star. these pairs strongly affect x-ray emission from near the starin two ways. (1) the pairs are a source of synchrotron emission immediatelyfollowing their creation in regions where $b \sim 10^{10}$ g. this emission, inthe photon energy range 0.1 kev $\lesssim e_{x} \lesssim$ 5 mev, has apower-law spectrum with energy index 0.5 and x-ray luminosity that depends onthe backflow current, and is typically $\sim 10^{33}$ \lum. (2) the pairsultimately form a cyclotron resonance ``blanket'' surrounding the star exceptfor two holes along the open field line bundles which pass through it. in sucha blanket the gravitational pull on electron-positron pairs toward the star isbalanced by the hugely amplified push of outflowing surface emitted x-rayswherever cyclotron resonance occurs. because of it the neutron star issurrounded by a leaky ``hohlraum'' of hot blackbody radiation with two smallholes, which prevents direct x-ray observation of a heated polar cap of agamma-ray pulsar. weakly spin-modulated radiation from the blanket togetherwith more strongly spin-modulated radiation from the holes through it wouldthen dominate observed low energy (0.1--10 kev) emission. for non-gamma-raypulsars, in which no such accelerators with their accompanying extremerelativistic backflow toward the star are ...

astro-ph;9801173	optical identification of the hardest x-ray source in the asca large sky  survey	we report the optical identification of the hardest x-ray source (axj131501+3141) detected in an unbiased wide-area survey in the 0.5--10 kev band,the asca large sky survey. the x-ray spectrum of the source is very hard and iswell reproduced by a power-law component (gamma = 1.5^+0.7_-0.6) with n_h =6^+4_-2 *10^22 cm^-2 (sakano et al. 1998). we have found a galaxy with r=15.62mag near the center of the error circle for the x-ray source. the opticalspectrum of the galaxy shows only narrow emission lines whose ratios correspondto those of a type 2 seyfert galaxy at z = 0.072, implying anabsorption-corrected x-ray luminosity of 2*10^43 erg sec^-1 (2--10 kev) and m_b= -20.93 mag. a radio point source is also associated with the center of thegalaxy. we thus identify the x-ray source with this galaxy as an obscured agn.the hidden nature of the nucleus of the galaxy in the optical band isconsistent with the x-ray spectrum. these results support the idea that theobscured agns/qsos contribute significantly to the cosmic x-ray background inthe hard band at the faint flux level.

astro-ph;9809174	euve j0425.6-5714: a newly discovered am herculis star	we detected a new am her star serendipitously in a 25 day observation withthe euve satellite. a coherent period of 85.82 min is present in the euve deepsurvey imager light curve of this source. a spectroscopic identification ismade with a 19th magnitude blue star that has h and he emission lines, andbroad cyclotron humps typical of a magnetic cataclysmic variable. a lower limitto the polar magnetic field of 46 mg is estimated from the spacing of thecyclotron harmonics. euve j0425.6-5714 is also detected in archival rosat hriobservations spanning two months, and its stable and highly structured lightcurve permits us to fit a coherent ephemeris linking the rosat and euve dataover a 1.3 yr gap. the derived period is 85.82107 +/- 0.00020 min, and theephemeris should be accurate to 0.1 cycles until the year 2005. a narrow butpartial x-ray eclipse suggests that this object belongs to the group of am herstars whose viewing geometry is such that the accretion stream periodicallyoccults the soft x-ray emitting accretion spot on the surface of the whitedwarf. a non-detection of hard x-rays from asca observations that arecontemporaneous with the rosat hri shows that the soft x-rays must dominate byat least an order of magnitude, which is consistent with a known trend among amher stars with large magnetic field. this object should not be confused withthe seyfert galaxy 1h 0419-577 (= lb 1727), another x-ray/euv source which liesonly 4' away, and was the principal target of these monitoring observations.
