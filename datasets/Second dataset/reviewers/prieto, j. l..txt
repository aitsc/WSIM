0706.4088	a study of the type ia/iin supernova 2005gj from x-ray to the infrared:  paper i	we present extensive ugrizyhjk photometry and optical spectroscopy of sn2005gj obtained by the sdss-ii and csp supernova projects, which give excellentcoverage during the first 150 days after the time of explosion. these data showthat sn 2005gj is the second clear case, after sn 2002ic, of a thermonuclearexplosion in a dense circumstellar environment. both the presence of singly anddoubly ionized iron-peak elements (feiii and weak sii, siii) near maximum lightas well as the spectral evolution show that sn 2002ic-like events are type iaexplosions. independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosityof sn 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium isstronger than in sn 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the balmeremission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higherclose to maximum light. the velocity evolution of the halpha components suggestthat the csm around sn 2005gj is clumpy and it has a flatter densitydistribution compared with the steady wind solution, in agreement with sn2002ic. an early x-ray observation with chandra gives an upper-limit on themass loss rate from the companion of &lt; 2x10^{-4} msun/yr.

0908.1990	discovery of the extremely energetic supernova 2008fz	we report on the discovery and initial observations of the energetic type iinsupernova (sn), 2008fz. the optical energy emitted by sn 2008fz (based on thelight curve over a 88 day period), is possibly the most ever observed for asupernova (1.4 x 10^51 erg). the event was more luminous than the type iin sn2006gy, but exhibited same smooth, slowly evolving light curve. as ischaracteristic of type iin sn, the early spectra of 2008fz initially exhibitednarrow balmer lines which were replaced by a broader component at later times.the spectra also show a blue continuum with no signs of ca or na absorption,suggesting that there is little extinction due to intragalatic dust in the hostor circumstellar material. no host galaxy is identified in prior coadded imagesreaching r ~ 22. from the supernova's redshift, z=0.133, we place an upperlimit on the host of m_r=-17. the presence of the sn within such a faint hostfollows the majority of recently discovered highly luminous sn. a possiblereason for this occurrence is the very high star formation rate occurring inlow-mass galaxies in combination with the low metallicity environment, whichmakes the production of very massive stars possible. we determine the peakabsolute magnitude of the event to be m_v = -22.3 from the initial photometryand the redshift distance, placing it among the most luminous supernovaediscovered.

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

1006.4162	sdwfs-mt-1: a self-obscured luminous supernova at z~0.2	we report the discovery of a six-month-long mid-infrared transient,sdwfs-mt-1 (aka sn 2007va), in the spitzer deep, wide-field survey of the noaodeep wide-field survey bootes field. the transient, located in a z=0.19 lowluminosity (m_[4.5]~-18.6 mag, l/l_milkyway~0.01) metal-poor (12+log(o/h)~7.8)irregular galaxy, peaked at a mid-infrared absolute magnitude of m_[4.5]~-24.2in the 4.5 micron spitzer/irac band and emitted a total energy of at least10^51 ergs. the optical emission was likely fainter than the mid-infrared,although our constraints on the optical emission are poor because the transientpeaked when the source was "behind" the sun. the spitzer data are consistentwith emission by a modified black body with a temperature of ~1350 k. we ruleout a number of scenarios for the origin of the transient such as a galacticstar, agn activity, grb, tidal disruption of a star by a black hole andgravitational lensing. the most plausible scenario is a supernova explodinginside a massive, optically thick circumstellar medium, composed of multipleshells of previously ejected material. if the proposed scenario is correct,then a significant fraction (~10%) of the most luminous supernova may beself-enshrouded by dust not only before but also after the supernova occurs.the spectral energy distribution of the progenitor of such a supernova would bea slightly cooler version of eta carina, peaking at 20-30 microns.

1007.0011	the sn 2008s progenitor star: gone or again self-obscured?	we obtained late-time optical and near-ir imaging of sn 2008s with the largebinocular telescope (lbt). we find that (1) it is again invisible at optical(ubvr) wavelengths to magnitude limits of approximately 25 mag, and (2) whiledetected in the near-ir (hk) at approximately 20 mag, it is fading rapidly. thenear-ir detections in march and may 2010 are consistent with dust emission at ablackbody temperature of t ~ 900 k and a total luminosity of l ~ 40000 lsun,comparable to the luminosity of the obscured progenitor star. if it is asupernova, the near-ir emission is likely due to shock heated dust since theelapsed time from peak is too long to support a near-ir dust echo and thedecline in luminosity is shallower than the 56co slope. if it is reprocessedemission from a surviving progenitor, a dust photosphere must havereestablished itself closer to the star than before the transient (~40 aurather than 150 au), unless there is a second, cooler dust component thatdominates at mid-ir wavelengths. the continued rapid fading at roughly constanttemperature favors transient emission, but the sed peaks in the mid-ir andfuture spitzer observations will be needed to close the case.

0712.2239	go long, go deep: finding optical jet breaks for swift-era grbs with the  lbt	using the 8.4m large binocular telescope, we observed six grb afterglows from2.8 hours to 30.8 days after the burst triggers to systematically probe thelate time behaviors of afterglows including jet breaks, flares, and supernovabumps. we detected five afterglows with sloan r' magnitudes ranging from23.0-26.3 mag. the depth of our observations allows us to extend the temporalbaseline for measuring jet breaks by another decade in time scale. we detectedtwo jet breaks and a third candidate, all of which are not detectable withoutdeep, late time optical observations. in the other three cases, we do notdetect the jet breaks either because of contamination from the host galaxylight, the presence of a supernova bump, or the intrinsic faintness of theoptical afterglow.  this suggests that the basic picture that grbs are collimated is still validand that the apparent lack of swift jet breaks is due to poorly sampledafterglow light curves, particularly at late times.

0801.3297	a measurement of the rate of type-ia supernovae at redshift $z\approx$  0.1 from the first season of the sdss-ii supernova survey	we present a measurement of the rate of type ia supernovae (sne ia) from thefirst of three seasons of data from the sdss-ii supernova survey. for thismeasurement, we include 17 sne ia at redshift $z\le0.12$. assuming a flatcosmology with $\omega_m = 0.3=1-\omega_\lambda$, we find a volumetric sn iarate of $[2.93^{+0.17}_{-0.04}({\rm systematic})^{+0.90}_{-0.71}({\rmstatistical})] \times 10^{-5} {\rm sne} {\rm mpc}^{-3} h_{70}^3 {\rmyear}^{-1}$, at a volume-weighted mean redshift of 0.09. this result isconsistent with previous measurements of the sn ia rate in a similar redshiftrange. the systematic errors are well controlled, resulting in the most precisemeasurement of the sn ia rate in this redshift range. we use a maximumlikelihood method to fit sn rate models to the sdss-ii supernova survey data incombination with other rate measurements, thereby constraining models for theredshift-evolution of the sn ia rate. fitting the combined data to a simplepower-law evolution of the volumetric sn ia rate, $r_v \propto (1+z)^{\beta}$,we obtain a value of $\beta = 1.5 \pm 0.6$, i.e. the sn ia rate is determinedto be an increasing function of redshift at the $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ level.fitting the results to a model in which the volumetric sn rate,$r_v=a\rho(t)+b\dot \rho(t)$, where $\rho(t)$ is the stellar mass density and$\dot \rho(t)$ is the star formation rate, we find $a = (2.8 \pm 1.2) \times10^{-14} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1} \mathrm{year}^{-1}$, $b =(9.3^{+3.4}_{-3.1})\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1}$.

1309.6320	identification of red supergiants in nearby galaxies with mid-ir  photometry	the role of episodic mass loss in massive star evolution is one of the mostimportant open questions of current stellar evolution theory. episodic massloss produces dust and therefore causes evolved massive stars to be veryluminous in the mid-infrared and dim at optical wavelengths. we aim to increasethe number of investigated luminous mid-ir sources to shed light on the latestages of these objects. to achieve this we employed mid-ir selection criteriato identity dusty evolved massive stars in two nearby galaxies. the method isbased on mid-ir colors, using 3.6 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m photometry fromarchival spitzer space telescope images of nearby galaxies and j-bandphotometry from 2mass. we applied our criteria to two nearby star-forming dwarfirregular galaxies, sextans a and ic 1613, selecting eight targets, which wefollowed up with spectroscopy. our spectral classification and analysis yieldedthe discovery of two m-type supergiants in ic 1613, three k-type supergiantsand one candidate f-type giant in sextans a, and two foreground m giants. weshow that the proposed criteria provide an independent way for identifyingdusty evolved massive stars, that can be extended to all nearby galaxies withavailable spitzer/irac images at 3.6 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m.

0802.0456	a survey about nothing: monitoring a million supergiants for failed  supernovae	extragalactic transient searches have historically been limited to lookingfor the appearance of new sources such as supernovae. it is now possible tocarry out a new kind of survey that will do the opposite, that is, search forthe disappearance of massive stars. this will entail the systematic observationof galaxies within a distance of 10 mpc in order to watch ~10^6 supergiants.reaching this critical number ensures that something will occur yearly, sincethese massive stars must end their lives with a core collapse within ~10^6years. using deep imaging and image subtraction it is possible to determine thefates of these stars whether they end with a bang (supernova) or a whimper(fall out of sight). such a survey would place completely new limits on thetotal rate of all core collapses, which is critical for determining thevalidity of supernova models. it would also determine the properties ofsupernova progenitors, better characterize poorly understood opticaltransients, such as eta carina-like mass ejections, find and characterize largenumbers of cepheids, luminous blue variables and eclipsing binaries, and allowthe discovery of any new phenomena that inhabit this relatively unexploredparameter space.

1311.6610	vortex pinning vs superconducting wire network: origin of periodic  oscillations induced by applied magnetic fields in superconducting films with  arrays of nanomagnets	hybrid magnetic arrays embedded in superconducting films are ideal systems tostudy the competition between different physical (such as the coherence length)and structural length scales such as available in artificially producedstructures. this interplay leads to oscillation in many magnetically dependentsuperconducting properties such as the critical currents, resistivity andmagnetization. these effects are generally analyzed using two distinct modelsbased on vortex pinning or wire network. in this work, we show that formagnetic dot arrays, as opposed to antidot (i.e holes) arrays, vortex pinningis the main mechanism for field induced oscillations in resistance r(h),critical current ic(h), magnetization m(h) and ac-susceptibility xac(h) in abroad temperature range. due to the coherence length divergence at tc, acrossover to wire network behavior is experimentally found. while pinningoccurs in a wide temperature range up to tc, wire network behavior is onlypresent in a very narrow temperature window close to tc. in this temperatureinterval, contributions from both mechanisms are operational but can beexperimentally distinguished.

(2012). by obtaining images and spectra at the same light echo positionbetween 2011 and 2014, we follow the evolution of the great eruption on athree-year timescale. we find remarkable changes in the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of the echo light. the $i$-band light curve shows adecline of $\sim 0.9$ mag in $\sim 1$ year after the peak observed in early2011 and a flattening at later times. the spectra show a pure-absorption earlyg-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the[ca ii] triplet develop strong p-cygni profiles and we see the appearance of[ca ii] 7291,7324 doublet in emission. these emission features and theirevolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some type iinsupernovae and supernova impostors. most surprisingly, starting $\sim 300$ daysafter peak brightness, the spectra show strong molecular transitions of cn at$\gtrsim 6800$ \aa. the appearance of these cn features can be explained if theejecta are strongly nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modernspectroscopic studies of the bipolar homunculus nebula. given the spectroscopicevolution of the light echo, velocities of the main features, and detection ofstrong cn, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to thehomunculus nebula.

astro-ph;0411357	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first two years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations of targets discoveredduring the first two years of the essence project. the goal of essence is touse a sample of ~200 type ia supernovae (sne ia) at moderate redshifts (0.2 &lt; z&lt; 0.8) to place constraints on the equation of state of the universe.spectroscopy not only provides the redshifts of the objects, but also confirmsthat some of the discoveries are indeed sne ia. this confirmation is criticalto the project, as techniques developed to determine luminosity distances tosne ia depend upon the knowledge that the objects at high redshift are the sameas the ones at low redshift. we describe the methods of target selection andprioritization, the telescopes and detectors, and the software used to identifyobjects. the redshifts deduced from spectral matching of high-redshift sne iawith low-redshift sne ia are consistent with those determined from host-galaxyspectra. we show that the high-redshift sne ia match well with low-redshifttemplates. we include all spectra obtained by the essence project, including 52sne ia, 5 core-collapse sne, 12 active galactic nuclei, 19 galaxies, 4 possiblyvariable stars, and 16 objects with uncertain identifications.

astro-ph;0510738	echoes from ancient supernovae in the large magellanic cloud	in principle, the light from historical supernovae could still be visible asscattered-light echoes even centuries later. however, while echoes have beendiscovered around some nearby extragalactic supernovae well after theexplosion, targeted searches have not recovered any echoes in the regions ofhistorical galactic supernovae. the discovery of echoes can allow us topinpoint the supernova event both in position and age and, most importantly,allow us to acquire spectra of the echo light to type the supernova centuriesafter the direct light from the explosion first reached the earth. here wereport on the discovery of three faint new variable surface brightnesscomplexes with high apparent proper motion pointing back to well-definedpositions in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). these positions correspond tothree of the six smallest (and likely youngest) previously catalogued supernovaremnants, and are believed to be due to thermonuclear (type ia) supernovae.using the distance and proper motions of these echo arcs, we estimate ages of610 and 410 yr for the echoes #2 and #3.

astro-ph;0602495	"anomalous" optical grb afterglows are common: two z~4 bursts, grb  060206 and 060210	we report on two recent z~4 gamma-ray bursts (grbs), grb 060206 and grb060210, for which we have obtained well-sampled optical light curves. our data,combined with early optical data reported in the literature, shows unusualbehavior for both afterglows. in r-band grb 060206 (z=4.045) experienced a slowearly decay, followed by a rapid increase in brightness by factor ~2.5 about 1hour after the burst. its afterglow then faded in a broken power-law fashion,with a smooth break at t_b=0.6 days, but with additional, less dramatic (~10%)``bumps and wiggles'', well detected in the densely sampled light curve. ther-band afterglow of grb 060210 (z=3.91) is also unusual: the light curves wasmore or less flat between 60 and 300 sec after the burst, followed by ~70%increase at ~600 sec after the burst, after which the light curve declined as at^{-1.3} power-law. despite earlier reports to the contrary, we find that forgrb 060206 x-rays also more or less follow the optical decay, but withsignificant variations on short timescales. however, the x-ray afterglow iscontaminated by a nearby, variable source, which especially at late timesobscures the behavior of the x-ray afterglow. we argue that ``anomalous''optical afterglows are likely to be the norm, and that the rapid variationsoften seen in swift-xrt data would also be seen in the optical light curves,given good enough sampling. as a result, some of the often employed procedures,such as deriving the jet opening angle using a smooth broken power-law fit tothe optical light curves, in many cases might have a poor statisticalsignificance. we argue that the early increase in brighness for both burstsmight be due to the turn-on of the external shock. existence of such featurescould provide valuable additional information about the burst.
