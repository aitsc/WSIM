0901.3853	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: constraints on stellar evolution  from the chemical compositions of rapidly rotating galactic and magellanic  cloud b-type stars	we have previously analysed the spectra of 135 early b-type stars in the lmcand found several groups of stars that have chemical compositions that conflictwith the theory of rotational mixing. here we extend this study to galactic andsmc metallicities with the analysis of ~50 galactic and ~100 smc early b-typestars with rotational velocities up to ~300km/s. the surface nitrogenabundances are utilised as a probe of the mixing process.  in the smc, we find a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich starsamongst the early b type core-hydrogen burning stars, similar to the lmc. inthe galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the corehydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectationfrom both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. however, onlya small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce asignificant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enrichedrapid rotators previously found in the lmc sample. finally, in each metallicityregime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is observed, which cannotbe the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning stars. their abundancesare, however, compatible with them having gone through a previous redsupergiant phase. together, these observations paint a complex picture of thenitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant stellaratmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. whether rotationalmixing is required to understand our results remains an open question at thistime, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction in thosegroups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models(abridged).

0902.3092	radiative transfer in very optically thick circumstellar disks	in this paper we present two efficient implementations of the diffusionapproximation to be employed in monte carlo computations of radiative transferin dusty media of massive circumstellar disks. the aim is to improve theaccuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computationtime. the accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in variouscorners of parameter space are investigated. the effects of using these methodson the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained fromhydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. two methods arepresented. first, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve theaccuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,where photon counts are low. second, a modified random walk approximation isemployed to decrease the computation time. this modified random walk ensuresthat the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape tothe lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in thedisk is still computed accurately. a new radiative transfer code, mcmax, ispresented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. thesecan be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decreasestatistical noise. we conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fastand accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structureand observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.

0704.1113	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: wind properties and evolution of  hot massive stars in the lmc	[abridged] we have studied the optical spectra of 28 o- and early b-typestars in the large magellanic cloud, 22 of which are associated with the youngstar-forming region n11. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code fastwind with thegenetic-algorithm optimisation routine pikaia. results for stars in the lh9 andlh10 associations of n11 are consistent with a sequential star formationscenario, in which activity in lh9 triggered the formation of lh10. our samplecontains four stars of spectral type o2, of which the hottest is found to be~49-54 kk (cf. ~45-46 kk for o3 stars). the masses of helium-enriched dwarfsand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotatingevolutionary tracks. we interpret this as evidence for efficientrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and toan increase of the stellar luminosity. this result is consistent with findingsfor smc stars by mokiem et al. for bright giants and supergiants no suchmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly(or non-)rotating objects. stellar mass-loss properties were found to beintermediate to those found in massive stars in the galaxy and the smc, andcomparisons with theoretical predictions at lmc metallicity yielded goodagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 &lt; log l/l(sun) &lt;6.1.

0903.2049	sub-surface convection zones in hot massive stars and their observable  consequences	we study the convection zones in the outer envelope of hot massive starswhich are caused by opacity peaks associated with iron and helium ionization.we determine the occurrence and properties of these convection zones asfunction of the stellar parameters. we then confront our results withobservations of ob stars. a stellar evolution code is used to compute a grid ofmassive star models at different metallicities. in these models, the mixinglength theory is used to characterize the envelope convection zones. we findthe iron convection zone (fecz) to be more prominent for lower surface gravity,higher luminosity and higher initial metallicity. it is absent for luminositiesbelow about $10^{3.2}\lsun$, $10^{3.9}\lsun$, and $10^{4.2}$\lsun$ for thegalaxy, lmc and smc, respectively. we map the strength of the fecz on thehertzsprung-russell diagram for three metallicities, and compare this with theoccurrence of observational phenomena in o stars: microturbulence, non-radialpulsations, wind clumping, and line profile variability. the confirmation ofall three trends for the fecz as function of stellar parameters by empiricalmicroturbulent velocities argues for a physical connection betweensub-photospheric convective motions and small scale stochastic velocities inthe photosphere of o- and b-type stars. we further suggest that clumping in theinner parts of the winds of ob stars could be caused by the same mechanism, andthat magnetic fields produced in the fecz could appear at the surface of obstars as diagnosed by discrete absorption components in ultraviolet absorptionlines.

(b) an externaltriggering is responsible for the star-formation propagating from south tonorth. [abridged]

0708.2042	the empirical metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate of o- and  early b-type stars	[abridged] we present a comprehensive study of the metallicity dependence ofthe mass-loss rates in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars. assuminga power-law dependence of mass loss on metallicity, mdot \propto z^{m}, andadopting a theoretical relation between the terminal velocity and metallicity,v_inf \propto z^{0.13} (leitherer et al.), we find m = 0.83 +/- 0.16 fornon-clumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation(wlr) for stars more luminous than 10^{5.2} lsun. within the errors, thisresult agrees with the prediction of m = 0.69 +/- 0.10 from vink et al. for thehigh luminosity stars we find the mass loss rates to be greater than thepredictions, implying wind clumping factors in their line-forming regions of~4. for lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengthscannot be reliably derived from optical lines, and one must rely on analysis ofuv lines. in the low-luminosity domain the galactic wlr is found to be muchsteeper than expected from theory, leading to a discrepancy between uvmass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of l ~10^{4.75} lsun, the origin of which is unknown. we emphasize that even if thecurrent mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars are overestimated as a result ofwind clumping, the degree of clumping would likely to be independent ofmetallicity, so the scalings derived in this study are expected to remaincorrect.

1007.0905	polarisation observations of vy canis majoris water vapour 5{32}-4{41}  620.701 ghz maser emission with hifi	context: water vapour maser emission from evolved oxygen-rich stars remainspoorly understood. additional observations, including polarisation studies andsimultaneous observation of different maser transitions may ultimately lead togreater insight. aims: we have aimed to elucidate the nature and structure ofthe vy cma water vapour masers in part by observationally testing a theoreticalprediction of the relative strengths of the 620.701 ghz and the 22.235 ghzmaser components of ortho water vapour. methods: in its high-resolution mode(hrs) the herschel heterodyne instrument for the infrared (hifi) offers afrequency resolution of 0.125 mhz, corresponding to a line-of-sight velocity of0.06 km/s, which we employed to obtain the strength and linear polarisation ofmaser spikes in the spectrum of vy cma at 620.701 ghz. simultaneous groundbased observations of the 22.235 ghz maser with the max-planck-institut f\"urradioastronomie 100-meter telescope at effelsberg, provided a ratio of 620.701ghz to 22.235 ghz emission. results:we report the first astronomical detectionto date of water vapour maser emission at 620.701 ghz. in vy cma both the620.701 and the 22.235 ghz polarisation are weak. at 620.701 ghz the maserpeaks are superposed on what appears to be a broad emission component, jointlyejected asymmetrically from the star. we observed the 620.701 ghz emission attwo epochs 21 days apart, both to measure the potential direction of linearlypolarised maser components and to obtain a measure of the longevity of thesecomponents. although we do not detect significant polarisation levels in thecore of the line, they rise up to approximately 6% in its wings.

1007.1235	discovery of water vapour in the carbon star v cygni from observations  with herschel/hifi	we report the discovery of water vapour toward the carbon star v cygni. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the1(11) - 0(00) para-water transition at 1113.3430 ghz in the upper sideband ofthe band 4b receiver. the observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,but with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and theintegrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \pm 0.17 k km/s. this detection ofthermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of waterin carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-richagb star, the first having been obtained by the submillimeter wave astronomysatellite toward irc+10216. for an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,the observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) e-5 earthmasses per year and a water abundance relative to h2 of ~ (2-5) e-6. this valueis a factor of at least 1e+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance ina carbon-rich environment, and - as in irc+10216 - raises the intriguingpossibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation oforbiting comets or dwarf planets. however, observations of the single lineobserved to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatialdistribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations ofadditional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of theh2o-emitting zone, and the h2o ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to placeimportant constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.

1008.1083	probing the mass-loss history of agb and red supergiant stars from co  rotational line profiles - ii. co line survey of evolved stars: derivation of  mass-loss rate formulae	we aim to (1) set up simple and general analytical expressions to estimatemass-loss rates of evolved stars, and (2) from those calculate estimates forthe mass-loss rates of asymptotic giant branch (agb), red supergiant (rsg), andyellow hypergiant stars in our galactic sample. rotationally excited lines ofco are a very robust diagnostic in the study of circumstellar envelopes (cses).when sampling different layers of the cse, observations of these molecularlines lead to detailed profiles of kinetic temperature, expansion velocity, anddensity. a state-of-the-art, nonlocal thermal equilibrium, and co-moving frameradiative transfer code that predicts co line intensities in the cses oflate-type stars is used in deriving relations between stellar andmolecular-line parameters, on the one hand, and mass-loss rate, on the other.we present analytical expressions for estimating the mass-loss rates of evolvedstellar objects for 8 rotational transitions of the co molecule, apply them toour extensive co data set covering 47 stars, and compare our results to thoseof previous studies. our expressions account for line saturation and resolvingof the envelope, thereby allowing accurate determination of very high mass-lossrates. we argue that, for estimates based on a single rotational line, theco(2-1) transition provides the most reliable mass-loss rate. the mass-lossrates calculated for the agb stars range from 4x10^-8 msun/yr up to 8x10^-5msun/yr. for rsgs they reach values between 2x10^-7 msun/yr and 3x10^-4msun/yr. the estimates for the set of co transitions allow time variability tobe identified in the mass-loss rate. possible mass-loss-rate variability istraced for 7 of the sample stars. we find a clear relation between thepulsation periods of the agb stars and their derived mass-loss rates, with alevelling off at approx. 3x10^-5 msun/yr for periods exceeding 850 days.

1105.0556	wind modelling of very massive stars up to 300 solar masses	some studies have claimed a universal stellar upper-mass limit of 150 msun. afactor that is often overlooked is that there might be a difference between thecurrent and initial masses of the most massive stars, as a result of mass loss.we present monte carlo mass-loss predictions for very massive stars in therange 40-300 msun, with large luminosities and eddington factors gamma. usingour new dynamical approach, we find an upturn in the mass-loss vs. gammadependence, at the point where the winds become optically thick. this coincideswith the location where wind efficiency numbers surpass the single-scatteringlimit of eta = 1, reaching values up to eta = 2.5. our modelling suggests atransition from common o-type winds to wolf-rayet characteristics at the pointwhere the winds become optically thick. this transitional behaviour is alsorevealed with respect to the wind acceleration parameter beta, which starts atvalues below 1 for the optically thin o-stars, and naturally reaches values ashigh as 1.5-2 for the optically thick wolf-rayet models. an additional findingconcerns the transition in spectral morphology of the of and wn characteristiche ii line at 4686 angstrom. when we express our mass-loss predictions as afunction of the electron scattering gamma_e (=l/m) only, we obtain a mass-lossgamma dependence that is consistent with a previously reported power-law mdotpropto gamma^5 (vink 2006) that was based on our semi-empirical modellingapproach. when we express mdot in terms of both gamma and stellar mass, we findmdot propto m^0.8 gamma^4.8 for our high gamma models. finally, we confirm thatthe gamma-effect on the mass-loss predictions is much stronger than that of anincreased helium abundance, calling for a fundamental revision in the way massloss is incorporated in evolutionary models of the most massive stars.

1105.1775	the vlt-flames tarantula survey iii: a very massive star in apparent  isolation from the massive cluster r136	vfts 682 is located in an active star-forming region, at a projected distanceof 29 pc from the young massive cluster r136 in the tarantula nebula of thelarge magellanic cloud. it was previously reported as a candidate young stellarobject, and more recently spectroscopically revealed as a hydrogen-richwolf-rayet (wn5h) star. our aim is to obtain the stellar properties, such asits intrinsic luminosity, and to investigate the origin of vfts 682. to thispurpose, we model optical spectra from the vlt-flames tarantula survey with thenon-lte stellar atmosphere code cmfgen, as well as the spectral energydistribution from complementary optical and infrared photometry. we find theextinction properties to be highly peculiar (rv ~4.7), and obtain asurprisingly high luminosity log(l/lsun) = 6.5 \pm 0.2, corresponding to apresent-day mass of ~150msun. the high effective temperature of 52.2 \pm 2.5kkmight be explained by chemically homogeneous evolution - suggested to be thekey process in the path towards long gamma-ray bursts. lightcurves of theobject show variability at the 10% level on a timescale of years. such changesare unprecedented for classical wolf-rayet stars, and are more reminiscent ofluminous blue variables. finally, we discuss two possibilities for the originof vfts 682: (i) the star either formed in situ, which would have profoundimplications for the formation mechanism of massive stars, or (ii) vfts 682 isa slow runaway star that originated from the dense cluster r136, which wouldmake it the most massive runaway known to date.

1106.5361	the eddington factor as the key to understand the winds of the most  massive stars. evidence for a gamma-dependence of wolf-rayet type mass loss	the most massive stars are thought to be hydrogen-rich wolf-rayet stars oflate spectral subtype (wnh stars). in previous theoretical studies the enhancedmass loss of these stars has been attributed to their proximity to theeddington limit. here we investigate observed trends in the mass-lossproperties of such young, very massive stars. we derive theoreticalmass-luminosity relations for very massive stars, based on a large grid ofstellar structure models. using these relations, we estimate eddington factorsfor a sample of stars, under different assumptions of their evolutionarystatus. we evaluate the resulting mass-loss relations, and compare them withtheoretical predictions. we find observational evidence that the mass loss inthe wr regime is dominated by the eddington parameter gamma_e, which hasimportant consequences for the way we understand wolf-rayet stars and theirmass loss. in addition, we derive wind masses that support the picture that thewnh stars in young stellar clusters are very massive, hydrogen-burning stars.our findings suggest that the proximity to the eddington limit is the physicalreason for the onset of wolf-rayet type mass loss. this means that, e.g. instellar evolution models, the wolf-rayet stage should be identified by largeeddington parameters, instead of a helium-enriched surface composition. thelatter is most likely only a consequence of strong mass loss, in combinationwith internal mixing. for very massive stars, the enhanced gamma-dependent massloss is responsible for the formation of late wnh subtypes with high hydrogensurface abundances, partly close to solar. because mass loss dominates theevolution of very massive stars, we expect a strong impact of this effect ontheir end products, in particular on the potential formation of black holes,and gamma-ray bursts, as well as the observed upper mass limit of stars.

1109.5502	on the mass-loss rates of massive stars in the low-metallicity galaxies  ic 1613, wlm and ngc 3109	we present a spectroscopic analysis of vlt/x-shooter observations of sixo-type stars in the low-metallicity (z ~ 1/7 z\odot) galaxies ic 1613, wlm andngc 3109. the stellar and wind parameters of these sources allow us, for thefirst time, to probe the mass-loss versus metallicity dependence of stellarwinds below that of the small magellanic cloud (at z ~ 1/5z\odot) by means of amodified wind momentum versus luminosity diagram. the wind strengths that weobtain for the objects in wlm and ngc 3109 are unexpectedly high and do notagree with theoretical predictions. the objects in ic 1613 tend towards ahigher than expected mass-loss rate, but remain consistent with predictionswithin their error bars. we discuss potential systematic uncertainties in themass-loss determinations to explain our results. however, if furtherscrutinization of these findings point towards an intrinsic cause for thisunexpected sub-smc mass-loss behavior, implications would include a higher thananticipated number of wolf-rayet stars and ib/ic supernovae in low-metallicityenvironments, but a reduced number of long-duration gamma-ray bursts producedthrough a single-star evolutionary channel.

1112.0944	predictions for mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of massive  o-type stars	mass loss forms an important aspect of the evolution of massive stars, aswell as for the enrichment of the surrounding ism. our goal is to predictaccurate mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities. these quantities can becompared to empirical values, thereby testing radiation-driven wind models. onespecific issue is that of the "weak-wind problem", where empirically derivedmass-loss rates fall orders of magnitude short of predicted values. we employan established monte carlo model and a recently suggested new line accelerationformalism to solve the wind dynamics consistently. we provide a new grid ofmass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of o stars, and compare the valuesto empirical results. our models fail to provide mass-loss rates formain-sequence stars below a luminosity of log(l/lsun) = 5.2, where we run intoa fundamental limit. at luminosities below this critical value there isinsufficient momentum transferred in the region below the sonic point tokick-start the acceleration. this problem occurs at the location of the onsetof the weak-wind problem. for o dwarfs, the boundary between being able tostart a wind, and failing to do so, is at spectral type o6/o6.5. the directcause of this failure is a combination of the lower luminosity and a lack of fev lines at the wind base. this might indicate that another mechanism isrequired to provide the necessary driving to initiate the wind. for stars moreluminous than log(l/lsun) = 5.2, our new mass-loss rates are in excellentagreement with the mass-loss prescription by vink et al. 2000. this impliesthat the main assumption entering the method of the vink et al. prescriptions -i.e. that the momentum equation is not explicitly solved for - does notcompromise the reliability of the vink et al. results for this part ofparameter space (abridged).

0711.2267	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: rotation and nitrogen enrichment  as the key to understanding massive star evolution	rotation has become an important element in evolutionary models of massivestars, specifically via the prediction of rotational mixing. here, we study asample of stars, including rapid rotators, to constrain such models and usenitrogen enrichments as a probe of the mixing process. chemical compositions(c, n, o, mg and si) have been estimated for 135 early b-type stars in thelarge magellanic cloud with projected rotational velocities up to ~300km/susing a non-lte tlusty model atmosphere grid. evolutionary models, includingrotational mixing, have been generated attempting to reproduce theseobservations by adjusting the overshooting and rotational mixing parameters andproduce reasonable agreement with 60% of our core hydrogen burning sample. wefind (excluding known binaries) a significant population of highly nitrogenenriched intrinsic slow rotators vsini less than 50km/s incompatible with ourmodels ~20% of the sample). furthermore, while we find fast rotators withenrichments in agreement with the models, the observation of evolved (log gless than 3.7dex) fast rotators that are relatively unenriched (a further ~20%of the sample) challenges the concept of rotational mixing. we also find that70% of our blue supergiant sample cannot have evolved directly from thehydrogen burning main-sequence. we are left with a picture where invokingbinarity and perhaps fossil magnetic fields are required to understand thesurface properties of a population of massive main sequence stars.

1207.1606	observational evidence for composite grains in an agb outflow: mgs in  the extreme carbon star ll peg	the broad 30 \mu m feature in carbon stars is commonly attributed to mgs dustparticles. however, reproducing the 30 \mu m feature with homogeneous mgsgrains would require much more sulfur relative to the solar abundance. directgas-phase condensation of mgs occurs at a low efficiency. precipitation of mgson sic precursor grains provides a more efficient formation mechanism, suchthat the assumption of homogeneous mgs grains may not be correct. using a montecarlo-based radiative transfer code, we aim to model the 30 \mu m feature ofthe extreme carbon star ll peg with mgs dust particles. we find that for ll pegthis modeling is insensitive to the unknown mgs optical properties at \lambda &lt;10 \mu m. when mgs is allowed to be in thermal contact with amorphous carbonand sic, the amount of mgs required to reproduce the strength of 30 \mu mfeature agrees with the solar abundance of sulfur, thereby resolving thereported mgs mass problem. we conclude that mgs is a valid candidate to be thecarrier of the 30 \mu m feature when it is part of a composite grain populationthat has optical properties representative of an ensemble of particle shapes.

1209.5934	mass-loss predictions for evolved very metal-poor massive stars	(shortened) the first couple of stellar generations may have been massive, oforder 100 msun, and to have played a dominant role in galaxy formation and thechemical enrichment of the early universe. some fraction of these objects mayhave died as pair-instability supernovae or gamma-ray bursts. the winds ifthese stars may have played an important role in determining these outcomes. asthe winds are driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines, their strengthsare expected to vary with metallicity. until now, most mass-loss predictionsfor metal-poor o-type stars have assumed a scaled-down solar-abundance pattern.however, population iii evolutionary tracks show significant surface enrichmentthrough rotational mixing of cno-processed material, because even metal-poorstars switch to cno-burning early on. we address the question of whether thecno surface enhanced self-enrichment in the first few generations of starscould impact their mass-loss properties. for this, we employ monte carlosimulations to establish the local line-force and solve for the momentumequation of the stellar outflow, testing whether an outflow can actually beestablished by assessing the net acceleration at the sonic point of the flow.stellar evolution models of rotating metal-poor stars are used to specify thesurface chemical composition, focussing on the phases of early enrichment. wefind that the mass-loss rates of cno enhanced metal-poor stars are higher thanthose of non-enriched stars, but they are much lower than those rates where thecno abundance is included in the total abundance z. we present a heuristicformula that provides mass-loss estimates for cno-dominated winds in relationto scaled-down solar abundances.

1211.3742	the rotation rates of massive stars: the role of binary interaction  through tides, mass transfer and mergers	rotation is thought to be a major factor in the evolution of massive stars,especially at low metallicity, with consequences for their chemical yields,ionizing flux and final fate. determining the natal rotation-rate distributionof stars is of high priority given its importance as a constraint on theoriesof massive star formation and as input for models of stellar populations in thelocal universe and at high redshift. recently, it has become clear that themajority of massive stars interact with a binary companion before they die. weinvestigate how this affects the distribution of rotation rates.  for this purpose, we simulate a massive binary-star population typical forour galaxy assuming continuous star formation. we find that, because of binaryinteraction, 20^+5_-10% of all massive main-sequence stars have projectedrotational velocities in excess of 200km/s. we evaluate the effect of uncertaininput distributions and physical processes and conclude that the mainuncertainties are the mass transfer efficiency and the possible effect ofmagnetic braking, especially if magnetic fields are generated or amplifiedduring mass accretion and stellar mergers.  the fraction of rapid rotators we derive is similar to that observed. ifindeed mass transfer and mergers are the main cause for rapid rotation inmassive stars, little room remains for rapidly rotating stars that are bornsingle. this implies that spin down during star formation is even moreefficient than previously thought. in addition, this raises questions about theinterpretation of the surface abundances of rapidly rotating stars as evidencefor rotational mixing. furthermore, our results allow for the possibility thatall early-type be stars result from binary interactions and suggest thatevidence for rotation in explosions, such as long gamma-ray bursts, points to abinary origin.

1309.2929	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xii. rotational velocities of the single  o-type stars	aims. using ground based multi-object optical spectroscopy obtained in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we aim to establish the(projected) rotational velocity distribution for a sample of 216 presumablysingle o-type stars in 30 doradus (30 dor).  methods. we measured projected rotational velocities, \vrot, by means of afourier transform method and a profile fitting method applied on a set ofisolated spectral lines. we also used an iterative deconvolution procedure toinfer the probability density, $\rm{p(\veq)}$, of the equatorial rotationalvelocity, \veq.  results. the distribution of \vrot\ shows a two-component structure: a peakaround 80 \kms\ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 \kms. thisstructure is also present in the inferred distribution $\rm{p(\veq)}$ witharound 80% of the sample having 0 $&lt;$ \veq\, $\leq\, 300$ \kms\ and the other20% distributed in the high-velocity region.  conclusions. most of the stars in our sample rotate with a rate less than20%\ of their break-up velocity. for the bulk of the sample, mass-loss in astellar wind and/or envelope expansion is not efficient enough to significantlyspin down these stars within the first few myr of evolution. the presence of asizeable population of fast rotators is compatible with recent populationsynthesis computations that investigate the influence of binary evolution onthe rotation rate of massive stars. despite the fact that we have excludedstars that show significant radial velocity variations, our sample may haveremained contaminated by post-interaction binary products. the fact that thehigh-velocity tail may be preferentially (and perhaps even exclusively),populated by post-binary interaction products, has important implications forthe evolutionary origin of systems that produce gamma-ray bursts.

1310.2849	on the nature of wo stars: a quantitative analysis of the wo3 star dr1  in ic 1613	context. oxygen sequence wolf-rayet (wo) stars are thought to represent thefinal evolutionary stage of the most massive stars. the characteristic strong ovi emission possibly originates from an enhanced oxygen abundance in thestellar wind. alternatively, the o vi emission can be caused by the hightemperature of these stars, in which case the wo stars are the high-temperatureextension of the more common carbon sequence wolf-rayet (wc) stars. aims. byconstraining the physical properties and evolutionary status of dr1, a wo starin the low-metallicity local group dwarf galaxy ic 1613 and one of only twoobjects of its class known in a smc-like metallicity environment, we aim toinvestigate the nature of wo stars and their evolutionary connection with wcstars. methods. we use the non-lte atmosphere code cmfgen to model the observedspectrum of dr1 and to derive its stellar and wind parameters. we compare ourvalues with other studies of wc and wo stars, as well as with the predictionsof evolutionary models. we also model the surrounding nebula using thephoto-ionization code cloudy. results. the oxygen and carbon abundances that weobtain are comparable to values found for wc stars. the temperature andluminosity are, however, higher than those of wc stars. dr1 is embedded in thehottest known h ii region in the local group. the nebular properties can beconsistently reproduced by cloudy models adopting dr1 as central ionizingsource. conclusions. comparison of the abundances and temperature of dr1 withcore helium-burning models show that dr1 is currently well into the second halfof helium burning. if the properties of dr1 are representative for the woclass, it would imply that wo stars are the high-temperature andhigh-luminosity extension of the wc stars, and do not necessarily represent alater evolutionary stage.

(1) several new examples of the earliest spectraltypes o2-o3 have been found. (2) a group of extremely rapidly rotatingmain-sequence objects has been isolated, including the largest $v\sin i$ valuesknown, the spatial and radial-velocity distributions of which suggest ejectionfrom the two principal ionizing clusters. (3) several new examples of theevolved, rapidly rotating onfp class show similar evidence.

(5) asurprisingly large fraction of the main-sequence spectra belong to the recentlyrecognized v((fc)) class, with c iii emission lines of similar strength to theusual n iii in v((f)) spectra; there are also six objects with veryhigh-quality data but no trace of either mission feature, presenting newchallenges to physical interpretations.

1407.1837	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xvii. physical and wind properties of  massive stars at the top of the main sequence	the evolution and fate of very massive stars (vms) is tightly connected totheir mass-loss properties. their initial and final masses differ significantlyas a result of mass loss. vms have strong stellar winds and extremely highionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanicaland radiative feedback in giant hii regions. however, how vms mass-lossproperties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we explore the mass-losstransition region from optically thin o to denser wnh star winds, therebytesting theoretical predictions. to this purpose we select 62 o, of, of/wn, andwnh stars, an unprecedented sample of stars with the highest masses andluminosities known. we perform a spectral analysis of optical vfts as well asnear-infrared vlt/sinfoni data using the non-lte radiative transfer code cmfgento obtain stellar and wind parameters. for the first time, we observationallyresolve the transition between optically thin o and optically thick wnh starwinds. our results suggest the existence of a kink between both mass-lossregimes, in agreement with recent mc simulations. for the optically thickregime, we confirm the steep dependence on the eddington factor from previoustheoretical and observational studies. the transition occurs on the ms near aluminosity of 10^6.1lsun, or a mass of 80...90msun. above this limit, we findthat - even when accounting for moderate wind clumping (with f = 0.1) - windmass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currentlyadopted in stellar evolution calculations. we also show that this results insubstantial helium surface enrichment. based on our spectroscopic analyses, weare able to provide the most accurate ionising fluxes for vms known to date,confirming the pivotal role of vms in ionising and shaping their environments.

1409.0396	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel. ii. the molecular envelope of w  hya	the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass ina stellar wind. understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellarwinds of agb stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products ofnucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining agb evolution and predicting thechemical evolution of galaxies. in a previous paper we have constrained thestructure of the outflowing envelope of w hya using spectral lines of the$^{12}$co molecule. here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set ofh$_{2}$o and $^{28}$sio lines observed by the three instruments on boardherschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfercode. the oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$sio abundance profile can beconnected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formationat the base of the stellar wind, respectively. the modelling of h$_{2}$o and$^{28}$sio confirms the properties of the envelope model of w hya derived from$^{12}$co lines. we find an h$_2$o ortho-to-para ratio of2.5\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an agb wind. theo$^{16}$/o$^{17}$ ratio indicates that w hya has an initial mass of about 1.5m$_\odot$. although the ortho- and para-h$_{2}$o lines observed by hifi appearto trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocityof $0.7\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the hifi lines of both spin isomers and thoseof $^{28}$sio well. the ortho- and para-h$_2^{16}$o and $^{28}$sio abundancesrelative to h$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \times10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. assuming a solarsilicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$sio line emission model is consistent withabout one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.

1409.6304	southern massive stars at high angular resolution: observational  campaign and companion detection	multiplicity is one of the most fundamental observable properties of massiveo-type stars and offers a promising way to discriminate between massive starformation theories. nevertheless, companions at separations between 1 and 100mas remain mostly unknown due to intrinsic observational limitations. [...] thesouthern massive stars at high angular resolution survey (smash+) was designedto fill this gap by providing the first systematic interferometric survey ofgalactic massive stars. we observed 117 o-type stars with vlti/pionier and 162o-type stars with naco/sam, respectively probing the separation ranges 1-45 and30-250mas and brightness contrasts of delta h &lt; 4 and delta h &lt; 5. takingadvantage of naco's field-of-view, we further uniformly searched for visualcompanions in an 8''-radius down to delta h = 8. this paper describes theobservations and data analysis, reports the discovery of almost 200 newcompanions in the separation range from 1mas to 8'' and presents the catalog ofdetections, including the first resolved measurements of over a dozen knownlong-period spectroscopic binaries.  excluding known runaway stars for which no companions are detected, 96objects in our main sample (dec &lt; 0 deg; h&lt;7.5) were observed both with pionierand naco/sam. the fraction of these stars with at least one resolved companionwithin 200mas is 0.53. accounting for known but unresolved spectroscopic oreclipsing companions, the multiplicity fraction at separation &lt; 8'' increasesto f_m = 0.91 +/- 0.03. the fraction of luminosity class v stars that have abound companion reaches 100% at 30mas while their average number of physicallyconnected companions within 8'' is f_c = 2.2 +/- 0.3. this demonstrates thatmassive stars form nearly exclusively in multiple systems. additionally, thenine non-thermal (nt) radio emitters observed by smash+ are all resolved [...]

1501.03794	the evolution of rotating very massive stars with lmc composition	we present a dense model grid with tailored input chemical compositionappropriate for the large magellanic cloud. we use a one-dimensionalhydrodynamic stellar evolution code, which accounts for rotation, transport ofangular momentum by magnetic fields, and stellar wind mass loss to compute ourdetailed models. we calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses of70-500 msun and with initial surface rotational velocities of 0-550 km/s,covering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. we find our rapidrotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium,with quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotatingmodels. above 160 msun, homogeneous evolution is also established through massloss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent ofthe initial rotation rate. surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slowerrotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass.for models above 150 mzams, and for models in the whole considered mass rangelater on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity ofthese models to their eddington limit. this leads to a maximum zero-age mainsequence surface temperature of 56000 k, at 180 msun, and to an evolution ofstars in the mass range 50-100 msun to the regime of luminous blue variables inthe hr diagram with high internal eddington factors. inflation also leads todecreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution ofstars above 180 msun. the cool surface temperatures due to the envelopeinflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars atlmc metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae. thecorresponding spin-down will also prevent very massive lmc stars to producelong-duration gamma-ray bursts, which might, however, originate from lowermasses.

1503.04765	dusty wind of w hya. multi-wavelength modelling of the present-day and  recent mass-loss	low- and intermediate-mass stars go through a period of intense mass-loss atthe end of their lives in a phase known as the asymptotic giant branch (agb).during the agb a significant fraction of their initial mass is expelled in astellar wind. this process controls the final stages of their evolution andcontributes to the chemical evolution of galaxies. however, the wind-drivingmechanism of agb stars is not yet well understood, especially so foroxygen-rich sources. characterizing both the present-day mass-loss and windstructure and the evolution of the mass-loss rate of such stars is paramount toadvancing our understanding of this processes. we modelled the dust envelope ofw hya using an advanced radiative transfer code. the dust model was analysed inthe light of a previously calculated gas-phase wind model and compared tomeasurements available in the literature, such as infrared spectra, infraredimages, and optical scattered light fractions. we find that the dust spectrumof w hya can partly be explained by a gravitationally bound dust shell thatprobably is responsible for most of the amorphous al$_2$o$_3$ emission. thecomposition of the large ($\sim$\,0.3\,$\mu$m) grains needed to explain thescattered light cannot be constrained, but probably is dominated by silicates.silicate emission in the thermal infrared was found to originate from beyond 40au from the star and we find that they need to have substantial near-infraredopacities to be visible at such large distances. the increase in near-infraredopacity of the dust at these distances roughly coincides with a sudden increasein expansion velocity as deduced from the gas-phase co lines. finally, therecent mass loss of w hya is confirmed to be highly variable and we identify astrong peak in the mass-loss rate that occurred about 3500 years ago and lastedfor a few hundred years.

1507.03591	b fields in ob stars (bob): detection of a strong magnetic field in the  o9.7 v star hd54879	the number of magnetic stars detected among massive stars is small;nevertheless, the role played by the magnetic field in stellar evolution cannotbe disregarded. links between line profile variability, enhancements/depletionsof surface chemical abundances, and magnetic fields have been identified forlow-mass b-stars, but for the o-type domain this is almost unexplored. based onfors2 and harps spectropolarimetric data, we present the first detection of amagnetic field in hd54879, a single slowly rotating o9.7 v star. using twoindependent and different techniques we obtained the firm detection of asurface average longitudinal magnetic field with a maximum amplitude of about600 g, in modulus. a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the star with thestellar atmosphere code fastwind results in an effective temperature and asurface gravity of 33000$\pm1000$ k and 4.0$\pm0.1$ dex. the abundances ofcarbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium are found to be slightly lowerthan solar, but compatible within the errors. we investigate line-profilevariability in hd54879 by complementing our spectra with spectroscopic datafrom other recent ob-star surveys. the photospheric lines remain constant inshape between 2009 and 2014, although h$\alpha$ shows a variable emission. theh$\alpha$ emission is too strong for a standard o9.7 v and is probably linkedto the magnetic field and the presence of circumstellar material. its normalchemical composition and the absence of photospheric line profile variationsmake hd54879 the most strongly magnetic, non-variable single o-star detected todate.

1509.08940	discovery of the massive overcontact binary vfts 352: evidence for  enhanced internal mixing	the contact phase expected to precede the coalescence of two massive stars ispoorly characterized due to the paucity of observational constraints. here wereport on the discovery of vfts 352, an o-type binary in the 30 doradus region,as the most massive and earliest spectral type overcontact system known todate. we derived the 3d geometry of the system, its orbital period $p_{\rmorb}=1.1241452(4)$ d, components' effective temperatures -- $t_1=42\,540\pm280$k and $t_2=41\,120\pm290$ k -- and dynamical masses -- $m_1=28.63\pm0.30m_{\odot}$ and $m_2 = 28.85\pm0.30 m_{\odot}$. compared to single-starevolutionary models, the vfts 352 components are too hot for their dynamicalmasses by about 2700 and 1100 k, respectively. these results can be explainednaturally as a result of enhanced mixing, theoretically predicted to occur invery short-period tidally-locked systems. the vfts 352 components are two ofthe best candidates identified so far to undergo this so-called chemicallyhomogeneous evolution. the future of vfts 352 is uncertain. if the two starsmerge, a very rapidly rotating star will be produced. instead, if the starscontinue to evolve homogeneously and keep shrinking within their roche lobes,coalescence can be avoided. in this case, tides may counteract the spin down bywinds such that the vfts 352 components may, at the end of their life, fulfillthe requirements for long gamma-ray burst (grb) progenitors in the collapsarscenario. independently of whether the vfts 352 components become grbprogenitors, this scenario makes vfts 352 interesting as a progenitor of ablack hole binary, hence as a potential gravitational wave source through blackhole-black hole merger.

0806.4038	the infrared emission spectra of compositionally inhomogeneous  aggregates composed of irregularly shaped constituents	in order to deduce properties of dust in astrophysical environments wheredust growth through aggregation is important, knowledge of the way aggregatedparticles interact with radiation, and what information is encoded in thethermal radiation they emit, is needed. the emission characteristics aredetermined by the size and structure of the aggregate and the composition andshape of the constituents. we thus aim at performing computations ofcompositionally inhomogeneous aggregates composed of irregularly shapedconstituents. in addition we aim at developing an empirical recipe to computethe optical properties of such aggregates in a fast and accurate manner. weperformed cda computations for aggregates of irregularly shaped particles withvarious compositions. the constituents of the aggregate are assumed to be inthe rayleigh regime, and in addition we assume that the dominant interaction ofthe aggregate constituents is through dipole-dipole interactions. we computedthe spectral structure of the emission efficiency in the 10 micron region foraggregates with 30% amorphous carbon and 70% silicates by volume with variousfractions of crystalline and amorphous components. we find that the spectralappearance of the various components of the aggregate are very different anddepend on their abundances. most notably, materials that have a very lowabundance appear spectroscopically as if they were in very small grains, whilemore abundant materials appear, spectroscopically to reside in larger grains.we construct a fast empirical approximate method, based on the idea of aneffective medium approximation, to construct the spectra for these aggregateswhich almost perfectly reproduces the more exact computations. this new methodis fast enough to be easily implemented in fitting procedures.

astro-ph;0004081	the gamma velorum binary system. ii. wr stellar parameters and the  photon loss mechanism	in this paper we derive stellar parameters for the wolf-rayet star in thegamma velorum binary system (wr11), from a detailed non-lte model of itsoptical and infrared spectra. compared to the study of schaerer et al., theparameters of the wc8 star are revised to a hotter effective temperature(teff~57kk),a higher luminosity (log(l/lsun = 5.00), and a lower mass loss rate(log(mdot / msun/yr) = -5.0 - using a 10% clumping filling factor). thesechanges lead to a significant decrease in wind efficiency number, from 144 to7, so that the driving mechanism of the wind of this wr star may be simplyradiation pressure on lines. the derived spectroscopic luminosity is found tobe 40% lower than that derived by de marco &amp; schmutz through themass-luminosity relationship for wr stars (log(l/lsun = 5.2). the paperfurthermore presents a comparison of the independently-developed modellingprograms, cmfgen and isa-wind . overall, there seems to be very reasonableagreement between the derived parameters for wr11, except for the carboncontent, which is 2 times higher for cmfgen (c/he=0.15 vs. 0.06, by number).thecomparison also confirms a disparity in the predicted flux at lambda&lt;$400a,found by crowther et al., which will have effects on several nebular linestrengths.  the paper also presents the first independent check of the photon lossmechanism proposed by schmutz. we conclude that, not only is it important toinclude very many lines to realistically model line blanketing, but inparticular those ones that critically interact with strong resonance lines(e.g. heii lambda303.78). the inclusion of these latter lines may significantlyalter the wind ionization structure.

astro-ph;0101256	crystallinity versus mass-loss rate in asymptotic giant branch stars	infrared space observatory (iso) observations have shown that o-richasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars exhibit crystalline silicate features intheir spectra only if their mass-loss rate is higher than a certain thresholdvalue. usually, this is interpreted as evidence that crystalline silicates arenot present in the dust shells of low mass-loss rate objects. in this study,radiative transfer calculations have been performed to search for analternative explanation to the lack of crystalline silicate features in thespectrum of low mass-loss rate agb stars. it is shown that due to a temperaturedifference between amorphous and crystalline silicates it is possible toinclude up to 40% of crystalline silicate material in the circumstellar dustshell, without the spectra showing the characteristic spectral features. sincethis implies that low mass-loss rate agb stars might also form crystallinesilicates and deposit them into the interstellar medium (ism), the describedobservational selection effect may put the process of dust formation around agbstars and the composition of the predominantly amorphous dust in theinterstellar medium in a different light. our model calculations result in adiagnostic tool to determine the crystallinity of an agb star with a knownmass-loss rate.

(1998), the infrared spectrum of hd 100546 is very similar tothat of c/1995 o1 hale-bopp (crovisier et al. 1997). using an identicalmethodology, we have therefore also studied this solar system comet. bothobjects have an almost identical grain composition, but with the importantdifference that the individual dust species in hale-bopp are in thermal contactwith each other, while this is not the case in hd 100546. this suggests that ifsimilar processes leading to the dust composition as seen in hd 100546 alsooccurred in our own solar system, that hale-bopp formed after the formation ofone or more proto-gas giants.

astro-ph;0301569	water ice growth around evolved stars	we present a model of the growth of water ice on silicate grains in thecircumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and red supergiants. we consider the growth of ice by gas grain collisions, the thermalevaporation of ice from a grain, and sputtering. our model contains severalimprovements compared to earlier models, including a detailed treatment of theeffects of sputtering, a detailed calculation of the radiation pressure on thegrain, and the treatment of subsonic drift velocities. in terms of driftvelocity between the grains and gas in the envelope, we find that the iceformation process can be divided into three regimes: (i) a sputtering dominatedregime where ice growth is heavily suppressed, (ii) an intermediate regime withmoderately efficient condensation and (iii) a thermally dominated regime whereice formation is highly efficient. sputtering is the critical factor whichdetermines if ice formation can occur at all. we find that in red supergiants,ice formation is suppressed, while the winds of oh/ir stars allow for efficientcondensation and can convert significant fractions of the available water vapor(tens of percent) into ice mantles on grains. population ii agb stars hardlyform ice due to their low dust to gas ratios. we also modify an analyticalequation describing condensation and depletion (jura and morris, 1985) in orderto give reasonable results for high and low drift velocities. initially, icewill condense in crystalline form, but continuing condensation at lowtemperatures, and damage caused by interstellar uv photons favor the productionof amorphous ice as well. we predict that a significant fraction of the iceformed will be amorphous.

astro-ph;0310262	the peculiar circumstellar environment of ngc2024-irs2	we re-examine the nature of ngc2024-irs2 in light of the recent discovery ofthe late o-type star, irs2b, located 5 arcsec from irs2. using l-bandspectroscopy, we set a lower limit of av = 27.0 mag on the visual extinctiontowards irs2. arguments based on the nature of the circumstellar material,favor an av of 31.5 mag. irs2 is associated with the uchii regiong206.543-16.347 and the infrared source iras 05393-0156. we show that much ofthe mid-infrared emission towards irs2, as well as the far infrared emissionpeaking at ~ 100 micron, do not originate in the direct surroundings of irs2,but instead from an extended molecular cloud. using new k-, l- and l'-bandspectroscopy and a comprehensive set of infrared and radio continuummeasurements from the literature, we apply diagnostics based on the radioslope, the strength of the infrared hydrogen recombination lines, and thepresence of co band-heads to constrain the nature and spatial distribution ofthe circumstellar material of irs2. using simple gaseous and/or dust models ofprescribed geometry, we find strong indications that the infrared fluxoriginating in the circumstellar material of irs2 is dominated by emission froma dense gaseous disk with a radius of about 0.6 au. at radio wavelengths theflux density distribution is best described by a stellar wind recombining at aradius of about 100 au. although ngc2024/irs2 shares many similarities withbn-like objects, we do not find evidence for the presence of a dust shellsurrounding this object. therefore, irs2 is likely more evolved.

astro-ph;0402496	metallicity and the spectral energy distribution and spectral types of  dwarf o-stars	we present a systematic study of the effect of metallicity on the stellarspectral energy distribution (sed) of o main sequence (dwarf) stars, focussingon the hydrogen and helium ionizing continua, and on the optical and near-irlines used for spectral classification. the spectra are based on non-lte lineblanketed atmosphere models with stellar winds calculated using the cmfgen codeof hillier &amp; miller (1998). we draw the following conclusions. first, we findthat the total number of lyman photons emitted is almost independent of lineblanketing effects and metallicity for a given effective temperature. this isbecause the flux that is blocked by the forest of metal lines at wavelengthsshorter than 600 angstrom is redistributed mainly within the lyman continuum.second, the spectral type, as defined by the ratio of the equivalent widths ofhei 4471 angstrom and heii 4542 angstrom, is shown to depend noticeably on themicroturbulent velocity in the atmosphere, on metallicity and, within theluminosity class of dwarfs, on gravity. third, we confirm the decrease in theeffective temperature for a given spectral type due to the inclusion of lineblanketing recently found by e.g. martins et al. (2002). finally, we find thatthe sed below ~450 angstrom is highly dependent on metallicity. this isreflected in the behaviour of nebular fine-structure line ratios such as[neiii]/[neii] 15.5/12.8 and [ariii]/[arii] 9.0/7.0 micron. this dependencecomplicates the use of these nebular ratios as diagnostic tools for theeffective temperature determination of the ionizing stars in hii regions andfor age dating of starburst regions in galaxies.

(1996). in particular, the failure to detectfringes provides strong constraints on the opacities in the inner regions ofthe dust shell or in the close vicinity of the star.

astro-ph;0503507	a 10 micron spectroscopic survey of herbig ae star disks: grain growth  and crystallization	we present spectroscopic observations of a large sample of herbig ae stars inthe 10 micrometer spectral region. we perform compositional fits of the spectrabased on properties of homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous sphericalparticles, and derive the mineralogy and typical grain sizes of the dustresponsible for the 10 $\mu$m emission. several trends are reported that canconstrain theoretical models of dust processing in these systems: i) none ofthe sources consists of fully pristine dust comparable to that found in theinterstellar medium, ii) all sources with a high fraction of crystallinesilicates are dominated by large grains, iii) the disks around more massivestars (m &gt;~ 2.5 m_sun, l &gt;~ 60 l_sun) have a higher fraction of crystallinesilicates than those around lower mass stars, iv) in the subset of lower massstars (m &lt;~ 2.5 m_sun) there is no correlation between stellar parameters andthe derived crystallinity of the dust. the correlation between the shape andstrength of the 10 micron silicate feature reported by van boekel et al. (2003)is reconfirmed with this larger sample. the evidence presented in this paper iscombined with that of other studies to present a likely scenario of dustprocessing in herbig ae systems. we conclude that the present data favour ascenario in which the crystalline silicates are produced in the innermostregions of the disk, close to the star, and transported outward to the regionswhere they can be detected by means of 10 micron spectroscopy. additionally, weconclude that the final crystallinity of these disks is reached very soon afteractive accretion has stopped.

astro-ph;0504067	absorption and scattering properties of arbitrarily shaped particles in  the rayleigh domain: a rapid computational method and a theoretical  foundation for the statistical approach	we provide a theoretical foundation for the statistical approach forcomputing the absorption properties of particles in the rayleigh domain. wepresent a general method based on the discrete dipole approximation (dda) tocompute the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the rayleighdomain. the method allows to separate the geometrical aspects of a particlefrom its material properties. doing the computation of the optical propertiesof a particle once, provides them for any set of refractive indices,wavelengths and orientations. this allows for fast computations of e.g.absorption spectra of arbitrarily shaped particles. other practicalapplications of the method are in the interpretation of atmospheric and radarmeasurements as well as computations of the scattering matrix of smallparticles as a function of the scattering angle. in the statistical approach,the optical properties of irregularly shaped particles are represented by theaverage properties of an ensemble of particles with simple shapes. we show thatthe absorption cross section of an ensemble of arbitrarily shaped particleswith arbitrary orientations can always be uniquely represented by the averageabsorption cross section of an ensemble of spheroidal particles with the samecomposition and fixed orientation. this proves for the first time that thestatistical approach is generally viable in the rayleigh domain.

astro-ph;0505603	the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of comet  hale-bopp	we discuss the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma ofcomet hale-bopp. we do this by fitting simultaneously the infrared emissionspectrum measured by the infrared space observatory (iso) and the measureddegree of linear polarization of scattered light at various phase angles and 12different wavelengths. the effects of particle shape on the modeled opticalproperties of the dust grains are taken into account. we constrain our fit byforcing the abundances of the major rock forming chemical elements to be solar.the infrared spectrum at long wavelengths reveals that large grains are neededin order to fit the spectral slope. the size and shape distribution we employallows us to estimate the sizes of the crystalline silicates. the ratios of thestrength of various forsterite features show that the crystalline silicategrains in hale-bopp must be submicron sized. we exclude the presence of largecrystalline silicate grains in the coma. because of this lack of largecrystalline grains combined with the fact that we do need large amorphousgrains to fit the emission spectrum at long wavelengths, we need onlyapproximately 4% of crystalline silicates by mass. after correcting forpossible hidden crystalline material included in large amorphous grains, ourbest estimate of the total mass fraction of crystalline material isapproximately 7.5%, significantly lower than deduced in previous studies inwhich the typical derived crystallinity is 20-30%. the implications of this onthe possible origin and evolution of the comet are discussed. the crystallinitywe observe in hale-bopp is consistent with the production of crystallinesilicates in the inner solar system by thermal annealing and subsequent radialmixing to the comet forming region.

(2005)with the genetic algorithm based optimizing routine pikaia from charbonneau(1995), allowing for a homogeneous analysis of upcoming large samples ofearly-type stars (e.g. evans et al. 2005). in this first implementation we usecontinuum normalized optical hydrogen and helium lines to determinephotospheric and wind parameters. we have assigned weights to these linesaccounting for line blends with species not taken into account, lackingphysics, and/or possible or potential problems in the model atmosphere code. wefind the method to be robust, fast, and accurate. using our method we analysedseven o-type stars in the young cluster cyg ob2 and five other galactic starswith high rotational velocities and/or low mass loss rates (including 10lac,zeta oph, and tau sco) that have been studied in detail with a previous versionof fastwind. the fits are found to have a quality that is comparable or evenbetter than produced by the classical ``by eye'' method. we define errorbars onthe model parameters based on the maximum variations of these parameters in themodels that cluster around the global optimum. using this concept, for theinvestigated dataset we are able to recover mass-loss rates down to ~6d-8msun/yr to within an error of a factor of two. comparison of our derivedspectroscopic masses with those derived from stellar evolutionary models are invery good agreement, i.e. based on the limited sample that we have studied wedo not find indications for a mass discrepancy.

astro-ph;0606299	probing the mass-loss history of agb and red supergiant stars from co  rotational line profiles i. theoretical model -- mass-loss history unravelled  in vy cma	context: mass loss plays a dominant role in the evolution of low mass starswhile they are on the asymptotic giant branch (agb). the gas and dust ejectedduring this phase are a major source in the mass budget of the interstellarmedium. recent studies have pointed towards the importance of variations in themass-loss history of such objects. aims: by modelling the full line profile oflow excitation co lines emitted in the circumstellar envelope, we can study themass-loss history of agb stars. methods: we have developed a non-lte radiativetransfer code, which calculates the velocity structure and gas kinetictemperature of the envelope in a self-consistent way. the resulting structureof the envelope provides the input for the molecular line radiativecalculations which are evaluated in the comoving frame. the code allows for theimplementation of modulations in the mass-loss rate. this code has beenbenchmarked against other radiative transfer codes and is shown to perform welland efficiently. results: we illustrate the effects of varying mass-loss ratesin case of a superwind phase. the model is applied to the well-studied case ofvy cma. we show that both the observed integrated line strengths as thespectral structure present in the observed line profiles, unambiguouslydemonstrate that this source underwent a phase of high mass loss (~ 3.2e-4msun/yr) some 1000 yr ago. this phase took place for some 100 yr, and waspreceded by a low mass-loss phase (~ 1e-6 msun/yr) taking some 800 yr. thecurrent mass-loss rate is estimated to be in the order of 8e-5 msun/yr.conclusions: in this paper, we demonstrate that both the relative strength ofthe co rotational line profiles and the (non)-occurrence of spectral structurein the profile offer strong diagnostics to pinpoint the mass-loss history.

0811.0915	a parameter study of self-consistent disk models around herbig aebe  stars	we present a parameter study of self-consistent models of protoplanetarydisks around herbig aebe stars. we use the code developed by dullemond anddominik, which solves the 2d radiative transfer problem including an iterationfor the vertical hydrostatic structure of the disk. this grid of models will beused for several studies on disk emission and mineralogy in followup papers. inthis paper we take a first look on the new models, compare them with previousmodeling attempts and focus on the effects of various parameters on the overallstructure of the sed that leads to the classification of herbig aebe stars intotwo groups, with a flaring (group i) or self-shadowed (group ii) sed. we findthat the parameter of overriding importance to the sed is the total mass ingrains smaller than 25um, confirming the earlier results by dullemond anddominik. all other parameters studied have only minor influences, and willalter the sed type only in borderline cases. we find that there is no naturaldichotomy between group i and ii. from a modeling point of view, the transitionis a continuous function of the small dust mass. we also show that moderategrain growth produces spectra with weak or no 1um feature, both for flaring(group i) and non-flaring (group ii) sources. the fact that sources with weakfeatures have been found mostly in group i sources is therefore surprising andmust be due to observational biases or evolutionary effects.
