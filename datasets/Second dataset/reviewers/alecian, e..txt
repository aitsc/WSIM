0812.4218	discovery of non-radial pulsations in the spectroscopic binary herbig ae  star rs cha	in this article we present a first discovery of non radial pulsations in bothcomponents of the herbig ae spectroscopic binary star rs cha. the binary wasmonitored in quasi-continuous observations during 14 observing nights (jan2006) at the 1m mt john (new zealand) telescope with the herculeshigh-resolution echelle spectrograph. the cumulated exposure time on the starwas 44 hrs, corresponding to 255 individual high-resolution echelle spectrawith $r = 45000$. least square deconvolved spectra (lsd) were obtained for eachspectrum representing the effective photospheric absorption profile modified bypulsations. difference spectra were calculated by subtracting rotationallybroadened artificial profiles; these residual spectra were analysed andnon-radial pulsations were detected. a subsequent analysis with twocomplementary methods, namely fourier parameter fit (fpf) and fourier 2d (f2d)has been performed and first constraints on the pulsation modes have beenderived. in fact, both components of the spectroscopic binary are herbig aestars and both show nrps. the fpf method identified 2 modes for the primarycomponent with (degree l, azimuthal number m) couples ordered by decreasingprobability: f_1 = 21.11 c/d with (l,m) = (11,11), (11,9) or (10,6) and f_2 =30.38 c/d with (l,m) = (10,6) or (9,5). the f2d analysis indicates for f_1 adegree l = 8-10. for the secondary component, the fpf method identified 3 modeswith (l,m) ordered by decreasing probability: f_1 = 12.81 c/d with (l,m) =(2,1) or (2,2), f_2b = 19.11 c/d with (l,m) = (13,5) or (10,5) and f_3 = 24.56c/d with (l,m) = (6,3) or (6,5). the f2d analysis indicates for f_1 a degree l= 2 or 3, but proposes a contradictory identification of f_2 as a radialpulsation (l = 0).

0901.0347	magnetism of herbig ae/be stars	observations of magnetic fields of stars at the pre-main sequence phase canprovide important new insights into the complex physics of the late stages ofstar formation. this is especially true at intermediate stellar masses, wheremagnetic fields are strong and globally organised, and therefore most amenableto direct study. recent circularly-polarised spectroscopic observations ofpre-main sequence herbig ae/be stars have revealed the presence of organisedmagnetic fields in the photospheres of a small fraction of these objects. todate, 9 magnetic haebe stars have been detected, and those detections confirmedby repeated observations. the morphology and variability of their stokes vsignatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipolecomponents of kg strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofatleast years. these magnetic stars exhibit a large range of stellar mass, fromabout 2-13 solar masses, and diverse rotational properties, with vsini from afew km/s to 200 km/s. most magnetic haebe stars show approximately solarabundances; they clearly do not generally exhibit the strong and systematicpeculiarities of the magnetic main sequence a and b type stars (the ap/bpstars). the observed fractional bulk incidence of magnetic haebe stars is about7%, a value compatible with the incidence of magnetic intermediate-mass starson the main sequence. this low incidence is at odds with formation scenariosgenerally involving magnetically-mediated accretion. the similarily between themagnetic properties of the pre-main sequence and main sequenceintermediate-mass stars appears compatible with the hypothesis of a fossilorigin of magnetism in these objects.

0906.1575	on the incidence of magnetic fields in slowly-pulsating b, beta cephei  and b-type emission line stars	we have obtained 40 high-resolution circular spectropolarimetric measurementsof 12 slowly-pulsating b (spb) stars, 8 beta cephei stars and two be stars withthe espadons and narval spectropolarimeters. the aim of these observations isto evaluate recent claims of a high incidence of magnetic field detections instars of these types obtained using low-resolution spectropolarimetry by hubrig(2006), hubrig (2007) and hubrig (2009). the precision achieved is generallycomparable to or superior to that obtained by hubrig et al., although our newobservations are distinguished by their resolution of metallic and he lineprofiles, and their consequent sensitivity to magnetic fields of zero netlongitudinal component. in the spb stars we confirm the detection of magneticfield in one star (16 peg), but find no evidence of the presence of fields inthe remaining 11. in the beta cep stars, we detect a field in xi^1 cma, but notin any of the remaining 7 stars. finally, neither of the two b-type emissionline stars shows any evidence of magnetic field. based on our results, weconclude that fields are not common in spb, beta cep and b-type emission linestars, consistent with the general rarity of fields in the broader populationof main sequence b-type stars.

0906.5269	the chemical abundance analysis of normal early a- and late b-type stars	modern spectroscopy of early-type stars often aims at studying complexphysical phenomena. comparatively less attention is paid to identifying andstudying the "normal" a- and b-type stars and testing how the basic atomicparameters and standard spectral analysis allow one to fit the observations. wewish to stablish whether the chemical composition of the solar photosphere canbe regarded as a reference for early a- and late b-type stars. we have obtainedoptical high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of three slowlyrotating early-type stars (hd 145788, 21 peg and pi cet) that show no obvioussign of chemical peculiarity, and performed a very accurate lte abundanceanalysis of up to 38 ions of 26 elements (for 21 peg), using a vast amount ofspectral lines visible in the spectral region covered by our spectra. weprovide an exhaustive description of the abundance characteristics of the threeanalysed stars with a critical review of the line parameters used to derive theabundances. we compiled a table of atomic data for more than 1100 measuredlines that may be used in the future as a reference. the abundances we obtainedfor he, c, al, s, v, cr, mn, fe, ni, sr, y, and zr are compatible with thesolar ones derived with recent 3d radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of thesolar photosphere. the abundances of the remaining studied elements show somedegree of discrepancy compared to the solar photosphere. those of n, na, mg,si, ca, ti, and nd may well be ascribed to non-lte effects; for p, cl, sc andco, non-lte effects are totally unknown; o, ne, ar, and ba show discrepanciesthat cannot be ascribed to non-lte effects. the discrepancies obtained for o(in two stars) and ne agree with very recent non-lte abundance analysis ofearly b-type stars in the solar neighbourhood.

0907.1423	discovery of a weak magnetic field in the photosphere of the single  giant pollux	aims: we observe the nearby, weakly-active single giant, pollux, in order todirectly study and infer the nature of its magnetic field. methods: we used thenew generation spectropolarimeters espadons and narval to observe and detectcircular polarization within the photospheric absorption lines of pollux. ourobservations span 18 months from 2007-2009. we treated the spectropolarimetricdata using the least-squares deconvolution method to create highsignal-to-noise ratio mean stokes v profiles. we also measured the classicalactivity indicator s-index for the ca h&amp;k lines, and the stellar radialvelocity (rv). results: we have unambiguously detected a weak stokes v signalin the spectral lines of pollux, and measured the related surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field bl. the longitudinal field averaged over the spanof the observations is below one gauss. our data suggest variations of thelongitudinal magnetic field, but no significant variation of the s-index. weobserve variations of rv which are qualitatively consistent with the publishedephemeris for a proposed exoplanet orbiting pollux. the observed variations ofbl appear to mimic those of rv, but additional data for this relationship to beestablished. using evolutionary models including the effects of rotation, wederive the mass of pollux and we discuss its evolutionary status and the originof its magnetic field. conclusions: this work presents the first directdetection of the magnetic field of pollux, and demonstrates that espadons andnarval are capable of obtaining sub-g measurements of the surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field of giant stars, and of directly studying therelationships between magnetic activity, stellar evolution and planet hostingof these stars.

0907.5113	magnetism and binarity of the herbig ae star v380 ori	in this paper we report the results of high-resolution circularspectropolarimetric monitoring of the herbig ae star v380 ori, in which wediscovered a magnetic field in 2005. a careful study of the intensity spectrumreveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. by modelling the binaryspectrum we infer the effective temperature of both stars: $10500\pm 500$ k forthe primary, and $5500\pm500$ k for the secondary, and we argue that the highmetallicity ($[m/h] = 0.5$), required to fit the lines may imply that theprimary is a chemically peculiar star. we observe that the radial velocity ofthe secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the the primary does not.by fitting these variations we derive the orbital parameters of the system. wefind an orbital period of $104\pm5$ d, and a mass ratio ($m_{\rm p}/m_{\rm s}$)larger than 2.9. the intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong,broad and variable emission. a simple analysis of these lines reveals that adisk might surround the binary, and that a wind occurs in the environment ofthe system. finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the least-squaresdeconvolved (lsd) profiles of the stokes $v$ spectra of both stars, andadopting the oblique rotator model. from rotational modulation of the primary'sstokes $v$ signatures, we infer its rotation period $p=4.31276\pm0.00042$ d,and find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength$2.12\pm0.15$ kg, with a magnetic obliquity $\beta = 66\pm5^{\circ}$, and arotation axis inclination $i=32\pm5^{\circ}$. however, no magnetic field isdetected in the secondary, and if it hosts a dipolar magnetic field, itsstrength must be below about 500 g, to be consistent with our observations.

0910.0214	discovery of a magnetic field in the o9 sub-giant star hd 57682 by the  mimes collaboration	we report the detection of a strong, organised magnetic field in the o9ivstar hd 57682, using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with espadons atthe 3.6-m canada-france-hawaii telescope within the context of the magnetism inmassive stars (mimes) large program. from the fitting of our spectra using nltemodel atmospheres we determined that hd 57682 is a $17^{+19}_{-9}$ m$_{\odot}$star with a radius of $7.0^{+2.4}_{-1.8}$ r$_\odot$, and a relatively lowmass-loss rate of $1.4^{+3.1}_{-0.95}\times10^{-9}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. thephotospheric absorption lines are narrow, and we use the fourier transformtechnique to infer $v\sin i=15\pm3$ km s$^{-1}$. this $v\sin i$ implies amaximum rotational period of 31.5 d, a value qualitatively consistent with theobserved variability of the optical absorption and emission lines, as well asthe stokes $v$ profiles and longitudinal field. using a bayesian analysis ofthe velocity-resolved stokes $v$ profiles to infer the magnetic fieldcharacteristics, we tentatively derive a dipole field strength of$1680^{+134}_{-356}$ g. the derived field strength and wind characteristicsimply a wind that is strongly confined by the magnetic field.

0707.2016	spectropolarimetric observations of the transiting planetary system of  the k dwarf hd 189733	with a jupiter-mass planet orbiting at a distance of only 0.031 au, theactive k2 dwarf hd 189733 is a potential candidate in which to study themagnetospheric interactions of a cool star with its recently-discoveredclose-orbiting giant planet. we decided to explore the strength and topology ofthe large-scale magnetosphere of hd 189733, as a future benchmark forquantitative studies for models of the star/planet magnetic interactions. tothis end, we used espadons, the new generation spectropolarimeter at thecanada-france-hawaii 3.6m telescope, to look for zeeman circular polarisationsignatures in the line profiles of hd 189733 in 2006 june and august. zeemansignatures in the line profiles of hd 189733 are clearly detected in allspectra, demonstrating that a field is indeed present at the surface of thestar. the zeeman signatures are not modulated with the planet's orbital periodbut apparently vary with the stellar rotation cycle. the reconstructedlarge-scale magnetic field, whose strength reaches a few tens of g, issignificantly more complex than that of the sun; it involves in particular asignificant toroidal component and contributions from magnetic multipoles oforder up to 5. the caii h &amp; k lines clearly feature core emission, whoseintensity is apparently varying mostly with rotation phase. our data suggestthat the photosphere and magnetic field of hd 189733 are sheared by asignificant amount of differential rotation. our initial study confirms that hd189733 is an optimal target for investigating activity enhancements induced byclosely orbiting planets. more data are needed, densely covering both theorbital and rotation cycles, to investigate whether and how much the planetcontributes to the overall activity level of hd 189733.

0707.2609	impact of the new solar abundances on the calibration of the pms binary  system rs cha	context: in a recent work, we tried to obtain a calibration of the twocomponents of the pre-main sequence binary system rs cha by means oftheoretical stellar models. we found that the only way to reproduce theobservational parameters of rs cha with standard stellar models is to decreasethe initial abundances of carbon and nitrogen derived from the gn93 solarmixture of heavy elements by a few tenths of dex.  aims: in this work, we aim to reproduce the observational properties of thers cha stars with stellar evolution models based on the new ags05 solar mixturerecently derived from a three-dimensional solar model atmosphere. the ags05mixture is depleted in carbon, nitrogen and oxygen with respect to the gn93mixture.  methods: we calculated new stellar models of the rs cha components using theags05 mixture and appropriate opacity tables. we sought models thatsimultaneously satisfy the observations of the two components (masses, radii,luminosities, effective temperatures and metallicity).  results: we find that it is possible to reproduce the observational data ofthe rs cha stars with ags05 models based on standard input physics. from thesemodels, the initial helium content of the system is y~0.255 and its age is~9.13 +- 0.12 myr.

(2005). this model includes a substantially offset dipolemagnetic field configuration, and approximately reproduces previousobservational variations in longitudinal field strength, photometricbrightness, and halpha emission. we analyze new spectroscopy, including h i, hei, c ii, si iii and fe iii lines, confirming the diversity of variability inphotospheric lines, as well as the double s-wave variation of circumstellarhydrogen. using the multiline analysis method of least-squares deconvolution(lsd), new, more precise longitudinal magnetic field measurements reveal asubstantial variance between the shapes of the observed and rrm modeltime-varying field. the phase resolved stokes v profiles of he i 5876 a and6678 a lines are fit poorly by synthetic profiles computed from the magnetictopology assumed by townsend et al.

0710.1780	magnetism and rotation in herbig ae/be stars	among the main sequence intermediate mass a and b stars, around 5% hostlarge-scale organized magnetic fields. most of these stars are very slowrotators compared to their non-magnetic counterparts, and show photosphericabundance anomalies. they are referred to as the ap/bp stars. one of thegreatest challenges, today is to understand the origin of their magnetic fieldand their slow rotation. the favoured hypothesis is a fossil origin of themagnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of ap/bp stars are relics of thosewhich existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. thisimplies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of thestellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. this isconsistent with the general belief that magnetic braking occurs during the pmsphase, which sheds angular momentum and slows the rotation of these stars. inthis context, we proceeded with a survey of a sample of around 50 pms herbigae/be stars, using the new spectropolarimeter espadons at the cfht, in order tostudy the magnetic field and the rotation velocity of these stars. this talkreviews the results of our survey, as well as their consequences for the originof the magnetic fields and the evolution of the rotation of intermediate massstars during the pms phase.

0712.0199	magnetism in pre-ms intermediate-mass stars and the fossil field  hypothesis	today, one of the greatest challenges concerning the ap/bp stars is tounderstand the origin of their slow rotation and their magnetic fields. thefavoured hypothesis for the latter is the fossil field, which implies that themagnetic fields subsist throughout the different evolutionary phases, and inparticular during the pre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fieldsat the pre-main sequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation ofap/bp stars. however, until recently, essentially no information was availableabout the magnetic properties of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, theso-called herbig ae/be stars. the new high-resolution spectropolarimeterespadons, installed in 2005 at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, provided thecapability necessary to perform surveys of the herbig ae/be stars in order toinvestigate their magnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted inthe detection and/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars,ranging in mass from 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this contribution i willpresent the results of our survey, as well as their implications for the originand evolution of the magnetic fields and rotation.

1211.0282	a magnetic confinement vs. rotation classification of massive-star  magnetospheres	building on results from the magnetism in massive stars (mimes) project, thispaper shows how a two-parameter classification of massive-star magnetospheresin terms of the magnetic wind confinement (which sets the alfv\'en radius ra)and stellar rotation (which sets the kepler co-rotation radius rk) provides auseful organisation of both observational signatures and theoreticalpredictions. we compile the first comprehensive study of inferred and observedvalues for relevant stellar and magnetic parameters of 64 confirmed magnetic obstars with teff &gt; 16 kk. using these parameters, we locate the stars in themagnetic confinement-rotation diagram, a log-log plot of rk vs. ra. thisdiagram can be subdivided into regimes of centrifugal magnetospheres (cm), withra &gt; rk, vs. dynamical magnetospheres (dm), with rk &gt; ra. we show how keyobservational diagnostics, like the presence and characteristics of halphaemission, depend on a star's position within the diagram, as well as otherparameters, especially the expected wind mass-loss rates. in particular, weidentify two distinct populations of magnetic stars with halpha emission:namely, slowly rotating o-type stars with narrow emission consistent with a dm,and more rapidly rotating b-type stars with broader emission associated with acm. for o-type stars, the high mass-loss rates are sufficient to accumulateenough material for line emission even within the relatively short free-falltimescale associated with a dm: this high mass-loss rate also leads to a rapidmagnetic spindown of the stellar rotation. for the b-type stars, the longerconfinement of a cm is required to accumulate sufficient emitting material fromtheir relatively weak winds, which also lead to much longer spindowntimescales.

1211.2907	a high-resolution spectropolarimetric survey of herbig ae/be stars - i.  observations and measurements	this is the first in a series of papers in which we describe and report theanalysis of a large survey of herbig ae/be stars in circularspectropolarimetry. using the espadons and narval high-resolutionspectropolarimeters at the canada-france-hawaii and bernard lyot telescopes,respectively, we have acquired 132 circularly-polarised spectra of 70 herbigae/be stars and herbig candidates. the large majority of these spectra arecharacterised by a resolving power of about 65,000, and a spectral coveragefrom about 3700 ang to 1 micron. the peak snr per ccd pixel ranges from below100 (for the faintest targets) to over 1000 (for the brightest). theobservations were acquired with the primary aim of searching for magneticfields in these objects. however, our spectra are suitable for a variety ofother important measurements, including rotational properties, variability,binarity, chemical abundances, circumstellar environment conditions andstructure, etc. in this first paper, we describe the sample selection, theobservations and their reduction, and the measurements that will comprise thebasis of much of our following analysis. we describe the determination offundamental parameters for each target. we detail the least-squaresdeconvolution that we have applied to each of our spectra, including theselection, editing and tuning of the lsd line masks. we describe the fitting ofthe lsd stokes i profiles using a multi-component model that yields therotationally-broadened photospheric profile (providing the projected rotationalvelocity and radial velocity for each observation) as well as circumstellaremission and absorption components. finally, we diagnose the longitudinalzeeman effect via the measured circular polarisation, and report thelongitudinal magnetic field and stokes v zeeman signature detectionprobability. as an appendix, we provide a detailed review of each starobserved.

1211.2911	a high-resolution spectropolarimetric survey of herbig ae/be stars - ii.  rotation	we report the analysis of the rotational properties of our sample of herbigae/be (haebe) and related stars for which we have obtained high-resolutionspectropolarimetric observations. using the projected rotational velocitiesmeasured at the surface of the stars, we have calculated the angular momentumof the sample and plotted it as a function of age. we have then compared theangular momentum and the vsini distributions of the magnetic to thenon-magnetic haebe stars. finally we have predicted the vsini of thenon-magnetic, non-binary ("normal") stars in our sample when they reach thezams, and compared them to various catalogues of the vsini of main-sequencestars. first, we observe that magnetic haebe stars are much slower rotatorsthan normal stars, indicating that they have been more efficiently braked thanthe normal stars. in fact, the magnetic stars have already lost most of theirangular momentum, despite their young ages (lower than 1 myr for some of them).secondly, our analysis suggests that the low mass (1.5 &lt; m &lt; 5 msun) normalhaebe stars evolve with constant angular momentum towards the zams, while thehigh-mass normal haebe stars (m &gt; 5 msun) are losing angular momentum. wepropose that winds, which are expected to be stronger in massive stars, are atthe origin of this phenomenon.

0712.1746	characterisation of the magnetic field of the herbig be star hd 200775	after our recent discovery of four magnetic herbig stars, we have decided tostudy in detail one of them, hd 200775, to determine if its magnetic topologyis similar to that of the main sequence magnetic stars. with this aim, wemonitored this star in stokes i and v over more than two years, using the newspectropolarimeters espadons at cfht, and narval at tbl. using our data, wefind that hd 200775 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, whosesecondary seems similar, in temperature, to the primary. we determine theluminosity ratio of the system, and using the luminosity of the system found inliterature, we derive the luminosity of both stars. from our measurements ofthe radial velocities of both stars we determine the ephemeris and the orbitalparameters of the system. we have fitted 30 stokes v profiles simultaneously,using a chi2 minimisation method, with a decentered-dipole model. the best-fitmodel provides a rotation period of 4.3281 d an inclination angle of 60degrees, and a magnetic obliquity angle of 125 degrees. the polar strength ofthe magnetic dipole field is 1000 g, which is decentered by 0.05 r* from thecenter of the star. the derived magnetic field model is qualitatively identicalto those commonly observed in the ap/bp stars, which bring strong argument infavour of the fossil field hypothesis, to explain the origin of the magneticfields in the main sequence ap/bp stars. our determination of the inclinationof the rotation axis leads to a radius of the primary which is smaller thanthat derived from the hr diagram position. this can be explained by a largerintrinsic luminosity of the secondary relative to the primary, due to a largercircumstellar extinction of the secondary relative to the primary.

1301.1804	the dramatic change of the fossil magnetic field of hd 190073: evidence  of the birth of the convective core in a herbig star ?	in the context of the espadons and narval spectropolarimetric surveys ofherbig ae/be stars, we discovered and then monitored the magnetic field of hd190073 over more than four years, from 2004 to 2009. our observations alldisplayed similar zeeman signatures in the stokes v spectra, indicating that hd190073 hosted an aligned dipole, stable over many years, consistent with afossil origin. we obtained new observations of the star in 2011 and 2012 anddetected clear variations of the zeeman signature on timescales of days toweeks, indicating that the configuration of its field has changed between 2009and 2011. such a sudden change of external structure of a fossil field hasnever previously been observed in any intermediate or high-mass star. hd 190073is an almost entirely radiative pre-main sequence star, probably hosting agrowing convective core. we propose that this dramatic change is the result ofthe interaction between the fossil field and the ignition of a dynamo fieldgenerated in the newly-born convective core.

1302.2699	orbital parameters, chemical composition, and magnetic field of the ap  binary hd 98088	hd 98088 is a synchronised, double-lined spectroscopic binary system with amagnetic ap primary component and an am secondary component. we study this raresystem using high-resolution musicos spectropolarimetric data, to gain insightinto the effect of binarity on the origin of stellar magnetism and theformation of chemical peculiarities in a-type stars. using a new collection of29 high-resolution stokes vqu spectra we re-derive the orbital and stellarphysical parameters and conduct the first disentangling of spectroscopicobservations of the system to conduct spectral analysis of the individualstellar components. from this analysis we determine the projected rotationalvelocities of the stars and conduct a detailed chemical abundance analysis ofeach component using both the synth3 and zeeman spectrum synthesis codes. thesurface abundances of the primary component are typical of a cool ap star,while those of the secondary component are typical of an am star. we presentthe first magnetic analysis of both components using modern data. usingleast-squares deconvolution, we extract the longitudinal magnetic fieldstrength of the primary component, which is observed to vary between +1170 and-920 g with a period consistent with the orbital period. there is no fielddetected in the secondary component. the magnetic field in the primary ispredominantly dipolar, with the positive pole oriented approximately towardsthe secondary.

1311.1552	chemical peculiarities in magnetic and non-magnetic pre-main sequence a  and b stars	in a- and late b-type stars, strong magnetic fields are always associatedwith ap and bp chemical peculiarities. however, it is not clear at what pointin a star's evolution those peculiarities develop. strong magnetic fields havebeen observed in pre-main sequence a and b stars (herbig ae and be stars), andthese objects have been proposed to be the progenitors of ap and bp stars.however, the photospheric chemical abundances of these magnetic herbig starshave not been studied carefully, and furthermore the chemical abundances of'normal' non-magnetic herbig stars remain poorly characterized. to investigatethis issue, we have studied the photospheric compositions of 23 herbig stars,four of which have confirmed magnetic fields. surprisingly, we found that halfthe non-magnetic stars in our sample show lambda bootis chemical peculiaritiesto varying degrees. for the stars with detected magnetic fields, we find onechemically normal star, one star with lambda boo peculiarities, one stardisplaying weak ap/bp peculiarities, and one somewhat more evolved star withsomewhat stronger ap/bp peculiarities. these results suggests that ap/bppeculiarities are preceded by magnetic fields, and that these peculiaritiesdevelop over the pre-main sequence lives of a and b stars. the incidence oflambda boo stars we find is much higher than that seen on the main sequence. weargue that a selective accretion model for the formation of lambda boopeculiarities is a natural explanation for this remarkably large incidence.

0802.2052	magnetospheric accretion on the t tauri star bp tauri	from observations collected with the espadons and narval spectropolarimeters,we report the detection of zeeman signatures on the classical t tauri star bptau. circular polarisation signatures in photospheric lines and in narrowemission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion are monitored throughout mostof the rotation cycle of bp tau at two different epochs in 2006. we observethat rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of bothunpolarised and circularly polarised spectral proxies tracing the photosphereand the footpoints of accretion funnels.  from the complete data sets at each epoch, we reconstruct the large-scalemagnetic topology and the location of accretion spots at the surface of bp tauusing tomographic imaging. we find that the field of bp tau involves a 1.2 kgdipole and 1.6 kg octupole, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotationaxis. accretion spots coincide with the two main magnetic poles at highlatitudes and overlap with dark photospheric spots; they cover about 2% of thestellar surface. the strong mainly-axisymmetric poloidal field of bp tau isvery reminiscent of magnetic topologies of fully-convective dwarfs. it suggeststhat magnetic fields of fully-convective cttss such as bp tau are likely notfossil remants, but rather result from vigorous dynamo action operating withinthe bulk of their convective zones.  preliminary modelling suggests that the magnetosphere of bp tau extends todistances of at least 4 r* to ensure that accretion spots are located at highlatitudes, and is not blown open close to the surface by a putative stellarwind. it apparently succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out asthe corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of bp tau.

1401.5494	two spotted and magnetic early b-type stars in the young open cluster  ngc2264 discovered by most and espadons	star clusters are known as superb tools for understanding stellar evolution.in a quest for understanding the physical origin of magnetism and chemicalpeculiarity in about 7% of the massive main-sequence stars, we analysed two ofthe ten brightest members of the ~10 myr old galactic open cluster ngc 2264,the early b-dwarfs hd47887 and hd47777. we find accurate rotation periods of1.95 and 2.64 days, respectively, from most photometry. we obtained espadonsspectropolarimetric observations, through which we determined stellarparameters, detailed chemical surface abundances, projected rotationalvelocities, and the inclination angles of the rotation axis. because we foundonly small (&lt;5 km/s) radial velocity variations, most likely caused by spots,we can rule out that hd47887 and hd47777 are close binaries. finally, using theleast-squares deconvolution technique, we found that both stars possess alarge-scale magnetic field with an average longitudinal field strength of about400 g. from a simultaneous fit of the stellar parameters we determine theevolutionary masses of hd47887 and hd47777 to be 9.4+/-0.7 m0 and 7.6+/-0.5 m0.interestingly, hd47777 shows a remarkable helium underabundance, typical ofhelium-weak chemically peculiar stars, while the abundances of hd47887 arenormal, which might imply that diffusion is operating in the lower mass starbut not in the slightly more massive one. furthermore, we argue that the ratherslow rotation, as well as the lack of nitrogen enrichment in both stars, can beconsistent with both the fossil and the binary hypothesis for the origin of themagnetic field. however, the presence of two magnetic and apparently singlestars near the top of the cluster mass-function may speak in favour of thelatter.

1502.00226	the origin of magnetic fields in hot stars	observations of stable mainly dipolar magnetic fields at the surface of ~7%of single hot stars indicate that these fields are of fossil origin, i.e. theydescend from the seed field in the molecular clouds from which the stars wereformed. recent results confort this theory. first, theoretical work andnumerical simulations confirm that the properties of the observed fieldscorrespond to those expected from fossil fields. they also showed that rapidrotation does not modify the surfacic dipolar magnetic configurations, buthinders the stability of fossil fields. this explains the lack of correlationbetween the magnetic field properties and stellar properties in massive stars.it may also explain the lack of detections of magnetic fields in be stars,which rotate close to their break-up velocity. in addition, observations by thebinamics collaboration of hot stars in binary systems show that the fraction ofthose hosting detectable magnetic fields is much smaller than for single hotstars. this could be related to results obtained in simulations of massive starformation, which show that the stronger the magnetic field in the originalmolecular cloud, the more difficult it is to fragment massive cores to formseveral stars. therefore, more and more arguments support the fossil fieldtheory.

1511.08425	the mimes survey of magnetism in massive stars: introduction and  overview	the mimes project is a large-scale, high resolution, sensitivespectropolarimetric investigation of the magnetic properties of o and early btype stars. initiated in 2008 and completed in 2013, the project was supportedby 3 large program allocations, as well as various programs initiated byindependent pis and archival resources. ultimately, over 4800 circularlypolarized spectra of 560 o and b stars were collected with the instrumentsespadons at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, narval at the t\'elescopebernard lyot, and harpspol at the european southern observatory la silla 3.6mtelescope, making mimes by far the largest systematic investigation of massivestar magnetism ever undertaken. in this paper, the first in a series reportingthe general results of the survey, we introduce the scientific motivation andgoals, describe the sample of targets, review the instrumentation andobservational techniques used, explain the exposure time calculation designedto provide sensitivity to surface dipole fields above approximately 100 g,discuss the polarimetric performance, stability and uncertainty of theinstrumentation, and summarize the previous and forthcoming publications.

astro-ph;0509295	discovery of the pre-main sequence progenitors of the magnetic ap/bp  stars?	we report the discovery, using fors1 at the eso-vlt and espadons at the cfht,of magnetic fields in the young a-type stars hd 101412, v380 ori and hd 72106a.two of these stars (hd 101412 and v380 ori) are pre-main sequence herbig ae/be(haebe) stars, while one (hd 72106a) is physically associated with a haebestar. remarkably, evidence of surface abundance spots is detected in thespectra of hd 72106a. the magnetic fields of these objects display intensitiesof order 1 kg at the photospheric level, are ordered on global scales, andappear in approximately 10% of the stars studied. based on these properties,the detected stars may well represent pre-main sequence progenitors of themagnetic ap/bp stars. the low masses inferred for these objects (2.6, 2.8 and2.4 solar masses) represent additional contradictions to the hypothesis ofhubrig et al. (2000), who claim that magnetic fields appear inintermediate-mass stars only after 30% of their main sequence evolution iscomplete. finally, we fail to confirm claims by hubrig et al. (2004) ofmagnetic fields in the herbig ae star hd 139614.

astro-ph;0601616	a search for magnetic fields in the variable hgmn star $\alpha$  andromedae	with this work, we have conducted an extensive search for magnetic fields inthe photosphere of $\alpha$~and. we have acquired new circular polarisationspectra with the musicos and espadons sp ectropolarimeters. we have alsoobtained fors1 circular polarisation spectra fro m the eso archive, andconsidered all previously published magnetic data. this e xtensive dataset hasbeen used to systematically test for the presence of magnet ic fields in thephotosphere of $\alpha$~and. we have also examined the high-res olution spectrafor line profile variability. the polarimetric and magnetic data provide noconvincing evidence for photospheric magnetic fields. the highest-s/n phase-and velocity-resolved stokes $v$ profiles, obtained with espadons, allow us toplace a $3\sigma$ upper limit of abou t 100~g on the possible presence of anyundetected pure dipolar, quadrupolar or octupolar surface magnet ic fields (andjust 50~g for fields with significant obliquity). we also conside r and dismissthe possible existence of more complex fossil and dynamo-generated fields, anddiscuss the implications of these results for explaining the non-un iformsurface distribution of hg. the very high-quality espadons spectra have allowed us to confidently detect variability of hg~{\sc ii} $\lambda 6149$,$\lamb da 5425$ and $\lambda 5677$. the profile variability of the hg~{\sc ii}lines is strong, and similar to that of the hg~{\sc ii} $\lambda 3984$ line. onthe ot her hand, variability of other lines (e.g. mn, fe) is much weaker, andappears to be attributable to orbital modulation, continuum normalisationdifferences and weak, variable fringing.

astro-ph;0601624	investigation of the magnetic field characteristics of herbig ae/be  stars: discovery of the pre-main sequence progenitors of the magnetic ap/bp  stars	we are investigating the magnetic characteristics of pre-main sequence herbigae/be stars, with the aim of (1) understanding the origin and evolution ofmagnetism in intermediate-mass stars, and (2) exploring the influence ofmagnetic fields on accretion, rotation and mass-loss at the early stages ofevolution of a, b and o stars. we have begun by conducting 2 large surveys ofherbig ae/be stars, searching for direct evidence of photospheric magneticfields via the longitudinal zeeman effect. from observations obtained usingfors1 at the eso-vlt and espadons at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, wereport the confirmed detection of magnetic fields in 4 pre-main sequence a- andb-type stars, and the apparent (but as yet unconfirmed) detection of fields in2 other such stars. we do not confirm the detection of magnetic fields inseveral stars reported by other authors to be magnetic: hd 139614, hd 144432 orhd 31649. one of the most evolved stars in the detected sample, hd 72106a,shows clear evidence of strong photospheric chemical peculiarity, whereas manyof the other (less evolved) stars do not. the magnetic fields that we detectappear to have surface intensities of order 1 kg, seem to be structured onglobal scales, and appear in about 10% of the stars studied. based on theseproperties, these magnetic stars appear to be pre-main sequence progenitors ofthe magnetic ap/bp stars.

astro-ph;0610499	the magnetic field of the pre-main sequence herbig ae star hd 190073	the general context of this paper is the study of magnetic fields in thepre-main sequence intermediate mass herbig ae/be stars. magnetic fields arelikely to play an important role in pre-main sequence evolution at thesemasses, in particular in controlling the gains and losses of stellar angularmomentum. the particular aim of this paper is to announce the detection of astructured magnetic field in the herbig ae star hd 190073, and to discussvarious scenarii for the geometry of the star, its environment and its magneticfield. we have used the espadons spectropolarimeter at cfht in 2005 and 2006 toobtain high-resolution and signal-to-noise circular polarization spectra whichdemonstrate unambiguously the presence of a magnetic field in the photosphereof this star. nine circular polarization spectra were obtained, each oneshowing a clear zeeman signature. this signature is suggestive of a magneticfield structured on large scales. the signature, which corresponds to alongitudinal magnetic field of 74+- 10 g, does not vary detectably on aone-year timeframe, indicating either an azimuthally symmetric field, a zeroinclination angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight, or a verylong rotation period. the optical spectrum of hd 190073 exhibits a large numberof emission lines. we discuss the formation of these emission lines in theframework of a model involving a turbulent heated region at the base of thestellar wind, possibly powered by magnetic accretion. this magnetic detectionbrings an important element for our understanding of stellar magnetism atintermediate masses.

astro-ph;0610758	the magnetic field of the planet-hosting star $\tau$ bootis	we have obtained high resolution spectropolarimetric data for theplanet-hosting star $\tau$ bootis, using the espadons spectropolarimeter atcfht. a weak but clear stokes $v$ signature is detected on three of the fournights of june 2006 during which we have recorded data. this polarimetricsignature indicates with no ambiguity the presence of a magnetic field at thestar's surface, with intensity of just a few gauss.  the analysis of the photospheric lines of $\tau$ boo at ultra-highsignal-to-noise reveals the presence of an 18% relative differential rotation.tentative zeeman-doppler imaging, using our spectropolarimetric observationscovering only a fraction of the star's rotational phase, indicates a magneticfield with a dominant potential field component. the data are best fitted whena 3.1d period of modulation and an intermediate inclination are assumed.considering the level of differential rotation of $\tau$ boo, this implies arotation period of 3.0d at the equator and of 3.7d at the pole, and a topologyof the magnetic field where its main non-axisymmetric part is located at lowlatitudes.  the planet is probably synchronised with the star's rotation at intermediatelatitudes, while the non-axisymmetric part of the magnetic field seems locatedat lower latitudes. our limited data do not provide sufficient constraints onthe magnetic field to study a possible interaction of the planet with thestar's magnetosphere. investigating this issue will require data with muchbetter phase coverage. similar studies should also be performed for other starshosting close-in giant planets.

astro-ph;0610947	calibration of the pre-main sequence rs cha binary system	context: the calibration of binary systems with accurately known massesand/or radii provides powerful tools to test stellar structure and evolutiontheory and to determine the age and helium content of stars. we study theeclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary system rs cha, for which we haveaccurate observations of the parameters of both stars (masses, radii,luminosities, effective temperatures and metallicity). aims: we have calculatedseveral sets of stellar models for the components of the rs cha system, withthe aim of reproducing simultaneously the available observational constraintsand to estimate the age and initial helium abundance of the system. methods:using the cesam stellar evolution code, we model both components starting fromthe initial mass and metallicity and adjusting the input parameters and physicsin order to satisfy the observational constraints. results: we find that theobservations cannot be reproduced if we assume that the abundance ratios aresolar but they are satisfied if carbon and nitrogen are depleted in the rs chasystem with respect to the sun. this is in accordance with the abundancesobserved in other young stars. the rs cha system is in an evolutionary stage atthe end of the pms phase where models are not strongly sensitive to variousphysical uncertainties. however we show that the oscillations of these twostars, which have been detected, would be able to discriminate betweendifferent options in the physical description of this evolutionary phase.

0809.2039	magnetic fields and chemical peculiarities of the very young  intermediate-mass binary system hd 72106	the recently discovered magnetic herbig ae and be stars may providequalitatively new information about the formation and evolution of magnetic apand bp stars. we have performed a detailed investigation of one particularlyinteresting binary system with a herbig ae secondary and a late b-type primarypossessing a strong, globally ordered magnetic field. twenty high-resolutionstokes v spectra of the system were obtained with the espadons instrumentmounted on the cfht. in these observations we see clear evidence for a magneticfield in the primary, but no evidence for a magnetic field in the secondary. adetailed abundance analysis was performed for both stars, revealing strongchemical peculiarities in the primary and normal chemical abundances in thesecondary. the primary is strongly overabundant in si, cr, and other iron-peakelements, as well as nd, and underabundant in he. the primary therefore appearsto be a very young bp star. in this context, line profile variations of theprimary suggest non-uniform lateral distributions of surface abundances.interpreting the 0.63995 +/- 0.00009 day variation period of the stokes i and vprofiles as the rotational period of the star, we have modeled the magneticfield geometry and the surface abundance distributions of si, ti, cr and feusing magnetic doppler imaging. we derive a dipolar geometry of the surfacemagnetic field, with a polar strength of 1230 g and an obliquity of 57 degrees.the distributions ti, cr and fe are all qualitatively similar, with anelongated patch of enhanced abundance situated near the positive magnetic pole.the si distribution is somewhat different, and its relationship to the magneticfield geometry less clear.

0809.4648	magnetic fields, winds and x-rays of massive stars: a  spectropolarimetric survey of the orion cluster	in massive stars, magnetic fields are thought to confine the outflowingradiatively-driven wind, resulting in x-ray emission that is harder, morevariable and more efficient than that produced by instability-generated shocksin non-magnetic winds. although magnetic confinement of stellar winds has beenshown to strongly modify the mass-loss and x-ray characteristics of massive obstars, we lack a detailed understanding of the complex processes responsible.the aim of this study is to examine the relationship between magnetism, stellarwinds and x-ray emission of ob stars. in conjunction with a chandra survey ofthe orion nebula cluster, we carried out spectropolarimatric espadonsobservations to determine the magnetic properties of massive ob stars of thiscluster. we found of two new massive magnetic stars in the orion nebulacluster: hd 36982 and hd 37061, for which the estimated dipole polar strengthsare 1150 (+320 -200) g and 620 (+220 -170) g, respectively. however, theapparent lack of clear correlation between x-ray indicator and the presence ofa magnetic fields brings forth new challenges for understanding the processesleading to x-ray emission in massive stars.

0810.2228	ek eridani: the tip of the iceberg of giants which have evolved from  magnetic ap stars	we observe the slowly-rotating, active, single giant, ek eri, to study andinfer the nature of its magnetic field directly. we used the spectropolarimeternarval at the telescope bernard lyot, pic du midi observatory, and the leastsquare deconvolution method to create high signal-to-noise ratio stokes vprofiles. we fitted the stokes v profiles with a model of the large-scalemagnetic field. we studied the classical activity indicators, the caii h and klines, the caii infrared triplet, and h\alpha line. we detected the stokes vsignal of ek eri securely and measured the longitudinal magnetic field bl forseven individual dates spanning 60% of the rotational period. the measuredlongitudinal magnetic field of ek eri reached about 100 g and was as strong asfields observed in rscvn or fk com type stars: this was found to beextraordinary when compared with the weak fields observed at the surfaces ofslowly-rotating ms stars or any single red giant previously observed withnarval. from our modeling, we infer that the mean surface magnetic field isabout 270 g, and that the large scale magnetic field is dominated by a poloidalcomponent. this is compatible with expectations for the descendant of astrongly magnetic ap star.
