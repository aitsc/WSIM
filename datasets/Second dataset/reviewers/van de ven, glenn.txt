0902.3025	structure and substructure of galactic spheroids	the full spatio-chemo-dynamical structure of galaxies of all types andenvironments at low redshift provides a critical accompaniment to observationsof galaxy formation at high redshift. the next decade brings the observationalopportunity to strongly constrain nearby galaxies' histories of star formationand assembly, especially in the spheroids that comprise the large majority ofthe stellar mass in the universe but have until now been difficult to study. inorder to constrain the pathways to building up the spheroidal "red-sequence",various standard techniques in photometry and spectroscopy, particularly withresolved tracer populations like globular clusters and planetary nebulae, canbe scaled up to comprehensive surveys as improved wide-field instrumentation isincreasingly available. at the same time, progress in adaptive optics on gianttelescopes could for the first time permit deep, resolved photometric andspectroscopic analysis of large samples of individual stars in these systems,thereby revolutionizing galaxy studies. strong theoretical support is needed inorder to understand the new observational constraints via detailed modeling andself-consistent simulations of star and galaxy formation throughout cosmictime.

0706.3624	absorption line-strengths of 18 late-type spiral galaxies observed with  sauron	we present absorption line-strength maps for a sample of 18 sb-sd galaxiesobserved using the integral-field spectrograph sauron. the sauron spectralrange allows the measurement of the lick/ids indices hbeta, fe5015 and mgb,which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. we presenthere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. from the maps, welearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high hbeta and low fe5015 andmgb values, and that the hbeta index has often a positive gradient over thefield, while the metal indices peak in the central region. we investigate therelations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations withmorphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observedbehaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals fromthe sauron survey. we find that our galaxies lie below the mg - sigma relationdetermined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend withmorphological type. from the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicityand abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-ssp approach andfrom a two-ssp approach. late-type galaxies are generally younger and moremetal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.we also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover thestar formation history using the evolutionary models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (sfr).we find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst andthe central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shortertau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basicallyended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

0905.3556	kinematic analysis of nuclear spirals: feeding the black hole in ngc1097	we present a harmonic expansion of the observed line-of-sight velocity fieldas a method to recover and investigate spiral structures in the nuclear regionsof galaxies. we apply it to the emission-line velocity field within thecircumnuclear starforming ring of ngc1097, obtained with the gmos-ifuspectrograph. the radial variation of the third harmonic terms are welldescribed by a logarithmic spiral, from which we interpret that thegravitational potential is weakly perturbed by a two-arm spiral density wavewith inferred pitch angle of of 52+/-4 degrees. this interpretation predicts atwo-arm spiral distortion in the surface brightness, as hinted by the duststructures in central images of ngc1097, and predicts a combined one-arm andthree-arm spiral structure in the velocity field, as revealed in thenon-circular motions of the ionised gas within the circumnuclear region of thisgalaxy. next, we use a simple spiral perturbation model to constrain thefraction of the measured non-circular motions that is due to radial inflow. wecombine the resulting inflow velocity with the gas density in the spiral arms,inferred from emission line ratios, to estimate the mass inflow rate as afunction of radius, which reaches about 0.011 msun/yr at a distance of 70 pcfrom the center. this value corresponds to a fraction of about 4.2 x 10^{-3} ofthe eddington mass accretion rate onto the central black hole in thisliner/seyfert1 galaxy. we conclude that the line-of-sight velocity not only canprovide a cleaner view of nuclear spirals than the associated dust, but thatthe presented method also allows the quantitative study of these possiblyimportant links in fueling the centers of galaxies, including providing ahandle on the mass inflow rate as a function of radius.

0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0906.3321	the sauron project - xiv. no escape from v$_{\mathrm{esc}}$: a global  and local parameter in early-type galaxy evolution	we present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity(vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from thesauron sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies withboth detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling.values of vesc are computed using multi gaussian expansion (mge) photometricfitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneouslyon hst and ground-based images. we determine line strengths and escapevelocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation ofthe correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. we finda tight correlation between vesc and the line-strength indices. for mgb we findthat this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but alsoinside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. therelation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the globalrelation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsicscatter in the local gradients. we transform our line strength indexmeasurements to the single stellar population (ssp) equivalent age (t),metallicity ([z/h]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/fe]) and carry out a principalcomponent analysis of our ssp and vesc data. we find that in thisfour-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a goodapproximation confined to a plane, given by $\log\mathrm({v}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[z/h]} + 0.43 \log(\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{gyrs})$ - 0.20. it is surprising that it is a combinationof age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy'between age and metallicity or a weakness in the ssp models.

0909.2884	short gamma-ray bursts from dynamically-assembled compact binaries in  globular clusters: pathways, rates, hydrodynamics and cosmological setting	we present a detailed assessment of the dynamical pathways leading to thecoalescence of compact objects in globular clusters (gcs) and short gamma-rayburst (sgrb) production. we consider primordial binaries, dynamically formedbinaries (through tidal two-body and three-body exchange interactions) anddirect impacts of compact objects (wd/ns/bh). we show that if the primordialbinary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate ofcoalescing compact systems. we find that the two dominant channels are theinteraction of field nss with dynamically formed binaries, and two-bodyencounters. we then estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxydemographics of sgrb progenitors, and find that gcs can provide a significantcontribution to the overall observed rate.  we have carried out hydrodynamical modeling of evolution of close stellarencounters with wd/ns/bh, and show that there is no problem in accounting forthe energy budget of a typical sgrb. the particulars of each encounter arevariable and lead to interesting diversity: the encounter characteristics aredependent on the impact parameter, in contrast to the merger scenario; thenature of the compact star itself can produce very different outcomes; thepresence of tidal tails in which material falls back onto the central object atlater times is a robust feature of these calculations, with the mass involvedbeing larger than for binary mergers. it is thus possible to accountgenerically in this scenario for a prompt episode of energy release, as well asfor activity many dynamical time scales later (abridged).

1006.1574	the sauron project - xvii. stellar population analysis of the absorption  line strength maps of 48 early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a stellar population analysis of the absorption linestrength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample. using the linestrength index maps of hbeta, fe5015, and mgb, measured in the lick/ids systemand spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, together with predictionsfrom up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellarpopulation-equivalent (ssp-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio[alpha/fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately oneeffective radius. we find a large range of ssp-equivalent ages in our sample,of which ~40% of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellarpopulation. the most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, withssp-equivalent ages of &lt;=3 gyr observed over the full field-of-view, andsometimes even showing signs of residual star-formation, are restricted to lowmass systems(sigma_e &lt;= 100 k/ms or ~2x10^10 m_sol). spatially restricted casesof young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively belinked to the presence of star-formation in a thin, dusty disk/ring, also seenin the near-uv or mid-ir. the flattened components with disk-like kinematicspreviously identified in all fast rotators (krajnovi\'c et al.) are shown to beconnected to regions of distinct stellar populations. these range from theyoung, still star-forming circumnuclear disks and rings with increasedmetallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, toapparently old structures with extended disk-like kinematics, which areobserved to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [alpha/fe] ratiocompared to the main body of the galaxy. the slow rotators generally show nostellar population signatures over and above the well known metallicitygradients and are largely consistent with old (&gt;=10 gyr) stellar populations.

1101.5153	physical condition of molecular gas at the centre of ngc 1097	we have used the xco conversion factor, local thermal equilibrium and largevelocity gradient approximation to parametrize the cold and warm phase of theinterstellar medium from five different low transitions of co in the central21"(kpc) of ngc 1097. we have applied a one-component model and derived atypical kinetic temperature of ~33k, and its molecular hydrogen density and aco column density. a two-component model results in 85% cold-to-total gasfraction with a 90k warm counterpart. furthermore, we "resolve" the spatiallyunresolved single dish observations by selecting velocity channels that in aninterferometric velocity map correspond to specific regions. we have selectedfive such regions and found that the physical properties in these regions arecomparable to those derived from the full line profile. this implies that thecentral kpc of ngc 1097 is rather homogeneous in nature, and, although theregions are not uniquely located within the ring, the star formation along thering is homogeneously distributed (in agreement with recent herschelobservations). we have further revised the mass inflow rate onto thesupermassive black hole in this prototype liner/sy1 galaxy and found that,accounting for the total interstellar medium and applying a carefulcontribution of the disc thickness and corresponding stability criterion,increases the previous estimations by a factor 10. finally we have calculatedthe xco for the centre of ngc 1097 using an independent estimation of thesurface density to the co emission, and obtained xco=(2.8+-0.5)x10^20 cm^-2(kkm s^-1)^-1 at radius 10.5" and xco=(5.0+-0.5)x10^20 cm^-2(k km s^-1)^-1 at7.5". with the approach and analysis described, we have demonstrated thatimportant physical properties can be derived to a resolution beyond the singledish resolution element, however, caution is necessary for interpreting theresults.(abriged)

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1103.6026	resolving the dynamical mass of a z~1.3 qso host galaxy using sinfoni  and laser guide star assisted adaptive optics	recent studies of the tight scaling relations between the masses ofsupermassive black holes and their host galaxies have suggested that in thepast black holes constituted a larger fraction of their host galaxies' mass.however, these arguments are limited by selection effects and difficulties indetermining robust host galaxy masses at high redshifts. here we report thefirst results of a new, complementary diagnostic route: we directly determine adynamical host galaxy mass for the z=1.3 luminous quasar j090543.56+043347.3through high-spatial-resolution (0.47", 4kpc fwhm) observations of the hostgalaxy gas kinematics over 30x40 kpc using eso/vlt/sinfoni with lgs/ao.combining our result of m_dyn = 2.05+1.68_0.74 x 10^11 m_sun (within a radius5.25 +- 1.05 kpc) with m_bh,mgii = 9.02 \pm 1.43 x 10^8 m_sun, m_bh,halpha =2.83 +1.93-1.13 x 10^8 m_sun, we find that the ratio of black hole mass to hostgalaxy dynamical mass for j090543.56+043347.3 matches the present-day relationfor m_bh vs. m_bulge,dyn, well within the ir scatter, deviating at most afactor of two from the mean. j090543.56+043347.3 displays clear signs of anongoing tidal interaction and of spatially extended star formation at a rate of50-100 m_sun/yr, above the cosmic average for a galaxy of this mass andredshift. we argue that its subsequent evolution may move j090543.56+043347.3even closer to the z=0 relation for m_bh vs. m_bulge,dyn. our results supportthe picture where any substantive evolution in these relations must occur priorto z~1.3. having demonstrated the power of this modelling approach we arecurrently analyzing similar data on seven further objects to better constrainsuch evolution.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1211.2638	a census of orbital properties of the m31 satellites	we present an analysis of the dynamics of the m31 satellite system. propermotion data exist for only two of the m31 satellites. we account for thisincompleteness in velocity data by a statistical analysis using a combinationof the timing argument and phase-space distribution functions. the bulk of them31 satellites are well fit by these models and we offer a table of orbitalproperties, including period, eccentricity and semi-major axis. this enables usto search for evidence of group infall based on orbital similarity rather thanpropinquity on the sky. our results favour an association between cass ii andngc 185, as the orbital parameters are in close agreement, but not for ngc 185and ngc 147, which have often been associated in the past. other possiblesatellite groupings include the pair and i and and xvii; the pair and ix andand x; and the triple and v, and xxv and ngc 147. and xxii has been claimed asa satellite of m33; we find that they are not moving independently along thesame orbit, but cannot determine whether they are orbiting each other or areunrelated. two satellites, and xii and and xiv, have high line-of-sightvelocities, consistent with very recent infall from the edge of the localgroup. they are not well described by our underlying smooth phase spacedistribution function, and are reanalysed without priors on their orbitalparameters. for and xiv, multiple pericentric passages are possible andimproved distance information is needed to draw further conclusions. for andxii, orbits which assume at least one pericentric passage can be ruled out andit must be on its first infall into the m31 system.

1211.6429	an over-massive black hole in the compact lenticular galaxy ngc1277	all massive galaxies likely have supermassive black holes at their centers,and the masses of the black holes are known to correlate with properties of thehost galaxy bulge component. several explanations have been proposed for theexistence of these locally-established empirical relationships; they includethe non-causal, statistical process of galaxy-galaxy merging, direct feedbackbetween the black hole and its host galaxy, or galaxy-galaxy merging and thesubsequent violent relaxation and dissipation. the empirical scaling relationsare thus important for distinguishing between various theoretical models ofgalaxy evolution, and they further form the basis for all black hole massmeasurements at large distances. in particular, observations have shown thatthe mass of the black hole is typically 0.1% of the stellar bulge mass of thegalaxy. the small galaxy ngc4486b currently has the largest published fractionof its mass in a black hole at 11%. here we report observations of the stellarkinematics of ngc 1277, which is a compact, disky galaxy with a mass of 1.2 x10^11 msun. from the data, we determine that the mass of the central black holeis 1.7 x 10^10 msun, or 59% its bulge mass. five other compact galaxies haveproperties similar to ngc 1277 and therefore may also contain over-sized blackholes. it is not yet known if these galaxies represent a tail of adistribution, or if disk-dominated galaxies fail to follow the normal blackhole mass scaling relations.

1212.0006	constraining the galactic potential via action-based distribution  functions for mono-abundance stellar populations	we present a rigorous and practical way of constraining the galacticpotential based on the phase-space information for many individual stars. suchan approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopicsurveys of the galaxy and in the future gaia. this approach describes the orbitdistribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (df)proposed by mcmillan and binney, which are based on actions. we find that theseparametrized dfs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-spacedistributions of individual abundance-selected galactic subpopulations of stars(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, whichenables independent dynamical constraints from each of the galacticmono-abundance populations. we lay out a statistically rigorous way toconstrain the galactic potential parameters by constructing the jointlikelihood of potential and df parameters, and subsequently marginalizing overthe df parameters. this approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selectionfunction inherent to all galactic surveys, and can account for theuncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. on that basis,we study the precision of the parameters of the galactic potential that can bereached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. bycreating mock samples from the df, we show that, even under a restrictive andrealistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitationalpotential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent withsample sizes of a few thousands. the assumptions of axisymmetry, of dfs thatare smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitationsin our current study.

1303.1210	the complex nature of the nuclear star cluster in fcc 277	recent observations have shown that compact nuclear star clusters (nscs) arepresent in up to 80% of galaxies. however, detailed studies of their dynamicaland chemical properties are confined mainly to spiral galaxy hosts, where theyare more easily observed. in this paper we present our study of the nsc in fcc277, a nucleated elliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster. we use a combinationof adaptive optics assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopy, hubblespace telescope imaging, and literature long slit data. we show that while thensc does not appear to rotate within our detection limit of ~6 km/s, rotationis detected at larger radii, where the isophotes appear to be disky, suggestingthe presence of a nuclear disk. we also observe a distinct central velocitydispersion drop that is indicative of a dynamically cold rotating sub-system.following the results of orbit-based dynamical modelling, co-rotating as wellas counter-rotating stellar orbits are simultaneously needed to reproduce theobserved kinematics. we find evidence for varying stellar populations, with thensc and nuclear disk hosting younger and more metal rich stars than the mainbody of the galaxy. we argue that gas dissipation and some level of merginghave likely played an important role in the formation of the nucleus of thisintermediate-mass galaxy. this is in contrast to nscs in low-mass early- typegalaxies, which may have been formed primarily through the infall of starclusters.

1308.4789	discrete dynamical modelling of omega centauri	we present a new framework for modelling discrete kinematic data. currenttechniques typically involve binning. our approach works directly with thediscrete data and uses maximum-likelihood methods to assess the probability ofthe dataset given model predictions. we avoid making hard cuts on the datasetsby allowing for a contaminating population in our models. we apply our modelsto discrete proper-motion and line-of-sight-velocity data of galactic globularcluster omega centauri and find a mildly radial velocity anisotropy beta = 0.10+/- 0.02, an inclination angle i = 50 +/- 1 deg, a v-band mass-to-light ratioupsilon = 2.71 +/- 0.05 msun/lsun and a distance d = 4.59 +/- 0.08 kpc. allparameters are in agreement with previous studies, demonstrating thefeasibility of our methods. we find that the models return lower distances andhigher mass-to-light ratios than expected when we include proper motion starswith high errors or for which there is some blending. we believe this not afault of our models but is instead due to underestimates or missing systematicuncertainties in the provided errors.

1311.3303	the central mass and mass-to-light profile of the galactic globular  cluster m15	we analyze line-of-sight velocity and proper motion data of stars in thegalactic globular cluster m15 using a new method to fit dynamical models todiscrete kinematic data. our fitting method maximizes the likelihood forindividual stars and, as such, does not suffer the same loss of spatial andvelocity information incurred when spatially binning data or measuring velocitymoments. in this paper, we show that the radial variation in m15 of themass-to-light ratio is consistent with previous estimates and theoreticalpredictions, which verifies our method. our best-fitting axisymmetric jeansmodels do include a central dark mass of $\sim2 \pm 1\cdot 10^3m_\odot$, whichcan be explained by a high concentration of stellar remnants at the clustercenter. this paper shows that, from a technical point of view and with currentcomputing power, spatial binning of data is no longer necessary. this not onlyleads to more accurate fits, but also avoids biased mass estimates due to theloss of resolution. furthermore, we find that the mass concentration in m15 issignificantly higher than previously measured, and is in close agreement withtheoretical predictions for core-collapsed globular clusters without a centralintermediate-mass black hole.

1402.5210	reconstructing the stellar mass distributions of galaxies using s4g irac  3.6 and 4.5 micron images: ii. the conversion from light to mass	we present a new approach for estimating the 3.6 micron stellar mass-to-lightratio in terms of the [3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations. ourapproach avoids several of the largest sources of uncertainty in existingtechniques. by focusing on mid-ir wavelengths, we gain a virtually dustextinction-free tracer of the old stars, avoiding the need to adopt a dustmodel to correctly interpret optical or optical/nir colors normally leveragedto assign m/l. by calibrating a new relation between nir and mid-ir colors ofglimpse giant stars we also avoid discrepancies in model predictions for the[3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations due to uncertainties in molecularline opacities. we find that the [3.6]-[4.5] color, which is driven primarilyby metallicity, provides a tight constraint on m/l_3.6, which variesintrinsically less than at optical wavelengths. the uncertainty on m/l_3.6 of~0.07 dex due to unconstrained age variations marks a significant improvementon existing techniques for estimating the stellar m/l with shorter wavelengthdata. a single m/l_3.6=0.6 (assuming a chabrier imf), independent of[3.6]-[4.5] color, is also feasible as it can be applied simultaneously to old,metal-rich and young, metal-poor populations, and still with comparable (orbetter) accuracy (~0.1 dex) as alternatives. we expect our m/l_3.6 to beoptimal for mapping the stellar mass distributions in s4g galaxies, for whichwe have developed an independent component analysis technique to first isolatethe old stellar light at 3.6 micron from non-stellar emission (e.g. hot dustand the 3.3 pah feature). our estimate can also be used to determine thefractional contribution of non-stellar emission to global (rest-frame) 3.6micron fluxes, e.g. in wise imaging, and establishes a reliable basis forexploring variations in the stellar imf.

1407.4808	the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid in the milky way disk	accurate determination of the local dark matter density is important forunderstanding the nature and distribution of dark matter in the universe. thisrequires that the local velocity distribution is characterised correctly. here,we present a kinematic study of 16,276 segue g-type dwarf stars in the solarneighbourhood, with which we determine the shape of the velocity ellipsoid inthe meridional plane. we separate our g-dwarf stars based on their [fe/h] and[alpha/fe] abundances and infer the local velocity distribution independentlyfor each sub-sample using a maximum-likelihood method that accounts forpossible contaminants. we show by constructing vertical jeans models that thedifferent sub-samples yield consistent results only when we allow the velocityellipsoid in the disk to be tilted, demonstrating that the common assumption ofdecoupled radial and vertical motions in the disk is incorrect. further, weobtain that the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid is consistent among thedifferent sub-samples. we find that increase in the tilt with height is welldescribed by the relation alpha_tilt = (-0.90 +- 0.04) arctan(|z|/r_sun) -(0.01 +- 0.005), which is close to alignment with the spherical coordinatesystem and hence a velocity ellipsoid pointing to the galactic centre. we alsoconfirm earlier findings that the sub-samples behave almost isothermally withboth radial and vertical velocity dispersion approximately constant withheight. we conclude that the coupling between radial and vertical motioncaptured in the velocity ellipsoid tilt cannot be ignored when consideringdynamical models of the solar neighbourhood. in a subsequent paper, we willdevelop a new modelling scheme informed by these results and make an improveddetermination of the local dark matter density.

1502.00634	a new channel for the formation of kinematically decoupled cores in  early-type galaxies	we present the formation of a kinematically decoupled core (kdc) in anelliptical galaxy, resulting from a major merger simulation of two diskgalaxies. we show that although the two progenitor galaxies are initiallyfollowing a prograde orbit, strong reactive forces during the merger can causea short-lived change of their orbital spin; the two progenitors follow aretrograde orbit right before their final coalescence. this results in acentral kinematic decoupling and the formation of a large-scale (~2 kpc radius)counter-rotating core (crc) at the center of the final elliptical-like mergerremnant (m*=1.3x10^11 msun), while its outer parts keep the rotation directionof the initial orbital spin. the stellar velocity dispersion distribution ofthe merger remnant galaxy exhibits two symmetrical off-centered peaks,comparable to the observed "2-sigma galaxies". the kdc/crc consists mainly ofold, pre-merger population stars (older than 5 gyr), remaining prominent in thecenter of the galaxy for more than 2 gyr after the coalescence of itsprogenitors. its properties are consistent with kdcs observed in massiveelliptical galaxies. this new channel for the formation of kdcs from progrademergers is in addition to previously known formation scenarios from retrogrademergers and can help towards explaining the substantial fraction of kdcsobserved in early-type galaxies.

1507.05632	understanding the central kinematics of globular clusters with simulated  integrated-light ifu observations	the detection of intermediate mass black holes in the centres of globularclusters is highly controversial, as complementary observational methods oftendeliver significantly different results. in order to understand thesediscrepancies, we develop a procedure to simulate integral field unit (ifu)observations of globular clusters: simulating ifu star cluster observations(sisco). the input of our software are realistic dynamical models of globularclusters that are then converted in a spectral data cube. we apply sisco tomonte carlo cluster simulations from downing et al. (2010), with a realisticnumber of stars and concentrations. using independent realisations of a givensimulation we are able to quantify the stochasticity intrinsic to the problemof observing a partially resolved stellar population with integrated-lightspectroscopy. we show that the luminosity-weighted ifu observations can bestrongly biased by the presence of a few bright stars that introduce a scatterin the velocity dispersion measurements up to $\simeq$40% around the expectedvalue, preventing any sound assessment of the central kinematic and a sensibleinterpretation of the presence/absence of an intermediate mass black hole.moreover, we illustrate that, in our mock ifu observations, the averagekinematic tracer has a mass of $\simeq$0.75 solar masses, only slightly lowerthan the mass of the typical stars examined in studies of resolvedline-of-sight velocities of giant stars. finally, in order to recover unbiasedkinematic measurements we test different masking techniques that allow us toremove the spaxels dominated by bright stars, bringing the scatter down to alevel of only a few percent. the application of sisco will allow to investigatestate-of-the-art simulations as realistic observations.

1509.03352	toward the dynamical classification of galaxies: principal component  analysis of sauron and califa circular velocity curves	we present a dynamical classification system for galaxies based on the shapesof their circular velocity curves (cvcs). we derive the cvcs of 40 sauron and42 califa galaxies across hubble sequence via a full line-of-sight integrationas provided by solutions of the axisymmetric jeans equations. we use principalcomponent analysis (pca) applied to the circular curve shapes to findcharacteristic features and use a k-means classifier to separate circularcurves into classes. this objective classification method identifies fourdifferent classes, which we name slow-rising (sr), flat (f), sharp-peaked (sp)and round-peaked (rp) circular curves. sr-cvcs are mostly represented bylate-type spiral galaxies (scd-sd) with no prominent spheroids in the centralparts and slowly rising velocities; f-cvcs span almost all morphological types(e,s0,sab,sb-sbc) with flat velocity profiles at almost all radii; sp-cvcs arerepresented by early-type and early-type spiral galaxies (e,s0,sb-sbc) withprominent spheroids and sharp peaks in the central velocities. rp-cvcs arerepresented by only two morphological types (e,sa-sab) with prominentspheroids, but rp-cvcs have much rounder peaks in the central velocities thansp-cvcs. rp-cvcs are typical for high-mass galaxies, while sr-cvcs are foundfor low-mass galaxies. intermediate-mass galaxies usually have f-cvcs andsp-cvcs. circular curve classification presents an alternative to typicalmorphological classification and may be more tightly linked to galaxyevolution.

1510.04973	creating s0s with major mergers: a 3d view	a number of simulators have argued that major mergers can sometimes preservediscs (e.g. springel &amp; hernquist 2005), but the possibility that they couldexplain the emergence of lenticular galaxies (s0s) has been generallyneglected. in fact, observations of s0s reveal a strong structural couplingbetween their bulges and discs, which seems difficult to reconcile with theidea that they come from major mergers. however, in querejeta et al. (2015a) wehave used n-body simulations of binary mergers to show that, under favourableconditions, discs are first destroyed but soon regrow out of the leftoverdebris, matching observational photometric scaling relations (e.g. laurikainenet al. 2010). additionally, in querejeta et al. (2015b) we have shown how themerger scenario agrees with the recent discovery that s0s and most spirals arenot compatible in an angular momentum--concentration plane. this importantresult from califa constitutes a serious objection to the idea that spiralstransform into s0s mainly by fading (e.g. via ram-pressure stripping, as thatwould not explain the observed simultaneous change in $\lambda_\mathrm{re}$ andconcentration), but our simulations of major mergers do explain that mismatch.from such a 3d comparison we conclude that mergers must be a relevant processin the build-up of the current population of s0s.

1511.03131	the massive dark halo of the compact, early-type galaxy ngc 1281	we investigate the compact, early-type galaxy ngc 1281 with integral fieldunit observations to map the stellar losvd out to 5 effective radii andconstruct orbit-based dynamical models to constrain its dark and luminousmatter content. under the assumption of mass-follows-light, the h-band stellarmass-to-light ratio (m/l) is {\upsilon} = 2.7(+-0.1) {\upsilon}_{sun}, higherthan expected from our stellar population synthesis fits with either acanonical kroupa ({\upsilon} = 1.3 {\upsilon}_{sun}) or salpeter ({\upsilon} =1.7 {\upsilon}_{sun}) stellar initial mass function. such models also cannotreproduce the details of the losvd. models with a dark halo recover thekinematics well and indicate that ngc 1281 is dark matter dominated, making up~ 90 per cent of the total enclosed mass within the kinematic bounds.parameterised as a spherical nfw profile, the dark halo mass is 11.5 &lt;log(m_{dm}/m_{sun}) &lt; 11.8 and the stellar m/l is 0.6 &lt; {\upsilon} &lt; 1.1.however, this stellar m/l is lower than predicted by its old stellarpopulation. moreover, the halo mass within the kinematic extent is ten timeslarger than expected based on {\lambda}cdm predictions, and an extrapolationyields cluster sized dark halo masses. adopting {\upsilon} = 1.7{\upsilon}_{sun} yields more moderate dark halo virial masses, but these modelsfit the kinematics worse. a non-nfw model might solve the discrepancy betweenthe unphysical consequences of the best-fitting dynamical models and modelsbased on more reasonable assumptions for the dark halo and stellarmass-to-light ratio, which are disfavoured according to our parameterestimation.

0807.1505	the sauron project - xii. kinematic substructures in early-type  galaxies: evidence for disks in fast rotators	[abridged] we analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxiesobtained with the sauron and oasis integral-field spectrographs usingkinemetry, a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher order momentsof the line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd). in the sauron sample, wefind that 31% of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91% of themulti-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest havingthree. in addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. we find that the velocitymaps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in thetransition regions between kinematic subcomponents. in terms of e/s0classification, this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components withdisk-like kinematics. for the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axialratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary towhat is predicted with isotropic jeans models viewed at different inclinations.the position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly inslow rotators. velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similarto the distribution of light. we constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - v/sigmaand h4 - v/sigma diagrams from sauron observations. we confirm the classicalanti-correlation of h3 and v\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero insome objects or even weakly correlated with v/sigma. the distribution of h4 forfast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. the difference betweenslow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the losvd, withevidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likelydifferent evolutionary paths.

0807.2437	migration of star clusters and nuclear rings	star clusters that form in nuclear rings appear to be at slightly largerradii than the gas. we argue that the star clusters move out from the gas inwhich they are formed because of satellite-disk tidal interactions. incalculating the dynamics of this star cluster and gas ring system, we includethe effects of dynamical friction of the background stars in the host galaxy onthe star cluster, and inflowing gas along the bar onto the nuclear ring at thetwo contact points. we show that the final separation is of the order of thehill radius of the nuclear ring, which is typically 20-30% of its radius.massive star clusters can reach half of this separation very quickly andproduce a factor of a few enhancement in the gas surface density. if this leadsto star formation in addition to the (ongoing) formation of star clusters nearthe contact points, a possible (initial) azimuthal age gradient may becomediluted or even disappear. finally, if the star cluster are massive and/ornumerous enough, we expect the nuclear ring to migrate inward, away from the(possibly) associated (inner) lindblad resonance. we discuss how thesepredictions may be tested observationally.

0807.4175	the einstein cross: constraint on dark matter from stellar dynamics and  gravitational lensing	[abridged] we present two-dimensional line-of-sight stellar kinematics of thelens galaxy in the einstein cross, obtained with the gemini 8m telescope, usingthe gmos integral-field spectrograph. the velocity map shows regular rotationup to ~100 km/s around the minor axis of the bulge, consistent withaxisymmetry. the velocity dispersion map shows a weak gradient increasingtowards a central (r&lt;1") value of sigma_0=170+/-9 km/s. we deproject theobserved surface brightness from hst imaging to obtain a realistic luminositydensity of the lens galaxy, which in turn is used to build axisymmetricdynamical models that fit the observed kinematic maps. we also construct agravitational lens model that accurately fits the positions and relative fluxesof the four quasar images. we find that the resulting luminous and total massdistribution are nearly identical around the einstein radius r_e = 0.89", witha slope that is close to isothermal, but which becomes shallower towards thecenter if indeed mass follows light. the dynamical model fits to the observedkinematic maps result in a total mass-to-light ratio (m/l)_dyn=3.7+/-0.5m_sun/l_sun,i (in the i-band). this is consistent with the einstein mass m_e =1.54 x 10^10 m_sun divided by the (projected) luminosity within r_e, whichyields a total mass-to-light ratio of (m/l)_e=3.4 m_sun/l_sun,i, with an errorof at most a few per cent. we estimate from stellar populations model fits tocolors of the lens galaxy a stellar mass-to-light ratio (m/l)_* from 2.8 to 4.1m_sun/l_sun,i. although a constant dark matter fraction of 20 per cent is notexcluded, dark matter may play no significant role in the bulge of this ~l*early-type spiral galaxy.

0808.2493	galaxy density profiles and shapes -- i. simulation pipeline for lensing  by realistic galaxy models	studies of strong gravitational lensing in current and upcoming wide and deepphotometric surveys, and of stellar kinematics from (integral-field)spectroscopy at increasing redshifts, promise to provide valuable constraintson galaxy density profiles and shapes. however, both methods are affected byvarious selection and modelling biases, whch we aim to investigate in aconsistent way. in this first paper in a series we develop a flexible butefficient pipeline to simulate lensing by realistic galaxy models. these galaxymodels have separate stellar and dark matter components, each with a range ofdensity profiles and shapes representative of early-type, central galaxieswithout significant contributions from other nearby galaxies. we use fouriermethods to calculate the lensing properties of galaxies with arbitrary surfacedensity distributions, and monte carlo methods to compute lensing statisticssuch as point-source lensing cross-sections. incorporating a variety ofmagnification bias modes lets us examine different survey limitations in imageresolution and flux. we rigorously test the numerical methods for systematicerrors and sensitivity to basic assumptions. we also determine the minimumnumber of viewing angles that must be sampled in order to recover accurateorientation-averaged lensing quantities. we find that for a range ofnon-isothermal stellar and dark matter density profiles typical of ellipticalgalaxies, the combined density profile and corresponding lensing properties aresurprisingly close to isothermal around the einstein radius. the converseimplication is that constraints from strong lensing and/or stellar kinematics,which are indeed consistent with isothermal models near the einstein radius,cannot trivially be extrapolated to smaller and larger radii.

0808.2497	galaxy density profiles and shapes -- ii. selection biases in strong  lensing surveys	[abridged] many current and future astronomical surveys will rely on samplesof strong gravitational lens systems to draw conclusions about galaxy massdistributions. we use a new strong lensing pipeline (presented in paper i ofthis series) to explore selection biases that may cause the population ofstrong lensing systems to differ from the general galaxy population. our focusis on point-source lensing by early-type galaxies with two mass components(stellar and dark matter) that have a variety of density profiles and shapesmotivated by observational and theoretical studies of galaxy properties. weseek not only to quantify but also to understand the physics behind selectionbiases related to: galaxy mass, orientation and shape; dark matter profileparameters such as inner slope and concentration; and adiabatic contraction. westudy how all of these properties affect the lensing einstein radius, totalcross-section, quad/double ratio, and image separation distribution. we findsignificant (factors of several) selection biases with mass; orientation, for agiven galaxy shape at fixed mass; cusped dark matter profile inner slope andconcentration; concentration of the stellar and dark matter deprojected sersicmodels. interestingly, the intrinsic shape of a galaxy does not stronglyinfluence its lensing cross-section when we average over viewing angles. ourresults are an important first step towards understanding how strong lenssystems relate to the general galaxy population.

astro-ph;0509642	a bar signature and central disk in the gaseous and stellar velocity  fields of ngc5448	we analyse sauron kinematic maps of the inner kpc of the early-type (sa)barred spiral galaxy ngc5448. the observed morphology and kinematics of theemission-line gas is patchy and perturbed, indicating clear departures fromcircular motion. the kinematics of the stars is more regular, and display asmall inner disk-like system embedded in a large-scale rotating structure. wefocus on the [oiii] gas, and use a harmonic decomposition formalism to analysethe gas velocity field. the higher-order harmonic terms and the main kinematicfeatures of the observed data are consistent with an analytically constructedsimple bar model. the bar model is derived using linear theory, considering anm=2 perturbation mode, and with bar parameters which are consistent with thelarge-scale bar detected via imaging. we also study optical and near infra-redimages to reveal the asymmetric extinction in ngc5448, and we recognise thatsome of the deviations between the data and the analytical bar model may be dueto these complex dust features. our study illustrates how the harmonicdecomposition formalism can be used as a powerful tool to quantify non-circularmotions in observed gas velocity fields.

astro-ph;0703531	the sauron project -- ix. a kinematic classification for early-type  galaxies	2d stellar kinematics of 48 representative e and s0 galaxies obtained withthe sauron ifs reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours,depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. we definea new parameter lambdar which involves luminosity weighted averages over thefull 2d kinematic field, as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellarangular momentum per unit mass. we use it as a basis for a new kinematicclassification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators(srs, frs), depending on whether they have lambdar values within theireffective radius re below or above 0.1, respectively. srs and frs are shown tobe physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be theconsequence of a biased viewing angle. frs tend to be relatively low luminositygalaxies. srs tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are stillspread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. 3 slow rotators of our sample,among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. remarkably, allother srs contain a large kpc-scale kdc. all frs show well aligned photometricand kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most srs whichexhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. in a companion paper(paper x), we also show that frs and srs are distinct classes in terms of theirorbital distribution. we suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formationand evolution of frs, and that the slowest rotators are the extremeevolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells wheredissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which mostof the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards.

0811.3474	recovering the intrinsic shape of early-type galaxies	we investigate how well the intrinsic shape of early-type galaxies can berecovered when both photometric and two-dimensional stellar kinematicobservations are available. we simulate these observations with galaxy modelsthat are representative of observed oblate fast-rotator to triaxialslow-rotator early-type galaxies. by fitting realistic triaxial dynamicalmodels to these simulated observations, we recover the intrinsic shape (andmass-to-light ratio), without making additional (ad-hoc) assumptions on theorientation.  for (near) axisymmetric galaxies the dynamical modelling can strongly excludetriaxiality, but the regular kinematics do not further tighten the constrainton the intrinsic flattening significantly, so that the inclination is nearlyunconstrained above the photometric lower limit even with two-dimensionalstellar kinematics. triaxial galaxies can have additional complexity in boththe observed photometry and kinematics, such as twists and (central)kinematically decoupled components, which allows the intrinsic shape to beaccurately recovered. for galaxies that are very round or show no significantrotation, recovery of the shape is degenerate, unless additional constraintssuch as from a thin disk are available.
