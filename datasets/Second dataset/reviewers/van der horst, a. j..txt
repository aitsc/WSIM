0706.1321	detailed study of the grb 030329 radio afterglow deep into the  non-relativistic phase	we explore the physics behind one of the brightest radio afterglows ever, grb030329, at late times when the jet is non-relativistic. we determine thephysical parameters of the blast wave and its surroundings, in particular theindex of the electron energy distribution, the energy of the blast wave, andthe density (structure) of the circumburst medium. we then compare our resultswith those from image size measurements. we observed the grb 030329 radioafterglow with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope and the giant metrewaveradio telescope at frequencies from 325 mhz to 8.4 ghz, spanning a time rangeof 268-1128 days after the burst. we modeled all the available radio data andderived the physical parameters. the index of the electron energy distributionis p=2.1, the circumburst medium is homogeneous, and the transition to thenon-relativistic phase happens at t_nr ~ 80 days. the energy of the blast waveand density of the surrounding medium are comparable to previous findings. ourfindings indicate that the blast wave is roughly spherical at t_nr, and theyagree with the implications from the vlbi studies of image size evolution. itis not clear from the presented dataset whether we have seen emission from thecounter jet or not. we predict that the low frequency array will be able toobserve the afterglow of grb 030329 and many other radio afterglows,constraining the physics of the blast wave during its non-relativistic phaseeven further.

0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0901.0519	swift grbs and the blast wave model	the complex structure of the light curves of swift grbs has made theirinterpretation and that of the blast wave caused by the burst, more difficultthan in the pre-swift era. we aim to constrain the blast wave parameters:electron energy distribution, p, density profile of the circumburst medium, k,and the continued energy injection index, q. we do so by comparing the observedmulti-wavelength light curves and x-ray spectra of a swift sample to thepredictions of the blast wave model.  we can successfully interpret all of the bursts in our sample of 10, excepttwo, within the framework of the blast wave model, and we can estimate withconfidence the electron energy distribution index for 6 of the sample.furthermore we identify jet breaks in half of the bursts. a statisticalanalysis of the distribution of p reveals that, even in the most conservativecase of least scatter, the values are not consistent with a single, universalvalue. the values of k suggest that the circumburst density profiles are notdrawn from only one of the constant density or wind-like media populations.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

1011.4079	search for gravitational wave bursts from six magnetars	soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) and anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) are thought tobe magnetars: neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields. these rareobjects are characterized by repeated and sometimes spectacular gamma-raybursts. the burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation ofnon-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (gws). we present theresults of a search for gw bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitiveto neutron star f-modes, thought to be the most efficient gw emittingoscillatory modes in compact stars. one of them, sgr 0501+4516, is likely ~1kpc from earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted inprevious gw searches. a second, axp 1e 1547.0-5408, gave a burst with anestimated isotropic energy &gt;10^{44} erg which is comparable to the giantflares. we find no evidence of gws associated with a sample of 1279electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between november 2006 andjune 2009, in gw data from the ligo, virgo, and geo600 detectors. our lowestmodel-dependent gw emission energy upper limits for band- and time-limitedwhite noise bursts in the detector sensitive band, and for f-mode ringdowns (at1090 hz), are 3.0x10^{44} d_1^2 erg and 1.4x10^{47} d_1^2 erg respectively,where d_1 = d_{0501} / 1 kpc and d_{0501} is the distance to sgr 0501+4516.these limits on gw emission from f-modes are an order of magnitude lower thanany previous, and approach the range of electromagnetic energies seen in sgrgiant flares for the first time.

1012.3648	radio observations of candidate magnetic o stars	context: some o stars are suspected to have to have (weak) magnetic fieldsbecause of the observed cyclical variability in their uv wind-lines. however,direct detections of these magnetic fields using optical spectropolarimetryhave proven to be very difficult. aims: non-thermal radio emission in theseobjects would most likely be due to synchrotron radiation. as a magnetic fieldis required for the production of synchrotron radiation, this would be strongevidence for the presence of a magnetic field. such non-thermal emission hasalready been observed from the strongly magnetic ap/bp stars. methods: we haveperformed 6 &amp; 21 cm observations using the wsrt and use these, in combinationwith archival vla data at 3.6 cm and results from the literature, to study theradio emission of 5 selected candidate magnetic o stars. results: out of ourfive targets, we have detected three: $\xi$ per, which shows a non-thermalradio spectrum, and $\alpha$ cam and $\lambda$ cep, which show no evidence of anon-thermal spectrum. in general we find that the observed free-free (thermal)flux of the stellar wind is lower than expected. this is in agreement withrecent findings that the mass-loss rates from o stars as derived from theh$\alpha$ line are overestimated because of clumping in the inner part of thestellar wind.

1107.2399	quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares: new clues from the fermi  gamma-ray burst monitor	in the last four decades it has been observed that solar flares showquasi-periodic pulsations (qpps) from the lowest, i.e. radio, to the highest,i.e. gamma-ray, part of the electromagnetic spectrum. to this day, it is stillunclear which mechanism creates such qpps. in this paper, we analyze fourbright solar flares which show compelling signatures of quasi-periodic behaviorand were observed with the gamma-ray burst monitor (\gbm) onboard the fermisatellite. because gbm covers over 3 decades in energy (8 kev to 40 mev) it canbe a key instrument to understand the physical processes which drive solarflares. we tested for periodicity in the time series of the solar flaresobserved by gbm by applying a classical periodogram analysis. however, contraryto previous authors, we did not detrend the raw light curve before creating thepower spectral density spectrum (psd). to assess the significance of thefrequencies we made use of a method which is commonly applied for x-raybinaries and seyfert galaxies. this technique takes into account the underlyingcontinuum of the psd which for all of these sources has a p(f) ~ f^{-\alpha}dependence and is typically labeled red-noise. we checked the reliability ofthis technique by applying it to a solar flare which was observed by the reuvenramaty high-energy solar spectroscopic imager (rhessi) which contains, besidesany potential periodicity from the sun, a 4 s rotational period due to therotation of the spacecraft around its axis. while we do not find an intrinsicsolar quasi-periodic pulsation we do reproduce the instrumental periodicity.moreover, with the method adopted here, we do not detect significant qpps inthe four bright solar flares observed by gbm. we stress that for the purpose ofsuch kind of analyses it is of uttermost importance to appropriately accountfor the red-noise component in the psd of these astrophysical sources.

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1202.3157	sgr j1550-5418 bursts detected with the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor  during its most prolific activity	we have performed detailed temporal and time-integrated spectral analysis of286 bursts from sgr j1550-5418 detected with the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor(gbm) in january 2009, resulting in the largest uniform sample of temporal andspectral properties of sgr j1550-5418 bursts. we have used the combination ofbroadband and high time-resolution data provided with gbm to performstatistical studies for the source properties. we determine the durations,emission times, duty cycles and rise times for all bursts, and find that theyare typical of sgr bursts. we explore various models in our spectral analysis,and conclude that the spectra of sgr j1550-5418 bursts in the 8-200 kev bandare equally well described by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung (ottb), apower law with an exponential cutoff (comptonized model), and two black-bodyfunctions (bb+bb). in the spectral fits with the comptonized model we find amean power-law index of -0.92, close to the ottb index of -1. we show thatthere is an anti-correlation between the comptonized epeak and the burstfluence and average flux. for the bb+bb fits we find that the fluences andemission areas of the two blackbody functions are correlated. thelow-temperature bb has an emission area comparable to the neutron star surfacearea, independent of the temperature, while the high-temperature blackbody hasa much smaller area and shows an anti-correlation between emission area andtemperature. we compare the properties of these bursts with bursts observedfrom other sgr sources during extreme activations, and discuss the implicationsof our results in the context of magnetar burst models.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1204.5840	maxi j1659-152: the shortest orbital period black-hole transient in  outburst	maxi j1659-152 is a bright x-ray transient black-hole candidate binary systemdiscovered in september 2010. we report here on maxi, rxte, swift, andxmm-newton observations during its 2010/2011 outburst. we find that during thefirst one and a half week of the outburst the x-ray light curves display dropsin intensity at regular intervals, which we interpret as absorption dips. aboutthree weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen. these dipshave, however, a spectral behaviour opposite to that of the absorption dips,and are related to fast spectral state changes (hence referred to as transitiondips). the absorption dips recur with a period of 2.414+/-0.005 hrs, which weinterpret as the orbital period of the system. this implies that maxi j1659-152is the shortest period black-hole candidate binary known to date. theinclination of the accretion disk with respect to the line of sight isestimated to be 65-80 degrees. we propose the companion to the black-holecandidate to be close to an m5 dwarf star, with a mass and radius of about0.15-0.25 m_sun and 0.2-0.25 r_sun, respectively. we derive that the companionhad an initial mass of about 1.5 m_sun, which evolved to its current mass inabout 5-6 billion years. the system is rather compact (orbital separation oflarger than ~1.33 r_sun), and is located at a distance of 8.6+/-3.7 kpc, with aheight above the galactic plane of 2.4+/-1.0 kpc. the characteristics of shortorbital period and high galactic scale height are shared with two othertransient black-hole candidate x-ray binaries, i.e., xte j1118+480 and swiftj1735.5-0127. we suggest that all three are kicked out of the galactic planeinto the halo, rather than being formed in a globular cluster.

1205.4239	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. vi. radio observations  at z&lt;1 and consistency with typical star-forming galaxies	the objective of this paper is to determine the level of obscured starformation activity and dust attenuation in a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb)hosts; and to test the hypothesis that grb hosts have properties consistentwith those of the general star-forming galaxy populations. we present a radiocontinuum survey of all z&lt;1 grb hosts in the optically unbiased grb host(tough) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-swift) grb-snhosts discovered before october 2006. we present new radio data for 22 objectsand have obtained a detection for three of them (grb 980425, 021211, 031203;none in the tough sample), increasing the number of radio-detected grb hostsfrom two to five. the star formation rate (sfr) for the grb 021211 host of ~825mo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a grb host, places it in the categoryof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. we found that at least 63% of grb hostshave sfr &lt; 100 mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have sfr &gt; 500 mo yr^-1. for theundetected hosts the mean radio flux (&lt;35 ujy 3sigma) corresponds to an averagesfr &lt; 15 mo yr^-1. moreover, ~88% of the z&lt;1 grb hosts have ultraviolet dustattenuation a_uv &lt; 6.7 mag (visual attenuation a_v &lt; 3 mag). hence we did notfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of grb hosts. finally,we found that the distributions of sfrs and a_uv of grb hosts are consistentwith those of lyman break galaxies, halpha emitters at similar redshifts and ofgalaxies from cosmological simulations. the similarity of the grb populationwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that grbs, aleast at z&lt;1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are thereforeless biased indicators than once thought.

0704.3718	gamma-ray burst afterglows as probes of environment and blastwave  physics ii: the distribution of p and structure of the circumburst medium	we constrain blastwave parameters and the circumburst media of a subsample often bepposax gamma-ray bursts. for this sample we derive the values of theinjected electron energy distribution index, p, and the density structure indexof the circumburst medium, k, from simultaneous spectral fits to their x-ray,optical and nir afterglow data. the spectral fits have been done in count spaceand include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previouslyreported optical and x-ray temporal behaviour. using the blastwave model andsome assumptions which include on-axis viewing and standard jet structure,constant blastwave energy and no evolution of the microphysical parameters, wefind a mean value of p for the sample as a whole of 2.04 +0.02/-0.03. astatistical analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the p values in thissample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3-sigmalevel or greater, which has significant implications for particle accelerationmodels. this approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburstdensity structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous)and k=2 (wind-like). we find five grbs for which k can be well constrained, andin four of these cases the circumburst medium is clearly wind-like. the fifthsource has a value of 0&lt;k&lt;1, consistent with a homogeneous circumburst medium.

1209.6053	the fermi-gbm x-ray burst monitor: thermonuclear bursts from 4u 0614+09	thermonuclear bursts from slowly accreting neutron stars (nss) have provendifficult to detect, yet they are potential probes of the thermal properties ofthe neutron star interior. during the first year of a systematic all-sky searchfor x-ray bursts using the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) aboard the fermigamma-ray space telescope we have detected 15 thermonuclear bursts from the nslow-mass x-ray binary 4u 0614+09, when it was accreting at nearly 1% of theeddington limit. we measured an average burst recurrence time of 12+/-3 d (68%confidence interval) between march 2010 and march 2011, classified all burstsas normal duration bursts and placed a lower limit on the recurrence time oflong/intermediate bursts of 62 d (95% confidence level). we discuss howobservations of thermonuclear bursts in the hard x-ray band compare to pointedsoft x-ray observations, and quantify such bandpass effects on measurements ofburst radiated energy and duration. we put our results for 4u 0614+09 in thecontext of other bursters and briefly discuss the constraints on ignitionmodels. interestingly, we find that the burst energies in 4u 0614+09 are onaverage between those of normal duration bursts and those measured inlong/intermediate bursts. such a continuous distribution in burst energyprovides a new observational link between normal and long/intermediate bursts.we suggest that the apparent bimodal distribution that defined normal andlong/intermediate duration bursts during the last decade could be due to anobservational bias towards detecting only the longest and most energetic burstsfrom slowly accreting nss.

0801.1449	the hidden x-ray breaks in afterglow light curves	gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow observations in the swift era have aperceived lack of achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax, or pre-swiftera. specifically, relatively few breaks, consistent with jet breaks, areobserved in the x-ray light curves of these bursts. if these breaks are trulymissing, it has serious consequences for the interpretation of grb jetcollimation and energy requirements, and the use of grbs as standard candles.  here we address the issue of x-ray breaks which are possibly 'hidden' andhence the light curves are misinterpreted as being single power-laws. we showhow a number of precedents, including grb 990510 &amp; grb 060206, exist for suchhidden breaks and how, even with the well sampled light curves of the swiftera, these breaks may be left misidentified. we do so by synthesising x-raylight curves and finding general trends via monte carlo analysis. furthermore,in light of these simulations, we discuss how to best identify achromaticbreaks in afterglow light curves via multi-wavelength analysis.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1402.6015	time resolved spectroscopy of sgr j1550-5418 bursts detected with  fermi/gbm	we report on time-resolved spectroscopy of the 63 brightest bursts of sgrj1550-5418, detected with fermi/gamma-ray burst monitor during its 2008-2009intense bursting episode. we performed spectral analysis down to 4 mstime-scales, to characterize the spectral evolution of the bursts. using acomptonized model, we find that the peak energy, e_peak, anti-correlates withflux, while the low-energy photon index remains constant at -0.8 up to a fluxlimit f~10^-5 erg s-1 cm-2. above this flux value the e_peak-flux correlationchanges sign, and the index positively correlates with flux reaching 1 at thehighest fluxes. using a two black-body model, we find that the areas and fluxesof the two emitting regions correlate positively. further, we study here forthe first time, the evolution of the temperatures and areas as a function offlux. we find that the area-kt relation follows lines of constant luminosity atthe lowest fluxes, r^2 \propto kt^-4, with a break at higher fluxes ($f&gt;10^-5.5erg s-1 cm-2). the area of the high-kt component increases with flux while itstemperature decreases, which we interpret as due to an adiabatic coolingprocess. the area of the low-kt component, on the other hand, appears tosaturate at the highest fluxes, towards r_max~30 km. assuming that crust quakesare responsible for sgr bursts and considering r_max as the maximum radius ofthe emitting photon-pair plasma fireball, we relate this saturation radius to aminimum excitation radius of the magnetosphere, and put a lower limit on theinternal magnetic field of sgr j1550-5418, b_int&gt;~4.5x10^15 g.

1403.2217	probing the bright radio flare and afterglow of grb 130427a with the  arcminute microkelvin imager	we present one of the best sampled early time light curves of a gamma-rayburst (grb) at radio wavelengths. using the arcminute mircrokelvin imager (ami)we observed grb 130427a at the central frequency of 15.7 ghz between 0.36 and59.32 days post-burst. these results yield one of the earliest radio detectionsof a grb and demonstrate a clear rise in flux less than one day after thegamma-ray trigger followed by a rapid decline. this early time radio emissionprobably originates in the grb reverse shock so our ami light curve reveals thefirst ever confirmed detection of a reverse shock peak in the radio domain. atlater times (about 3.2 days post-burst) the rate of decline decreases,indicating that the forward shock component has begun to dominate thelight-curve. comparisons of the ami light curve with modelling conducted byperley et al. show that the most likely explanation of the early time 15.7 ghzpeak is caused by the self-absorption turn-over frequency, rather than the peakfrequency, of the reverse shock moving through the observing bands.

0802.3803	on the nature of late x-ray flares in swift gamma-ray bursts	previously detected in only a few gamma-ray bursts (grbs), x-ray flares arenow observed in ~50% of swift grbs, though their origins remain unclear. mostflares are seen early on in the afterglow decay, while some bursts exhibitflares at late times of 10^4 to 10^5 seconds, which may have implications forflare models.we investigate whether a sample of late time (&gt; 10^4s) flares aredifferent from previous samples of early time flares, or whether they aremerely examples on the tail of the early flare distribution. we examine thex-ray light curves of swift bursts for late flares and compare the flare andunderlying temporal power-law properties with those of early flares, and thevalues of these properties predicted by the blast wave model. the burst sampleshows late flare properties consistent with those of early flares, where themajority of the flares can be explained by either internal or external shock,though in a few cases one origin is favoured over the other. the underlyingpower laws are mainly consistent with the normal decay phases of the afterglow.if confirmed by the ever growing sample of late time flares, this would implythat, in some cases, prolonged activity out to a day or a restarting of thecentral engine is required.

1407.1053	constraining properties of grb magnetar central engines using the  observed plateau luminosity and duration correlation	an intrinsic correlation has been identified between the luminosity andduration of plateaus in the x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs;dainotti et al. 2008), suggesting a central engine origin. the magnetar centralengine model predicts an observable plateau phase, with plateau durations andluminosities being determined by the magnetic fields and spin periods of thenewly formed magnetar. this paper analytically shows that the magnetar centralengine model can explain, within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainties, the correlationbetween plateau luminosity and duration. the observed scatter in thecorrelation most likely originates in the spread of initial spin periods of thenewly formed magnetar and provides an estimate of the maximum spin period of~35 ms (assuming a constant mass, efficiency and beaming across the grbsample). additionally, by combining the observed data and simulations, we showthat the magnetar emission is most likely narrowly beamed and has $\lesssim$20%efficiency in conversion of rotational energy from the magnetar into theobserved plateau luminosity. the beaming angles and efficiencies obtained bythis method are fully consistent with both predicted and observed values. wefind that short grbs and short grbs with extended emission lie on the samecorrelation but are statistically inconsistent with being drawn from the samedistribution as long grbs, this is consistent with them having a wider beamingangle than long grbs.

1410.0489	circular polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 121024a	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are most probably powered by collimated relativisticoutflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. brightafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, whenmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet andthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. high values ofoptical polarization detected minutes after burst in grb 120308a indicate thepresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the centralengine (the power source of the grb). theoretical models predict low degrees oflinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, whenthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient mediumand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. here we report thedetection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of grb121024a, measured 0.15 days after the burst. we show that the circularpolarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dustscattering or plasma propagation effects. a possible explanation is to invokeanisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angledistributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce thecomplex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

1501.05251	dissecting magnetar variability with bayesian hierarchical models	neutron stars are a prime laboratory for testing physical processes underconditions of strong gravity, high density, and extreme magnetic fields. amongthe zoo of neutron star phenomena, magnetars stand out for their burstingbehaviour, ranging from extremely bright, rare giant flares to numerous, lessenergetic recurrent bursts. the exact trigger and emission mechanisms for thesebursts are not known; favoured models involve either a crust fracture andsubsequent energy release into the magnetosphere, or explosive reconnection ofmagnetic field lines. in the absence of a predictive model, understanding thephysical processes responsible for magnetar burst variability is difficult.here, we develop an empirical model that decomposes magnetar bursts into asuperposition of small spike-like features with a simple functional form, wherethe number of model components is itself part of the inference problem. thecascades of spikes that we model might be formed by avalanches of reconnection,or crust rupture aftershocks. using markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) samplingaugmented with reversible jumps between models with different numbers ofparameters, we characterise the posterior distributions of the model parametersand the number of components per burst. we relate these model parameters tophysical quantities in the system, and show for the first time that thevariability within a burst does not conform to predictions from ideas ofself-organised criticality. we also examine how well the properties of thespikes fit the predictions of simplified cascade models for the differenttrigger mechanisms.

1504.06642	the peculiar radio galaxy 4c 35.06: a case for recurrent agn activity?	using observations obtained with the low fequency array (lofar), thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and archival very large array (vla)data, we have traced the radio emission to large scales in the complex source4c 35.06 located in the core of the galaxy cluster abell 407. at higher spatialresolution (~4"), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offsetby about 11 kpc (in projection).  at 62 mhz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to210 kpc. at 1.4 ghz and intermediate spatial resolution (~30"), the structureappears to have a helical morphology.  we have derived the characteristics of the radio spectral index across thesource. we show that the source morphology is most likely the result of atleast two episodes of agn activity separated by a dormant period of around 35myr.  the agn is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of abell407. we propose that it is intermittently active as it moves in the denseenvironment in the cluster core. using lofar, we can trace the relic plasmafrom that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than everbefore.  using the the wsrt, we detect hi in absorption against the center of theradio source. the absorption profile is relatively broad (fwhm of 288 km/s),similar to what is found in other clusters.  understanding the duty cycle of the radio emission as well as the triggeringmechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provideimportant constraints to quantify the impact of agn feedback on galaxyevolution. the study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphologicaland spectral information promises to bring new important insights in thisfield.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1509.01257	the lofar multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss) i. survey  description and first results	we present the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss), the firstnorthern-sky lofar imaging survey. in this introductory paper, we firstdescribe in detail the motivation and design of the survey. compared toprevious radio surveys, msss is exceptional due to its intrinsic multifrequencynature providing information about the spectral properties of the detectedsources over more than two octaves (from 30 to 160 mhz). the broadbandfrequency coverage, together with the fast survey speed generated by lofar'smultibeaming capabilities, make msss the first survey of the sort anticipatedto be carried out with the forthcoming square kilometre array (ska). two of thesixteen frequency bands included in the survey were chosen to exactly overlapthe frequency coverage of large-area very large array (vla) and giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) surveys at 74 mhz and 151 mhz respectively. the surveyperformance is illustrated within the "msss verification field" (mvf), a regionof 100 square degrees centered at j2000 (ra,dec)=(15h,69deg). the msss resultsfrom the mvf are compared with previous radio survey catalogs. we assess theflux and astrometric uncertainties in the catalog, as well as the completenessand reliability considering our source finding strategy. we determine the 90%completeness levels within the mvf to be 100 mjy at 135 mhz with 108"resolution, and 550 mjy at 50 mhz with 166" resolution. images and catalogs forthe full survey, expected to contain 150,000-200,000 sources, will be releasedto a public web server. we outline the plans for the ongoing production of thefinal survey products, and the ultimate public release of images and sourcecatalogs.

1509.03931	the askap/emu source finding data challenge	the evolutionary map of the universe (emu) is a proposed radio continuumsurvey of the southern hemisphere up to declination +30 deg., with theaustralian square kilometre array pathfinder (askap). emu will use an automatedsource identification and measurement approach that is demonstrably optimal, tomaximise the reliability, utility and robustness of the resulting radio sourcecatalogues. as part of the process of achieving this aim, a "data challenge"has been conducted, providing international teams the opportunity to test avariety of source finders on a set of simulated images. the aim is to quantifythe accuracy of existing automated source finding and measurement approaches,and to identify potential limitations. the challenge attracted nine independentteams, who tested eleven different source finding tools. in addition, thechallenge initiators also tested the current askapsoft source-finding tool toestablish how it could benefit from incorporating successful features of theother tools. here we present the results of the data challenge, identifying thesuccesses and limitations for this broad variety of the current generation ofradio source finding tools. as expected, most finders demonstrate completenesslevels close to 100% at 10sigma dropping to levels around 10% by 5sigma. thereliability is typically close to 100% at 10sigma, with performance to lowersensitivities varying greatly between finders. all finders demonstrate theusual trade-off between completeness and reliability, whereby maintaining ahigh completeness at low signal-to-noise comes at the expense of reducedreliability, and vice-versa. we conclude with a series of recommendations forimproving the performance of the askapsoft source-finding tool.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1510.08122	a connection between plasma conditions near black hole event horizons  and outflow properties	accreting black holes are responsible for producing the fastest, mostpowerful outflows of matter in the universe. the formation process of powerfuljets close to black holes is poorly understood, and the conditions leading tojet formation are currently hotly debated. in this paper, we report anunambiguous empirical correlation between the properties of the plasma close tothe black hole and the particle acceleration properties within jets launchedfrom the central regions of accreting stellar-mass and supermassive blackholes. in these sources the emission of the plasma near the black hole ischaracterized by a power law at x-ray energies during times when the jets areproduced. we find that the photon index of this power law, which givesinformation on the underlying particle distribution, correlates with thecharacteristic break frequency in the jet spectrum, which is dependent onmagnetohydrodynamical processes in the outflow. the observed range in breakfrequencies varies by five orders of magnitude, in sources that span nineorders of magnitude in black hole mass, revealing a similarity of jetproperties over a large range of black hole masses powering these jets. thiscorrelation demonstrates that the internal properties of the jet rely mostcritically on the conditions of the plasma close to the black hole, rather thanother parameters such as the black hole mass or spin, and will provide abenchmark that should be reproduced by the jet formation models.

1512.00014	lofar msss: detection of a low-frequency radio transient in 400 hrs of  monitoring of the north celestial pole	we present the results of a four-month campaign searching for low-frequencyradio transients near the north celestial pole with the low-frequency array(lofar), as part of the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss). the datawere recorded between 2011 december and 2012 april and comprised 2149 11-minutesnapshots, each covering 175 deg^2. we have found one convincing candidateastrophysical transient, with a duration of a few minutes and a flux density at60 mhz of 15-25 jy. the transient does not repeat and has no obvious optical orhigh-energy counterpart, as a result of which its nature is unclear. thedetection of this event implies a transient rate at 60 mhz of 3.9 (+14.7, -3.7)x 10^-4 day^-1 deg^-2, and a transient surface density of 1.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2,at a 7.9-jy limiting flux density and ~10-minute time-scale. the campaign datawere also searched for transients at a range of other time-scales, from 0.5 to297 min, which allowed us to place a range of limits on transient rates at 60mhz as a function of observation duration.

1512.03016	orbital and superorbital variability of ls i +61 303 at low radio  frequencies with gmrt and lofar	ls i +61 303 is a gamma-ray binary that exhibits an outburst at ghzfrequencies each orbital cycle of $\approx$ 26.5 d and a superorbitalmodulation with a period of $\approx$ 4.6 yr. we have performed a detailedstudy of the low-frequency radio emission of ls i +61 303 by analysing all thearchival gmrt data at 150, 235 and 610 mhz, and conducting regular lofarobservations within the radio sky monitor (rsm) at 150 mhz. we have detectedthe source for the first time at 150 mhz, which is also the first detection ofa gamma-ray binary at such a low frequency. we have obtained the light-curvesof the source at 150, 235 and 610 mhz, all of them showing orbital modulation.the light-curves at 235 and 610 mhz also show the existence of superorbitalvariability. a comparison with contemporaneous 15-ghz data shows remarkabledifferences with these light-curves. at 15 ghz we see clear outbursts, whereasat low frequencies we see variability with wide maxima. the light-curve at 235mhz seems to be anticorrelated with the one at 610 mhz, implying a shift of$\sim$ 0.5 orbital phases in the maxima. we model the shifts between the maximaat different frequencies as due to changes in the physical parameters of theemitting region assuming either free-free absorption or synchrotronself-absorption, obtaining expansion velocities for this region close to thestellar wind velocity with both mechanisms.

astro-ph;0508385	broadband modeling of gamma-ray burst afterglows	according to the fireball model gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows are theresult of a shock pushed into the surrounding medium by an extremelyrelativistic outflow from the grb. by modeling the broadband spectrum, rangingfrom x-ray to radio wavelengths, on time scales of hours to years after thegrb, we can determine several burst parameters, e.g. the burst energy, thecircumburst medium density (and its gradient) and the energy contained inelectrons and the magnetic field. we have developed a code to do broadbandmodeling and determine the model parameters. we also performed monte carlosimulations with synthetic data sets in order to derive an estimate of theaccuracy of the best fit parameters. grb970508 was taken as a case study and wepresent our fitting results. we also present our wsrt radio observations ofgrb030329 at centimeter wavelengths and the results from modeling thisafterglow. the low frequency wsrt radio observations provide a uniquepossibility to study the late stages of the fireball evolution and examine thejet structure.

astro-ph;0508397	the radio afterglow of grb 030329 at centimeter wavelengths: evidence  for a structured jet or non-relativistic expansion	we present our centimeter wavelength (1.4, 2.3 and 4.8 ghz) light curves ofthe afterglow of grb 030329, which were obtained with the westerbork synthesisradio telescope. modeling the data according to a collimated afterglow resultsin a jet-break time of 10 days. this is in accordance with earlier resultsobtained at higher radio frequencies. however, with respect to the afterglowmodel, some additional flux at the lower frequencies is present when theselight curves reach their maximum after 40-80 days. we show that this additionalflux can be modeled with two or more components with progressively later jetbreaks. from these results we infer that the jet is in fact a structured or alayered jet, where the ejecta with lower lorentz factors produce additionalflux that becomes visible at late times in the lowest frequency bands. we showthat a transition to non-relativistic expansion of the fireball at late timescan also account for the observed flux excess, except for the lowest frequency(1.4 ghz) data.

astro-ph;0607110	prompt and afterglow emission properties of gamma-ray bursts with  spectroscopically identified supernovae	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the prompt and afterglow emissionof four nearby long-soft gamma-ray bursts (grbs 980425, 030329, 031203, and060218) that were spectroscopically found to be associated with type icsupernovae, and compare them to the general grb population. for each event, weinvestigate the spectral and luminosity evolution, and estimate the totalenergy budget based upon broadband observations. the observational inventoryfor these events has become rich enough to allow estimates of their energycontent in relativistic and sub-relativistic form. the result is a globalportrait of the effects of the physical processes responsible for producinglong-soft grbs. in particular, we find that the values of the energy releasedin mildly relativistic outflows appears to have a significantly smaller scatterthan those found in highly relativistic ejecta. this is consistent with apicture in which the energy released inside the progenitor star is roughlystandard, while the fraction of that energy that ends up in highly relativisticejecta outside the star can vary dramatically between different events.

0809.1559	robust photometric redshift determinations of gamma-ray burst afterglows  at z &gt; 2	theory suggests that about 10% of swift-detected gamma-ray bursts (grbs) willoriginate at redshifts greater than 5 yet a number of high redshift candidatesmay be left unconfirmed due to the lack of measured redshifts. here weintroduce our code, grbz, a method of simultaneous multi-parameter fitting ofgrb afterglow optical and near infrared, spectral energy distributions. itallows for early determinations of the photometric redshift, spectral index andhost extinction to be made. we assume that grb afterglow spectra are wellrepresented by a power-law decay and model the effects of absorption due to thelyman forest and host extinction. we use a genetic algorithm-based routine tosimultaneously fit the parameters of interest, and a monte carlo erroranalysis. we use grbs of previously determined spectroscopic redshifts to proveour method, while also introducing new near infrared data of grb 990510 whichfurther constrains the value of the host extinction. our method is effective inestimating the photometric redshift of grbs, relatively unbiased by assumptionsof the afterglow spectral index or the host galaxy extinction. monte carloerror analysis is required as the method of error estimate based on the optimumpopulation of the genetic algorithm underestimates errors significantly.

astro-ph;0610899	gamma-ray burst afterglows as probes of environment and blastwave  physics i: absorption by host galaxy gas and dust	we use a new approach to obtain limits on the absorbing columns towards aninitial sample of 10 long gamma-ray bursts observed with bepposax and selectedon the basis of their good optical and nir coverage, from simultaneous fits tonir, optical and x-ray afterglow data, in count space and including the effectsof metallicity. in no cases is a mw-like extinction preferred, when testing mw,lmc and smc extinction laws. the 2175a bump would in principle be detectable inall these afterglows, but is not present in the data. an smc-like gas-to-dustratio or lower value can be ruled out for 4 of the hosts analysed here(assuming smc metallicity and extinction law) whilst the remainder of thesample have too large an error to discriminate. we provide a more accurateestimate of the line-of-sight extinction and improve upon the uncertainties forthe majority of the extinction measurements made in previous studies of thissample. we discuss this method to determine extinction values in comparisonwith the most commonly employed existing methods.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.

0812.2813	testing the blast wave model with swift grbs	the complex structure of the light curves of swift grbs has made theidentification of breaks, and the interpretation of the blast wave caused bythe burst, more difficult than in the pre-swift era. we aim to identify breaks,which are possibly hidden, and to constrain the blast wave parameters; electronenergy distribution, p, density profile of the circumburst medium, k, and thecontinued energy injection index, q. we do so by comparing the observedmulti-wavelength light curves and x-ray spectra of our sample to thepredictions of the blast wave model.  we can successfully interpret all of the bursts in our sample of 10, excepttwo, within this framework and we can estimate, with confidence, the electronenergy distribution index for 6 of the sample. furthermore we identify jetbreaks in a number of the bursts. a statistical analysis of the distribution ofp reveals that, even in the most conservative case of least scatter, the valuesare not consistent with a single, universal value. the values of k suggest thatthe circumburst density profiles are not drawn from only one of the constantdensity or wind-like media populations.
