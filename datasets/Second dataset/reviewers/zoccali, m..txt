0901.4476	radial extent of the sgb in ngc 1851	recent hst-acs observations revealed the presence of a double subgiant branch(sgb) in the core of the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851. this peculiaritywas tentatively explained by the presence of a second population with either anage difference of about 1 gyr, or a higher c+n+o abundance, probably due topollution by the first generation of stars.  in the present letter, we analyze vlt-fors v,i images, covering 12.7x12.7arcmin, in the southwest quadrant of the cluster, allowing us to probe theextent of the double sgb from ~1.4 to ~13 arcmin from the cluster center. ourstudy reveals, for the first time, that the "peculiar" population is the oneassociated to the fainter sgb. indeed, while the percentage of stars in thissequence is about 45% in the cluster core (as previously found on the basis ofhst-acs data), we find that it drops sharply, to a level consistent with zeroin our data, at ~2.4 arcmin from the cluster center, where the brighter sgb, inour sample, still contains ~100 stars. implications for the proposed scenariosare discussed.

0907.4372	li-rich rgb stars in the galactic bulge	we present lithium abundance determination for a sample of k giant stars inthe galactic bulge. the stars presented here are the only 13 stars withdetectable lithium line (6767.18 a) among ~400 stars for which we have spectrain this wavelength range, half of them in baade's window (b=-4) and half in afield at b=-6. the stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph offlames@vlt, with a spectral resolution of r~20,000. abundances were derived viaspectral synthesis and the results are compared with those for stars withsimilar parameters, but no detectable li line. we find 13 stars with adetectable li line, among which 2 have abundances a(li)&gt;2.7. no clearcorrelations were found between the li abundance and those of other elements.with the exception of the two most li rich stars, the others follow a fairlytight a(li)-t_eff correlation. it would seems that there must be a liproduction phase during the red giant branch (rgb), acting either on a veryshort timescale, or selectively only in some stars. the proposed li productionphase associated with the rgb bump cannot be excluded, although our targets aresignificantly brighter than the predicted rgb bump magnitude for a populationat 8 kpc

0908.3603	vlt-flames analysis of 8 giants in the bulge metal-poor globular cluster  ngc 6522: oldest cluster in the galaxy?	ngc 6522 has been the first metal-poor globular cluster identified in thebulge by w. baade. despite its importance, very few high resolution abundanceanalyses of stars in this cluster are available in the literature. the bulgemetal-poor clusters may be important tracers of the early chemical enrichmentof the galaxy. the main purpose of this study is the determination ofmetallicity and elemental ratios in individual stars of ngc 6522. highresolution spectra of 8 giants of the bulge globular cluster ngc 6522 wereobtained at the 8m vlt ut2-kueyen telescope with the flames+giraffespectrograph. multiband v,i,j,ks} photometry was used to derive effectivetemperatures as reference values. spectroscopic parameters are derived from feiand feii lines, and adopted for the derivation of abundance ratios. the presentanalysis provides a metallicity [fe/h] = -1.0+-0.2. the alpha-elements oxygen,magnesium and silicon show [o/fe]=+0.4, [mg/fe]=[si/fe]= +0.25, whereas calciumand titanium show shallower ratios of [ca/fe]=[ti/fe]=+0.15. theneutron-capture r-process element europium appears to be overabundant by[eu/fe]=+0.4. the neutron-capture s-elements la and ba are enhanced by[la/fe]=+0.35 and [ba/fe]=+0.5. the large internal errors, indicating the largestar-to-star variationin the ba and eu abundances, are also discussed. themoderate metallicity combined to a blue horizontal branch (bhb), arecharacteristics similar to those of hp~1 and ngc 6558, pointing to a populationof very old globular clusters in the galactic bulge. also, the abundance ratiosin ngc 6522 resemble those in hp 1 and ngc 6558. the ultimate conclusion isthat the bulge is old, and went through an early prompt chemical enrichment.

0910.0448	chemical abundances for 11 bulge stars from high-resolution, near-ir  spectra	it is debated whether the milky way bulge has the characteristics of aclassical bulge sooner than those of a pseudobulge. detailed abundance studiesof bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classificationof the bulge. the aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulgeand to study detailed abundances determined from near-ir spectra for bulgegiants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing thestellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the presentstudy. especially, the important cno elements are better determined in thenear-ir. high-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the h band are recordedusing the crires spectrometer on the very large telescope. the cno abundancescan all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength rangeobserved. abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-irspectra. [o/fe], [si/fe] and [s/fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of atleast [fe/h]=-0.3, after which they decline. this suggests that the milky waybulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of aclassical bulge. however, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend ofthe local thick disk seems present. such a similarity could suggest that thebulge has a pseudobulge origin. our [c/fe] trend does not show any increasewith [fe/h] which could have been expected if w-r stars have contributedsubstantially to the c abundances. no "cosmic scatter" can be traced around ourobserved abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given theobservational uncertainties.

0910.4892	millimagnitude photometry for transiting extrasolar planetary  candidates. v. follow-up of 30 ogle transits. new candidates	we used vlt/vimos images in the v band to obtain light curves of extrasolarplanetary transits ogle-tr-111 and ogle-tr-113, and candidate planetarytransits: ogle-tr-82, ogle-tr-86, ogle-tr-91, ogle-tr-106, ogle-tr-109,ogle-tr-110, ogle-tr-159, ogle-tr-167, ogle-tr-170, ogle-tr-171. usingdifference imaging photometry, we were able to achieve millimagnitude errors inthe individual data points. we present the analysis of the data and the lightcurves, by measuring transit amplitudes and ephemerides, and by calculatinggeometrical parameters for some of the systems. we observed 9 ogle objects atthe predicted transit moments. two other transits were shifted in time by a fewhours. for another seven objects we expected to observe transits during thevimos run, but they were not detected. the stars ogle-tr-111 and ogle-tr-113are probably the only ogle objects in the observed sample to host planets, withthe other objects being very likely eclipsing binaries or multiple systems. inthis paper we also report on four new transiting candidates which we have foundin the data.

0912.0824	on a new near-infrared method to estimate the absolute ages of star  clusters: ngc3201 as a first test case	we present a new method to estimate the absolute ages of stellar systems.this method is based on the difference in magnitude between the main sequenceturn-off (msto) and a well defined knee located along the lower main sequence(msk). this feature is caused by the collisionally induced absorption ofmolecular hydrogen and it can be easily identified in near-infrared (nir) andin optical-nir color-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems. we took advantageof deep and accurate nir images collected with the multi-conjugate adaptiveoptics demonstrator temporarily available on the very large telescope and ofoptical images collected with the advanced camera for surveys wide field cameraon the hubble space telescope and with ground-based telescopes to estimate theabsolute age of the globular ngc3201 using both the msto and thedelta(msto-msk). we have adopted a new set of cluster isochrones and we foundthat the absolute ages based on the two methods agree to within one sigma.however, the errors of the ages based on the delta(msto-msk) method arepotentially more than a factor of two smaller, since they are not affected byuncertainties in cluster distance or reddening.current isochrones appear topredict slightly bluer (~0.05mag) nir and optical-nir colors than observed formagnitudes fainter than the msk.

1005.3919	insights on the milky way bulge formation from the correlations between  kinematics and metallicity	two main scenarios for the formation of the galactic bulge are invoked, thefirst one through gravitational collapse or hierarchical merging of subclumps,the second through secular evolution of the galactic disc. we aim to constrainthe formation of the galactic bulge through studies of the correlation betweenkinematics and metallicities in baade's window (l=1, b=-4) and two other fieldsalong the bulge minor axis (l=0, b=-6 and b=-12). we combine the radialvelocity and the [fe/h] measurements obtained with flames/giraffe at the vltwith a spectral resolution of r=20000, plus for the baade's window field theogle-ii proper motions, and compare these with published n-body simulations ofthe galactic bulge. we confirm the presence of two distinct populations inbaade's window found in hill et al. 2010: the metal-rich population presentsbar-like kinematics while the metal-poor population shows kinematicscorresponding to an old spheroid or a thick disc one. in this context themetallicity gradient along the bulge minor axis observed by zoccali et al.(2008), visible also in the kinematics, can be related to a varying mix ofthese two populations as one moves away from the galactic plane, alleviatingthe apparent contradiction between the kinematic evidence of a bar and theexistence of a metallicity gradient. we show evidences that the two mainscenarios for the bulge formation co-exist within the milky way bulge.

0708.1736	the peculiar horizontal branch morphology of the galactic globular  clusters ngc 6388 and ngc 6441: new insights from uv observations	in this paper we present multiband optical and uv hubble space telescopephotometry of the two galactic globular clusters ngc 6388 and ngc 6441. we haveobtained the first uv color-magnitude diagrams for ngc 6388 and ngc 6441. thesediagrams confirm previous results, obtained in optical bands, about thepresence of a sizeable stellar population of extremely hot horizontal branchstars. at least in ngc 6388, we find a clear indication that at the hot end ofthe horizontal branch the distribution of stars forms a hook-like feature,closely resembling those observed in ngc 2808 and omega centauri. we brieflyreview the theoretical scenarios that have been suggested for interpreting thisobservational feature. we also investigate the tilted horizontal branchmorphology and provide further evidence that supports early suggestions thatthis feature cannot be interpreted as an effect of differential reddening. weshow that a possible solution of the puzzle is to assume that a small fraction- ranging between 10-20% - of the stellar population in the two clusters isstrongly helium enriched (y=0.40 in ngc 6388 and y=0.35 in ngc 6441). theoccurrence of a spread in the he abundance between the canonical value (y=0.26)and the quoted upper limits can significantly help in explaining the wholemorphology of the horizontal branch and the pulsational properties of thevariable stars in the target clusters.

1009.1589	low-resolution spectroscopy of main sequence stars belonging to 12  galactic globular clusters. i. ch and cn band strength variations	globular clusters show abundance variations for light elements that are notyet well understood. the preferred explanation involves a self-enrichmentscenario, with two subsequent generations of stars. observations of mainsequence stars allow us to investigate the signature of this chemicallyprocessed material without the complicating effects of internal mixing. ourgoal is to investigate the c-n anti-correlation with low-resolutionspectroscopy of 20-50 stars fainter than the first dredge-up in seven globularclusters (ngc288, ngc1851, ngc5927, ngc6352, ngc6388, and pal12) with differentproperties. we complemented our observations with 47~tuc archival data, withfour additional clusters from the literature (m15, m22, m55, ngc362), and withadditional literature data on ngc288. in this first paper, we measured thestrength of cn and ch band indices, and we investigated the anti-correlationand bimodality of these indices. we compared r_cn, the ratio of stars belongingto the cn-strong and weak groups, with 15 different cluster parameters. weclearly see bimodal anti-correlation of the ch and cn band stregths in themetal-rich clusters (pal12, 47tuc, ngc6352, ngc5927). only m15 among themetal-poor clusters shows a clearly bimodal anti-correlation. we found weakcorrelations (sligthly above 1 sigma) of r_cn with the cluster orbitalparameters, present-day total mass, cluster concentration, and age. ourfindings support the self-enrichment scenario, and suggest that the occurrenceof more than two major generations of stars in a ggc should be rare. smalladditional generations (&lt;10-20% of the total) would be difficult to detect withour samples. the first generation, which corresponds to the cn-weak stars,usually contains more stars than the second one (&lt;r_cn&gt;=0.82+/-0.29), asopposed to results based on the na-o anti-correlations.

1106.2734	on a new parameter to estimate the helium content in old stellar systems	we introduce a new parameter {\delta}{\xi} - the difference in magnitudebetween the red giant branch (rgb) bump and a point on the main sequence (ms)at the same color as the bump, the "benchmark" - to estimate the helium contentin old stellar systems. its sensitivity to helium is linear over the entiremetallicity range, it is minimally affected by age, uncertainties in thephotometric zero-point, reddening or the effects of evolution on the horizontalbranch. the two main drawbacks are the need for precise and large photometricdata sets, and a strong dependence of the {\delta}y/{\delta}{\xi} slope onmetallicity. to test the {\delta}{\xi} parameter we selected 22 galacticglobular clusters (ggcs) with low foreground reddening, a broad range of ironabundance and precise, relatively deep, and homogeneous multi-band (b,v,i)photometry. we found that the observed {\delta}{\xi} and those predicted from{\alpha}-enhanced models agree quite well if we assume y=0.20. comparison withcanonical primordial helium content models (y=0.245, {\delta}y/{\delta}z=1.4)indicates that the observed {\delta}{\xi} values are systematically smallerthan predicted. the outcome is the same if predicted parameters are based onmodels that take into account also cno enhancements and becomes even larger ifwe consider he-enhanced models. these findings suggest that current stellarevolutionary models overestimate the luminosity of the rgb bump. we also foundthat including envelope overshooting can eliminate the discrepancy, asoriginally suggested by alongi et al. (1993, aaps, 97, 851). the {\delta}{\xi}parameter of ggcs, in spite of the possible limitations concerning the inputphysics of current evolutionary models, provides an independent detection ofpre-stellar helium at least at the 5{\sigma} level.

1107.5199	the metallicity distribution of bulge clump giants in baade's window	we seek to constrain the formation of the galactic bulge by means ofanalysing the detailed chemical composition of a large sample of red clumpstars in baade's window. we measure [fe/h] in a sample of 219 bulge red clumpstars from r=20000 resolution spectra obtained with flames/giraffe at the vlt,using an automatic procedure, differentially to the metal-rich local referencestar muleo. for a subsample of 162 stars, we also derive [mg/h] from spectralsynthesis around the mgi triplet at 6319a. the fe and mg metallicitydistributions are both asymmetric, with median values of +0.16 and +0.21respectively. the iron distribution is clearly bimodal, as revealed both by adeconvolution (from observational errors) and a gaussian decomposition. thedecomposition of the observed fe and mg metallicity distributions into gaussiancomponents yields two populations of equal sizes (50% each): a metal-poorcomponent centred around [fe/h]=-0.30 and [mg/h]=-0.06 with a large dispersionand a narrow metal-rich component centred around [fe/h]=+0.32 and [mg/h]=+0.35.the metal poor component shows high [mg/fe] ratios (around 0.3) whereas starsin the metal rich component are found to have near solar ratios. babusiaux etal. (2010) also find kinematical differences between the two components: themetal poor component shows kinematics compatible with an old spheroid whereasthe metal rich component is consistent with a population supporting a bar. inview of their chemical and kinematical properties, we suggest differentformation scenarios for the two populations: a rapid formation timescale as anold spheroid for the metal poor component (old bulge) and for the metal richcomponent, a formation over a longer time scale driven by the evolution of thebar (pseudo-bulge).

1110.0925	the inner galactic bar traced by the vvv survey	we use the vvv survey observations in bulge regions close to the galacticplane to trace the bar inclination at the galactic latitude b\sim\pm1{\deg} andto investigate a distinct structure in the inner regions of the bar that waspreviously detected at positive latitude (b=+1{\deg}). we use the (j-ks) colorsof the red clump stars to obtain reddening values on 6 x 6 arcmin scale,minimizing the problems arising from differential extinction. dereddenedmagnitudes are then used to build the luminosity function of the bulge inregions of ~0.4 sq deg to obtain the mean red clump magnitudes. these are usedas distance indicators to trace the bar structure. the luminosity functionclearly shows the red clump mean magnitude variation with longitude, asexpected from a large scale bar oriented towards us at positive galacticlongitude, with a dereddened magnitude varying from ks_0=13.4 at l=-10{\deg} toks_0=12.4 at l=+10{\deg}. we detect a change in the orientation of the bar inthe central regions with |l|&lt;4{\deg} at b=\pm1{\deg}, in agreement with resultsobtained at positive latitudes by other authors. our results are based on adifferent dataset and at different latitude, which shows that this change inthe bar orientation is real. this suggests that there is an inner structuredistinct to the large-scale galactic bar, with a different orientation angle.this inner structure could be a secondary, inner bar, with a semi-major axis of~500 pc that is symmetric with respect to the galactic plane.

1110.5221	a spectroscopic survey of thick disc stars outside the solar  neighbourhood	we performed a spectroscopic survey of nearly 700 stars probing the galacticthick disc far from the solar neighbourhood towards the galactic coordinates(l~277, b~47). the derived effective temperatures, surface gravities andoverall metallicities were then combined with stellar evolution isochrones,radial velocities and proper motions to derive the distances, kinematics andorbital parameters of the sample stars. the targets belonging to each galacticcomponent (thin disc, thick disc, halo) were selected either on theirkinematics or according to their position above the galactic plane, and thevertical gradients were also estimated. we present here atmospheric parameters,distances and kinematics for this sample, and a comparison of our kinematic andmetallicity distributions with the besancon model of the milky way. the thickdisc far from the solar neighbourhood is found to differ only slightly from thethick disc properties as derived in the solar vicinity. for regions where thethick disc dominates, we measured vertical velocity and metallicity trends ofd(v_phi)/dz = 19 +/- 8 km/s/kpc and d[m/h]/dz = -0.14 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc,respectively. these trends can be explained as a smooth transition between thedifferent galactic components, although intrinsic gradients could not beexcluded. in addition, a correlation d(v_phi)/d[m/h] = -45 +/- 12 km/s/dexbetween the orbital velocity and the metallicity of the thick disc is detected.this gradient is inconsistent with the sdss photometric survey analysis, whichdid not detect any such trend, and challenges radial migration models of thickdisc formation. estimations of the scale heights and scale lengths fordifferent metallicity bins of the thick disc result in consistent values, withhr~3.4 \pm 0.7 kpc, and hz~694 \pm 45 pc, showing no evidence of relics ofdestroyed massive satellites.

1202.6176	c and n abundances of ms and sgb stars in ngc 1851	we present the first chemical analysis of stars on the double subgiant branch(sgb) of the globular cluster ngc 1851. we obtained 48 magellan imacs spectraof subgiants and fainter stars covering the spectral region between3650-6750\aa, to derive c and n abundances from the spectral features at4300\aa (g-band) and at ~ 3883\aa (cn). we added to our sample ~ 45 unvevolvedstars previously observed with fors2 at the vlt. these two datasets werehomogeneously reduced and analyzed. we derived abundances of c and n for atotal of 64 stars and found considerable star-to-star variations in both [c/h]and [n/h] at all luminosities extending to the red giant branch (rgb) base(v~18.9). these abundances appear to be strongly anticorrelated, as would beexpected from the cn-cycle enrichment, but we did not detect any bimodality inthe c or n content. we used hst and ground-based photometry to select twogroups of faint- and bright-sgb stars from the visual and str\"omgrencolor-magnitude diagrams. significant variations in the carbon and nitrogenabundances are present among stars of each group, which indicates that each sgbhosts multiple subgenerations of stars. bright- and faint-sgb stars differ inthe total c+n content, where the fainter sgb have about 2.5 times the c+ncontent of the brighter ones. coupling our results with literature photometricdata and abundance determinations from high-resolution studies, we identify thefainter sgb with the red-rgb population, which also should be richer on averagein ba and other s-process elements, as well as in na and n, when compared tobrighter sgb and the blue-rgb population.

1204.4004	reddening and metallicity maps of the milky way bulge from vvv and 2mass  ii. the complete high resolution extinction map and implications for bulge  studies	we use the vista variables in the via lactea (vvv) eso public survey data tomeasure extinction values in the complete area of the galactic bulge covered bythe survey at high resolution. we derive reddening values using the methoddescribed in paper i. this is based on measuring the mean (j-ks) color of redclump giants in small subfields of 2' to 6' in the following bulge area:-10.3&lt;b&lt;+5.1 and -10&lt;l&lt;+10.4. to determine the reddening values e(j-ks) foreach region, we measure the rc color and compare it to the (j-ks) color of rcstars measured in baade's window, for which we adopt e(b-v)=0.55. this allowsus to construct a reddening map sensitive to small scale variations minimizingthe problems arising from differential extinction. the significant reddeningvariations are clearly observed on spatial scales as small as 2'. we find agood agreement between our extinction measurements and schlegel maps in theouter bulge, but, as already stated in the literature the schlegel maps are notreliable for regions within |b| &lt; 6. in the inner regions we compare ourresults with maps derived from denis and spitzer surveys. while we find goodagreement with other studies in the corresponding overlapping regions, ourextinction map has better quality due to both higher resolution and a morecomplete spatial coverage in the bulge. we investigate the importance ofdifferential reddening and demonstrate the need for high resolution extinctionmaps for detailed studies of bulge stellar populations and structure. theextinction variations on scales of up to 2'-6', must be taken into account whenanalysing the stellar populations of the bulge.

1302.0243	reddening and metallicity maps of the milky way bulge from vvv and 2mass  iii. the first global photometric metallicity map of the galactic bulge	we investigate the large scale metallicity distribution in the galacticbulge, using a large spatial coverage, in order to constrain the bulgeformation scenario. we use the vista variables in the via lactea (vvv) surveydata and 2mass photometry, covering 320 sqdeg of the galactic bulge, to derivephotometric metallicities by interpolating of the (j-ks)0 colors of individualred giant branch stars based on a set of globular cluster ridge lines. we thenuse this information to construct the first global metallicity map of the bulgewith a resolution of 30'x45'. the metallicity map of the bulge revealed a clearvertical metallicity gradient of ~0.04 dex/deg (~0.28 dex/kpc), with metal-richstars ([fe/h]~0) dominating the inner bulge in regions closer to the galacticplane (|b|&lt;5). at larger scale heights, the mean metallicity of the bulgepopulation becomes significantly more metal-poor. this fits in the scenario ofa boxy-bulge originated from the vertical inestability of the galactic bar,formed early via secular evolution of a two component stellar disk. older,metal-poor stars dominate at higher scale heights due to the non-mixed orbitsfrom the originally hotter thick disk stars.

1304.6427	3d kinematics through the x-shaped milky way bulge	it has recently been discovered that the galactic bulge is x-shaped, with thetwo southern arms of the x both crossing the lines of sight at l=0 and |b|&gt;4,hence producing a double red clump (rc) in the bulge cmd. dynamical modelspredict the formation of x-shaped bulges, as extreme cases of boxy-peanutbulges. however, since x-shaped bulges were known to be present only inexternal galaxies, models have never been compared to 3d kinematical data forindividual stars. we study the orbital motion of galactic bulge stars, in thetwo arms of the x in the southern hemisphere. the goal is to provideobservational constraints to bulge formation models that predict the formationof x-shapes through bar dynamical instabilities. radial velocities have beenobtained for a sample of 454 bulge giants, roughly equally distributed betweenthe bright and faint rc, in a field at (l,b)=(0,-6). proper motions werederived for all rc stars in the same field by combining images from two epochsobtained 11 years apart. the proper motions for the spectroscopic subsample areanalyzed taking into account the radial velocities and metallicities measuredfrom near-ir calcium triplet lines, for a subsample of 352 stars. the radialvelocity distribution of stars in the bright rc, tracing the closer overdensityof bulge stars, shows an excess of stars moving towards the sun. similarly, anexcess of stars receding from the sun is seen in the far overdensity, traced byfaint rc stars. this is explained with the presence of stars on elongatedorbits, most likely streaming along the arms of the x-shaped bulge. propermotions for these stars are consistent with qualitative predictions ofdynamical models of peanut-shaped bulges. surprisingly, stars on elongatedorbits have preferentially metal poor metallicities, while the metal rich ones,in both overdensities, are preferentially found in more axysimmetric orbits.

1309.4570	stellar ages through the corners of the boxy bulge	in some scenarios for the formation of the milky way bulge the stellarpopulation at the edges of the boxy bulge may be younger than those on theminor axis, or close to the galactic center. so far the only bulge region wheredeep color-magnitude diagrams have been obtained is indeed along the minoraxis. to overcome this limitation, we aim at age-dating the bulge stellarpopulations far away from the bulge minor axis. color-magnitude diagrams andluminosity functions have been obtained from deep near-ir vlt/hawk-i imagestaken at the two southern corners of the boxy bulge, i.e., near the oppositeedges of the galactic bar. the foreground disk contamination has beenstatistically removed using a pure disk field observed with the same instrumentand located approximately at similar galactic latitudes of the two bulgefields, and 30deg in longitude away from the galactic center. for each bulgefield, mean reddening and distance are determined using the position of redclump stars, and the metallicity distribution is derived photometrically usingthe color distribution of stars in the upper red giant branch. the resultingmetallicity distribution function of both fields peaks around [fe/h] -0.1 dex,with the bulk of the stellar population having a metallicity within the range:-1 dex &lt; [fe/h] &lt;+0.4 dex, quite similar to that of other inner bulge fields.like for the inner fields previously explored, the color-magnitude diagrams ofthe two bar fields are consistent with their stellar population being olderthan ~10 gyr, with no obvious evidence for the presence of a youngerpopulation.

1508.02576	the giraffe inner bulge survey (gibs) ii. metallicity distributions and  alpha element abundances at fixed galactic latitude	high resolution (r$\sim$22,500) spectra for 400 red clump giants, in fourfields within $\rm -4.8^{\circ} \lesssim b \lesssim -3.4^{\circ}$ and $\rm-10^{\circ} \lesssim l \lesssim +10^{\circ}$, were obtained within the giraffeinner bulge survey (gibs) project. to this sample we added another $\sim$ 400stars in baade's window, observed with the identical instrumentalconfiguration. we constructed the metallicity distributions for the entiresample, as well as for each field individually, in order to investigate thepresence of gradients or field-to-field variations in the shape of thedistributions. the metallicity distributions in the five fields are consistentwith being drawn from a single parent population, indicating the absence of agradient along the major axis of the galactic bar. the global metallicitydistribution is well fitted by two gaussians. the metal poor component israther broad, with a mean at $\rm &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.31$ dex and $\sigma=0.31$ dex.the metal-rich one is narrower, with mean $\rm &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=+0.26$ and $\sigma=0.2$dex. the [mg/fe] ratio follows a tight trend with [fe/h], with enhancement withrespect to solar in the metal-poor regime, similar to the one observed forgiant stars in the local thick disc. [ca/fe] abundances follow a similar trend,but with a considerably larger scatter than [mg/fe]. a decrease in [mg/fe] isobserved at $\rm [fe/h]=-0.44$ dex. this \textit{knee} is in agreement with ourprevious bulge study of k-giants along the minor axis, but is 0.1 dex lower inmetallicity than the one reported for the bulge micro lensed dwarf andsub-giant stars. we found no variation in $\alpha$-element abundancedistributions between different fields.

astro-ph;0003003	galactic globular clusters as a test for very low-mass stellar models	we make use of the next generation model atmospheres by allard et al.

astro-ph;0003004	on the helium content of galactic globular clusters via the r parameter	we estimate the empirical r parameter in 26 galactic globular clusterscovering a wide metallicity range, imaged by wfpc2 on board the hst. theimproved spatial resolution permits a large fraction of the evolved stars to bemeasured and permits accurate assessment of radial populaton gradients andcompleteness corrections. in order to evaluate both the he abundance and the heto metal enrichment ratio, we construct a large set of evolutionary models byadopting similar metallicities and different he contents. we find an absolutehe abundance which is lower than that estimated from spectroscopic measurementsin hii regions and from primordial nucleosynthesis models. this discrepancycould be removed by adopting a c12o16 nuclear cross section about a factor oftwo smaller than the canonical value, although also different assumptions formixing processes can introduce systematical effects. the trend in the rparameter toward solar metallicity is consistent with an upper limit to the heto metal enrichment ratio of the order of 2.5.

0705.4030	distances of the bulge globular clusters terzan 5, liller 1, uks 1 and  terzan 4 based on hst nicmos photometry	a large number of pulsars and x-rays sources are detected in globularclusters. to understand the structure and content of these clusters, accuratedistances are required. we derive the distances of terzan 5, liller 1 and uks 1using as a reference a recent distance determination of ngc 6528, based onhst/nicmos and ntt/sofi infrared photometry. the distance of the metal-poorcluster terzan 4 was derived from a comparison with m92 in nicmos bands.distances of the metal-rich clusters are obtained by comparison of thehorizontal branch (hb) level of the clusters, relative to the reddening linepassing through the hb of ngc 6528. we use methods based on nicmos bands andtransformations to j and h magnitudes with different assumptions. liller~1 andterzan~4 are found to be at the central bulge distance, uks~1 is beyond thegalactic center, while terzan 5 is closer to the sun than the other fourclusters. the distance of terzan 5 is of paramount importance, given the impactof its population of 21 pulsars, which is related to the high cluster density.the distance of terzan 5 is found to be d$_{\odot}$=5.5$\pm$0.9 kpc from thesun, thus closer to us than values given in studies of pulsars in terzan 5. asa consequence, the higher cluster density is even more favourable for formationof the millisecond pulsars recently detected in this cluster.

astro-ph;0505252	on the horizontal branch of the galactic globular ngc2808	we present new uv (f218w) data for stars in the central region of thegalactic globular cluster ngc2808, collected with the wfpc2 camera on board ofthe hubble space telescope. these data together with f439w and f555w-band dataand previous ground based observations provide a multifrequency coverage of thecluster stellar population extending up to a distance of 1.7 times the clustercore radius. we discuss this complete sample of stars, which includes 764 redgiant branch (rgb) stars brighter than the horizontal branch (hb) luminositylevel, 1239 hb stars, 119 asymptotic giant branch (agb), and 22 agb-manque'stellar structures. as already known, we find that blue hb stars separate intothree distinct groups. however, our multiband photometry indicates that severalstars in the two hotter hb groups show a flat spectrum, thus suggesting thebinarity of these objects. artificial star experiments suggest that at most 50%of them might be photometric blends. moreover, at variance with previous claimsone finds that canonical zero age horizontal branch (zahb) models do reacheffective temperatures typical of observed hot hb stars. we also show that theratio between hb and rgb stars brighter than the hb luminosity level steadlyincreases when moving from the cluster center to the periphery, passing fromr=1.37 +/- 0.14 in the cluster core to r=1.95 +/- 0.26 in the outer clusterregions. we discuss the possible origin of such a radial gradient in thecontext of the blue tails phenomenon, advancing some suggestions concerning theclumpy stellar distribution along the hb.

astro-ph;0511033	dynamical mass estimates for two luminous star clusters in galactic  merger remnants	we present high-dispersion spectra of two extremely massive star clusters ingalactic merger remnants. one cluster, w30, is located in the ~500 myr oldmerger remnant ngc 7252 and has a velocity dispersion and effective radius ofsigma=27.5+-2.5 km/s and r_eff=9.3+-1.7 pc, respectively. the other cluster,g114, located in the ~3 gyr old merger remnant ngc 1316, is much more compact,r_eff=4.08+-0.55 pc, and has a velocity dispersion of sigma=42.1+-2.8 km/s.these measurements allow an estimate of the virial mass of the two clusters,yielding m_dyn(w30)=1.59(+-0.26) * 10^7 msun and m_dyn(g114)=1.64(+-0.13) *10^7msun. both clusters are extremely massive, being more than three times heavierthan the most massive globular clusters in the galaxy. for both clusters wemeasure light-to-mass ratios, which when compared to simple stellar population(ssp) models of the appropriate age, are consistent with a kroupa-type stellarmass function. using measurements from the literature we find a strong agedependence on how well ssp models (with underlying kroupa or salpeter-typestellar mass functions) fit the light-to-mass ratio of clusters. based on thisresult we suggest that the large scatter in the light-to-mass ratio of theyoungest clusters is not due to variations in the underlying stellar massfunction, but instead to the rapidly changing internal dynamics of youngclusters. finally, based on the positions of old globular clusters, youngmassive clusters (ymcs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) and dwarf-globulartransition objects (dgtos) in kappa-space we conclude that 1) ucds and dgtosare consistent with the high mass end of star clusters and 2) ymcs occupy amuch larger parameter space than old globular clusters, consistent with theidea of preferential disruption of star clusters.

astro-ph;0512366	dwarf elliptical galaxies in centaurus a group: stellar populations in  am 1339-445 and am 1343-452	we study the red giant populations of two de galaxies, am 1339-445 and am1343-452, with the aim of investigating the number and luminosity of any upperasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars present. the galaxies are members of thecentaurus a group (d~3.8 mpc) and are classified as outlying (r~350 kpc)satellites of cen a. the analysis is based on near-ir photometry for individualred giant stars, derived from images obtained with isaac on the vlt. thephotometry, along with optical data derived from wfpc2 images retrieved fromthe hst science archive, enable us to investigate the stellar populations ofthe des in the vicinity of the red giant branch (rgb) tip. in both systems wefind stars above the rgb tip, which we interpret as intermediate-age upper-agbstars. the presence of such stars is indicative of extended star formation inthese des similar to that seen in many, but not all, des in the local group.for am 1339-445, the brightest of the upper-agb stars have mbol~-4.5 whilethose in am 1343-452 have mbol~-4.8 mag. these luminosities suggest ages ofapproximately 6.5+/-1 and 4+/-1 gyr as estimates for the epoch of the lastepisode of significant star formation in these systems. in both cases thenumber of upper-agb stars suggests that ~15% of the total stellar population isin the form of intermediate-age stars, considerably less than is the case foroutlying de satellites of the milky way such as fornax and leoi.

astro-ph;0610346	oxygen, sodium, magnesium and aluminium as tracers of the galactic bulge  formation	this paper investigates the peculiar behaviour of the light even(alpha-elements) and odd atomic number elements in red giants in the galacticbulge, both in terms of the chemical evolution of the bulge, and in terms ofpossible deep-mixing mechanisms in these evolved stars. using uves on vlt, wemeasure the abundances of the four light elements o, na, mg and al in 13 redclump and 40 red giant branch stars in four fields spanning the bulge from b=-3to -12\deg. we show that the resulting abundance patterns point towards achemical enrichment dominated by massive stars at all metallicities. o, mg andal ratios with respect to iron are overabundant with respect to both galacticdisks (thin and thick) for [fe/h]$&gt;-0.5$. a formation timescale for thegalactic bulge shorter than for both the thin and thick disks is thereforeinferred. using mg as a proxy for metallicity (instead of fe) we further showthat: (i) the bulge stars [o/mg] ratio follows and extend to highermetallicities the decreasing trend of [o/mg] found in the galactic disks. (ii)the [na/mg] ratio trend with increasing [mg/h] is found to increase in threedistinct sequences in the thin disk, the thick disk and the bulge. the bulgetrend is well represented by the predicted metallicity-dependent yields ofmassive stars, whereas the galactic disks have too high na/mg ratios at lowmetallicities, pointing to an additional source of na from agb stars. (iii)contrary to na, there appears to be no systematic difference in the [al/mg]ratio between bulge and disk stars, and the theoretical yields by massive starsagree with the observed ratios, leaving no space for agb contribution to al.

astro-ph;9902176	hst luminosity functions of the globular clusters m10, m22, and m55. a  comparison with other clusters	from a combination of deep hubble space telescope v and i images withgroundbased images in the same bands, we have obtained color-magnitude diagramsof m10, m22, and m55, extending from just above the hydrogen burning limit tothe tip of the red giant branch, down to the white dwarf cooling sequence. wehave used the color-magnitude arrays to extract main sequence luminosityfunctions (lfs) from the turnoff to about 0.13 solar masses. the lfs of m10 issignificantly steeper than that for the other two clusters. the differencecannot be due to a difference in metallicity. a comparison with the lfs frompiotto, cool, and king (1997), shows a large spread in the lf slopes. thisspread is also present in the local mass functions (mfs) obtained from theobserved lfs using different theoretical mass--luminosity relations. thedispersion in the mf slopes remains also after removing the mass segregationeffects by using multimass king-michie models. the globular cluster mf slopesare also flatter than the mf slope of the field stars and of the galacticclusters in the same mass interval. we interpret the mf slope dispersion andthe mf flatness as an evidence of dynamical evolution which makes the presentday globular cluster stellar mfs different from the intial mfs. the slopes ofthe present day mfs exclude that the low mass star can be dynamically relevantfor the galactic globular clusters.

astro-ph;9906269	hst observations of galactic globular cluster cores. ii. ngc 6273 and  the problem of horizontal-branch gaps	we present observations of the center of the galactic globular cluster ngc6273, obtained with the hst/wfpc2 camera as part of the snapshot programgo-7470. a b, v color-magnitude diagram (cmd) for ~28,000 stars is presentedand discussed. the most prominent feature of the cmd, identified for the firsttime in this paper, is the extended horizontal branch blue tail (ebt) with aclear double-peaked distribution and a significant gap. the ebt of ngc 6273 iscompared with the ebts of seven other globular clusters for which we have a cmdin the same photometric system. from this comparison we conclude that all theglobular clusters in our sample with an ebt show at least one gap along the hb,which could have similar origins. a comparison with theoretical models suggeststhat at least some of these gaps may be occuring at a particular value of thestellar mass, common to a number of different clusters. from the cmd of ngc6273 we obtain a distance modulus (m-m)_v=16.27+-0.20. we also estimate anaverage reddening e(b-v)=0.47+-0.03, though the cmd is strongly affected bydifferential reddening, with the relative reddening spanning a 0.2 magnitudeinterval in e(b-v) in the wfpc2 field. a luminosity function for the evolvedstars in ngc 6273 is also presented and compared with the most recentevolutionary models.

astro-ph;9906452	the initial mass function of the galactic bulge down to ~0.15 msun	we present a luminosity function (lf) for lower main sequence stars in thegalactic bulge near (l,b)=(0,-6) to j=24, corresponding to m_j~9.3. this lf isderived from hst + nicmos observations with the f110w and f160w filters. themain sequence locus in the infrared shows a strong change in slope at j~20.5(m_j~5.75) which is well fit by new low mass models that include water andmolecular hydrogen opacity. our derived mass function (which is not correctedfor binary companions) is the deepest measured to date in the bulge, andextends to 0.15 $m_\odot$ with a power law slope of $\alpha=-1.33\pm0.07$; asalpeter mass function would have $\alpha=-2.35$. we also combine our j band lfwith previously published data for the evolved stars to produce a bulge lfspanning ~15 magnitudes. we show that this mass function has negligibledependence on the adopted bulge metallicity and distance modulus. althoughshallower than the salpeter slope, the slope of the bulge imf is steeper thanthat recently found for the galactic disk ($\alpha=-0.8$ and $\alpha=-0.54$from the data of reid &amp; gizis, 1997, and gould et al. 1997, respectively, inthe same mass interval), but is virtually identical to the disk imf derived bykroupa et al. (1993). the bulge imf is also quite similar to the mass functionsderived for those globular clusters which are believed to have experiencedlittle or no dynamical evolution. finally, we derive the $m/l_j$ ratio of thebulge to be $\sim 0.9\pm0.1$ $m_\odot/l_\odot$, and briefly discuss theimplications of this bulge imf for the interpretation of the microlensingevents observed in the direction of the galactic bulge.

0810.0682	the globular cluster ngc 5286. i. a new ccd bv color-magnitude diagram	we present bv photometry of the galactic globular cluster ngc 5286, based on128 v frames and 133 b frames, and covering the entire face of the cluster. ourphotometry reaches almost two magnitudes below the turn-off level, and isaccordingly suitable for an age analysis. field stars were removedstatistically from the cluster's color-magnitude diagram (cmd), and adifferential reddening correction applied, thus allowing a precise ridgeline tobe calculated.  using the latter, a metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.70 +/- 0.10 in the zinn &amp; westscale, and [fe/h] = -1.47 +/- 0.02 in the carretta &amp; gratton scale, was derivedon the basis of several parameters measured from the red giant branch, in goodagreement with the value provided in the harris catalog.  comparing the ngc 5286 cmd with the latest photometry for m3 by p. b. stetson(2008, priv. comm.), and using vandenberg isochrones for a suitable chemicalcomposition, we find evidence that ngc 5286 is around 1.7 +/- 0.9 gyr olderthan m3. this goes in the right sense to help account for the blue horizontalbranch of ngc 5286, for which we provide a measurement of several morphologicalindicators. if ngc 5286 is a bona fide member of the canis major dwarfspheroidal galaxy, as previously suggested, our results imply that the latter'soldest components may be at least as old as the oldest milky way globularclusters.
