0903.1272	a complete view of galaxy evolution: panchromatic luminosity functions  and the generation of metals	when and how did galaxies form and their metals accumulate? over the lastdecade, this has moved from an archeological question to a live investigation:there is now a broad picture of the evolution of galaxies in dark matter halos:their masses, stars, metals and supermassive blackholes. galaxies have beenfound and studied in which these formation processes are taking place mostvigorously, all the way back in cosmic time to when the intergalactic medium(igm) was still largely neutral. however, the details of how and why theinterstellar medium (ism) in distant galaxies cools, is processed, recycled andenriched in metals by stars, and fuels active galactic nuclei (agns) remainuncertain. in particular, the cooling of gas to fuel star formation, and thechemistry and physics of the most intensely active regions is hidden from viewat optical wavelengths, but can be seen and diagnosed at mid- &amp; far-infrared(ir) wavelengths. rest-frame ir observations are important first to identifythe most luminous, interesting and important galaxies, secondly to quantifyaccurately their total luminosity, and finally to use spectroscopy to trace theconditions in the molecular and atomic gas out of which stars form. in order tomap out these processes over the full range of environments and large-scalestructures found in the universe - from the densest clusters of galaxies to theemptiest voids - we require tools for deep, large area surveys, of millions ofgalaxies out to z~5, and for detailed follow-up spectroscopy. the necessarytools can be realized technically. here, we outline the requirements forgathering the crucial information to build, validate and challenge models ofgalaxy evolution.

0905.0691	radio and x-ray properties of submillimeter galaxies in the a2125 field	we present the radio and x-ray properties of 1.2 mm mambo source candidatesin a 1600 sq. arcmin field centered on the abell 2125 galaxy cluster atz=0.247. the brightest, non-synchrotron mm source candidate in the field has aphotometric redshift, z = 3.93^+1.11_-0.80, and is not detected in a 31 kschandra x-ray exposure. these findings are consistent with this object being anextremely dusty and luminous starburst galaxy at high-redshift, possibly themost luminous yet identified in any blank-field mm survey. the deep 1.4 ghz vlaimaging identifies counterparts for 83% of the 29 mm source candidatesidentified at &gt;=4-sigma s(1.2mm) = 2.7 - 52.1 mjy, implying that the majorityof these objects are likely to lie at z &lt;~ 3.5. the median mm-to-radiowavelength photometric redshift of this radio-detected sample is z~2.2 (firstand third quartiles of 1.7 and 3.0), consistent with the median redshiftderived from optical spectroscopic surveys of the radio-detected subsample ofbright submm galaxies (s(850um) &gt; 5 mjy). three mm-selected quasars areconfirmed to be x-ray luminous in the high resolution chandra imaging, whileanother mm source candidate with potential multiple radio counterparts is alsodetected in the x-ray regime. both of these radio counterparts are positionallyconsistent with the mm source candidate. one counterpart is associated with anelliptical galaxy at z = 0.2425, but we believe that a second counterpartassociated with a fainter optical source likely gives rise to the mm emissionat z~1.

0908.0018	imaging atomic and highly excited molecular gas in a z=6.42 quasar host  galaxy: copious fuel for an eddington-limited starburst at the end of cosmic  reionization	we have imaged co(j=7-6) and ci(3p2-3p1) emission in the host galaxy of thez=6.42 quasar sdss j114816.64+525150.3 (hereafter: j1148+5251) throughobservations with the plateau de bure interferometer. the region showingco(j=7-6) emission is spatially resolved, and its size of 5 kpc is in goodagreement with earlier co(j=3-2) observations. in combination with a revisedmodel of the collisional line excitation in this source, this indicates thatthe highly excited molecular gas traced by the co j=7-6 line is subthermallyexcited (showing only 58+/-8% of the co j=3-2 luminosity), but not morecentrally concentrated. we also detect ci(3p2-3p1) emission in the host galaxyof j1148+5251, but the line is too faint to enable a reliable size measurement.  from the ci(3p2-3p1) line flux, we derive a total atomic carbon mass ofm_ci=1.1x10^7 m_sun, which corresponds to ~5x10^-4 times the total moleculargas mass. we also searched for h2o(j_kakc=2_12-1_01) emission, and obtained asensitive line luminosity limit of l'_h2o&lt;4.4x10^9 k kms pc^2, i.e., &lt;15% ofthe co(j=3-2) luminosity. the warm, highly excited molecular gas, atomic gasand dust in this quasar host at the end of cosmic reionization maintain anintense starburst that reaches surface densities as high as predicted by (dustopacity) eddington limited star formation over kiloparsec scales.

(2006) discovered two molecular loops in the galactic center andargued that the foot points of the molecular loops, two bright spots at bothloops ends, represent the gas accumulated by the falling motion along theloops, subsequent to magnetic flotation by the parker instability. we havecarried out sensitive co observations of the foot points toward l=356 deg at afew pc resolution in the six rotational transitions of co; 12co(j=1-0, 3-2,4-3, 7-6), 13co(j=1-0) and c18o(j=1-0). the high resolution image of 12co(j=3-2) has revealed the detailed distribution of the high excitation gasincluding u shapes, the outer boundary of which shows sharp intensity jumpsaccompanying strong velocity gradients. an analysis of the multi-j cotransitions shows that the temperature is in a range from 30-100 k and densityis around 10^3-10^4 cm^-3, confirming that the foot points have hightemperature and density although there is no prominent radiative heating sourcesuch as high mass stars in or around the loops. we argue that the hightemperature is likely due to the shock heating under c-shock condition causedby the magnetic flotation. we made a comparison of the gas distribution withtheoretical numerical simulations and note that the u shape is consistent withnumerical simulations. we also find that the region of highest temperature of~100 k or higher inside the u shape corresponds to the spur having an upwardflow, additionally heated up either by magnetic reconnection or bouncing in theinteraction with the narrow neck at the bottom of the u shape. we note thesenew findings further reinforce the magnetic floatation interpretation.

0910.0309	warm and dense molecular gas in the n159 region: 12co j=4-3 and 13co  j=3-2 observations with nanten2 and aste	new 12co j=4-3 and 13co j=3-2 observations of the n159 region in the largemagellanic cloud have been made. the 12co j=4-3 distribution is separated intothree clumps. these new measurements toward the three clumps are used incoupled calculations of molecular rotational excitation and line radiationtransfer, along with other transitions of the 12co as well as the isotopetransitions of 13co. the temperatures and densities are determined to be~70-80k and ~3x10^3 cm-3 in n159w and n159e and ~30k and ~1.6x10^3 cm-3 inn159s. these results are compared with the star formation activity. the n159eclump is associated with embedded cluster(s) as observed at 24 micron and thederived high temperature is explained as due to the heating by these sources.the n159e clump is likely responsible for a dark lane in a large hii region bythe dust extinction. the n159w clump is associated with embedded clustersmainly toward the eastern edge of the clump only. these clusters show offsetsof 20"-40" from the 12co j=4-3 peak and are probably responsible for heatingindicated by the derived high temperature. the n159w clump exhibits no sign ofstar formation toward the 12co j=4-3 peak position and its western region. wesuggest that the n159w peak represents a pre-star-cluster core of ~105m_solwhich deserves further detailed studies. note that recent star formation tookplace between n159w and n159e as indicated by several star clusters and hiiregions, while the natal molecular gas toward the stars have already beendissipated by the ionization and stellar winds of the ob stars. the n159s clumpshows little sign of star formation as is consistent with the lower temperatureand somewhat lower density. the n159s clump is also a candidate for future starformation.

1002.1561	molecular gas in redshift 6 quasar host galaxies	we report our new observations of redshifted carbon monoxide emission fromsix z~6 quasars, using the pdbi. co (6-5) or (5-4) line emission was detectedin all six sources. together with two other previous co detections, theseobservations provide unique constraints on the molecular gas emissionproperties in these quasar systems close to the end of the cosmic reionization.complementary results are also presented for low-j co lines observed at the gbtand the vla, and dust continuum from five of these sources with the sharc-iibolometer camera at the cso. we then present a study of the molecular gasproperties in our combined sample of eight co-detected quasars at z~6. thedetections of high-order co line emission in these objects indicates thepresence of highly excited molecular gas, with estimated masses on the order of10^10 m_sun within the quasar host galaxies. no significant difference is foundin the gas mass and co line width distributions between our z~6 quasars andsamples of co-detected $1.4\leq z\leq5$ quasars and submillimeter galaxies.most of the co-detected quasars at z~6 follow the far infrared-co luminosityrelationship defined by actively star-forming galaxies at low and highredshifts. this suggests that ongoing star formation in their hosts contributessignificantly to the dust heating at fir wavelengths. the result is consistentwith the picture of galaxy formation co-eval with supermassive black hole(smbh) accretion in the earliest quasar-host systems. we investigate the blackhole--bulge relationships of our quasar sample, using the co dynamics as atracer for the dynamical mass of the quasar host. the results place importantconstraints on the formation and evolution of the most massive smbh-spheroidalhost systems at the highest redshift.

1003.0827	submillimeter galaxies behind the bullet cluster (1e 0657-56)	clusters of galaxies are effective gravitational lenses able to magnifybackground galaxies and making it possible to probe the fainter part of thegalaxy population. submillimeter galaxies, which are believed to bestar-forming galaxies at typical redshifts of 2 to 3, are a major contaminantto the extended sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal of galaxy clusters. for a properquantification of the sz signal the contribution of submillimeter galaxiesneeds to be quantified. the aims of this study are to identify submillimetersources in the field of the bullet cluster (1e 0657-56), a massive cluster ofgalaxies at z~0.3, measure their flux densities at 870 micron, and search forcounterparts at other wavelengths to constrain their properties. we carried outdeep observations of the submillimeter continuum emission at 870 micron usingthe large apex bolometer camera (laboca) on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. several numerical techniques were used to quantify the noiseproperties of the data and extract sources. in total, seventeen sources werefound. thirteen of them lie in the central 10 arcminutes of the map, which hasa pixel sensitivity of 1.2 mjy per 22 arcsec beam. after correction for fluxboosting and gravitational lensing, the number counts are consistent withpublished submm measurements. nine of the sources have infrared counterparts inspitzer maps. the strongest submm detection coincides with a source previouslyreported at other wavelengths, at an estimated redshift z~2.7. if the submmflux arises from two images of a galaxy magnified by a total factor of 75, asmodels have suggested, its intrinsic flux would be around 0.6 mjy, consistentwith an intrinsic luminosity below 10^12 l_sun.

0704.2053	millimeter and radio observations of z~6 quasars	we present millimeter and radio observations of 13 sdss quasars at reshiftsz~6. we observed eleven of them with the max-planck millimeter bolometer array(mambo-2) at the iram 30m-telescope at 250 ghz and all of them with the verylarge array (vla) at 1.4 ghz. four sources are detected by mambo-2 and six aredetected by the vla at &gt;=3 sigma level. these sources, together with another 6published in previous papers,yield a submillimeter/millimeter and radioobserved sdss quasar sample at z~6. we use this sample to investigate thefar-infrared (fir) andradio properties of optically bright quasars in the earlyuniverse. we compare this sample to lower redshift samples of quasars observedinthe submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths ((sub)mm), and find that thedistribution of the fir to b band optical luminosity ratio (l_fir/l_b) issimilar from z~2 to 6. we find a weak correlation between the fir luminosity(l_fir) and b band optical luminosity (l_b) byincluding the (sub)mm observedsamples at all redshifts. some strong (sub)mm detections in the z~6 sample haveradio-to-fir ratios within the range defined by star forming galaxies, whichsuggests possible co-eval star forming activity with the powerful agn in thesesources. we calculate the rest frame radio to optical ratios (r*_1.4=l_{v,1.4ghz}/l_{v, 4400a}) for all of the vla observed sources in the z~6 quasarsample. only one radio detection in this sample, j083643.85+005453.3, hasr*_1.4~40 and can be considered radio loud. there are no strong radio sources(r*_1.4&gt;=100) among these sdss quasars at z~6. these data are consistent with,although do not set strong constraints on, a decreasing radio-loud quasarfraction with increasing redshift.

1008.0389	a massive molecular gas reservoir in the z=5.3 submillimeter galaxy  aztec-3	we report the detection of co 2-1, 5-4, and 6-5 emission in thehighest-redshift submillimeter galaxy (smg) aztec-3 at z=5.298, using theexpanded very large array and the plateau de bure interferometer. theseobservations ultimately confirm the redshift, making aztec-3 the mostsubmillimeter-luminous galaxy in a massive z=5.3 protocluster structure in thecosmos field. the strength of the co line emission reveals a large moleculargas reservoir with a mass of 5.3e10 (alpha_co/0.8) msun, which can maintain theintense 1800 msun/yr starburst in this system for at least 30 myr, increasingthe stellar mass by up to a factor of six in the process. this gas mass iscomparable to `typical' z~2 smgs, and constitutes &gt;~80% of the baryonic mass(gas+stars) and 30%-80% of the total (dynamical) mass in this galaxy. themolecular gas reservoir has a radius of &lt;4 kpc and likely consists of a`diffuse', low-excitation component, containing (at least) 1/3 of the gas mass(depending on the relative conversion factor alpha_co), and a `dense',high-excitation component, containing ~2/3 of the mass. the likely presence ofa substantial diffuse component besides highly-excited gas suggests differentproperties between the star-forming environments in z&gt;4 smgs and z&gt;4 quasarhost galaxies, which perhaps trace different evolutionary stages. the discoveryof a massive, metal-enriched gas reservoir in a smg at the heart of a largez=5.3 protocluster considerably enhances our understanding of early massivegalaxy formation, pushing back to a cosmic epoch where the universe was lessthan 1/12 of its present age.

1011.0991	dense molecular gas excitation at high redshift: detection of  hco+(j=4-3) emission in the cloverleaf quasar	we report the detection of hco+(j=4-3) emission in the cloverleaf quasar atz=2.56, using the iram plateau de bure interferometer. hco+ emission is a starformation indicator similar to hcn, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(h2)~= 10^5 cm^-3) within star-forming molecular clouds. we derive alensing-corrected hco+(j=4-3) line luminosity of l'(hco+(4-3)) = (1.6+/-0.3) x10^9 (mu_l/11)^-1 k km/s pc^2, which corresponds to only 48% of the hco+(j=1=0)luminosity, and &lt;~4% of the co(j=3-2) luminosity. the hco+ excitation thus isclearly subthermal in the j=4-3 transition. modeling of the hco+ line radiativetransfer suggests that the hco+ emission emerges from a region with physicalproperties comparable to that exhibiting the co line emission, but 2x highergas density. this suggests that both hco+ and co lines trace the warm, densemolecular gas where star formation actively takes place. the hco+ lines haveonly ~2/3 the width of the co lines, which may suggest that the densest gas ismore spatially concentrated. in contrast to the z=3.91 quasar apm08279+5255,the dense gas excitation in the cloverleaf is consistent with being purelycollisional, rather than being enhanced by radiative processes. thus, thephysical properties of the dense gas component in the cloverleaf are consistentwith those in the nuclei of nearby starburst galaxies. this suggests that theconditions in the dense, star-forming gas in active galactic nucleus-starburstsystems at early cosmic times like the cloverleaf are primarily affected by thestarburst itself, rather than the central active black hole.

1104.4348	imaging the molecular gas properties of a major merger driving the  evolution of a z=2.5 submillimeter galaxy	we report the detection of spatially extended co 1-0 and 5-4 emission in thez=2.49 submillimeter galaxy (smg) j123707+6214, using the expanded very largearray and the plateau de bure interferometer. the large molecular gas reservoiris spatially resolved into two co(1-0) components (north-east and south-west;previously identified in co 3-2 emission) with gas masses of 4.3 and 3.5 x10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) msun. we thus find that the optically invisible north-eastcomponent slightly dominates the gas mass in this system. the total moleculargas mass derived from the co(1-0) observations is ~2.5 times larger thanestimated from co(3-2). the two components are at approximately the sameredshift, but separated by ~20 kpc in projection. the morphology is consistentwith that of an early-stage merger. the total amount of molecular gas issufficient to maintain the intense 500 msun/yr starburst in this system for atleast ~160 myr. we derive line brightness temperature ratios ofr_31=0.39+/-0.09 and 0.37+/-0.10, and r_51=0.26+/-0.07 and 0.25+/-0.08 in thetwo components, respectively, suggesting that the j&gt;=3 lines are substantiallysubthermally excited. this also suggests comparable conditions for starformation in both components. given the similar gas masses of both components,this is consistent with the comparable starburst strengths observed in theradio continuum emission. our findings are consistent with other recent studiesthat find evidence for lower co excitation in smgs than in high-z quasar hostgalaxies with comparable gas masses. this may provide supporting evidence thatboth populations correspond to different evolutionary stages in the formationof massive galaxies.

1105.4177	extended cold molecular gas reservoirs in z~3.4 submillimeter galaxies	we report the detection of spatially resolved co(1-0) emission in the z~3.4submillimeter galaxies (smgs) smm j09431+4700 and smm j13120+4242, using theexpanded very large array (evla). smm j09431+4700 is resolved into the twopreviously reported millimeter sources h6 and h7, separated by ~30kpc inprojection. we derive co(1-0) line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (2.49+/-0.86)and (5.82+/-1.22) x 10^10 k km/s pc^2 for h6 and h7, and l'(co 1-0) =(23.4+/-4.1) x 10^10 k km/s pc^2 for smm j13120+4242. these are ~1.5-4.5xhigher than what is expected from simple excitation modeling of higher-j colines, suggesting the presence of copious amounts of low-excitation gas. thisis supported by the finding that the co(1-0) line in smm j13120+4242, thesystem with lowest co excitation, appears to have a broader profile and moreextended spatial structure than seen in higher-j co lines (which is lessprominently seen in smm j09431+4700). based on l'(co 1-0) and excitationmodeling, we find m_gas = 2.0-4.3 and 4.7-12.7 x 10^10 msun for h6 and h7, andm_gas = 18.7-69.4 x 10^10 msun for smm j13120+4242. the observed co(1-0)properties are consistent with the picture that smm j09431+4700 represents anearly-stage, gas-rich major merger, and that smm j13120+4242 represents such asystem in an advanced stage. this study thus highlights the importance ofspatially and dynamically resolved co(1-0) observations of smgs to furtherunderstand the gas physics that drive star formation in these distant galaxies,which becomes possible only now that the evla rises to its full capabilities.

1107.5065	far-infrared and molecular co emission from the host galaxies of faint  quasars at z~6	we present new millimeter and radio observations of nine z~6 quasarsdiscovered in deep optical and near-infrared surveys. we observed the 250 ghzcontinuum in eight of the nine objects and detected three of them. new 1.4 ghzradio continuum data have been obtained for four sources, and one has beendetected. we searched for molecular co (6-5) line emission in the three 250 ghzdetections and detected two of them. we study the fir and radio emission andquasar-host galaxy evolution with a sample of 18 z~6 quasars that are faint atuv/optical wavelengths (rest-frame 1450a magnitudes of m_1450\ge20.2). theaverage fir-to-agn uv luminosity ratio of this faint quasar sample is about twotimes higher than that of the bright quasars at z~6 (m_1450&lt;20.2). a fit to theaverage fir and agn bolometric luminosities of both the uv/optically faint andbright z~6 quasars, and the average luminosities of samples of submillimeter/millimeter-observed quasars at z~2 to 5, yields a relationship of l_{fir}{l_{bol}}^{0.62}. five of the 18 faint z~6 quasars have been detected at 250ghz. these 250 ghz detections, as well as most of the millimeter-detectedoptically bright z~6 quasars, follow a shallower trend of l_{fir}{l_{bol}}^{0.45} defined by the starburst-agn systems in local and high-zuniverse. the millimeter continuum detections in the five objects and molecularco detections in three of them reveal a few x10^8 m_sun of fir-emitting warmdust and 10^10 m_sun of molecular gas in the quasar host galaxies. all theseresults argue for massive star formation in the quasar host galaxies, withestimated star formation rates of a few hundred m_sun yr^{-1}. additionally,the higher fir-to-agn luminosity ratio found in these 250 ghz-detected faintquasars also suggests a higher ratio between star formation rate andsupermassive black hole accretion rate than the uv/optically most luminousquasars at z~6.

0710.4525	observations of dense molecular gas in a quasar host galaxy at z=6.42:  further evidence for a non-linear dense gas - star formation relation at  early cosmic times	we report a sensitive search for the hcn(j=2-1) emission line towards sdssj1148+5251 at z=6.42 with the vla. hcn emission is a star formation indicator,tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(h2) &gt;= 10^4 cm^-3) within star-formingmolecular clouds. no emission was detected in the deep interferometer maps ofj1148+5251. we derive a limit for the hcn line luminosity of l'(hcn) &lt; 3.3 x10^9 k km/s pc^2, corresponding to a hcn/co luminosity ratio of l'(hcn)/l'(co)&lt; 0.13. this limit is consistent with a fraction of dense molecular gas inj1148+5251 within the range of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs;median value: l'(hcn)/l'(co) = 0.17 {+0.05/-0.08}) and hcn-detected z&gt;2galaxies (0.17 {+0.09/-0.08}). the relationship between l'(hcn) and l(fir) isconsidered to be a measure for the efficiency at which stars form out of densegas. in the nearby universe, these quantities show a linear correlation, andthus, a practically constant average ratio. in j1148+5251, we findl(fir)/l'(hcn) &gt; 6600. this is significantly higher than the average ratios fornormal nearby spiral galaxies (l(fir)/l'(hcn) = 580 {+510/-270}) and ulirgs(740 {+505/-50}), but consistent with a rising trend as indicated by other z&gt;2galaxies (predominantly quasars; 1525 {+1300/-475}). it is unlikely that thisrising trend can be accounted for by a contribution of agn heating to l(fir)alone, and may hint at a higher median gas density and/or elevatedstar-formation efficiency toward the more luminous high-redshift systems. thereis marginal evidence that the l(fir)/l'(hcn) ratio in j1148+5251 may evenexceed the rising trend set by other z&gt;2 galaxies; however, only futurefacilities with very large collecting areas such as the ska will offer thesensitivity required to further investigate this question.

1208.4846	herschel-pacs observations of [oi]63um towards submillimetre galaxies at  z~1	we present herschel-pacs spectroscopy of the [oi]63um far-infrared coolingline from a sample of six unlensed and spectroscopically-confirmed870um-selected submillimetre (submm) galaxies (smgs) at 1.1&lt;z&lt;1.6 from thelaboca extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) submm survey (less). this isthe first survey of [oi]63um, one of the main photodissociation region (pdr)cooling lines, in smgs. new high-resolution alma interferometric 870umcontinuum imaging confirms that these six herschel-targeted smg counterpartsare bona fide sources of submm emission. we detect [oi]63um in two smgs with asnr &gt;3, tentatively detect [oi]63um in one smg, and constrain the line flux forthe non-detections. we also exploit the combination of submm continuumphotometry from 250-870um and our new pacs continuum measurements to constrainthe far-infrared (fir) luminosity, l_fir, in these smgs to &lt; 30%. we find thatsmgs do not show a deficit in their [oi]63um-to-far-infrared continuumluminosity ratios (with ratios ranging from ~0.5-1.5%), similar to what wasseen previously for the [cii]158um-to-fir ratios in smgs. these observed ratiosare about an order of magnitude higher than what is seen typically for localultra luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), which adds to the growing body ofevidence that smgs are not simply `scaled up' versions of local ulirgs. rather,the pdr line-to-l_fir ratios suggest that the star formation modes of smgs arelikely more akin to that of local normal (lower-luminosity) star-forminggalaxies, with the bulk of the star formation occurring in extended regions,galaxy-scale (~kpc) in size. these observations represent the first steptowards a census of the major pdr cooling lines in typical smgs that will beattainable with alma, enabling detailed modelling to probe the globalproperties of the star formation and the evolutionary status of smgs.

1208.6100	molecular gas and dust in the highly magnified z = 2.8 galaxy behind the  bullet cluster	the gravitational magnification provided by massive galaxy clusters makes itpossible to probe the physical conditions in distant galaxies that are of lowerluminosity than those in blank fields and likely more representative of thebulk of the high-redshift galaxy population. we aim to constrain the basicproperties of molecular gas in a strongly magnified submm galaxy located behindthe massive bullet cluster. this galaxy (smm j0658) is split into three images,with a total magnification factor of almost 100. we used the australiatelescope compact array (atca) to search for {12}co(1--0) and {12}co(3--2) lineemission from smm j0658. we also used the saboca bolometer camera on theatacama pathfinder experiment (apex) telescope to measure the continuumemission at 350 micron. co(1--0) and co(3--2) are detected at 6.8 sigma and 7.5sigma significance when the spectra toward the two brightest images of thegalaxy are combined. from the co(1-0) luminosity we derive a mass of coldmolecular gas of (1.8 \pm 0.3) * 10^9 msun, using the co to h_2 conversionfactor commonly used for luminous infrared galaxies. this is 45 \pm 25 % of thestellar mass. from the width of the co lines we derive a dynamical mass withinthe co-emitting region l of (1.3 \pm 0.4) * 10^10 (l/1 kpc) msun. we refine theredshift determination of smm j0658 to z=2.7793 \pm 0.0003. continuum emissionat 350 micron from smm j0658 was detected with saboca at a signal-to-noiseratio of 3.6. we study the spectral energy distribution of smm j0658 and derivea dust temperature of 33\pm 5 k and a dust mass of 1.1*10^7 msun. smm j0658 isone of the least massive submm galaxies discovered so far. as a likelyrepresentative of the bulk of the submm galaxy population, it is a prime targetfor future observations.

1209.1390	an alma survey of sub-millimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: detection of [c ii] at z=4.4	we present alma 870-um (345ghz) observations of two sub-millimetre galaxies(smgs) drawn from an alma study of the 126 sub-millimeter sources from thelaboca extended chandra deep field south survey (less). the alma data identifythe counterparts to these previously unidentified sub-millimeter sources andserendipitously detect bright emission lines in their spectra which we show aremost likely to be [c ii]157.74um emission yielding redshifts of z=4.42 andz=4.44. this blind detection rate within the 7.5-ghz bandpass of alma isconsistent with the previously derived photometric redshift distribution ofsmgs and suggests a modest, but not dominant (&lt;25%), tail of 870-um selectedsmgs at z&gt;4. we find that the ratio of l_cii/l_fir in these smgs is much higherthan seen for similarly far-infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0, which isattributed to the more extended gas reservoirs in these high-redshift ulirgs.indeed, in one system we show that the [c ii] emission shows hints of extendedemission on &gt;3kpc scales. finally, we use the volume probed by our alma surveyto show that the bright end of the [c ii] luminosity function evolves stronglybetween z=0 and z~4.4, reflecting the increased ism cooling in galaxies as aresult of their higher star-formation rates. these observations demonstratethat even with short integrations, alma is able to detect the dominant finestructure cooling lines from high-redshift ulirgs, measure their energetics andtrace their evolution with redshift.

1210.0249	an alma survey of submillimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: high resolution 870um source counts	we report the first counts of faint submillimetre galaxies (smg) in the870-um band derived from arcsecond resolution observations with the atacamalarge millimeter array (alma). we have used alma to map a sample of 122870-um-selected submillimetre sources drawn from the (0.5x0.5)deg^2 labocaextended chandra deep field south submillimetre survey (less). these alma mapshave an average depth of sigma(870um)~0.4mjy, some ~3x deeper than the originallaboca survey and critically the angular resolution is more than an order ofmagnitude higher, fwhm of ~1.5" compared to ~19" for the laboca discovery map.this combination of sensitivity and resolution allows us to precisely pin-pointthe smgs contributing to the submillimetre sources from the laboca map, freefrom the effects of confusion. we show that our alma-derived smg counts broadlyagree with the submillimetre source counts from previous, lower-resolutionsingle-dish surveys, demonstrating that the bulk of the submillimetre sourcesare not caused by blending of unresolved smgs. the difficulty whichwell-constrained theoretical models have in reproducing the high-surfacedensities of smgs, thus remains. however, our observations do show that all ofthe very brightest sources in the less sample, s(870um)&gt;12mjy, compriseemission from multiple, fainter smgs, each with 870-um fluxes of &lt;9mjy. thisimplies a natural limit to the star-formation rate in smgs of &lt;10^3 m_sun/yr,which in turn suggests that the space densities of z&gt;1 galaxies with gas massesin excess of ~5x10^10 m_sun is &lt;10^-5 mpc^-3. we also discuss the influence ofthis blending on the identification and characterisation of the smgcounterparts to these bright submillimetre sources and suggest that it may beresponsible for previous claims that they lie at higher redshifts than faintersmgs.

1301.3155	empirical predictions for (sub-)millimeter line and continuum deep  fields	[abridged] modern (sub-)millimeter/radio interferometers will enable us tomeasure the dust and molecular gas emission from galaxies that haveluminosities lower than the milky way, out to high redshifts and withunprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. this will provide newconstraints on the star formation properties and gas reservoir in galaxiesthroughout cosmic times through dedicated deep field campaigns targeting theco/[cii] lines and dust continuum emission. in this paper, we present empiricalpredictions for such (sub-)millimeter line and continuum deep fields. we basethese predictions on the deepest available optical/near-infrared acs and nicmosdata on the hubble ultra deep field. using a physically-motivated spectralenergy distribution model, we fit the observed optical/near-infrared emissionof 13,099 galaxies with redshifts up to z=5, and obtain median likelihoodestimates of their stellar mass, star formation rate, dust attenuation and dustluminosity. we derive statistical constraints on the dust emission in theinfrared and (sub-)millimeter which are consistent with the observedoptical/near-infrared emission in terms of energy balance. this allows us toestimate, for each galaxy, the (sub-)millimeter continuum flux densities inseveral alma, pdbi/noema and jvla bands. using empirical relations between theobserved co/[cii] line luminosities and the infrared luminosity, we infer theflux of the co(1-0) and [cii] lines from the estimated infrared luminosity ofeach galaxy in our sample. we then predict the fluxes of higher co transitionlines co(2-1) to co(7-6) bracketing two extreme gas excitation scenarios. weuse our predictions to discuss possible deep field strategies with alma. thepredictions presented in this study will serve as a direct benchmark for futuredeep field campaigns in the (sub-)millimeter regime.

1302.4154	star formation and gas kinematics of quasar host galaxies at z~6: new  insights from alma	we present alma observations of the [c ii] 158 micron fine structure line anddust continuum emission from the host galaxies of five redshift 6 quasars. wealso report complementary observations of 250 ghz dust continuum and co (6-5)line emission from the z=6.00 quasar sdss j231038.88+185519.7. the almaobservations were carried out in the extended array at 0.7" resolution. we havedetected the line and dust continuum in all five objects. the derived [c ii]line luminosities are 1.6x10^{9} to 8.8x10^{9} lsun and the [c ii]-to-firluminosity ratios are 3.0-5.6x10^{-4}, which is comparable to the values foundin other high-redshift quasar-starburst systems and local ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies. the sources are marginally resolved and the intrinsic sourcesizes (major axis fwhm) are constrained to be 0.3" to 0.6" (i.e., 1.7 to 3.5kpc) for the [c ii] line emission and 0.2" to 0.4" (i.e., 1.2 to 2.3 kpc) forthe continuum. these measurements indicate that there is vigorous starformation over the central few kpc in the quasar host galaxies. the almaobservations also constrain the dynamical properties of the atomic gas in thestarburst nuclei. the intensity-weighted velocity maps of three sources showclear velocity gradients. such velocity gradients are consistent with arotating, gravitationally bound gas component, although they are not uniquelyinterpreted as such. under the simplifying assumption of rotation, the implieddynamical masses within the [c ii]-emitting regions are of order 10^{10} to10^{11} msun. given these estimates, the mass ratios between the smbhs and thespheroidal bulge are an order of magnitude higher than the mean value found inlocal spheroidal galaxies, which is in agreement with results from previous coobservations of high redshift quasars.

1310.6363	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the redshift distribution and evolution of submillimeter  galaxies	we present the first photometric redshift distribution for a large unbiasedsample of 870um selected submillimeter galaxies (smgs) with robustidentifications based on observations with the atacama large millimeter array(alma). in our analysis we consider 96 smgs in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth, 77 of which have 4-19 band, optical-near-infrared, photometry. we modelthe spectral energy distributions (seds) for these 77 smgs, deriving a medianphotometric redshift of z=2.3+/-0.1. the remaining 19 smgs have insufficientoptical or near-infrared photometry to derive photometric redshifts, but astacking analysis of irac and herschel observations confirms they are notspurious. assuming these sources have an absolute h-band magnitude distributioncomparable to that of a complete sample of z~1-2 smgs, we demonstrate that theundetected smgs lie at higher redshifts, raising the median redshift for smgsto z=2.5+/-0.2. more critically we show that the proportion of galaxiesundergoing an smg phase at z&gt;3 is 35+/-5% of the total population. we derive amedian stellar mass for smgs of mstar=(8+/-1)x10^10mo, but caution that thereare significant systematic uncertainties in our stellar mass estimate, up to x5for individual sources. we compare our sample of smgs to a volume-limited,morphologically classified sample of ellipticals in the local universe.assuming the star formation activity in smgs has a timescale of ~100myr we showthat their descendants at z~0 would have a space density and m_h distributionwhich are in good agreement with those of local ellipticals. in addition theinferred mass-weighted ages of the local ellipticals broadly agree with thelook-back times of the smg events. taken together, these results are consistentwith a simple model that identifies smgs as events that form most of the starsseen in the majority of luminous elliptical galaxies at the present day.

1409.5796	evolution of the dust emission of massive galaxies up to z=4 and  constraints on their dominant mode of star formation	we aim to measure the average dust and molecular gas content of massivestar-forming galaxies ($\rm &gt; 3 \times 10^{10}\,m_\odot$) up to z=4 in thecosmos field to determine if the intense star formation observed at highredshift is induced by major mergers or caused by large gas reservoirs.firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributionsas a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of spitzer, herschel,laboca, and aztec data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objectsand strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. wefound that the mean intensity of the radiation field $&lt; u &gt;$ heating the dust(strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshiftup to z$\sim$4 in main-sequence galaxies. we can reproduce this evolution withsimple models that account for the decrease of the gas metallicity withredshift. no evolution of $&lt; u &gt;$ with redshift is found in strong starbursts.we then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as$\rm m_{\rm mol}/(m_{\rm mol}+m_\star)$) with redshift and found a similar,steeply increasing trend for both samples. at z$\sim$4, this fraction reaches$\sim$60%. the average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locusof the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated schmidt-kennicuttdiagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that thebulk of the star formation up to z=4 is dominated by secular processes.

1411.5476	evidence for a pressure discontinuity at the position of the coma relic  from planck sunyaev-zel'dovich effect data	radio relics are mpc-scale diffuse synchrotron sources found in galaxycluster outskirts. they are believed to be associated with large-scale shockspropagating through the intra-cluster medium, although the connection betweenradio relics and the cluster merger shocks is not yet proven conclusively. wepresent a first tentative detection of a pressure jump in the well-known relicof the coma cluster through sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect imaging.the sze dataare extracted from the first public all-sky data release of planck and we usehigh-frequency radio data at 2.3 ghz to constrain the shock-front geometry. thesze data provide evidence for a pressure discontinuity, consistent with therelic position, without requiring any additional prior on the shock-frontlocation. the derived mach number m = 2.9 (+0.8/-0.6) is consistent with x-rayand radio results. a high-pressure "filament" without any pressurediscontinuity is disfavoured by x-ray measurements and a "sub-cluster" modelbased on the infalling group ngc 4839 can be ruled out considering thepublished mass estimates for this group. these results signify a first attempttowards directly measuring the pressure discontinuity for a radio relic and thefirst sz-detected shock feature observed near the virial radius of a galaxycluster.

1502.05854	(sub)millimetre interferometric imaging of a sample of cosmos/aztec  submillimetre galaxies - i. multiwavelength identifications and redshift  distribution	we used the pdbi to map a sample of 15 smgs in the cosmos field at thewavelength of 1.3 mm. the target smgs were originally discovered in thejcmt/aztec 1.1 mm continuum survey at s/n=4-4.5. this paper presents, for thefirst time, interferometric millimetre-wavelength observations of thesesources. the angular resolution of our observations, 1.8", allowed us toaccurately determine the positions of the target smgs. using a detectionthreshold of s/n&gt;4.5 regardless of multiwavelength counterpart association, and4&lt;s/n&lt;=4.5 if a multiwavelength counterpart within 1.5" is also present, thetotal number of detections in our survey is 22. three of our detected smgs(aztec21, 27, and 28; which corresponds to 20%) are marginally resolved at ourangular resolution, and these sources are found to have elongated or clumpymorphologies and/or multiple components. using optical to nir photometricredshifts, available spectroscopic redshifts, and redshifts estimated from theradio-to-submm spectral index we infer a median redshift of$\tilde{z}=3.20\pm0.25$ for our sample. to study the overall multiplicity andredshift distribution of flux-limited samples of smgs we combined these sourceswith the 15 brightest aztec smgs detected at 1.1 mm, aztec1-15, and studiedpreviously. this constitutes a complete, flux- and s/n-limited 1.1-mm selectedsample. we find that the median redshift for the 15 brightest aztec smgs($\tilde{z}=3.05\pm0.44$) is consistent with that for aztec16-30. this conformsto recent observational findings that smgs do not exhibit any significant trendbetween the redshift and (sub)mm flux density. for the combined aztec1-30sample we derive a median redshift of $\tilde{z}=3.17\pm0.27$, consistent withprevious results based on mm-selected samples. we further infer that within thecombined aztec1-30 sample $\sim25\pm9\%$ of sources separate into multiplecomponents.

1504.04376	an alma survey of sub-millimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: physical properties derived from ultraviolet-to-radio modelling	[abridged] the aless survey has followed-up a sample of 122 sub-millimetersources in the extended chandra deep field south at 870um with alma, allowingto pinpoint the positions of sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs) to 0.3'' and tofind their precise counterparts at different wavelengths. this enabled thefirst compilation of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (seds)of a statistically reliable survey of smgs. in this paper, we present a newcalibration of the magphys modelling code that is optimized to fit theseuv-to-radio seds of z&gt;1 star-forming galaxies using an energy balance techniqueto connect the emission from stellar populations, dust attenuation and dustemission in a physically consistent way. we derive statistically and physicallyrobust estimates of the photometric redshifts and physical parameters for thealess smgs. we find that they have a median stellar mass$m_\ast=(8.9\pm0.1)\times10^{10} m_\odot$, sfr$=280\pm70 m_\odot$/yr, overallv-band dust attenuation $a_v=1.9\pm0.2$ mag, dust mass$m_\rm{dust}=(5.6\pm1.0)\times10^8 m_\odot$, and average dust temperaturetdust~40 k. the average intrinsic sed of the aless smgs resembles that of localulirgs in the ir range, but the stellar emission of our average smg is brighterand bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are moreextended. we explore how the average seds vary with different parameters, andwe provide a new set of smg templates. to put the aless smgs into context, wecompare their stellar masses and sfrs with those of less actively star-forminggalaxies at the same redshifts. at z~2, about half of the smgs lie above thestar-forming main sequence, while half are at the high-mass end of thesequence. at higher redshifts (z~3.5), the smgs tend to have higher sfr andmstar, but the fraction of smgs that lie significantly above the main sequencedecreases to less than a third.

0806.4616	a molecular einstein ring at z=4.12: imaging the dynamics of a quasar  host galaxy through a cosmic lens	we present high-resolution (0.3") very large array (vla) imaging of themolecular gas in the host galaxy of the high redshift quasar pss j2322+1944(z=4.12). these observations confirm that the molecular gas (co) in the hostgalaxy of this quasar is lensed into a full einstein ring, and reveal theinternal dynamics of the molecular gas in this system. the ring has a diameterof ~1.5", and thus is sampled over ~20 resolution elements by our observations.through a model-based lens inversion, we recover the velocity gradient of themolecular reservoir in the quasar host galaxy of pss j2322+1944. the einsteinring lens configuration enables us to zoom in on the emission and to resolvescales down to ~1 kpc. from the model-reconstructed source, we find that themolecular gas is distributed on a scale of 5 kpc, and has a total mass ofm(h2)=1.7 x 10^10 m_sun. a basic estimate of the dynamical mass gives m_dyn =4.4 x 10^10 (sin i)^-2 m_sun, that is, only ~2.5 times the molecular gas mass,and ~30 times the black hole mass (assuming that the dynamical structure ishighly inclined). the lens configuration also allows us to tie the opticalemission to the molecular gas emission, which suggests that the active galacticnucleus (agn) does reside within, but not close to the center of the molecularreservoir. together with the (at least partially) disturbed structure of theco, this suggests that the system is interacting. such an interaction, possiblycaused by a major `wet' merger, may be responsible for both feeding the quasarand fueling the massive starburst of 680 m_sun/yr in this system, in agreementwith recently suggested scenarios of quasar activity and galaxy assembly in theearly universe.

0705.3338	detection of emission from the cn radical in the cloverleaf quasar at  z=2.56	we report the detection of cn(n=3-2) emission towards the cloverleaf quasar(z=2.56) based on observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer.this is the first clear detection of emission from this radical at highredshift. cn emission is a tracer of dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(h2) &gt; 10^4cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds, in particular in regions wherethe clouds are affected by uv radiation. the hcn/cn intensity ratio can be usedas a diagnostic for the relative importance of photodissociation regions (pdrs)in a source, and as a sensitive probe of optical depth, the radiation field,and photochemical processes. we derive a lensing-corrected cn(n=3-2) lineluminosity of l'(cn(3-2) = (4.5 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 k km/s pc^2. the ratio betweencn luminosity and far-infrared luminosity falls within the scatter of the samerelationship found for low-z (ultra-) luminous infrared galaxies. combining ournew results with co(j=3-2) and hcn(j=1-0) measurements from the literature andassuming thermal excitation for all transitions, we find a co/cn luminosityratio of 9.3 +/- 1.9 and a hcn/cn luminosity ratio of 0.95 +/- 0.15. however,we find that the cn(n=3-2) line is likely only subthermally excited, implyingthat those ratios may only provide upper limits for the intrinsic 1-0 lineluminosity ratios. we conclude that, in combination with other molecular gastracers like co, hcn, and hco+, cn is an important probe of the physicalconditions and chemical composition of dense molecular environments at highredshift.

(2002), we have observed 9 sources from their sample of 11quasars at 1.25 mm. for 7 sources the 1.25 mm fluxes are much brighter than onewould expect from a purely thermal dust model fitted to the submm data,providing evidence for the synchrotron nature of the observed 1.25 mmradiation. if we extrapolate a power-law synchrotron spectrum to shorterwavelengths, then for 6 of the 9 sources also the 850 micron fluxes aredominated by synchrotron radiation. we discuss how far the (sub)-millimetredata can be interpreted in accordance with the orientation-dependent unifiedschemes for powerful radio galaxies and quasars. in this case the resultschallenge the reported evidence for the receding torus model and for theevolutionary trend of a declining dust luminosity with increasing projectedsize of the radio lobes.

astro-ph;9603032	structure of stationary photodissociation fronts	the structure of stationary photodissociation fronts is revisited. h_2 self-shielding is discussed, including the effects of line overlap. we find thatline overlap is important for n(h_2) &gt; 10^{20} cm^{-2}. we compute multiline uvpumping models, and compare these with simple analytic approximations for theeffects of self-shielding.  the overall fluorescent efficiency of the photodissociation front is obtainedfor different ratios of chi/n_h (where chi characterizes the intensity of theincident uv) and different dust extinction laws. the dust optical depthtau_{pdr} to the point where 50% of the h is molecular is found to be a simplefunction of a dimensionless quantity phi_0 depending on chi/n_h, the ratecoefficient for h_2 formation on grains, and the uv dust opacity. thefluorescent efficiency of the pdr also depends primarily on phi_0 for chi&lt;3000and n_h&lt;10^4 cm^{-3}; for stronger radiation fields and higher densitiesradiative and collisional depopulation of vibrationally-excited levelsinterferes with the radiative cascade. the emission spectrum from the pdr isessentially independent of the color temperature $t_{color}$ of the incident uvfor t_{color}&gt;10^4k, but shows some sensitivity to the v-j distribution ofnewly-formed h_2. the 1-0s(1)/2-1s(1) and 2-1s(1)/6-4q(1) intensity ratios, theortho/para ratio, and the rotational temperature in the $v$=1 and $v$=2 levelsare computed as functions of the temperature and density, for different valuesof chi and n_h.  we apply our models to the reflection nebula ngc 2023. we are best able toreproduce the observations with models having chi=5000, n_h=10^5 cm^{-3}.

astro-ph;9904261	detection of hd in the orion molecular outflow	we report a detection in the interstellar medium of an infrared transitionwithin the electronic ground state of the deuterated hydrogen molecule, hd.through a deep integration with the short-wavelength-spectrometer on iso, thepure rotational v=0-0 r(5) line at 19.43um was detected toward the orion(omc-1) outflow at its brightest h_2 emission region, peak 1. the ~20"beam-averaged observed flux of the line is (1.84 +- 0.4) 10^-5 erg cm^-2 s^-1sr^-1. upper flux limits were derived for sixteen other rotational andro-vibrational hd lines in the wavelength range 2.5 to 38 um. we utilize therich spectrum of h_2 lines observed at the same position to correct forextinction, and to derive a total warm hd column density under the assumptionthat similar excitation conditions apply to h_2 and hd. accounting for non-ltehd level populations in a partially dissociated gas, our best estimate for thetotal warm hd column density is n(hd)=(2.0+-0.75)10^16 cm^-2. the warmmolecular hydrogen column density is (2.21+-0.24)10^21 cm^-2, so that therelative abundance is [hd]/[h_2]=(9.0+-3.5)10^-6. accounting for hd depletionrelative to h_2 in partially dissociative shocks we derive a deuteriumabundance in the warm shocked gas, [d]/[h]= (7.6+-2.9)10^-6. our implieddeuterium abundance is low compared to previous determinations in the localinterstellar medium, but it is consistent with two other recent observationstoward orion, suggesting that deuterium may be significantly depleted there.
