0901.1346	high-energy particle acceleration at the radio-lobe shock of centaurus a	we present new results on the shock around the southwest radio lobe ofcentaurus a using data from the chandra very large programme observations. thex-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobeis well described by a single power-law model with galactic absorption --thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to thenucleus. we conclude that a significant fraction of the x-ray emission aroundthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. we infer that inthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, theinflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to x-ray synchrotron emittingenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as sn1006. this interpretationresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for thisemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required tobe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. we estimate thatthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughlymach 8 relative to the ambient medium. we discuss the spatial variation ofspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observationsconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongestpart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shockacceleration theory. finally, we consider the implications of these results forthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) and tev emission fromcentaurus a, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be asignificant source of uhecrs, but that tev emission from this region isexpected at levels comparable to current limits at tev energies, for plausibleassumed magnetic field strengths.

0903.2663	the jet-heated x-ray filament in the centaurus a northern middle radio  lobe	we present results from a 40 ks {\em xmm-newton} observation of the x-rayfilament coincident with the southeast edge of the centaurus a northern middleradio lobe (nml). we find that the x-ray filament consists of five spatiallyresolved x-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. the spectrum ofeach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from0.3-0.7 kev and subsolar elemental abundances. in four of the five knots,non-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling outsynchrotron or ic/cmb mechanisms for their emission. the internal pressures ofthe knots exceed that of the ambient ism or the equipartition pressure of thenml by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be shortlived ($\sim3\times10^6$ yrs). based on energetic arguments, it is implausiblethat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galacticnucleus of cen a or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation ofthe nml. in our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the x-rayknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a directinteraction with the jet. the lifetimes of the x-ray knots in the nml areroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the sw inner lobe,suggesting they were created in the same agn outburst. the most plausible modelof the nml is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is beingre-energized by the current outburst. we also report the discovery of a largescale (at least 35 kpc radius) gas halo around cen a.

0904.1112	unmasking the active galactic nucleus in pks j2310-437	pks j2310-437 is an agn with bright x-ray emission relative to its weak radioemission and optical continuum. it is believed that its jet lies far enoughfrom the line of sight that it is not highly relativistically beamed. it thusprovides an extreme test of agn models. we present new observations aimed atrefining the measurement of the source's properties. in optical photometry withthe ntt we measure a central excess with relatively steep spectrum lying abovethe bright elliptical galaxy emission, and we associate the excess wholly or inpart with the agn. a new full-track radio observation with the atca finds thatthe core 8.64ghz emission has varied by about 20 per cent over 38 months, andimproves the mapping of the weak jet. with chandra we measure awell-constrained power-law spectral index for the x-ray core, uncontaminated byextended emission from the cluster environment, with a negligible level ofintrinsic absorption. weak x-ray emission from the resolved radio jet is alsomeasured. our analysis suggests that the optical continuum in this radio galaxyhas varied by at least a factor of four over a timescale of about two years,something that should be testable with further observations. we conclude thatthe most likely explanation for the bright central x-ray emission issynchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons.

0706.4013	a chandra study of the lobe/ism interactions around the inner radio  lobes of centaurus a: constraints on the temperature structure and transport  processes	we present results from deeper {\em chandra} observations of the southwestradio lobe of centaurus a, first described by kraft et al. (2003). we find thatthe sharp x-ray surface brightness discontinuity extends around $\sim$75% ofthe periphery of the radio lobe, and detect significant temperature jumps inthe brightest regions of this discontinuity nearest to the nucleus. thisdemonstrates that this discontinuity is indeed a strong shock which is theresult of an overpressure which has built up in the entire lobe over time.additionally, we demonstrate that if the mean free path for ions to transferenergy and momentum to the electrons behind the shock is as large as thespitzer value, the electron and proton temperatures will not have equilibratedalong the sw boundary of the radio lobe where the shock is strongest. thus theproton temperature of the shocked gas could be considerably larger than theobserved electron temperature, and the total energy of the outburstcorrespondingly larger as well. we investigate this using a simpleone-dimensional shock model for a two-fluid (proton/electron) plasma. we findthat for the thermodynamic parameters of the cen a shock the electrontemperature rises rapidly from $\sim$0.29 kev (the temperature of the ambientism) to $\sim$3.5 kev at which point heating from the protons is balanced byadiabatic losses. the proton and electron temperatures do not equilibrate in atimescale less than the age of the lobe. we note that the measured electrontemperature of similar features in other nearby powerful radio galaxies in poorenvironments may considerably underestimate the strength and velocity of theshock.

0906.5364	luminosity functions of lmxbs in centaurus a: globular clusters versus  the field	we study the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxb) in the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a, concentrating primarily ontwo aspects of binary populations: the xlf behavior at the low luminosity limitand comparison between globular cluster and field sources. the 800 ksecexposure of the deep chandra vlp program allows us to reach a limitingluminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.we confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall lmxb xlf atlog(l_x)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constantdn/d(ln l). separating globular cluster and field sources, we find astatistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributionswith a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular clusterpopulation. this demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parentpopulations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire lmxb population inearly type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. as a plausibleexplanation for this difference in the xlfs, we suggest that there is anenhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which arecreated in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. due to the 4 timeshigher ionization temperature of he, such systems are subject to accretion diskinstabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, andtherefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.

0909.3849	low resolution spectral templates for agns and galaxies from 0.03 -- 30  microns	we present a set of low resolution empirical sed templates for agns andgalaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 to 30 microns based on themulti-wavelength photometric observations of the noao deep-wide field surveybootes field and the spectroscopic observations of the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey. our training sample is comprised of 14448 galaxies in the redshiftrange 0&lt;~z&lt;~1 and 5347 likely agns in the range 0&lt;~z&lt;~5.58. we use ourtemplates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and agns. while theyare relatively accurate for galaxies, their accuracies for agns are a strongfunction of the luminosity ratio between the agn and galaxy components.somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the agn and its host arewell determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error.we also use our templates to study the mid-ir agn selection criteria developedby stern et al.(2005) and lacy et al.(2004). we find that the stern etal.(2005) criteria suffers from significant incompleteness when there is astrong host galaxy component and at z =~ 4.5, when the broad halpha emissionline is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated bylow and intermediate redshift galaxies. the lacy et al.(2004) criterion is notaffected by incompleteness at z =~ 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by stronggalaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low redshift starforming galaxies. finally, we use our templates to predict the color-colordistribution of sources in the upcoming wise mission and define a colorcriterion to select agns analogous to those developed for irac photometry. weestimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 agns will be identified by thesecriteria, but will have serious completeness problems for z &gt;~ 3.4.

0910.3610	high resolution x-ray imaging of supernova remnant 1987a	we report observations of the remnant of supernova 1987a with the highresolution camera (hrc) onboard the chandra x-ray observatory. a direct imagefrom the hrc resolves the annular structure of the x-ray remnant, confirmingthe morphology previously inferred by deconvolution of lower resolution datafrom the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer. detailed spatial modeling showsthat the a thin ring plus a thin shell gives statistically the best descriptionof the overall remnant structure, and suggests an outer radius 0.96" +/- 0.05"+/- 0.03" for the x-ray-emitting region, with the two uncertaintiescorresponding to the statistical and systematic errors, respectively. this isvery similar to the radius determined by a similar modeling technique for theradio shell at a comparable epoch, in contrast to previous claims that theremnant is 10-15% smaller at x-rays than in the radio band. the hrcobservations put a flux limit of 0.010 cts/s (99% confidence level, 0.08-10 kevrange) on any compact source at the remnant center. assuming the sameforeground neutral hydrogen column density as towards the remnant, this allowsus to rule out an unobscured neutron star with surface temperature t^\infty &gt;2.5mk observed at infinity, a bright pulsar wind nebula or a magnetar.

0911.2115	long term monitoring of the dynamics and particle acceleration of knots  in the jet of centaurus a	we present new and archival multi-frequency radio and x-ray data forcentaurus a obtained over almost 20 years at the vla and with chandra, withwhich we measure the x-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, fluxdensity variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and propermotions. we compare the observed properties with current knot formation modelsand particle acceleration mechanisms. we rule out impulsive particleacceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect thesame population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence ofextreme variability in the x-ray knots. we find the most likely mechanism forall the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed bya steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and x-ray synchrotronemission. in this scenario, the x-ray-only knots have radio counterparts thatare too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shockswhere no particles are accelerated to x-ray emitting energies. although thebase knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of amoving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots arehard to explain in this model. we detect apparent motion in three knots;however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for oragainst a faster moving `spine' within the jet. the radio-only knots, bothstationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

1001.4529	the mid-ir and x-ray selected qso luminosity function	we present the j-band luminosity function of 1838 mid-infrared and x-rayselected agns in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;5.85. these luminosity functions areconstructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broad-band observations fromthe uv to the mid-ir of the ndwfs bootes field with the x-ray observations ofthe xbootes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field byages. our sample is primarily composed of irac-selected agns, targeted usingmodifications of the stern et al.(2005) criteria, complemented by mips 24microns and x-ray selected agns to alleviate the biases of irac mid-irselection against z~4.5 quasars and agns faint with respect to their hosts.this sample provides an accurate link between low and high redshift agnluminosity functions and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness ofoptical samples at z~3. we find that the space density of the brightest quasarsstrongly decreases from z=3 to z=0, while the space density of faint quasars isat least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. at z&gt;3 weobserve a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. wemodel the luminosity function by a double power-law and find that its evolutioncannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, butmust be a combination of both. our best-fit model has bright and faintpower-law indices consistent with the low redshift measurements based on the2qz and 2slaq surveys and it generally agrees with the number of bright quasarspredicted by other lfs at all redshifts. if we construct the qso luminosityfunction using only the irac-selected agns, we find that the biases inherent tothis selection method significantly modify the behavior of phi*(z) only for z&lt;1and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude m*_j(z).

1008.2921	radio and deep chandra observations of the disturbed cool core cluster  abell 133	we present results based on new chandra and multi-frequency radioobservations of the disturbed cool core cluster abell 133. the diffuse gas hasa complex bird-like morphology, with a plume of emission extending from twosymmetric wing-like features, and capped with a filamentary radio relic. x-rayobservations indicate the presence of either high temperature gas ornon-thermal emission in the region of the relic. we find evidence for a weakelliptical x-ray surface brightness edge surrounding the core, consistent witha sloshing cold front. the plume is consistent with having formed due to upliftby a buoyantly rising radio bubble, now seen as the radio relic. our resultsare inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the x-ray wings formed dueto the passage of a weak shock through the cool core. we instead conclude thatthe wings are due to x-ray cavities formed by gas displacement by the radiorelic. the central cd galaxy contains two small-scale cold gas clumps that areslightly offset from their optical and uv counterparts, suggestive of agalaxy-galaxy merger event. on larger scales, there is evidence for clustersubstructure in both optical observations and the x-ray temperature map. wesuggest that abell 133 has recently undergone a merger event with aninterloping subgroup, initiating gas sloshing in the core. we show that theadditional buoyant force from a passing subcluster can have a significanteffect on the rise trajectories of buoyant bubbles, although this effect alonecannot fully explain the morphology of abell 133. the radio observations reveala previously unreported background giant radio galaxy at z = 0.293, thenorthern lobe of which overlies the radio relic in the core of abell 133. arough estimate indicates that the contribution of this background lobe to thetotal radio emission in the region of the relic is modest (&lt; 13%).

1011.3295	identification of a population of x-ray emitting massive stars in the  galactic plane	we present x-ray, infrared, optical and radio observations of four previouslyunidentified galactic plane x-ray sources, ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, axj144701-5919 and ax j144547-5931. detection of each source with the chandrax-ray observatory has provided sub-arcsecond localizations, which we use toidentify bright infrared counterparts to all four objects. infrared and opticalspectroscopy of these counterparts demonstrate that all four x-ray sources areextremely massive stars, with spectral classifications ofpe/wn9 (axj163252-4746), wn7 (ax j184738-0156 = wr121a), wn7-8h (ax j144701-5919) andoif+ (ax j144547-5931). ax j163252-4746 and ax j184738-0156 are both luminous,hard, x-ray emitters with strong fe xxv emission lines in their x-ray spectraat ~6.7 kev. the multi-wavelength properties of ax j163252-4746 and axj184738-0156 are not consistent with isolated massive stars or accretion onto acompact companion; we conclude that their x-ray emission is most likelygenerated in a colliding-wind binary system. for both ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931, the x-ray emission is an order of magnitude less luminous andwith a softer spectrum. these properties are consistent with a colliding-windbinary interpretation for these two sources also, but other mechanisms for thegeneration of x-rays cannot be excluded. there are many other as yetunidentified x-ray sources in the galactic plane, with x-ray properties similarto those seen for ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931. this may indicate a substantial population of x-ray-emittingmassive stars and colliding-wind binaries in the milky way.

1111.4020	reinstating the m31 x-ray system rx j0042.3+4115 as a black hole x-ray  binary, and compelling evidence for an extended corona	the m31 x-ray source rx j0042.3+4115 was originally identified as a blackhole binary because it displayed characteristic low state variability atconspicuously high luminosities; unfortunately, this variability was laterfound to be artificial. however, analysis of 84 chandra acis observations, anhst acs/wfc observation, and a 60 ks xmm-newton observation has supplied newevidence that rx j0042.3+4115 is indeed a black hole binary. the brightestoptical star within 3 sigma of the position of rx j0042.3+4115 had a f435w (~b)magnitude of 25.4+/-0.2; m_b &gt; -0.4, hence we find a low mass donor likely. rxj0042.3+4115 was persistently bright over ~12 years. spectral fits revealedcharacteristic black hole binary states: a low/hard state at 2.08+/-0.08 e+38erg/s, and a steep power law state at 2.41+/-0.05 e+38 erg/s (0.3--10 kev). thehigh luminosity low state suggests a ~20 m_sun primary; this is high, butwithin the range of known stellar black hole masses. the inner disk temperatureduring the steep power law state is 2.24$\pm$0.15 kev, high but strikinglysimilar to that of grs 1915+105, the only known galactic black hole binary witha low mass donor t o be persistently bright. therefore rx j0042.3+4115 may bean analog for grs 1915+105; however, other mechanisms may account for itsbehavior. we find compelling evidence for an extended corona during the steeppower law state, because compact corona models where the seed photons forcomptonization are tied to the inner disc temperature are rejected.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1203.2583	12 years of x-ray variability in m31 globular clusters, including 8  black hole candidates, as seen by chandra	we examined 134 chandra observations of the population of x-ray sourcesassociated with globular clusters (gcs) in the central region of m31. these areexpected to be x-ray binary systems (xbs), consisting of a neutron star orblack hole accreting material from a close companion. we created long-termlightcurves for these sources, correcting for background, interstellarabsorption and instrumental effects. we tested for variability by examining thegoodness of fit for the best fit constant intensity. we also created structurefunctions (sfs) for every object in our sample, the first time this techniquehas been applied to xbs. we found significant variability in 28 out of 34 gcsand gc candidates; the other 6 sources had 0.3--10 kev luminosities fainterthan ~2e+36 erg/s, limiting our ability to detect similar variability. the sfsof xbs with 0.3--10 kev luminosities ~2--50 e+36 generally showed considerablymore variability than the published ensemble sf of agn. our brightest xbs weremostly consistent with the agn sf; however, their 2--10 kev fluxes could bematched by &lt;1 agn per square degree. these encouraging results suggest thatexamining the long term lightcurves of other x-ray sources in the field mayprovide an important distinction between x-ray binaries and backgroundgalaxies, as the x-ray emission spectra from these two classes of x-ray sourcesare similar. additionally, we identify 3 new black hole candidates (bhcs) usingadditional xmm-newton data, bringing the total number of m31 gc bhcs to 9, with8 covered in this survey.

1205.3103	weak-lensing mass measurements of five galaxy clusters in the south pole  telescope survey using magellan/megacam	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of five galaxyclusters selected from the south pole telescope (spt) survey, with the primarygoal of comparing these with the spt sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray basedmass estimates. the clusters span redshifts 0.28 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 and have massesm_500 &gt; 2 x 10^14 h^-1 m_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered bythe spt survey. we observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with themegacam imager on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. we measure a mean ratio ofweak lensing (wl) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the sz data,both within an aperture of r_500,sz derived from the sz mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.we measure a mean ratio of spherical wl masses evaluated at r_500,sz tospherical sz masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical wl massesevaluated at r_500,wl to spherical sz masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. we explorepotential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude thatall are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms beingcluster concentration uncertainty and n-body simulation calibration bias.expanding the sample of spt clusters with wl observations has the potential tosignificantly improve the spt cluster mass calibration and the resultingcosmological constraints from the spt cluster survey. these are the first wldetections using megacam on the magellan clay telescope.

1206.2355	irregular sloshing cold fronts in the nearby merging groups ngc 7618 and  ugc 12491: evidence for kelvin-helmholtz instabilities	we present results from two \sim30 ks chandra observations of the hotatmospheres of the merging galaxy groups centered around ngc 7618 and ugc12491. our images show the presence of arc-like sloshing cold fronts wrappedaround each group center and \sim100 kpc long spiral tails in both groups. mostinterestingly, the cold fronts are highly distorted in both groups, exhibiting'wings' along the fronts. these features resemble the structures predicted fromnon-viscous hydrodynamic simulations of gas sloshing, where kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities (khis) distort the cold fronts. this is in contrast to thestructure seen in many other sloshing and merger cold fronts, which are smoothand featureless at the current observational resolution. both magnetic fieldsand viscosity have been invoked to explain the absence of khis in these smoothcold fronts, but the ngc 7618/ugc 12491 pair are two in a growing number ofboth sloshing and merger cold fronts that appear distorted. magnetic fieldsand/or viscosity may be able to suppress the growth of khis at the cold frontsin some clusters and groups, but clearly not in all. we propose that thepresence or absence of khi-distortions in cold fronts can be used as a measureof the effective viscosity and/or magnetic field strengths in the icm.

1208.1612	contribution of the accretion disk, hot corona, and obscuring torus to  the luminosity of seyfert galaxies: integral and spitzer observations	we estimate the relative contributions of the supermassive black hole (smbh)accretion disk, corona, and obscuring torus to the bolometric luminosity ofseyfert galaxies, using spizter mid-infrared (mir) observations of a completesample of 68 nearby active galactic nuclei from the integral all-sky hard x-ray(hx) survey. this is the first hx-selected (above 15 kev) sample of agns withcomplementary high angular resolution, high signal to noise, mir data.correcting for the host galaxy contribution, we find a correlation between hxand mir luminosities: l_mir l_hx^(0.74+/-0.06). assuming that the observed miremission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dustytorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (asinferred from the declining fraction of obscured agns), the intrinsic diskluminosity, l_d, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the coronain the 2-300 kev energy band, l_c, with the l_d/l_c ratio varying by a factorof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6. this ratio is a factor of ~2 smaller thanfor typical quasars producing the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). therefore,over three orders of magnitude in luminosity, hx radiation carries a large, androughly comparable, fraction of the bolometric output of agns. we estimate thecumulative bolometric luminosity density of local agns at ~(1-3)x10^40erg/s/mpc^3. finally, the compton temperature ranges between kt_c~2 and ~6 kevfor nearby agns, compared to kt_c~2 kev for typical quasars, confirming thatradiative heating of interstellar gas can play an important role in regulatingsmbh growth.

0802.0928	discovery of heavily-obscured agn among 7 integral hard x-ray sources  observed by chandra	we observed 7 integral sources with the chandra x-ray observatory to refinetheir localization to ~2 arcsec and to study their x-ray spectra. two sourcesare inferred to have a galactic origin: igr j08390-4833 is most likely amagnetic cataclysmic variable with a white dwarf spin period ~1,450 s; and igrj21343+4738 is a high-mass x-ray binary. five sources (igr j02466-4222, igrj09522-6231, igr j14493-5534, igr j14561-3738, and igr j23523+5844) prove to beagn with significant intrinsic x-ray absorption along the line of sight. theirredshifts and hard x-ray (17-60 kev) luminosities range from 0.025 to 0.25 andfrom ~2x10^43 to ~2x10^45 erg/s, respectively, with the distance to igrj14493-5534 remaining unknown. the sources igr j02466-4222 and igr j14561-3738are likely compton-thick agn with absorption column densities nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2,and the former further appears to be one of the nearest x-ray bright,optically-normal galaxies. with the newly-identified sources, the number ofheavily-obscured (nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn detected by integral has increased to~10. therefore, such objects constitute 10-15% of hard x-ray bright, non-blazaragn in the local universe. the small ratio (&lt;&lt;1%) of soft (0.5-8.0 kev) to hard(17-60 kev) band fluxes (chandra to integral) and the non-detection of opticalnarrow-line emission in some of the compton-thick agn in our sample suggeststhat there is a new class of objects in which the central massive black holemay be surrounded by a geometrically-thick dusty torus with a narrow ionizationcone.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1407.2942	mass calibration and cosmological analysis of the spt-sz galaxy cluster  sample using velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ and x-ray $y_\textrm{x}$  measurements	we present a velocity dispersion-based mass calibration of the south poletelescope sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey (spt-sz) galaxy cluster sample.using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster candidates from 720 deg2of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and 16 x-ray yxmeasurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate themass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. thecalibrations using $\sigma_v$ and yx are consistent at the $0.6\sigma$ level,with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. we use the fullcluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. thespt cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the wmap9 orplanck+wmap9 polarization (wp) data, but assuming the sum of the neutrinomasses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ ev, we find the datasets to be consistent at the1.0$\sigma$ level for wmap9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for planck+wp. allowing for larger$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. when we combine the cluster andplanck+wp datasets with bao and snia, the preferred cluster masses are$1.9\sigma$ higher than the yx calibration and $0.8\sigma$ higher than the$\sigma_v$ calibration. given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23% in mass,respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension,indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of thedata. using the multi-probe dataset, we measure $\omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and$\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. within a $\nu$cdm model we find $\sum m_\nu =0.148\pm0.081$ ev. we present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of stateparameter $w$ to vary, we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$,demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with alcdm model ($\gamma=0.55; \,w=-1$).

0803.3595	evidence for non-hydrostatic gas motions in the hot ism of centaurus a	we present preliminary results from a deep (600 ks) {\em chandra} observationof the hot interstellar medium of the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a (cena). we find a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas $\sim$3.5 kpc fromthe nucleus spanning a 120$^\circ$ arc. the temperature of the gas is0.60$\pm$0.05 and 0.68$\pm$0.10 kev, interior and exterior to thediscontinuity, respectively. the elemental abundance is poorly constrained bythe spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity,there is a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. thiswould imply that the gas is moving at 470$\pm$100 km s$^{-1}$, or mach1.0$\pm$0.2 (1.2$\pm$0.2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external(internal) to the discontinuity. alternatively, pressure balance could bemaintained if there is a large (factor of $\sim$7) discontinuity in theelemental abundance. we suggest that the observed discontinuity is the resultof non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i.e. sloshing) due to the recentmerger. in this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients areimportant in the visibility of the discontinuity. cen a is in the late stagesof merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in densityand abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the twogalaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after themerger. the pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on thetemporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. the jet could have decollimatedcrossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

0806.0866	chandra's view of the ram pressure stripped galaxy m86	we present results from a mosaic of nine chandra observations of m86 and thesurrounding field. we detect three main diffuse components: the virgo icm at~2.4 kev, the extended halo of m86 at ~1.2 kev, and the cooler central andstripped gas of m86 at ~0.8 kev. the most striking feature is a long tail ofemission, which consists of a plume ~ 4' north of m86 and two main extensionsemanating from the plume. based on the morphology and temperature structure ofthe tail, we conclude that it is formed by ram pressure stripping of m86 as itfalls into the virgo cluster and interacts with the virgo icm, in agreementwith earlier work. the tail is 150 kpc in projection, and a simple estimategives a lower limit on the true length of the tail of 380 kpc, making this thelongest ram pressure stripped tail presently known. the total gas mass in theplume (7x10^8 m_sun) and tail (1x10^9 m_sun) is about three times that in thecore of m86, which supports the scenario where most of the gas was strippedrapidly and recently. the projected position of the plume can be understood ifm86 has an aspherical potential, as suggested by optical isophotes. rampressure stripping from an aspherical potential can also explain the split"double tails" seen in m86 and in other virgo cluster galaxies in the field.the large line-of-sight velocity of m86 (1550 km/s with respect to m87), itsposition relative to the virgo cluster, and the orientation of the tail tightlyconstrain its orbital parameters. the data are inconsistent with a radialorbit, and imply inner and outer turning radii of r_i ~ 300 kpc and r_o &gt; 8.8mpc, indicating that m86 is, at best, only weakly bound to the virgo cluster.

astro-ph;0008499	chandra estimate of the magnetic field strength near the cold front in  a3667	we use the chandra observation of the cold front in the intracluster gas ofa3667 to estimate the magnetic field strength near the front. the front is seenin the chandra data as a sharp discontinuity in the gas density whichdelineates a large body of dense cool gas moving with the near-sonic velocitythrough the less dense, hotter gas. without a magnetic field, the front shouldbe quickly disturbed by the kelvin-helmholtz instability arising fromtangential motion of gas layers. however, chandra image shows that the front isstable within a +-30deg sector in the direction of the cloud motion, beyondwhich it gradually disappears. we suggest that the kelvin-helmholtz instabilitywithin the +-30deg sector is suppressed by surface tension of the magneticfield whose field lines are parallel to the front. the required field strengthis b ~ 10 mug. magnetic field near the front is expected to be stronger andhave very different structure compared to the bulk of the intergalactic medium,because the field lines are stretched by the tangential gas motions. such amagnetic configuration, once formed, would effectively stop the plasmadiffusion and heat conduction across the front, and may inhibit gas mixingduring the subcluster merger. we note that even the increased magnetic fieldnear the front contributes only 10-20% to the total gas pressure, and thereforemagnetic pressure is unimportant for hydrostatic cluster mass estimates.

astro-ph;0009211	chandra high-resolution camera observations of the luminous x-ray source  in the starburst galaxy m82	we have analyzed chandra high resolution camera observations of the starburstgalaxy m82, concentrating on the most luminous x-ray source. we find a positionfor the source of $\rm r.a. = 09^h 55^m 50^s.2, decl. = +69^{\circ} 40\arcmin46\arcsec.7$ (j2000) with a $1\sigma$ radial error of $0.7\arcsec$. theaccurate x-ray position shows that the luminous source is not at the dynamicalcentre of m82 nor coincident with any suggested radio agn candidate. the sourceis highly variable between observations, which suggests that the source is acompact object and not a supernova or remnant. there is no significant shortterm variability within the observations. dynamical friction and the off-centerposition place an upper bound of $10^{5} - 10^{6} m_{\odot}$ on the mass of theobject, depending on its age. the x-ray luminosity suggests a compact objectmass of at least $500 m_{\odot}$. thus, the luminous source in m82 mayrepresent a new class of compact object with a mass intermediate between thoseof stellar mass black hole candidates and supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0012162	structure of the x-ray emission from the jet of 3c 273	we present images from five observations of the quasar 3c 273 with thechandra x-ray observatory. the jet has at least four distinct features whichare not resolved in previous observations. the first knot in the jet (a1) isvery bright in x-rays. its x-ray spectrum is well fitted with a power law withalpha = 0.60 +/- 0.05. combining this measurement with lower frequency datashows that a pure synchrotron model can fit the spectrum of this knot from1.647 ghz to 5 kev (over nine decades in energy) with alpha = 0.76 +/- 0.02,similar to the x-ray spectral slope. thus, we place a lower limit on the totalpower radiated by this knot of 1.5e43 erg/s; substantially more power may beemitted in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands.  knot a2 is also detected and is somewhat blended with knot b1. synchrotronemission may also explain the x-ray emission but a spectral bend is requirednear the optical band. for knots a1 and b1, the x-ray flux dominates theemitted energy. for the remaining optical knots (c through h), localized x-rayenhancements that might correspond to the optical features are not clearlyresolved. the position angle of the jet ridge line follows the optical shapewith distinct, aperiodic excursions of +/-1 deg from a median value of-138.0deg. finally, we find x-ray emission from the ``inner jet'' between 5 and10" from the core.

(1) we present data on the spectra and/or light curves of the 5 most luminousm31 gc sources.  (2)we explore possible explanations for the high x-ray luminosities of thebrightest sources. these include that the x-ray sources may be composites, theradiation we receive may be beamed, metallicity effects could be at work, orthe sources may be accreting black holes. we weigh each of these possibilitiesagainst the data. in addition, we introduce a neutron star model in which masstransfer proceeds on the thermal time scale of the donor star. our model canproduce luminosities of several times 10^{38} ergs/s, and leads to a set ofwell-defined predictions.  (3) we compute the x-ray luminosity function and the distribution of countsin wavebands that span the range of energies to which chandra is sensitive. wefind the peak x-ray luminosity is higher and that systems with l_x &gt; 10^{37}ergs/s constitute a larger fraction of all gc sources than in the mw.

astro-ph;0109172	exploring the early universe with xmm-newton	the question of the x-ray background has been largely settled over the last10 years using the rosat satellite. about 70-80 % of the soft x-ray backgroundwas resolved into discrete sources, which are mainly x-ray and opticallyunobscured agns (quasars, sy1). furthermore we found already several obscuredagns in deep rosat surveys, which are predicted by the population synthesismodels for the x-ray background, based on the unified agn schemes. however,deep x-ray surveys using chandra} and xmm-newton allow to test the reliabilityof these models, which seem to be still far from unique. recent observationswith chandra and xmm-newton have resolved most of the hard x-ray backgroundinto discrete sources. the first deep xmm-newton survey was performed in thelockman hole region, one of the sky areas best studied over a wide wavelengthrange. about 100 ksec good exposure time have been accumulated with the epiccamera during the performance verification phase. we reach a limiting flux of0.31, 1.4 and 2.4 x 10e-15 erg/cm2/s in the 0.5-2, 2-10 and 5-10 kev energybands. a significant number of x-ray sources show hard, probably intrinsicallyabsorbed x-ray spectra. we discuss the x-ray, optical and infrared propertiesof these sources in comparison with the predictions of the recent x-raybackground models.

astro-ph;0111340	chandra observations of the x-ray jet in centaurus a	we present high angular resolution x-ray images and spectra from two {\emchandra} acis-i observations of the x-ray jet in the nearby radio galaxycentaurus a. we find that the x-ray emission from the jet is composed of a lowsurface brightness diffuse component extending continuously from within atleast 60 pc of the active nucleus into the ne radio lobe 4 kpc from thenucleus, along with 31 discrete compact knots, most of which are extended atthe resolution of our observation. we find that there are small but significantdifferences between the x-ray and radio morphologies of the inner jet at thearcsecond level, making it unlikely that a single, spatially coincidentpopulation of ultrarelativistic electrons is responsible for the emission inboth energy regimes. we suggest that the x-ray knots of the inner jet areindeed the sites of particle acceleration and shocks, and the x-ray and radioknot offsets are caused by a combination of particle diffusion and energy loss.these offsets may be a common feature of all jets in radio galaxies, or atleast jets in fr i type galaxies, and may be fundamental to the physics of suchjets. the x-ray spectra of several regions of the jet are well fit by absorbedpower-law models with photon indices $\sim$2.2-2.5, although the spectrum ofone bright knot located $\sim$1 kpc from the nucleus (knot b) is harder (photonindex = 2.0).

astro-ph;0304363	x-ray emission from the hot ism and sw radio lobe of the nearby radio  galaxy centaurus a	we present results from two {\em chandra}/acis-i observations and one {\emxmm-newton} observation of x-ray emission from the ism and the inner radiolobes of the nearby radio galaxy centaurus a. the ism has an average radialsurface brightness profile that is well described by a $\beta$-model profilewith index $\beta$=0.40$\pm$0.04 and a temperature of $k_bt_{ism}\sim$0.29 kevbeyond 2 kpc from the nucleus. we find that diffuse x-ray emission iscoincident with the outer half of the southwest radio lobe, and a bright x-rayenhancement is detected along the edge of the lobe. on the basis of energeticand lifetime arguments, we reject a nonthermal explanation for this emission.we model this emission as a thin, hot shell or cap of x-ray emitting plasmasurrounding the radio lobe that was created by the supersonic inflation of thelobe. this plasma shell is both hotter than ($k_bt_{sh}\sim$2.9 kev) andgreatly overpressurized relative to the ambient ism indicating supersonicexpansion. we estimate that the lobe is expanding into the ism at approximatelymach 8.5 or 2400 km s$^{-1}$. we are not directly observing the bow shock, butrather the cooler, denser material that is accumulating ahead of the contactdiscontinuity. the thermal energy in the shell is a significant fraction of thethermal energy of the hot ism, demonstrating the possibility that the hot ismof early galaxies can be re-energized by outflows from nuclear activity.interestingly, no similarly bright x-ray emission is detected in or along theedge of the ne lobe, implying that there are differences in the dynamics andevolution of the kpc-scale radio components.

astro-ph;0405511	eso 3060170 -- a massive fossil galaxy group with a heated gas core?	we present a detailed study of the eso 3060170 galaxy group combiningchandra, xmm and optical observations. the system is found to be a fossilgalaxy group. the group x-ray emission is composed of a central dense cool core(10 kpc in radius) and an isothermal medium beyond the central 10 kpc. theregion between 10 and 50 kpc (the cooling radius) has the same temperature asthe gas from 50 kpc to 400 kpc although the gas cooling time between 10 and 50kpc (2 - 6 gyr) is shorter than the hubble time. thus, the eso 3060170 groupdoes not have a group-sized cooling core. we suggest that the group coolingcore may have been heated by a central agn outburst in the past and the smalldense cool core is the truncated relic of a previous cooling core. the chandraobservations also reveal a variety of x-ray features in the central region,including a ``finger'', an edge-like feature and a small ``tail'', all alignedalong a north-south axis, as are the galaxy light and group galaxydistribution. the proposed agn outburst may cause gas ``sloshing'' around thecenter and produce these asymmetric features. the observed flat temperatureprofile to 1/3 r_vir is not consistent with the predicted temperature profilein recent numerical simulations. we compare the entropy profile of the eso3060170 group with those of three other groups and find a flatter relation thanthat predicted by simulations involving only shock heating, s $\propto$ r$^{~0.85}$. this is direct evidence for the importance of non-gravitationalprocesses in group centers. we derive the mass profiles within 1/3 r_vir andfind the eso 3060170 group is the most massive fossil group known (1 - 2 x10$^{14}$ m$_{\odot}$). the m/l ratio of the system, ~ 150 at 0.3 r_vir, isnormal.
