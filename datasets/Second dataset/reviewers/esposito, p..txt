0901.3453	suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr 0501+4516 in  outburst	we present the first suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr0501+4516, performed on 2008 august 26, four days after the onset of burstingactivity of this new member of the magnetar family. the soft x-ray persistentemission was detected with the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) at a 0.5-10 kevflux of 3.8e-11 erg/s/cm2, with a spectrum well fitted by an absorbed blackbodyplus power-law model. the source pulsation was confirmed at a period of5.762072+/-0.000002 s, and 32 x-ray bursts were detected by the xis, four ofwhich were also detected at higher energies by the hard x-ray detector (hxd).the strongest burst, which occurred at 03:16:16.9 (utc), was so bright that itcaused instrumental saturation, but its precursor phase, lasting for about 200ms, was detected successfully over the 0.5-200 kev range, with a fluence of~2.1e-7 erg/cm2 and a peak intensity of about 89 crab. the entire burst fluenceis estimated to be ~50 times higher. the precursor spectrum was very hard, andwell modeled by a combination of two blackbodies. we discuss the burstingactivity and x/gamma-ray properties of this newly discovered soft gammarepeater in comparison with other members of the class.

0907.2873	spin-down rate and inferred dipole magnetic field of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 1627-41	using chandra data taken on 2008 june, we detected pulsations at 2.59439(4) sin the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41. this is the second measurement ofthe source spin period and allows us to derive for the first time a long-termspin-down rate of (1.9 +/- 0.4)e-11 s/s. from this value we infer for sgr1627-41 a characteristic age of 2.2 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4e+34 erg/s(one of the highest among sources of the same class), and a surface dipolemagnetic field strength of 2e+14 g. these properties confirm the magnetarnature of sgr 1627-41; however, they should be considered with caution sincethey were derived on the basis of a period derivative measurement made usingtwo epochs only and magnetar spin-down rates are generally highly variable. thepulse profile, double-peaked and with a pulsed fraction of (13 +/- 2)% in the2-10 kev range, closely resembles that observed by xmm-newton in 2008september. having for the first time a timing model for this sgr, we alsosearched for a pulsed signal in archival radio data collected with the parkesradio telescope nine months after the previous x-ray outburst. no evidence forradio pulsations was found, down to a luminosity level 10-20 times fainter (fora 10% duty cycle and a distance of 11 kpc) than the peak luminosity shown bythe known radio magnetars.

0907.4041	the first broad-band x-ray study of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  saxj1818.6-1703 in outburst	the supergiant fast x-ray transient (sfxt) saxj1818.6-1703 underwent anoutburst on 2009 may 6 and was observed with swift. we report on theseobservations which, for the first time, allow us to study the broad-bandspectrum from soft to hard x-rays of this source. no x-ray spectral informationwas available on this source before the swift monitoring. the spectrum can bedeconvolved well with models usually adopted to describe the emission from highmass x-ray binary x-ray pulsars, and is characterized by a very highabsorption, a flat power law (photon index ~0.1-0.5) and a cutoff at about 7-12kev. alternatively, the saxj1818.6-1703 emission can be described with acomptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona, with an electrontemperature kte=5-7 kev, a hot seed photon temperature, kt0, of 1.3-1.4 kev,and an optical depth for the comptonizing plasma of about 10. the 1-100 kevluminosity at the peak of the flare is 3e36 erg/s (assuming the opticalcounterpart distance of 2.5 kpc). these properties of saxj1818.6-1703 resemblethose of the prototype of the sfxt class, xtej1739-302. the monitoring withswift/xrt reveals an outburst duration of about 5 days, similarly to othermembers of the class of sfxts, confirming saxj1818.6-1703 as a member of thisclass.

0907.4239	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j1037.5-5647 in a low luminosity state	the spectra of several x-ray binary pulsars display a clear soft excess,which in most cases can be described with a blackbody model, above the mainpower-law component. while in the high-luminosity sources it is usuallycharacterized by low temperature (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and large emission radius (r &gt;100 km), in the two persistent and low-luminosity pulsars 4u 0352+309 and rxj0146.9+6121 this component has a high temperature (kt &gt; 1 kev) and a smallerradius (r &lt; 0.5 km), consistent with the estimated size of the neutron-starpolar cap. here we report on the timing and spectral analysis of rxj1037.5-5647, another low-luminosity persistent be binary pulsar, based on thefirst xmm-newton observation of this source. we have found a best-fit period p= 853.4(+/-0.2) s, that implies an average pulsar spin-up dp/dt ~ -2e-8 s/s inthe latest decade. the estimated source luminosity is lx ~ 10^34 erg/s, a valuecomparable to that of the other persistent be binary pulsars and about oneorder of magnitude lower than in most of the previous measurements. the sourcespectrum can be described with a power law plus blackbody model, with ktbb =1.26(+0.16/-0.09) kev and rbb = 128(+13/-21) m, suggesting a polar-cap originof this component. these results strengthen the hypothesis that, in addition tolow luminosities and long periods, this class of sources is characterized alsoby common spectral properties

0907.4616	quiet but still bright: xmm-newton observations of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 0526-66	sgr 0526-66 was the first soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) from which a giantflare was detected in march 1979, suggesting the existence of magnetars, i.e.neutron stars powered by the decay of their extremely strong magnetic field.since then, very little information has been obtained on this object, mainlybecause it has been burst-inactive since 1983 and the study of its persistentx-ray emission has been hampered by its large distance and its location in ax-ray bright supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud. here we report ona comprehensive analysis of all the available xmm-newton observations of sgr0526-66. in particular, thanks to a deep observation taken in 2007, we measuredits pulsation period (p = 8.0544 +/- 0.0002 s) 6 years after its latestdetection by chandra. this allowed us to detect for the first time asignificant reduction of its spin-down rate. from a comparison with two shorterxmm-newton observations performed in 2000 and 2001, we found no significantchanges in the spectrum, which is well modelled by an absorbed power-law withnh = 4.6e+21 cm^-2 and photon index = 3.27. the high luminosity (about 4e+35erg/s, in the 1-10 kev energy band) still observed about 25 years after thelatest detection of bursting activity places sgr 0526-66 in the group of brightand persistent magnetar candidates.

0908.3819	upper limits on x-ray emission from two rotating radio transients	x-ray emission from the enigmatic rotating radio transients (rrats) offers avital clue to understanding these objects and how they relate to the greaterneutron star population. an x-ray counterpart to j1819-1458 is known, and itsproperties are similar to those of other middle-aged (0.1 myr) neutron stars.we have searched for x-ray emission with chandra/acis at the positions of tworrats with arcsecond (or better) localisation, j0847-4316 and j1846-0257.despite deep searches (especially for j1847-0257) we did not detect anyemission with 0.3-8 kev count-rate limits of 1 counts/ks and 0.068 counts/ks,respectively, at 3sigma confidence. assuming thermal emission similar to thatseen from j1819-1458 (a blackbody with radius of approximately 20 km), wederive effective temperature limits of 77 ev and 91 ev for the nominal valuesof the distances and column densities to both sources, although both of thosequantities are highly uncertain and correlated. if we instead fix thetemperature of the emission (a blackbody with kt=0.14 kev), we deriveunabsorbed luminosity limits in the 0.3-8 kev range of 1e32 erg/s and 3e32erg/s. these limits are considerably below the luminosity of j1819-1458 (4e33erg/s), suggesting that rrats j0847-4316 and j1846-0257 have cooled beyond thepoint of visibility (plausible given the differences in characteristic age).however, as we have not detected x-ray emission, it may also be that theemission from rrats j0847-4316 and j1846-0257 has a different character fromthat of j1819-1458. the two non-detections may prove a counterpoint toj1819-1458, but more detections are certainly needed before we can begin toderive general x-ray emission properties for the rrat populations.

0911.1659	xmm-newton and swift observations prove grb 090709a to be a distant,  standard, long grb	grb 090709a is a long gamma-ray burst (grb) discovered by swift, featuring abright x-ray afterglow as well as a faint infrared transient with very red andpeculiar colors. the burst attracted a large interest because of a possiblequasi-periodicity at p=8.1 s in the prompt emission, suggesting that it couldhave a different origin with respect to standard, long grbs. in order tounderstand the nature of this burst, we obtained a target of opportunityobservation with xmm-newton. x-ray spectroscopy, based on xmm-newton and swiftdata, allowed us to model the significant excess in photoelectric absorptionwith respect to the galactic value as due to a large column density (about6.5e+22 cm^-2) in the grb host, located at z=4.2. such a picture is alsoconsistent with the infrared transient's properties. re-analysis of the promptemission, based on integral and on swift data, excludes any significantmodulation at p=8.1 s. thus, we conclude that grb 090709a is a distant,standard, long grb.

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

1006.2950	the 2008 october swift detection of x-ray bursts/outburst from the  transient sgr-like axp 1e 1547.0-5408	we report on the detailed study of the 2008 october outburst from theanomalous x-ray pulsar (axp) 1e 1547.0-5408 discovered through the swift/burstalert telescope (bat) detection of sgr-like short x-ray bursts on 2008 october3. the swift/x-ray telescope (xrt) started observing the source after less than100 s since the bat trigger, when the flux (about 6e-11 erg/cm^2/s in the 2-10kev range) was &gt;50 times higher than its quiescent level. swift monitored theoutbursting activity of 1e 1547.0-5408 on a daily basis for approximately threeweeks. this strategy allowed us to find a phase-coherent solution for thesource pulsations after the burst, which, besides period and period derivative,requires a positive period second derivative term (spin-down increase). thetime evolution of the pulse shape is complex and variable, with the pulsedfraction increasing from 20% to 50% within the swift observational window. thexrt spectra can be fitted well by means of a single component, either apower-law (pl) or a blackbody (bb). during the very initial phases of theoutburst the spectrum is hard, with a pl photon index about 2 (or kt about 1.4kev) which steepens to about 4 (or kt about 0.8 kev) within one day from thebat trigger, though the two components are likely present simultaneously duringthe first day spectra. an integral observation carried out five days after thetrigger provided an upper limit of about 2e-11 erg/cm^2/s to the emission of 1e1547.0-5408 in the 18-60 kev band.

1009.0021	agile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58	we present the results of new agile observations of psr b1509-58 performedover a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset ofthe present data. the modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 mev isat a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those foundearlier by comptel up to 30 mev: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching itsmaximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94+/- 0.03. the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed fluxdetected by comptel and agile is well described by a power-law (photon indexalpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at e_c=81 +/- 20 mev, representingthe softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. the pulsarluminosity at e &gt; 1 mev is $l_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiencyto gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. the unusual soft break in the spectrum of psrb1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as asignature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic fieldof this pulsar. in this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magneticaltitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggestedbecause pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of themagnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photonsplitting. in the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from theradio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the modelsto reproduce agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

1102.4754	detection of continuum radio emission associated with geminga	a deep very large array observation of the geminga pulsar field led to thediscovery, at a higher than 10 sigma significance level, of radio emissiontrailing the neutron star proper motion. this 10-arcsec-long radio feature,detected with a flux of 0.4 mjy at 4.8 ghz, is marginally displaced (2.7\pm1.8arcsec) from the pulsar (which, at any rate, is unlikely to contribute withmagnetospheric pulsed emission more than 15% to the total observed radioluminosity, about 1e26 erg/s) and positionally coincident with the x-ray axialtail recently discovered by chandra and ascribed to the pulsar wind nebula(pwn). overall, the geminga radio tail is compatible with the scenario of asynchrotron-emitting pwn, but the present data do not allow us to discriminatebetween different (and not always necessarily mutually exclusive) possibleprocesses for producing that. if this radio feature does not result fromintrinsic peculiarities of geminga, but its proximity and radio-quiet nature(both helping in not hindering the faint diffuse radio emission), otherrelatively near and energetic radio-quiet pulsars could show similar structuresin dedicated interferometric observations.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1107.5488	is sgr 0418+5729 indeed a waning magnetar ?	sgr 0418+5729 is a transient soft gamma-ray repeater which underwent a majoroutburst in june 2009, during which the emission of short bursts was observed.its properties appeared quite typical of other sources of the same class untillong-term x-ray monitoring failed to detect any period derivative. the presentupper limit on $\dot p$ implies that the surface dipole field is $b_p\lesssim7.5\times 10^{12}\ {\rm g}$ (rea et al 2010), well below those measured inother soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) and in the anomalous x-ray pulsars(axps), a group of similar sources. both sgrs and axps are currently believedto be powered by ultra-magnetized neutron stars (magnetars, $b_p\approx10^{14}$--$10^{15}\ {\rm g}$). sgr 0418+5729 hardly seems to fit in such apicture. we show that the magneto-rotational properties of sgr 0418+5729 can bereproduced if this is an aged magnetar, $\approx 1\ {\rm myr}$ old, whichexperienced substantial field decay. the large initial toroidal component ofthe internal field required to match the observed properties of sgr 0418+5729ensures that crustal fractures, and hence bursting activity, can still occur atpresent time. the thermal spectrum observed during the outburst decay iscompatible with the predictions of a resonant compton scattering model (as inother sgrs/axps) if the field is low and the magnetospheric twist moderate.

1112.5341	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j0440.9+4431	many x-ray accreting pulsars have a soft excess below 10 kev. this featurehas been detected also in faint sources and at low luminosity levels,suggesting that it is an ubiquitous phenomenon. in the case of the highluminosity pulsars (lx &gt; 10^36 erg/s), the fit of this component with thermalemission models usually provides low temperatures (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and largeemission regions (r &gt; a few hundred km); for this reason, it is referred to asa `soft' excess. on the other hand, we recently found that in persistent,low-luminosity (lx ~ 10^34 erg/s) and long-period (p &gt; 100 s) be accretingpulsars the observed excess can be modeled with a rather hot (kt &gt; 1 kev)blackbody component of small area (r &lt; 0.5 km), which can be interpreted asemission from the ns polar caps. in this paper we present the results of arecent xmm-newton observation of the galactic be pulsar rx j0440.9+4431, whichis a poorly studied member of this class of sources. we have found a best-fitperiod p = 204.96(+/-0.02) s, which implies an average pulsar spin-down duringthe last 13 years, with dp/dt ~ 6x10^(-9) s/s. the estimated source luminosityis lx ~ 8x10^(34) erg/s: this value is higher by a factor &lt; 10 compared tothose obtained in the first source observations, but almost two orders ofmagnitude lower than those measured during a few outbursts detected in thelatest years. the source spectrum can be described with a power law plusblackbody model, with ktbb = 1.34(+/-0.04) kev and rbb = 273(+/-16) m,suggesting a polar-cap origin of this component. our results support theclassification of rx j0440.9+4431 as a persistent be/ns pulsar, and confirmthat the hot blackbody spectral component is a common property of this class ofsources.

1306.1106	cxou j005047.9-731817: a 292-s x-ray binary pulsar in the small  magellanic cloud	we report on the discovery of a transient x-ray pulsars, located in the smallmagellanic cloud, with a pulse period of 292 s. a series of chandra pointingsfortuitously recorded in 2010 april-may the occurrence of a two-weeks-longoutburst, during which the source luminosity increased by a factor of about100, reaching a peak of ~1e36 erg/s (for a distance of 61 kpc). complex-shapeand energy-dependent pulsations were detected close to the outburst peak andduring the very first part of its decay phase. during the outburst, thephase-averaged spectrum of the pulsar was well described by an absorbed powerlaw with photon index ~0.6, but large variations as a function of phase werepresent. the source was also detected by chandra several times (during 2002,2003, 2006, and 2010) at a quiescent level of ~1e34 erg/s. in 2012 we performedan infrared photometric follow-up of the r ~ 15 mag optical counterpart withthe eso/vlt and a spectroscopic observation by means of the ctio telescope. theoptical spectra suggest a late-oe or early-be v-iii luminosity-class star,though a more evolved companion cannot be ruled out by our data (we can excludea luminosity class i and a spectral type later than b2). finally, we show thatthe outburst main parameters (duration and peak luminosity) can be accountedfor by interpreting the source transient activity as a type i outburst in a bex-ray binary.

1311.6973	swift x-ray and ultraviolet observations of the shortest orbital period  double-degenerate system rx j0806.3+1527 (hm cnc)	the system rx j0806.3+1527 (hm cnc) is a pulsating x-ray source with 100 percent modulation on a period of 321.5 s (5.4 min). this period reflects theorbital motion of a close binary consisting of two interacting white dwarfs.here we present a series of simultaneous x-ray (0.2-10 kev) andnear-ultraviolet (2600 angstrom and 1928 angstrom) observations that werecarried out with the swift satellite. in the near-ultraviolet, the counterpartof rx j0806.3+1527 was detected at flux densities consistent with a blackbodywith temperature 27e+3 k. we found that the emission at 2600 angstrom ismodulated at the 321.5-s period with the peak ahead of the x-ray one by 0.28cycles and is coincident within 0.05 cycles with the optical. this phase-shiftmeasurement confirms that the x-ray hot spot (located on the primary whitedwarf) is at about 80-100 degrees from the direction that connects the twowhite dwarfs. albeit at lower significance, the 321.5-s signature is presentalso in the 1928-angstrom data; at this wavelength, however, the pulse peak isbetter aligned with that observed at x-rays. we use the constraints on thesource luminosity and the geometry of the emitting regions to discuss themerits and limits of the main models for rx j0806.3+1527.

1404.4446	constraints on the winds of hot subdwarf stars from x-ray observations  of two sdb binaries with compact companions: cd -30 11223 and pg 1232-136	little observational data are available on the weak stellar winds of hotsubdwarf stars of b spectral type (sdb). close binary systems composed of ansdb star and a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) couldbe detected as accretion-powered x-ray sources. the study of their x-rayemission can probe the properties of line-driven winds of sdb stars that cannot be derived directly from spectroscopy because of the low luminosity ofthese stars. here we report on the first sensitive x-ray observations of twosdb binaries with compact companions. cd -30 11223 is the sdb binary with theshortest known orbital period (1.2 h) and its companion is certainly a whitedwarf. pg 1232-136 is an sdb binary considered the best candidate to host ablack hole companion. we observed these stars with xmm-newton in august 2013for 50 ks and in july 2009 for 36 ks, respectively. none of them was detectedand we derived luminosity upper limits of about 1.5x10^29 erg/s for cd -3011223 5x10^29 erg/s for pg 1232-136. the corresponding mass loss rate for pg1232-136 is poorly constrained, owing to the unknown efficiency for black holeaccretion. on the other hand, in the case of cd -30 11223 we could derive,under reasonable assumptions, an upper limit of about 3x10^-13 solar masses/yron the wind mass loss rate from the sdb star. this is one of the fewobservational constraints on the weak winds expected in this class of low masshot stars. we also report the results on the x-ray emission from a cluster ofgalaxies serendipitously discovered in the field of cd -30 11223.

1505.00836	simultaneous multi-band radio &amp; x-ray observations of the galactic  center magnetar sgr 1745$-$2900	we report on multi-frequency, wideband radio observations of the galacticcenter magnetar (sgr 1745$-$2900) with the green bank telescope for $\sim$100days immediately following its initial x-ray outburst in april 2013. we mademultiple simultaneous observations at 1.5, 2.0, and 8.9 ghz, allowing us toexamine the magnetar's flux evolution, radio spectrum, and interstellar mediumparameters (such as the dispersion measure (dm), the scattering timescale andits index). during two epochs, we have simultaneous observations from thechandra x-ray observatory, which permitted the absolute alignment of the radioand x-ray profiles. as with the two other radio magnetars with publishedalignments, the radio profile lies within the broad peak of the x-ray profile,preceding the x-ray profile maximum by $\sim$0.2 rotations. we also find thatthe radio spectral index $\gamma$ is significantly negative between $\sim$2 and9 ghz; during the final $\sim$30 days of our observations $\gamma \sim -1.4$,which is typical of canonical pulsars. the radio flux has not decreased duringthis outburst, whereas the long-term trends in the other radio magnetars showconcomitant fading of the radio and x-ray fluxes. finally, our widebandmeasurements of the dms taken in adjacent frequency bands in tandem arestochastically inconsistent with one another. based on recent theoreticalpredictions, we consider the possibility that the dispersion measure isfrequency-dependent. despite having several properties in common with the otherradio magnetars, such as $l_{\textrm{x,qui}}/l_{\textrm{rot}} \lesssim 1$, anincrease in the radio flux during the x-ray flux decay has not been observedthus far in other systems.

1506.05808	periodic signals from the circinus region: two new cataclysmic variables  and the ultraluminous x-ray source candidate gc x-1	the examination of two 2010 chandra acis exposures of the circinus galaxyresulted in the discovery of two pulsators: cxo j141430.1-651621 and cxouj141332.9-651756. we also detected 26-ks pulsations in cg x-1, consistentlywith previous measures. for ~40 other sources, we obtained limits on periodicmodulations. in cxo j141430.1-651621, which is ~2 arcmin outside the circinusgalaxy, we detected signals at 6120(1) s and 64.2(5) ks. in the longestobservation, the source showed a flux of ~1.1e-13 erg/cm^2/s (absorbed, 0.5-10kev) and the spectrum could be described by a power-law with photon index ~1.4.from archival observations, we found that the luminosity is variable by ~50 percent on time-scales of weeks-years. the two periodicities pin down cxoj141430.1-651621 as a cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar subtype.the period of cxou j141332.9-651756 is 6378(3) s. it is located inside thecircinus galaxy, but the low absorption indicates a galactic foreground object.the flux was ~5e-14 erg/cm^2/s in the chandra observations and showed ~50 percent variations on weekly/yearly scales; the spectrum is well fit by a powerlaw ~0.9. these characteristics and the large modulation suggest that cxouj141332.9-651756 is a magnetic cataclysmic variable, probably a polar. for cgx-1, we show that if the source is in the circinus galaxy, its properties areconsistent with a wolf-rayet plus black hole binary. we consider theimplications of this for ultraluminous x-ray sources and the prospects ofadvanced ligo and virgo. in particular, from the current sample of wr-bhsystems we estimate an upper limit to the detection rate of stellar bh-bhmergers of ~16 events per yr.

1512.00467	extras discovery of an 1.2-s x-ray pulsar in m 31	during a search for coherent signals in the x-ray archival data ofxmm-newton, we discovered a modulation at 1.2 s in 3xmm j004301.4+413017 (3xj0043), a source lying in the direction of an external arm of m 31. this shortperiod indicates a neutron star (ns). between 2000 and 2013, the position of 3xj0043 was imaged by public xmm-newton observations 35 times. the analysis ofthese data allowed us to detect an orbital modulation at 1.27 d and study thelong-term properties of the source. the emission of the pulsar was rather hard(most spectra are described by a power law with $\gamma &lt; 1$) and, assuming thedistance to m 31, the 0.3-10 kev luminosity was variable, from$\sim$$3\times10^{37}$ to $2\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the analysis ofoptical data shows that, while 3x j0043 is likely associated to a globularcluster in m 31, a counterpart with $v\gtrsim22$ outside the cluster cannot beexcluded. considering our findings, there are two main viable scenarios for 3xj0043: a peculiar low-mass x-ray binary, similar to 4u 1822-37 or 4u 1626-67,or an intermediate-mass x-ray binary resembling her x-1. regardless of theexact nature of the system, 3x j0043 is the first accreting ns in m 31 in whichthe spin period has been detected.

astro-ph;0502417	a xmm-newton view of the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1806--20: long term  variability in the pre-super giant flare epoch	the low energy (&lt;10 kev) x-ray emission of the soft gamma-ray repeatersgr1806-20 has been studied by means of four xmm-newton observations carriedout in the last two years, the latter performed in response to a strongsequence of hard x-ray bursts observed on 2004 october 5. the source was caughtin different states of activity: over the 2003-2004 period the 2-10 kev fluxdoubled with respect to the historical level observed previously. the long termraise in luminosity was accompanied by a gradual hardening of the spectrum,with the power law photon index decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, and by a growth ofthe bursting activity. the pulse period measurements obtained in the fourobservations are consistent with an average spin-down rate of 5.5x10e-10 s/s,higher than the values observed in the previous years. the long-term behaviorof sgr1806-20 exhibits the correlation between spectral hardness and spin-downrate previously found only by comparing the properties of different sources(both sgrs and anomalous x-ray pulsars). the best quality spectrum (obtained on6 september 2004) cannot be fitted by a single power law, but it requires anadditional blackbody component (kt=0.79 kev, r_bb = 1.9 (d/15 kpc)^2 km),similar to the spectra observed in other sgrs and in anomalous x-ray pulsars.no spectral lines were found in the persistent emission, with equivalent widthupper limits in the range 30-110 ev. marginal evidence for an absorptionfeature at 4.2 kev is present in the cumulative spectrum of 69 bursts detectedin september-october 2004.

astro-ph;0512059	xmm-newton observation of the soft gamma ray repeater sgr 1627-41 in a  low luminosity state	the sky region containing the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41 has beenobserved three times with xmm-newton in february and september 2004. sgr1627-41 has been detected with an absorbed flux of ~9x10^{-14} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1} (2-10 kev). for a distance of 11 kpc, this corresponds to a luminosityof ~3x10^{33} erg s^{-1}, the smallest ever observed for a soft gamma repeaterand possibly related to the long period of inactivity of this source. theobserved flux is smaller than that seen with chandra in 2001-2003, suggestingthat the source was still fading and had not yet reached a steady quiescentlevel. the spectrum is equally well fit by a steep power law (photon index\~3.2) or by a blackbody with temperature kt~0.8 kev. we also report on theintegral transient igr j16358-4726 that lies at ~10' from sgr 1627-41. it wasdetected only in september 2004 with a luminosity of ~4x10^{33} erg s^{-1} (ford=7 kpc), while in february 2004 it was at least a factor 10 fainter.

0809.1230	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from grb 080514b	grb 080514b is the first gamma ray burst (grb), since the time of egret, forwhich individual photons of energy above several tens of mev have been detectedwith a pair-conversion tracker telescope. this burst was discovered with theitalian agile gamma-ray satellite. the grb was localized with a cooperation byagile and the interplanetary network (ipn). the gamma-ray imager (grid)estimate of the position, obtained before the superagile-ipn localization, isfound to be consistent with the burst position. the hard x-ray emissionobserved by superagile lasted about 7 s, while there is evidence that theemission above 30 mev extends for a longer duration (at least ~13 s). similarbehavior was seen in the past from a few other grbs observed with egret.however, the latter measurements were affected, during the brightest phases, byinstrumental dead time effects, resulting in only lower limits to the burstintensity. thanks to the small dead time of the agile/grid we could assess thatin the case of grb 080514b the gamma-ray to x-ray flux ratio changessignificantly between the prompt and extended emission phase.

astro-ph;0608588	the first xmm-newton observations of the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr  1900+14	a ~50 ks xmm-newton observation of sgr 1900+14 has been carried out inseptember 2005, after almost three years during which no bursts were detectedfrom this soft gamma-ray repeater. the 0.8-10 kev spectrum was well fit by apower law plus blackbody model with photon index 1.9+/-0.1, temperaturekt=0.47+/-0.02 kev and n_h = (2.12+/-0.08)x10^22 cm^-2, similar to previousobservations of this source. the flux was ~5x10^{-12} erg/cm2/s, a factor 2dimmer than the typical value and the smallest ever seen from sgr 1900+14. thelong term fading of the persistent emission has been interrupted by the recentburst reactivation of the source. a target of opportunity xmm-newtonobservation performed in april 2006 showed a flux ~15% higher. this variationwas not accompanied by significant changes in the spectrum, pulsed fraction andlight curve profile. we searched for emission and absorption lines in thespectra of the two observations, with negative results and setting tight upperlimits of 50-200 ev (3 sigma), depending on the assumed line energy and width,on the equivalent width of lines in the 1-9 kev range.

astro-ph;0610158	a new symbiotic low mass x-ray binary system: 4u 1954+319	4u 1954+319 was discovered 25 years ago, but only recently has a clearpicture of its nature begun to emerge. we present for the first time abroad-band spectrum of the source and a detailed timing study using more thanone year of monitoring data. the timing and spectral analysis was done usingpublicly available swift, integral, bepposax, and rxte/asm data in the 0.7-150kev energy band. the source spectrum is described well by a highly absorbed(n_h~10^23 cm^-2) power law with a high-energy exponential cutoff around 15kev. an additional black body component is needed below 3 kev to account for asoft excess. the derived ~5 hr periodicity, with a spin-up timescale of ~25years, could be identified as the neutron star spin period. the spectral andtiming characteristics indicate that we are dealing both with the slowestestablished wind-accreting x-ray pulsar and with the second confirmed member ofthe emerging class dubbed "symbiotic low mass x-ray binaries" to host a neutronstar.

0810.1516	high-resolution timing observations of spin-powered pulsars with the  agile gamma-ray telescope	agile is a small gamma-ray astronomy satellite mission of the italian spaceagency dedicated to high-energy astrophysics launched in 2007 april. its 1microsecond absolute time tagging capability coupled with a good sensitivity inthe 30 mev-30 gev range, with simultaneous x-ray monitoring in the 18-60 kevband, makes it perfectly suited for the study of gamma-ray pulsars following upon the cgro/egret heritage. in this paper we present the first agile timingresults on the known gamma-ray pulsars vela, crab, geminga and b 1706-44. thedata were collected from 2007 july to 2008 april, exploiting the missionscience verification phase, the instrument timing calibration and the earlyobserving pointing program. thanks to its large field of view, agile collecteda large number of gamma-ray photons from these pulsars (about 10,000 pulsedcounts for vela) in only few months of observations. the coupling of agiletiming capabilities, simultaneous radio/x-ray monitoring and new tools aimed atprecise photon phasing, exploiting also timing noise correction, unveiled newinteresting features at sub-millisecond level in the pulsars' high-energylight-curves.

0810.3804	chandra astrometry sets a tight upper limit to the proper motion of sgr  1900+14	the soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) sgr 1900+14 lies a few arcminutes outsidethe edge of the shell supernova remnant (snr) g42.8+0.6. a physical associationbetween the two systems has been proposed - for this and other sgr-snr pairs -based on the expectation of high space velocities for sgrs in the framework ofthe magnetar model. the large angular separation between the sgr and the snrcenter, coupled with the young age of the system, suggest a test of theassociation with a proper motion measurement. we used a set of threechandra/acis observations of the field spanning 5 years to perform accuraterelative astrometry in order to measure the possible angular displacement ofthe sgr as a function of time. our investigation sets a 3-sigma upper limit of70 mas/yr to the overall proper motion of the sgr. such a value argues againstan association of sgr 1900+14 with g42.8+0.6 and adds further support to themounting evidence for an origin of the sgr within a nearby, compact cluster ofmassive stars.
