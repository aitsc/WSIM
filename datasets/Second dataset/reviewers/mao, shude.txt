0902.1175	the clustering of barred galaxies in the local universe	we study the clustering properties of barred galaxies using data from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we compute projected redshift-space two-pointcross-correlation functions w_p(r_p) for a sample of nearly 1000 galaxies forwhich we have performed detailed structural decompositions using the methodsdescribed in gadotti (2009). the sample includes 286 barred galaxies. theclustering of barred and unbarred galaxies of similar stellar mass isindistinguishable over all the scales probed (~20kpc - 30mpc). this result alsoholds even if the sample is restricted to bars with bluer g-i colours (andhence younger ages). our result also does not change if we split our sample ofbarred galaxies according to bar-to-total luminosity ratio, bar boxyness,effective surface brightness, length, or the shape of the surface densityprofile within the bar. there is a hint that red, elliptical bars are morestrongly clustered than red and less elliptical bars, on scales &gt;~ 1 mpc,although the statistical significance is not high. we conclude that there is nosignificant evidence that bars are a product of mergers or interactions. wetentatively interpret the stronger clustering of the more elliptical bars asevidence that they are located in older galaxies, which reside in more massivehaloes.

0904.2379	major dry-mergers in early-type brightest cluster galaxies	we search for ongoing major dry-mergers in a well selected sample of localbrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) from the c4 cluster catalogue. 18 out of 515early-type bcgs with redshift between 0.03 and 0.12 are found to be in majordry-mergers, which are selected as pairs (or triples) with $r$-band magnitudedifference $\dm&lt;1.5$ and projected separation $\rp&lt;30$ kpc, and showingsignatures of interaction in the form of significant asymmetry in residualimages. we find that the fraction of bcgs in major dry-mergers increases withthe richness of the clusters, consistent with the fact that richer clustersusually have more massive (or luminous) bcgs. we estimate that present-dayearly-type bcgs may have experienced on average $\sim 0.6(\tmerge/0.3\gyr)^{-1}$ major dry-mergers and through this process increasestheir luminosity (mass) by $15% (\tmerge/0.3\gyr)^{-1}  (\fmass/0.5)$ on average since $z=0.7$, where $\tmerge$ is the mergingtimescale and $\fmass$ is the mean mass fraction of companion galaxies added tothe central ones. we also find that major dry-mergers do not seem to elevateradio activities in bcgs. our study shows that major dry-mergers involving bcgsin clusters of galaxies are not rare in the local universe, and they are animportant channel for the formation and evolution of bcgs.

0707.0550	blending in gravitational microlensing experiments: source confusion and  related systematics	gravitational microlensing surveys target very dense stellar fields in thelocal group. as a consequence the microlensed source stars are often blendedwith nearby unresolved stars. the presence of `blending' is a cause of majoruncertainty when determining the lensing properties of events towards thegalactic centre. after demonstrating empirical cases of blending we utilizemonte carlo simulations to probe the effects of blending. we generateartificial microlensing events using an hst luminosity function convolved totypical ground-based seeing, adopting a range of values for the stellar densityand seeing. we find that a significant fraction of bright events are blended,contrary to the oft-quoted assumption that bright events should be free fromblending. we probe the effect that this erroneous assumption has on both theobserved event timescale distribution and the optical depth, using realisticdetection criteria relevent to the different surveys. importantly, under thisassumption the latter quantity appears to be reasonably unaffected across ouradopted values for seeing and density. the timescale distribution is howeverbiased towards smaller values, even for the least dense fields. the dominantsource of blending is from lensing of faint source stars, rather than lensingof bright source stars blended with nearby fainter stars. we also explore otherissues, such as the centroid motion of blended events and the phenomena of`negative' blending. furthermore, we breifly note that blending can affect thedetermination of the centre of the red clump giant region from an observedluminosity function. this has implications for a variety of studies, e.g.mapping extinction towards the bulge and attempts to constrain the parametersof the galactic bar through red clump giant number counts.

1010.5940	detectability of orbital motion in stellar binary and planetary  microlenses	a standard binary microlensing event lightcurve allows just two parameters ofthe lensing system to be measured: the mass ratio of the companion to its host,and the projected separation of the components in units of the einstein radius.however, other exotic effects can provide more information about the lensingsystem. orbital motion in the lens is one such effect, which if detected, canbe used to constrain the physical properties of the lens. to determine thefraction of binary lens lightcurves affected by orbital motion (the detectionefficiency) we simulate lightcurves of orbiting binary star and star-planet(planetary) lenses and simulate the continuous, high-cadence photometricmonitoring that will be conducted by the next generation of microlensingsurveys that are beginning to enter operation. the effect of orbital motion ismeasured by fitting simulated lightcurve data with standard static binarymicrolensing models; lightcurves that are poorly fit by these models areconsidered to be detections of orbital motion. we correct for systematic falsepositive detections by also fitting the lightcurves of static binary lenses.for a continuous monitoring survey without intensive follow-up of highmagnification events, we find the orbital motion detection efficiency forplanetary events with caustic crossings to be 0.061+-0.010, consistent withobservational results, and 0.0130+-0.0055 for events without caustic crossings(smooth events). similarly for stellar binaries, the orbital motion detectionefficiency is 0.098+-0.011 for events with caustic crossings and is0.048+-0.006 for smooth events. these result in combined (caustic crossing andsmooth) orbital motion detection efficiencies of 0.029+-0.005 for planetarylenses and 0.070+-0.006 for stellar binary lenses. we also investigate howvarious microlensing parameters affect the orbital motion detectability.[abridged]

1101.2291	a distortion of very--high--redshift galaxy number counts by  gravitational lensing	the observed number counts of high-redshift galaxy candidates have been usedto build up a statistical description of star-forming activity at redshift z &gt;~7, when galaxies reionized the universe. standard models predict that a highincidence of gravitational lensing will probably distort measurements of fluxand number of these earliest galaxies. the raw probability of this happeninghas been estimated to be ~ 0.5 percent, but can be larger owing toobservational biases. here we report that gravitational lensing is likely todominate the observed properties of galaxies with redshifts of z &gt;~ 12, whenthe instrumental limiting magnitude is expected to be brighter than thecharacteristic magnitude of the galaxy sample. the number counts could bemodified by an order of magnitude, with most galaxies being part of multiplyimaged systems, located less than 1 arcsec from brighter foreground galaxies atz ~ 2. this lens-induced association of high-redshift and foreground galaxieshas perhaps already been observed among a sample of galaxy candidatesidentified at z ~ 10.6. future surveys will need to be designed to account fora significant gravitational lensing bias in high-redshift galaxy samples.

1105.3539	charge exchange x-ray emission of m82: k{\alpha} triplets of o vii, ne  ix, and mg xi	starburst galaxies are primary feedback sources of mechanical energy andmetals, which are generally measured from associated x-ray emission linesassuming that they are from the thermal emission of the outflowing hot gas.such line emission, however, can also arise from the charge exchange x-rayemission (cxe) between highly ionized ions and neutral species. to understandthe feedback of energy and metals, it is crucial to determine the origin of thex-ray emission lines and to distinguish the contributions from the cxe and thethermal emission. the origin of the lines can be diagnosed by the k{\alpha}triplets of he-like ions, because the cxe favors the inter-combination andforbidden lines, while the thermal emission favors the resonance line. weanalyze the triplets of o vii, ne ix, and mg xi observed in the xmm- newtonreflection grating spectra of the starburst galaxy m82. the flux contributionof the cxe is 90%, 50%, and 30% to the o vii, ne ix, and mg xi triplet,respectively. averaged over all the three triplets, the contribution of the cxeis \sim 50% of the total observed triplet flux. to correctly understand the hotoutflow of starburst galaxies, it is necessary to include the cxe. based on themeasured cxe contributions to the o vii, ne ix, and mg xi triplets, we estimatethe relative abundances of o, ne, and mg of the outflow and find they aresimilar to the solar ratios.

1107.1319	rapidly rotating lenses: repeating features in the lightcurves of short  period binary microlenses	microlensing is most sensitive to binary lenses with relatively large orbitalseparations, and as such, typical binary microlensing events show little or noorbital motion during the event. however, despite the strength of binarymicrolensing features falling off rapidly as the lens separation decreases, weshow that it is possible to detect repeating features in the lightcurve ofbinary microlenses that complete several orbits during the microlensing event.we investigate the lightcurve features of such rapidly rotating lens (rrl)events. we derive analytical limits on the range of parameters where theseeffects are detectable, and confirm these numerically. using a populationsynthesis galactic model we estimate the rrl event rate for a ground-based andspace-based microlensing survey to be 0.32fb and 7.8fb events per yearrespectively, assuming year-round monitoring and where fb is the binaryfraction. we detail how rrl event parameters can be quickly estimated fromtheir lightcurves, and suggest a method to model rrl events using timingmeasurements of lightcurve features. modelling rrl lightcurves will yield thelens orbital period and possibly measurements of all orbital elements includingthe inclination and eccentricity. measurement of the period from the lightcurveallows a mass-distance relation to be defined, which when combined with ameasurement of microlens parallax or finite source effects, can yield a massmeasurement to a two-fold degeneracy. with sub-percent accuracy photometry itis possible to detect planetary companions, but the likelihood of this is verysmall.

1110.0887	effects of supermassive binary black holes on gravitational lenses	recent observations indicate that many if not all galaxies host massivecentral black holes (bhs). in this paper we explore the influence ofsupermassive binary black holes (smbbhs) on their actions as gravitationallenses. when lenses are modelled as singular isothermal ellipsoids, binaryblack holes change the critical curves and caustics differently as a functionof distance. each black hole can in principle create at least one additionalimage, which, if observed, provides evidence of black holes. by studying howsmbbhs affect the cumulative distribution of magnification for images createdby black holes, we find that the cross section for at least one such additionalimage to have a magnification larger than $10^{-5}$ is comparable to the crosssection for producing multiple-images in singular isothermal lenses. suchadditional images may be detectable with high-resolution and large dynamicrange maps of multiply-imaged systems from future facilities, such as the ska.the probability of detecting at least one image (two images) with magnificationabove $10^{-3}$ is $\sim 0.2 \fbh$ ($\sim 0.05 \fbh$) in a multiply-imaged lenssystem, where $\fbh$ is the fraction of galaxies housing binary black holes. wealso study the effects of smbbhs on the core images when galaxies haveshallower central density profiles (modelled as non-singular isothermalellipsoids). we find that the cross section of the usually faint core images isfurther suppressed by smbbhs. thus their presence should also be taken intoaccount when one constrains the core radius from the lack of central images ingravitational lenses.

1110.1185	on the effects of line-of-sight structures on lensing flux-ratio  anomalies in a lcdm universe	the flux-ratio anomalies observed in multiply-lensed quasar images are mostplausibly explained as the result of perturbing structures superposed on theunderlying smooth matter distribution of the primary lens. the cold dark mattercosmological model predicts that a large number of substructures should surviveinside larger halos but, surprisingly, this population alone has been shown tobe insufficient to explain the observed distribution of the flux ratios ofquasar's multiple images. other halos (and their own subhalos) projected alongthe line of sight to the primary lens have been considered as additional sourceof perturbation. in this work, we use ray tracing through the millennium iisimulation to investigate the importance of projection effects due to halos andsubhalos of mass m&gt;1e8 msun/h and extend our analysis to lower masses, m&gt;1e6msun/h, using monte-carlo halo distributions. we find that the magnitude of theviolation depends strongly on the density profile and concentration of theintervening halos, but clustering plays only a minor role. for a typicallensing geometry (lens at redshift 0.6 and source at redshift 2), backgroundhaloes (behind the main lens) are more likely to cause a violation thanforeground halos. we conclude that line-of-sight structures can be as importantas intrinsic substructures in causing flux-ratio anomalies. the combined effectof perturbing structures within the lens and along the line of sight in thelcdm universe results in a cusp-violation probability of 20-30%. thisalleviates the discrepancy between models and current data, but a largerobservational sample is required for a stronger test of the theory.

1111.2429	lensing by a singular isothermal sphere and a black hole	most galaxies host central supermassive black holes. as two galaxies merge,the black holes also merge. the final single black hole may suffer a kick dueto asymmetric gravitational radiation and may not be at the centre of thegalaxy; off-centre black holes may also be produced by other means such assustained acceleration due to asymmetric jet power. we model the main galaxy asa singular isothermal sphere and the black hole as an off-centre point lens,and study the critical curves and caustics using complex notation. we identifythe critical parameters that govern the transitions in the topology of criticalcurves, caustics and pseudo-caustics, and find the number of images can be two,three, four and five. we show examples of image configurations, including caseswhere three highly de-magnified images are found close to the centre. theperturbation on the image magnification due to the black hole scales linearlywith its mass in the off-centre case, and quadratically when the black hole isat the centre. such images are difficult to observe unless high-contrast andhigh-resolution imaging facilities (e.g., the square kilometer array in theradio) become available.

1111.5915	charge exchange x-ray emission of nearby star-forming galaxies	properties of hot gas outflows from galaxies are generally measured fromassociated x-ray line emission assuming that it represents atomic transitionsin thermally excited hot gas. x-ray line emission, however, can also arise fromthe charge exchange between highly ionised ions and neutral species. thek\alpha\ triplet of he-like ions can be used as a powerful diagnostic, becausethe charge exchange x-ray emission (cxe) favours the inter-combination andforbidden lines, while the thermal emission favours the resonance line. weanalyse the ovii triplet of a sample of nine nearby star-forming galaxiesobserved by the xmm-newton reflection grating spectrometers. for most galaxies,the forbidden lines are comparable to or stronger than the resonance lines,which is in contrast to the thermal prediction. for ngc 253, m51, m83, m61, ngc4631, and the antennae galaxy, the observed line ratios are consistent with theratio of the cxe; for m94 and ngc 2903, the observed ratios indicate multipleorigins; for m82, different regions show different line ratios, also indicatingmultiple origins. we discuss other possible mechanisms that can produce arelatively strong forbidden line, such as a collisionalnon-equilibrium-ionization recombining/ionizing plasma, which are not favoured.these results suggest that the cxe may be a common process and contribute asignificant fraction of the soft x-ray line emission for galaxies with massivestar formation.

1206.3566	internal kinematics of groups of galaxies in the sloan digital sky  survey data release 7	we present measurements of the velocity dispersion profile (vdp) for galaxygroups in the final data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). forgroups of given mass we estimate the redshift-space cross-correlation function(ccf) with respect to a reference galaxy sample, xi(r_p, pi), the projectedccf, w_p(r_p), and the real-space ccf, xi(r). the vdp is then extracted fromthe redshift distortion in xi(r_p, pi), by comparing xi(r_p, pi) with xi(r). wefind that the velocity dispersion (vd) within virial radius (r_200) shows aroughly flat profile, with a slight increase at radii below ~0.3 r_200 for highmass systems. the average vd within the virial radius, sigma_v, is a stronglyincreasing function of central galaxy mass. we apply the same methodology ton-body simulations with the concordance lambda cold dark matter cosmology butdifferent values of the density fluctuation parameter sigma_8, and we comparethe results to the sdss results. we show that the sigma_v-m_* relation from thedata provides stringent constraints on both sigma_8 and sigma_ms, thedispersion in log m_* of central galaxies at fixed halo mass. our best-fittingmodel suggests sigma_8 = 0.86 +/- 0.03 and sigma_ms = 0.16 +/- 0.03. theslightly higher value of sigma_8 compared to the wmap7 result might be due to asmaller matter density parameter assumed in our simulations. our vdmeasurements also provide a direct measure of the dark matter halo mass forcentral galaxies of different luminosities and masses, in good agreement withthe results obtained by mandelbaum et al. (2006) from stacking thegravitational lensing signals of the sdss galaxies.

(1) microlensing observations toward the magellanicclouds rule out the milky way halo being dominated by massive compact haloobjects (machos). this confirms most dark matter is non-baryonic, consistentwith other observations. (2) microlensing has discovered about 20 extrasolarplanets (16 published), including the first two jupiter-saturn like systems andthe only "cold neptunes" yet detected. they probe a different part of theparameter space and will likely provide the most stringent test of coreaccretion theory of planet formation. (3) microlensing provides a unique way tomeasure the mass of isolated stars, including brown dwarfs to normal stars.half a dozen or so stellar mass black hole candidates have also been proposed.(4) high-resolution, target-of-opportunity spectra of highly-magnified dwarfstars provide intriguing "age" determinations which may either hint at enhancedhelium enrichment or unusual bulge formation theories. (5) microlensing alsomeasured limb-darkening profiles for close to ten giant stars, which challengesstellar atmosphere models. (6) data from surveys also provide strongconstraints on the geometry and kinematics of the milky way bar (through propermotions); the latter indicates predictions from current models appear to be tooanisotropic compared with observations. the future of microlensing is brightgiven the new capabilities of current surveys and forthcoming new telescopenetworks from the ground and from space. some open issues in the field areidentified and briefly discussed.

1301.0360	gravitational lensing effects on sub-millimetre galaxy counts	we study the effects on the number counts of sub-millimetre galaxies due togravitational lensing. we explore the effects on the magnification crosssection due to halo density profiles, ellipticity and cosmological parameter(the power-spectrum normalisation $\sigma_8$). we show that the ellipticitydoes not strongly affect the magnification cross section in gravitationallensing while the halo radial profiles do. since the baryonic cooling effect isstronger in galaxies than clusters, galactic haloes are more concentrated. inlight of this, a new scenario of two halo population model is explored wheregalaxies are modeled as a singular isothermal sphere profile and clusters as anavarro, frenk and white (nfw) profile. we find the transition mass between thetwo has modest effects on the lensing probability. the cosmological parameter$\sigma_8$ alters the abundance of haloes and therefore affects our results.compared with other methods, our model is simpler and more realistic. theconclusions of previous works is confirm that gravitational lensing is anatural explanation for the number count excess at the bright end.

1303.6430	a new photometric model of the galactic bar using red clump giants	we present a study of the luminosity density distribution of the galactic barusing number counts of red clump giants (rcgs) from the ogle-iii survey. thedata were recently published by nataf et al. (2013) for 9019 fields towards thebulge and have $2.94\times 10^6$ rc stars over a viewing area of $90.25\,\textrm{deg}^2$. the data include the number counts, mean distance modulus($\mu$), dispersion in $\mu$ and full error matrix, from which we fit the datawith several tri-axial parametric models. we use the markov chain monte carlo(mcmc) method to explore the parameter space and find that the best-fit modelis the $e_3$ model, with the distance to the gc is 8.13 kpc, the ratio ofsemi-major and semi-minor bar axis scale lengths in the galactic plane$x_{0},y_{0}$, and vertical bar scale length $z_0$, is $x_0:y_0:z_0 \approx1.00:0.43:0.40$ (close to being prolate). the scale length of the stellardensity profile along the bar's major axis is $\sim$ 0.67 kpc and has an angleof $29.4^\circ$, slightly larger than the value obtained from a similar studybased on ogle-ii data. the number of estimated rc stars within the field ofview is $2.78 \times 10^6$, which is systematically lower than the observedvalue. we subtract the smooth parametric model from the observed counts andfind that the residuals are consistent with the presence of an x-shapedstructure in the galactic centre, the excess to the estimated mass content is$\sim 5.8%$. we estimate the total mass of the bar is $\sim 1.8 \times 10^{10}m_\odot$. our results can be used as a key ingredient to construct new densitymodels of the milky way and will have implications on the predictions of theoptical depth to gravitational microlensing and the patterns of hydrodynamicalgas flow in the milky way.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

1307.4220	how well can cold-dark-matter substructures account for the observed  lensing flux-ratio anomalies?	lensing flux-ratio anomalies are most likely caused by gravitational lensingby small-scale dark matter structures. these anomalies offer the prospect oftesting a fundamental prediction of the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologicalmodel: the existence of numerous substructures that are too small to hostvisible galaxies. in two previous studies we found that the number of subhalosin the six high-resolution simulations of cdm galactic halos of the aquariusproject is not sufficient to account for the observed frequency of flux ratioanomalies seen in selected quasars from the class survey. these studies werelimited by the small number of halos used, their narrow range of masses (1-2e12solar masses) and the small range of lens ellipticities considered. we addressthese shortcomings by investigating the lensing properties of a large sample ofhalos with a wide range of masses in two sets of high resolution simulations ofcosmological volumes and comparing them to a currently best available sample ofradio quasars. we find that, as expected, substructures do not change theflux-ratio probability distribution of image pairs and triples with largeseparations, but they have a significant effect on the distribution at smallseparations. for such systems, cdm substructures can account for a substantialfraction of the observed flux-ratio anomalies. for large close-pair separationsystems, the discrepancies existing between the observed flux ratios andpredictions from smooth halo models are attributed to simplifications inherentin these models which do not take account of fine details in the lens massdistributions.

1310.5825	effects of plasma on gravitational lensing	we study gravitational lensing when plasma surrounds the lens. an extradeflection angle is induced by the plasma in addition to the deflectiongenerated by gravity. an inhomogeneous plasma distribution generates a greatereffect than a homogeneous one, and may cause significant effects to be detectedin low frequency radio observations (a few hundred mhz). in particular, thelensed image positions will be different between optical and radioobservations. the change of position due to a plasma can reach a few tens ofmilli-arcsec, which is readily detectable. one can use the position differencein different frequencies to estimate the density of plasma in the lens. themagnification ratios between multiple images are mainly determined by otherproperties of the lens, and are only weakly affected by the plasma. moreimportantly, we find that the strong lensing time delay will be affected by theplasma. estimation of the hubble constant from the time delay in low radiofrequency observation may be slightly biased due to plasma in the lens.unfortunately, the ionosphere of the earth strongly affects low frequency radioobservations. thus our ability to detect the effect depends on how well we areable to calibrate out the ionosphere.

1401.2996	are high velocity peaks in the milky way bulge due to the bar?	recently the commissioning apogee observations of the galactic bulge reportedthat a significant fraction of stars ($\sim10%$) are in a cold ($\sigma_{\rm v}\approx 30$ km/s) high velocity peak (galactocentric radial velocity $\approx200$ km/s). these stars are speculated to reflect the stellar orbits in thegalactic bar. in this study, we use two $n$-body models of the milky way-likedisk galaxy with different bar strengths to critically examine thispossibility. the general trends of the galactocentric radial velocitydistribution in observations and simulations are similar, but neither ourmodels nor the brava data reveal a statistically significant cold high velocitypeak. a monte carlo test further suggests that it is possible for a spurioushigh velocity peak to appear if there are only a limited number of starsobserved. thus, the reported cold high velocity peak, even if it is real, isunlikely due to stars on the bar-supporting orbits. our models do predict anexcess of stars with high radial velocity, but not in a distinct peak. in thedistance--velocity diagram, the high velocity particles in different fieldsexist at a similar distance $\sim8.5 \pm 1$ kpc away from the sun. this resultmay be explained with geometric intersections between the line-of-sight and theparticle orbits; high velocity stars naturally exist approximately at thetangent point, without constituting a distinct peak. we further demonstratethat even without the presence of a bar structure, particle motions in anaxisymmetric disk can also exhibit an excess of high velocity stars.

1402.2504	microlensing of sub-parsec massive binary black holes in lensed qsos:  light curves and size-wavelength relation	sub-parsec binary massive black holes (bbhs) are long anticipated to exist inmany qsos but remain observationally elusive. in this paper, we propose a novelmethod to probe sub-parsec bbhs through microlensing of lensed qsos. if a qsohosts a sub-parsec bbh in its center, it is expected that the bbh is surroundedby a circum-binary disk, each component of the bbh is surrounded by a smallaccretion disk, and a gap is opened by the secondary component in between thecircum-binary disk and the two small disks. assuming such a bbh structure, wegenerate mock microlensing light curves for some qso systems that host bbhswith typical physical parameters. we show that microlensing light curves of abbh qso system at the infrared-optical-uv bands can be significantly differentfrom those of corresponding qso system with a single massive black hole (mbh),mainly because of the existence of the gap and the rotation of the bbh (and itsassociated small disks) around the center of mass. we estimate the half-lightradii of the emission region at different wavelengths from mock light curvesand find that the obtained half-light radius vs. wavelength relations of bbhqso systems can be much flatter than those of single mbh qso systems at awavelength range determined by the bbh parameters, such as the total mass, massratio, separation, accretion rates, etc. the difference is primarily due to theexistence of the gap. such unique features on the light curves and half-lightradius-wavelength relations of bbh qso systems can be used to select and probesub-parsec bbhs in a large number of lensed qsos to be discovered by currentand future surveys, including the panoramic survey telescope and rapid responsesystem (pan-starrs), the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) and euclid.

1403.4936	predictions for microlensing planetary events from core accretion theory	we conduct the first microlensing simulation in the context of planetformation model. the planet population is taken from the ida &amp; lin coreaccretion model for $0.3m_\odot$ stars. with $6690$ microlensing events, wefind for a simplified korea microlensing telescopes network (kmtnet) thefraction of planetary events is $2.9\%$ , out of which $5.5\%$ showmultiple-planet signatures. the number of super-earths, super-neptunes andsuper-jupiters detected are expected to be almost equal. our simulation showsthat high-magnification events and massive planets are favored by planetdetections, which is consistent with previous expectation. however, we noticethat extremely high-magnification events are less sensitive to planets, whichis possibly because the 10 min sampling of kmtnet is not intensive enough tocapture the subtle anomalies that occur near the peak. this suggests that whilekmtnet observations can be systematically analyzed without reference to anyfollow-up data, follow-up observations will be essential in extracting the fullscience potential of very high-magnification events. the uniformly high-cadenceobservations expected for kmtnet also result in $\sim 55\%$ of all detectedplanets being non-caustic-crossing, and more low-mass planets even down tomars-mass being detected via planetary caustics. we also find that thedistributions of orbital inclinations and planet mass ratios in multiple-planetevents agree with the intrinsic distributions.

1407.2263	the next generation virgo cluster survey. v. modelling the dynamics of  m87 with the made-to-measure method	we study the dynamics of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 from the central tothe outermost regions with the made-to-measure (m2m) method. we use a newcatalogue of 922 globular cluster line-of- sight velocities extending to aprojected radius of 180 kpc (equivalent to 25 m87 effective radii), and sauronintegral field unit data within the central 2.4 kpc. 263 globular clusters,mainly located beyond 40 kpc, are newly observed by the next generation virgosurvey (ngvs). for the m2m modelling, the gravitational potential is taken as acombination of a luminous matter potential with a constant stellarmass-to-light ratio and a dark matter potential modelled as a logarithmicpotential. our best dynamical model returns a stellar mass-to-light ratio inthe i band of m/li = 6.0(+ -0.3) m_sun/l_sun with a dark matter potential scalevelocity of 591(+ -50) km/s and scale radius of 42(+ -10) kpc. we determine thetotal mass of m87 within 180 kpc to be (1.5 + - 0.2) 10^13 m_sun. the masswithin 40 kpc is smaller than previous estimates determined using globularcluster kinematics that did not extend beyond 45 kpc. with our new globularcluster velocities at much larger radii, we see that globular clusters around40 kpc show an anomalously large velocity dispersion which affected previousresults. the mass we derived is in good agreement with that inferred from rosatx-ray observation out to 180 kpc. within 30 kpc our mass is also consistentwith that inferred from chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations, while within120 kpc it is about 20% smaller. the model velocity dispersion anisotropy betaparameter for the globular clusters in m87 is small, varying from -0.2 at thecentre to 0.2 at 40 kpc, and gradually decreasing to zero at 120 kpc.

1407.2943	empirical study of simulated two-planet microlensing event	we undertake the first study of two-planet microlensing models recovered fromsimulations of microlensing events generated by realistic multi-planet systemsin which 292 planetary events including 16 two-planet events were detected from6690 simulated light curves. we find that when two planets are recovered, theirparameters are usually close to those of the two planets in the system mostresponsible for the perturbations. however, in one of the 16 examples, theapparent mass of both detected planets was more than doubled by the unmodeledinfluence of a third, massive planet. this fraction is larger than, butstatistically consistent with, the roughly 1.5% rate of serious mass errors dueto unmodeled planetary companions for the 274 cases from the same simulation inwhich a single planet is recovered. we conjecture that an analogous effect dueto unmodeled stellar companions may occur more frequently. for seven out of 23cases in which two planets in the system would have been detected separately,only one planet was recovered because the perturbations due to the two planetshad similar forms. this is a small fraction (7/274) of all recoveredsingle-planet models, but almost a third of all events that might plausiblyhave led to two-planet models. still, in these cases, the recovered planettends to have parameters similar to one of the two real planets mostresponsible for the anomaly.

1510.06810	determining the local dark matter density with lamost data	measurement of the local dark matter density plays an important role in bothgalactic dynamics and dark matter direct detection experiments. however, theestimated values from previous works are far from agreeing with each other. inthis work, we provide a well-defined observed sample with 1427 g \&amp; k typemain-sequence stars from the lamost spectroscopic survey, taking into accountselection effects, volume completeness, and the stellar populations. we apply avertical jeans equation method containing a single exponential stellar disk, arazor thin gas disk, and a constant dark matter density distribution to thesample, and obtain a total surface mass density of $\rm {78.7 ^{+3.9}_{-4.7}\m_{\odot}\ pc^{-2}}$ up to 1 kpc and a local dark matter density of$0.0159^{+0.0047}_{-0.0057}\,\rm m_{\odot}\,\rm pc^{-3}$. we find that thesampling density (i.e. number of stars per unit volume) of the spectroscopicdata contributes to about two-thirds of the uncertainty in the estimatedvalues. we discuss the effect of the tilt term in the jeans equation and findit has little impact on our measurement. other issues, such as anon-equilibrium component due to perturbations and contamination by the thickdisk population, are also discussed.

astro-ph;0002451	tully-fisher relation and its implications for halo density profile and  self-interacting dark matter	we show that the tully-fisher relation observed for spiral galaxies can beexplained in the current scenario of galaxy formation without invoking subtleassumptions, provided that galactic-sized dark haloes have shallow, core-likecentral profiles, with a core radius proportional to halo circular velocity. insuch a system, both disk and halo contribute significantly to the maximumrotation of the disk, and the interaction between the disk and halo componentsacts to reduce the scatter in the tully-fisher relation. with model parameterschosen in plausible ranges, the model can well accommodate the zero-point,slope, scatter of the observed tully-fisher relation, as well as the largerange of disk sizes. the model predicts that lsb disks obey a tully-fisherrelation similar to that of normal disks, if disk mass-to-light ratio isproperly taken into account. the halo profile required by the tully-fisherrelation is as shallow as that required by the rotation curves of faint disks,but much shallower than that predicted by conventional cdm models. our resultscannot be explained by some of the recent proposals for resolving the conflictbetween conventional cdm models and the rotation-curve shapes of faintgalaxies. if dark matter self-interaction (either scattering or annihilation)is responsible for the shallow profile, the observed tully-fisher relationrequires the interaction cross section \sigma_x to satisfy&lt;\sigma_{x}|v|&gt;/m_{x}~10^{-16} cm^3/s/gev.

astro-ph;0102436	the host haloes of lyman break galaxies and sub-millimeter sources	we use the observed sizes and star formation rates of lyman-break galaxies(lbgs) to understand their properties expected in the hierarchical scenario ofgalaxy formation. the observed size distribution constrains the masses of thehost haloes of lbgs from below, while the observed star-formation distributionconstrains the masses from above. assuming a flat cdm model with a cosmologicalconstant ($\omega_\lambda=0.7$), we find that consistency with observationsrequires the circular velocities of lbg host haloes to be in the range100--$300 {\rm km s^{-1}}$. the predicted comoving correlation length of theseobjects is $\sim 3 h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$, and the predicted velocity dispersion oftheir stellar contents is typically $70 {\rm km s^{-1}}$. the same prescriptionapplied to larger haloes in the cdm cosmogony predicts the existence ofgalaxies with star formation rates $\sim 1000 {\rm m_\odot yr^{-1}}$ atredshift $z\sim 3$. we explore the possibility of identifying these galaxies tobe the bright sub-millimeter (sub-mm) sources detected by scuba. the modelpredicts that the host haloes of these sub-mm sources are massive. thesegalaxies are predicted to be strongly correlated, with a comoving correlationlength of $\sim 7 h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$. the descendants of the bright sub-mmsources should reside in clusters of galaxies at the present time, and it islikely that these objects are the progenitors of giant ellipticals. the modelpredicts the existence of a relatively bright and red population of galaxies at$z\sim 3$, which may be observed in the k-band.

astro-ph;0207131	constraining the galactic bar parameters with red clump giants	we show that the small intrinsic spread in luminosities of red clump giantscan be used to constrain the differences in the streaming motions of galaticbulge stars on the near side and those on the far side. we propose two methodsto select two samples with one preferentially on the near side and the other onthe far side. in the first method, we divide red clump giants into a brightsample and a faint one; stars in the bright sample will be on average more onthe near side and vice versa. the second method relies on the fact that lensedbulge stars lie preferentially on the far side due to the enhanced lensingprobability by the stars on the near side and in the disk. if the radialstreaming motion is ~50km/s, we find the difference in the average radialvelocity between the bright and faint samples can reach ~33km/s while thecorresponding difference is about ~10km/s between the lensed stars and allobserved stars. the difference in the average proper motion between the brightand faint samples is about ~1.6mas/yr if there is a tangential streaming motionof 100km/s; the corresponding shift between the lensed stars and all observedstars is ~1mas/yr. to observe the shifts in the radial velocity and propermotion, roughly one hundred microlensing events, and/or bright/faint red clumpgiants, need to be observed either spectroscopically or astrometrically. thespectroscopic observations can be performed efficiently using multi-objectspectrographs already available. the proper motion signature of microlensedobjects can be studied using ground-based telescopes and hst. theseobservations will provide strong constraints on the galactic bar parameters(abridged).

astro-ph;0301035	an analytic model for the galactic winds and mass outflows	galactic winds and mass outflows are observed both in nearby starburstgalaxies and in high-redshift star-forming galaxies. in this paper we develop asimple analytic model to understand the observed superwind phenomenon. ourmodel is built upon the model of mckee &amp; ostriker (1977) for the interstellarmedium. it allows one to predict how properties of a superwind, such as windvelocity and mass outflow rate, are related to properties of its star-forminghost galaxy, such as size, gas density and star formation rate. the modelpredicts a threshold of star formation rate density for the generation ofobservable galactic winds. galaxies with more concentrated star formationproduce superwinds with higher velocities. the predicted mass outflow rates arecomparable to (or slightly larger than) the corresponding star formation rates.we apply our model to both local starburst galaxies and high-redshift lymanbreak galaxies, and find its predictions to be in good agreement with currentobservations. our model is simple, and so can be easily incorporated intonumerical simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0311203	limits on the evolution of galaxies from the statistics of gravitational  lenses	we use gravitational lenses from the cosmic lens all-sky survey (class) toconstrain the evolution of galaxies since redshift $z \sim 1$ in the current$\lcdm$ cosmology. this constraint is unique as it is based on a mass-selectedlens sample of galaxies. our method of statistical analysis is the same as inchae (2003). we parametrise the early-type number density evolution in the formof $(1+z)^{\nu_n}$ and the velocity dispersion as $(1+z)^{\nu_v}$. we find that$\nu_n=-0.11^{+0.82}_{-0.89}$ ($1\sigma$) if we assume $\nu_v =0$, implyingthat the number density of early-type galaxies is within 50% to 164% of thepresent-day value at redshift $z=1$. allowing the velocity dispersion toevolve, we find that $\nu_v=-0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ ($1\sigma$), indicating thatthe velocity dispersion must be within 57% and 107% of the present-day value at$z=1$. these results are consistent with the early formation and passiveevolution of early-type galaxies. more stringent limits from lensing can beobtained from future large lens surveys and by using very high-redshift quasars($z \ga 5$) such as those found from the sloan digital sky survey.

astro-ph;0311459	galaxy formation in pre-processed dark halos	recent n-body simulations show that the formation of a present-day, galaxysized dark matter halo in the cdm cosmogony in general consists of an earlyfast collapse phase, during which the potential associated with a halo isestablished, followed by a slow accretion phase, during which mass is addedrather gently in the outer region. here we outline a scenario in which the fastcollapse phase is accompanied with rapid formation of cold clouds and withstarbursts that can eject a large amount of gas from the halo center.the lossof orbital energy of the cold clouds to the dark matter and the ejection of gasfrom halo center by starburst can significantly reduce the halo concentration.the outflow from the starburst can also heat the gas in the protogalaxy region.subsequent formation of galaxies in the slow accretion regime is therefore inhalos that have been pre-processed by these processes and may have propertiesdifferent from that given by n-body simulations.  this scenario can help to solve several outstanding problems in the standard  lambda cdm model of galaxy formation without compromising its success inallowing structure formation at high redshift. the predicted rotation curvesare quite flat,alleviating the discrepancy of the tully-fisher relationpredicted in the lambda cdm model with observations. the flattened galaxy halosallow accreted minihalos to survive in their central regions longer, which maybe helpful in producing the flux anomalies observed in some gravitationallensing systems. the preheating by the early starbursts effectively reduces theamount of gas that can be accreted into galaxy halos, which may explain why thebaryon fraction in a spiral galaxy is in general much lower than the universalbaryon fraction, f_b~0.16, in the standard lambda cdm model.

astro-ph;0406638	chandra x-ray analysis of galaxy cluster a168	we present chandra x-ray observations of galaxy cluster a168 (z=0.045). twox-ray peaks with a projected distance of 676 kpc are found to be located closeto two dominant galaxies, respectively. both peaks are significantly offsetfrom the peak of the number density distribution of galaxies. this suggeststhat a168 consists of two subclusters, a northern subcluster (a168n) and asouthern subcluster (a168s). further x-ray imaging analysis reveals that (1)the x-ray isophotes surrounding the two x-ray peaks are heavily distorted, (2)an elongated and ontinuous filament connects the two x-ray peaks. these suggestthat strong interactions have occurred between the two subclusters. spectralanalysis shows that a168 has a mean temperature of 2.53 +/- 0.09 kev and a meanmetallicity of 0.31 +/- 0.04 z_{solar}. the metallicity is roughly a constantacross the cluster but the temperature shows some systematic variations. mostx-ray, optical and radio properties of a168 are consistent with it being anoff-axis merger several gyrs after a core passage, although detailed numericalsimulations are required to see whether the observed properties, in particularthe significant offset between the optical and x-ray centers, can be reproducedin such a scenario.

astro-ph;0605405	constraints on the velocity profiles of galaxies from strong lensing  statistics and semi-analytical modelling of galaxy formation	semi-analytical models of galaxy formation can be used to predict theevolution of the number density of early-type galaxies as a function of thecircular velocity at the virial radius, v_{c,vir}. gravitational lensingprobability and separation distribution on the other hand are sensitive to thevelocity dispersion (or circular velocity) at about the effective radius. weadopt the singular isothermal ellipsoid (sie) lens model to estimate thevelocity dispersion at the effective radius. we use radio lenses from thecosmic lens all-sky survey and the pmn-nvss extragalactic lens survey to studyhow the velocity dispersions, \sigma_sie, are related to v_{c,vir}. when weinclude both the lensing probability and separation distribution as our lensingconstraints, we find \sigma_sie /(200\kms) =  [(1.17_{-0.26}^{+0.40}) v_{c,vir}/ (200\kms)]^{0.22^{+0.05}_{-0.04}} for200\kms \la \sigma_sie \la 260\kms; at \sigma_sie = 200\kms, the ratio \sqrt{2}\sigma_sie / v_{c,vir} is about 1.65^{+0.57}_{-0.37} (68% cl) but decreases to0.65_{-0.12}^{+0.15} (68% cl) for \sigma_sie = 260\kms. these results areconsistent with those of seljak (2002) obtained from galaxy-galaxy weak lensingfor galaxies of around l_*. however, our results clearly suggest that the ratiomust vary significantly as \sigma_sie is varied and are marginally discrepantwith the seljak results at \sigma_sie = 260\kms. the scaling \sigma_sie \proptov_{c,vir}^{0.22\pm 0.05} is broadly consistent with those from galaxyoccupation statistics studies and the most recent galaxy-galaxy weak lensingstudy.

astro-ph;0701130	the alignment between satellites and central galaxies: theory vs.  observations	recent studies have shown that the distribution of satellite galaxies ispreferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy. thestrength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours ofthe satellite and central galaxies, and only weakly on the mass of the halo inwhich the galaxies reside. in this paper we study whether these alignmentsignals, and their dependence on galaxy and halo properties, can be reproducedin a hierarchical structure formation model of a $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. to that extent we use a large $n$-body simulation which we populatewith galaxies following a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. we findthat if the orientation of the central galaxy is perfectly aligned with that ofits dark matter halo, then the predicted central-satellite alignment signal ismuch stronger than observed. if, however, the minor axis of a central galaxy isperfectly aligned with the angular momentum vector of its dark matter halo, wecan accurately reproduce the observed alignment strength as function of halomass and galaxy color. although this suggests that the orientation of centralgalaxies is governed by the angular momentum of their dark matter haloes, weemphasize that any other scenario in which the minor axes of central galaxy andhalo are misaligned by $\sim 40^{\circ}$ (on average) will match the dataequally well. finally, we show that dependence of the alignment strength on thecolor of the central galaxy is most likely an artefact due to interlopers inthe group catalogue. the dependence on the color of the satellite galaxies, onthe other hand, is real and owes to the fact that red satellites are associatedwith subhaloes that were more massive at their time of accretion.

astro-ph;9304016	on the bimodal distribution of gamma-ray bursts	kouveliotou et al. (1993) recently confirmed that gamma-ray bursts arebimodal in duration. in this paper we compute the statistical properties of theshort ($\le 2$~s) and long ($&gt;2$~s) bursts using a method of analysis thatmakes no assumption regarding the location of the bursts, whether in the galaxyor at a cosmological distance. we find the 64 ms channel on batse to be moresensitive to short bursts and the 1024 ms channel is more sensitive to longbursts. we show that all the currently available data are consistent with thesimple hypothesis that both short and long bursts have the same spatialdistribution and that within each population the sources are standard candles.the rate of short bursts is $\sim 0.4$ of the rate of long bursts. although thedurations of short and long gamma-ray bursts span several orders of magnitudeand the total energy of a typical short burst is smaller than that of a typicallong burst by a factor of $\sim 20$, surprisingly the peak luminosities of thetwo kinds of bursts are equal to within a factor of $\sim 2$.

astro-ph;9406030	evidence from gravitational lensing for a non-thermal pressure support  in the cluster of galaxies a2218	the central mass distribution of clusters of galaxies can be inferred fromgravitationally lensed arcs with known redshifts. for the abell cluster 2218,this method yields a core mass which is larger by a factor of $2.5 \pm 0.5$than the value deduced from x-ray observations, under the assumptions that thegas is supported by thermal pressure and that the cluster is spherical. we showthat a non-thermal pressure support is the most plausible explanation for thisdiscrepancy. such a pressure can be naturally provided by strong turbulence andequipartition magnetic fields ($\sim 50\mu$g) that are tangled on small spatialscales (&lt;10 kpc). the turbulent and magnetic pressures do not affect themeasured sunyaev-zel'dovich effect for this cluster. intracluster magneticfields with a comparable magnitude ($\sim 10^{1-2} \mu$g) have already beendetected by faraday rotation in other clusters. if generic, a small-scaleequipartition magnetic field should affect the structure of cooling flows andmust be included in x-ray determinations of cluster masses.

astro-ph;9512014	cosmological constant and statistical lensing of giant arcs	using a singular isothermal sphere model for the matter distribution offoreground clusters of galaxies, we study the statistics of giant arcs in flatcosmologies with and without a cosmological constant. we find that the relativenumber of arcs predicted within $z=1$ in a universe with $\omega_0=0.3$ and$\lambda_0 \equiv \lambda/(3h_0^2)=0.7$ is a factor of $\sim2$ larger than theone in the einstein-de sitter universe ($\omega_0=1, \lambda_0=0$). for aluminosity-dependent evolution model of the number density of backgroundgalaxies that accounts for the over-density of faint blue galaxies at$z_s\approx0.4$, the einstein- de sitter cosmological model predicts that about$5\%$ of clusters of galaxies with an x-ray luminosity $l_x &gt; 2 \times 10^{44}$erg s$^{-1}$ should have giant arcs with length-to-width ratio larger than 10.this is a factor of $\sim4$ lower than the observed fraction in thegravitational lensing survey of distant x-ray selected emss clusters ofgalaxies, indicating that the matter distribution of clusters of galaxiesdeviates significantly from simple isothermal spheres or/and the presence of asignificant cosmological constant. it is profitable to further study theconstraint on the cosmological constant from giant arcs using more realisticcluster models.

astro-ph;9605030	on the microlensing optical depth of the galactic bar	the microlensing probability (optical depth $\tau$) toward the galacticcenter carries information about the mass distribution of the galacticbulge/bar, so can be used to constrain the very uncertain shape parameters ofthe bar. we find $tau$ depends on the bar mass, radial profile, angle, axisscale lengths and boxyness by a few simple analytical formulae, which shows:(1) $\tau$ is proportional to the mass of the bar, $m$. (2) $\tau$ falls alongthe minor axis with a strong gradient. (3) an oblate bulge can have moreoptical depth than a triaxial bar if the bar angle $\alpha&gt;45$ degress. (4)$\tau$ is the largest if the angle $\alpha$ and the axis ratio $y_0/x_0$conspires so that $y_0/x_0=\tan \alpha$. (5) at a fixed field on the minor axisbut away from the center, boxy bars with a flat density profile tend to give alarger optical depth than ellipsoidal bars with a steep profile. (6) mainsequence sources should have a significantly lower (20-50\% lower) opticaldepth than red clump giants if main sequence stars are not observed as deep asthe bright clump giants.  an application to four cobe-constrained models (dwek et al. 1994) shows mostmodels produce optical depth $2\sigma$ lower than macho and ogle observedvalues even with both a massive bar $2.8\times 10^{10} m_\odot$ and a fulldisk. the high $\tau$ argues for a massive ($&gt; 2\times 10^{10}m_\odot$) boxybar with $y_0/x0\approx \tan\alpha$ and $\alpha&lt;20$ deg and with a flat radialprofile up to corotation.

astro-ph;9702021	probing the structure of lensing galaxies with quadruple lenses: the  effect of the ``external'' shear	we study a general elliptical potential of the form $\psi(x^2+y^2/q^2)~(0&lt;q\le 1)$ plus an additional shear (with an arbitrary direction) as modelsfor the observed quadruple lenses. it is shown that a minimum additional shearis needed even just to reproduce the observed positions alone. we also obtainthe dependence of the axial ratio, $q$, on the orientation of the major axis ofpotential. a general relation also exists between the shear, the position angleand axial ratio of the lensing galaxy. the relation shows a generic degeneracyin modelling quadruple lenses. in particular, it shows that only the ratio ofthe ellipticity, $\epsilon\equiv (1-q^2)/(1+q^2)$, to the magnitude of shear,$\gamma$ can be determined. all these results are valid regardless of theradial profile of the potential. our formalism applies when the galaxy positionis observed, which is the case for seven of the eight known quadruple lenses.application to these seven cases reveals two quadruple lenses class 1608+656and hst 12531-2914, requiring highly significant shear with magnitude $\approx0.2$. for hst 12531-2914, there must be a misalignment between the major axisof light and the major axis of potential (mass). we conclude that detailedmodelling of quadruple lenses can yield valuable quantitative information aboutthe shape of lensing galaxies and their dark matter halos.

astro-ph;9707093	the formation of galactic disks	we study the population of galactic disks expected in current hierarchicalclustering models for structure formation. a rotationally supported disk withexponential surface density profile is assumed to form with a mass and angularmomentum which are fixed fractions of those of its surrounding dark halo. weassume that haloes respond adiabatically to disk formation, and that onlystable disks can correspond to real systems. with these assumptions thepredicted population can match both present-day disks and the damped lymanalpha absorbers in qso spectra. good agreement is found provided: (i) themasses of disks are a few percent of those of their haloes; (ii) the specificangular momenta of disks are similar to those of their haloes; (iii)present-day disks were assembled recently (at z&lt;1). in particular, the observedscatter in the size-rotation velocity plane is reproduced, as is the slope andscatter of the tully-fisher relation. the zero-point of the tf relation ismatched for a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1 to 2 h in the i-band, consistentwith observational values derived from disk dynamics. high redshift disks arepredicted to be small and dense, and could plausibly merge together to form theobserved population of elliptical galaxies. in many (but not all) currentlypopular cosmogonies, disks with rotation velocities exceeding 200 km/s canaccount for a third or more of the observed damped lyman alpha systems atz=2.5. half of the lines-of-sight to such systems are predicted to intersectthe absorber at r&gt;3kpc/h and about 10% at r&gt;10kpc/h. the cross-section forabsorption is strongly weighted towards disks with large angular momentum andso large size for their mass. the galaxy population associated with dampedabsorbers should thus be biased towards low surface brightness systems.

astro-ph;9707187	evidence for substructure in lens galaxies?	we discuss whether one should expect that multiply imaged qsos can beunderstood with `simple' lens models which contain a handful of parameters.whereas for many lens systems such simple mass models yield a remarkably gooddescription of the observed properties, there are some systems which arenotoriously difficult to understand quantitatively. we argue that at least inone case (b 1422+231) these difficulties are not due to a `wrong'parametrization of the lens model, but that the discrepancy between observedand model-predicted flux ratios are due to substructure in the lens. similar tomicrolensing for optical fluxes, such substructure can distort also the radioflux ratios predicted by `simple' mass models, in particular for highlymagnified images, without appreciably changing image positions. substructurealso does not change the time delay significantly and therefore has littleeffect on the determination of the hubble constant using time delays. wequantify these statements with several simple scenarios for substructure, andpropose a strategy to model lens systems in which substructure is suspected.

astro-ph;9801238	an x-ray luminous, dwarf seyfert companion of mrk 273	we report the discovery of the brightest x-ray source hosted by a faint(m_b=-16) dwarf galaxy in the immediate vicinity of the ultraluminous irasmerging galaxy mrk 273. the dwarf galaxy, 1.3 arcmin away from mrk 273, is atthe tip of a faint northeast plume of mrk 273. its spectrum exhibits strong[oiii], halpha, [nii] emission lines, which establish the redshift of the dwarfgalaxy, $z=0.0376$, the same as that of mrk 273. the emission line ratios aretypical of seyfert galaxies. the x-ray emission is consistent with a point-likesource coincident with the center of the dwarf galaxy. the intrinsic x-rayluminosity, 6.3x10^{41} ergs, in the 0.1--2.4 kev energy range, is about seventimes larger than the b band luminosity. the x-ray spectrum of the source canbe fit with a power-law. all the evidence is consistent with the source being aseyfert galaxy. it is mysterious why out of $\sim 10$ faint objects in the samefield only one is detected by rosat and its ratio of soft x-ray to opticalluminosity is as high as those for bl lac objects and few active galacticnuclei (agns). if there is a population of such dwarf agns hidden as companionsof major merger galaxies (such as mrk 273), they may contribute to theluminosity function of agns and the cosmic x-ray background at the faint end.

astro-ph;9807077	observational constraints on disk galaxy formation	we use data from the literature to constrain theoretical models of galaxyformation. we show how to calculate the dimensionless spin parameter $\lambda$of the halos of disk galaxies and we compare the distribution of $\lambda$ withthat observed in cosmological $n$-body simulations. the agreement is excellent,which provides strong support for the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation.assuming only that the radial surface density distribution of disks isexponential, we estimate crudely the maximum-disk mass-to-light ratio in the$i$-band and obtain $&lt;m/l&gt; \la 3.56h$, for a hubble constant of $100h~\kms\mpc^{-1}$. we discuss this result and its limitations in relation to otherindependent determinations of $m/l$. we also define a dimensionless form of thetully-fisher relation, and use it to derive a value of the baryon fraction indisk galaxies. for galaxies with circular velocity $\vmax&gt;100\kms$, the medianvalue is $md = 0.086 (m/l/3.56h)$. assuming that the gas fraction in galactichalos is at most as large as that in clusters, we also conclude that $&lt;m/l&gt; \la2.48h^{-1/2}$.

astro-ph;9807341	the structure and clustering of lyman break galaxies	the number density and clustering properties of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs)are consistent with them being the central galaxies of the most massive darkhalos present at z~3. this conclusion holds in all currently popularhierarchical models for structure formation, and is almost independent of theglobal cosmological parameters. we examine whether the sizes, luminosities,kinematics and star-formation rates of lbgs are also consistent with thisidentification. simple formation models tuned to give good fits to low redshiftgalaxies can predict the distribution of these quantities in the lbgpopulation. the lbgs should be small (with typical half-light radii of 0.6-2kpc/h), should inhabit haloes of moderately high circular velocity (180-290km/s) but have low stellar velocity dispersions (70-120 km/s) and should havesubstantial star formation rates (15-100 msun/yr). the numbers here refer tothe predicted median values in the lbg sample of adelberger et al. (1998); thefirst assumes an omega=1 universe and the second a flat universe withomega=0.3. for either cosmology these predictions are consistent with thecurrent (rather limited) observational data. following the work of kennicutt(1998) we assume stars to form more rapidly in gas of higher surface density.this predicts that lbg samples should preferentially contain objects with lowangular momentum, and so small size, for their mass. in contrast, samples ofdamped lyman alpha systems (dlss), should be biased towards objects with largeangular momentum. bright lbgs and dlss may therefore form distinct populations,with very different sizes and star formation rates, lbgs being smaller and moremetal-rich than dlss of similar mass and redshift.

astro-ph;9808342	the nature of the host galaxies for gamma-ray bursts	it has been suggested recently that the rate of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) isproportional to the star formation rate in the universe. in this paper, westudy the nature of grb hosts expected in this scenario. we improve uponprevious studies by incorporating a luminosity function for the grbs, asrequired by observations. this model provides a good match to the observednumber counts of grbs as a function of peak-count rate. the model predicts thatthe host galaxies have their redshift distribution peaked around z~1, and about15 percent have z&gt;2.5. this high-redshift fraction have the same properties asthe star-forming galaxies recently discovered by the lyman-break technique. atz&lt;~1, many of the grbs may be hosted by faint blue galaxies. using aphotometric redshift sample of galaxies from the hubble deep field, we findthat the host galaxies have magnitudes in the range from 21.5 to 28 in thei-band, and about 90 percent of them have semi-major axis smaller than 1.3arcsec. assuming isotropic emission, the typical peak-luminosity and totalenergy of grbs are in an einstein-de sitter universe with h_0=100km/s/mpc. wealso discuss further observational tests of this scenario.

astro-ph;9811171	ultraluminous iras galaxy 10026+4347	we study optical and x-ray properties of the ultraluminous iras galaxy10026+4347. this galaxy is a narrow-line qso with very strong feii emission.three optical spectra were taken over two years. the full widths at halfmaximum (fwhms) of the emission lines are constant whereas the third spectrumseems to show a continuum change. intermediate-band photometry also shows asmall (0.1 mag) but significant decrease in flux. hst wfpc2 images suggest thatthis object is a post-merger galaxy. the source is x-ray luminous (l_x ~ 10^45erg/s) with a very soft x-ray spectrum (photon index ~ 3.2) the x-rayluminosity exhibits variabilities of a factor of ~8 over four years and afactor of two within two days. during these x-ray flux changes, the x-rayspectral shapes are consistent with no variation. all the optical and x-rayproperties resemble those of narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies, except that thefwhm of hbeta is about 2500 km/s, larger than that for most nls1s. we discussthe implications of our results on models of nls1s.

astro-ph;9906323	on the magnfication relations in quadruple lenses: a moment approach	we present a new method of studying quadruple lenses in elliptical power-lawpotentials parameterized by $\psi(x,y) \propto (x^2+y^2/q^2)^{\beta/2}/\beta (0\leq \beta &lt; 2)$. for this potential, the moments of the four image positionsweighted by signed magnifications (magnification times parity) have very simpleproperties. in particular, we find that the zeroth moment -- the sum of foursigned magnifications satisfies $\simeq 2/(2-\beta)$; the relation is exact for$\beta=0$ (point-lens) and $\beta=1$ (isothermal potential), independent of theaxial ratio. similar relations can be derived when a shear is present along themajor or minor axes. these relations, however, do not hold well for theclosely-related elliptical density distributions. for a singular isothermalelliptical density distribution without shear, the sum of signed magnificationsfor quadruple lenses is $\approx 2.8$, again nearly independent of theellipticity. for the same distribution with shear, the total signedmagnification is around 2-3 for most cases, but can be significantly differentfor some combinations of the axial ratio and shear where more than four imagescan appear.

0706.0262	spatial and kinematic alignments between central and satellite halos	based on a cosmological n-body simulation we analyze spatial and kinematicalignments of satellite halos within six times the virial radius of group sizehost halos (rvir). we measure three different types of spatial alignment: haloalignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (gcs) andthe distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation ofa satellite and the direction towards its gcs, and direct alignment between theorientation of the gcs and that of its satellites. in analogy we use thedirections of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment:the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connectingline between satellite and gcs, the halo velocity alignment between theorientation of the gcs and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignmentbetween the satellites orientations and their velocities. we find thatsatellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the gcs within atleast 6 rvir (the range probed here). furthermore, satellites preferentiallypoint towards the gcs. the most pronounced signal is detected on small scalesbut a detectable signal extends out to 6 rvir. the direct alignment signal isweaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances &lt; 2 rvir. allvelocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. our results suggestthat the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure whichextends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. in contrast, the maincontribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of thesatellite orientations in the group tidal field. the projected data reveal goodagreement with recent results derived from large galaxy surveys.

0811.1995	alignment between galaxies and large-scale structure	based on the sloan digital sky survey dr6 (sdss) and millennium simulation(ms) we investigate the alignment between galaxies and large-scale structure.for this purpose we develop two new statistical tools, namely the alignmentcorrelation function and the cos(2theta)-statistic. the former is atwo-dimensional extension of the traditional two-point correlation function andthe latter is related to the ellipticity correlation function used for cosmicshear measurements. both are based on the cross correlation between a sample ofgalaxies with orientations and a reference sample which represents thelarge-scale structure. applied to the sdss galaxy catalog the alignmentcorrelation function reveals an overabundance of reference galaxies along themajor axes of red, luminous (l &gt; l*) galaxies out to projected separations of60 mpc/h. no alignment signal is detected for blue galaxies. thecos(2\theta)-statistic yields very similar results. starting from a mssemi-analytic galaxy catalog we assign an orientation to each red, luminous andcentral galaxy, based on the central region of the host halo. alternatively, weuse the orientation of the host halo itself. we find a mean projectedmisalignment between a halo and its central region of ~25 deg. agreement withthe sdss results is good if the central orientations are used. using the haloorientations overestimates the observed alignment by more than a factor of 2.the large volume of the ms allows to generate two-dimensional maps of thealignment correlation function which show the reference galaxy distribution tobe flattened parallel to the orientations of red luminous galaxies with axisratios of ~0.5 and ~0.75 for halo and central orientations,respectively. theseratios are almost independent of scale out to 60 mpc/h.
