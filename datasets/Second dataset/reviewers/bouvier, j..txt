0905.0914	surface magnetic fields on two accreting t tauri stars: cv cha and cr  cha	we have produced brightness and magnetic field maps of the surfaces of cv chaand cr cha: two actively accreting g and k-type t tauri stars in the chamaeleoni star-forming cloud with ages of 3-5 myr. our magnetic field maps showevidence for strong, complex multi-polar fields similar to those obtained foryoung rapidly rotating main sequence stars. brightness maps indicate thepresence of dark polar caps and low latitude spots -- these brightness maps arevery similar to those obtained for other pre-main sequence and rapidly rotatingmain sequence stars.  only two other classical t tauri stars have been studied using similartechniques so far: v2129 oph and bp tau. cv cha and cr cha show magnetic fieldpatterns that are significantly more complex than those recovered for bp tau, afully convective t tauri star.  we discuss possible reasons for this difference and suggest that thecomplexity of the stellar magnetic field is related to the convection zone;with more complex fields being found in t tauri stars with radiative cores(v2129 oph, cv cha and cr cha). however, it is clearly necessary to conductmagnetic field studies of t tauri star systems, exploring a wide range ofstellar parameters in order to establish how they affect magnetic fieldgeneration, and thus how these magnetic fields are likely to affect theevolution of t tauri star systems as they approach the main sequence.

0907.1157	a spectroscopic survey of the youngest field stars in the solar  neighbourhood. i. the optically bright sample	we present the first results of a ground-based programme conducted on 1-4mclass telescopes. our sample consists of 1097 active and presumably youngstars, all of them being optical counterparts of rass x-ray sources in thenorthern hemisphere. we concentrate on the 704 optically brightest(v_ticho&lt;=9.5 mag) candidates. we acquired high-res spectroscopy in thehalpha/li spectral regions for 426 of such stars without relevant literaturedata. we describe the sample and the observations and we start to discuss itsphysical properties. we used a cross-correlation technique and other tools toderive accurate radial/rotational velocities and to perform a spectralclassification for both single and sb2 stars. the spectral subtractiontechnique was used to derive chromospheric activity levels and li abundances.we estimated the fraction of young single stars and multiple systems in stellarsoft x-ray surveys and the contamination by more evolved systems, like rscvn's. we classified stars on the basis of li abundance and give a glimpse oftheir sky distribution. the sample appears to be a mixture of youngpleiades-/hyades- like stars plus an older li-poor population (~1-2 gyr). 7stars with li abundance compatible with the age of ic 2602 (~30 myr) or youngerwere detected as well, although 2 appear to be li-rich giants. the discovery ofa large number of li-rich giants is another outcome of this survey. thecontamination of soft x-ray surveys by old systems in which the activity levelis enhanced by tidal synchronisation is not negligible, especially for k-typestars. 5 stars with li content close to the primordial abundance are probablyassociated with known moving groups in the solar neighbourhood. some of themare ptts candidates according to their positions in the hr diagram.

0909.5035	evidence for early disk-locking among low-mass members of the orion  nebula cluster	we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for 91 pms stars in oncwith masses in the range 0.10-0.25msun carried out with the multi-fiberspectrograph flames@eso. our aim is to better understand the disk-lockingscenario in very low-mass stars. we have derived radial velocities, vsini, andfull width at 10% of the halpha emission peak. using published measurements ofinfrared excess as disk tracer, and equivalent width of the nir caii linelambda8542, mid-ir difference [3.6]-[8.0]micron derived by spitzer data, and10% halpha width as diagnostic of the level of accretion, we have looked forany correlation between vsini divided by the radius and presence of disk andaccretion. four low-mass stars are sb2 systems. the distribution of rotationperiods derived from our vsini measurements is unimodal with a peak of fewdays. our &lt;sini&gt; is lower than the one expected for a random distribution. wefind no evidence for a population of fast rotators close to the break-upvelocity. a clear correlation between vsini/r and delta(ic-k) has been found.while for stars with no circumstellar disk a spread in the rotation rates isseen, stars with a circumstellar disk show an abrupt drop in their rotationrates by a factor of ~5. on the other hand, only a partial correlation betweenvsini and accretion is observed when other indicators are used. the x-raycoronal activity level shows no dependence on vsini/r suggesting that all starsare in a saturated regime limit. the critical velocity is probably below ourvsini detection limit of 9 km/s. the onc low-mass stars in our sample atpresent seem to be not locked, but the clear correlation we find betweenrotation and ir color excess suggests that they were locked once. in addition,the percentage of accretors seems to scale inversely to the stellar mass.

0911.1080	complex magnetic topology and strong differential rotation on the  low-mass t tauri star v2247 oph	from observations collected with the espadons spectropolarimeter at thecanada-france-hawaii telescope, we report the detection of zeeman signatures onthe low-mass classical ttauri star (ctts) v2247oph. profile distortions andcircular polarisation signatures detected in photospheric lines can beinterpreted as caused by cool spots and magnetic regions at the surface of thestar. the large-scale field is of moderate strength and highly complex;moreover, both the spot distribution and the magnetic field show significantvariability on a timescale of only one week, as a likely result of strongdifferential rotation. both properties make v2247oph very different from the(more massive) prototypical ctts bptau; we speculate that this differencereflects the lower mass of v2247oph.  during our observations, v2247oph was in a low-accretion state, with emissionlines showing only weak levels of circular polarisation; we nevertheless findthat excess emission apparently concentrates in a mid-latitude region of strongradial field, suggesting that it is the footpoint of an accretion funnel.  the weaker and more complex field that we report on v2247oph may sharesimilarities with those of very-low-mass late-m dwarfs and potentially explainwhy low-mass cttss rotate on average faster than intermediate mass ones. thesesurprising results need confirmation from new independent data sets on v2247ophand other similar low-mass cttss.

0911.5476	dynamo processes in the t tauri star v410 tau	we present new brightness and magnetic images of the weak-line t tauri starv410 tau, made using data from the narval spectropolarimeter at telescopebernard lyot (tbl). the brightness image shows a large polar spot andsignificant spot coverage at lower latitudes. the magnetic maps show a fieldthat is predominantly dipolar and non-axisymmetric with a strong azimuthalcomponent. the field is 50% poloidal and 50% toroidal, and there is very littledifferential rotation apparent from the magnetic images.  a photometric monitoring campaign on this star has previously revealed v-bandvariability of up to 0.6 magnitudes but in 2009 the lightcurve is much flatter.the doppler image presented here is consistent with this low variability.calculating the flux predicted by the mapped spot distribution gives anpeak-to-peak variability of 0.04 magnitudes. the reduction in the amplitude ofthe lightcurve, compared with previous observations, appears to be related to achange in the distribution of the spots, rather than the number or area.  this paper is the first from a zeeman-doppler imaging campaign being carriedout on v410 tau between 2009-2012 at tbl. during this time it is expected thatthe lightcurve will return to a high amplitude state, allowing us to ascertainwhether the photometric changes are accompanied by a change in the magneticfield topology.

1003.2205	the low-mass population of the rho ophiuchi molecular cloud	star formation theories are currently divergent regarding the fundamentalphysical processes that dominate the substellar regime. observations of nearbyyoung open clusters allow the brown dwarf (bd) population to be characteriseddown to the planetary mass regime, which ultimately must be accommodated by asuccessful theory. we hope to uncover the low-mass population of the rhoophiuchi molecular cloud and investigate the properties of the newly foundbrown dwarfs. we use near-ir deep images (reaching completeness limits ofapproximately 20.5 mag in j, and 18.9 mag in h and ks) taken with the widefield ir camera (wircam) at the canada france hawaii telescope (cfht) toidentify candidate members of rho oph in the substellar regime. a spectroscopicfollow-up of a small sample of the candidates allows us to assess theirspectral type, and subsequently their temperature and membership. we select 110candidate members of the rho ophiuchi molecular cloud, from which 80 have notpreviously been associated with the cloud. we observed a small sample of theseand spectroscopically confirm six new brown dwarfs with spectral types rangingfrom m6.5 to m8.25.

1005.4384	accretion dynamics and disk evolution in ngc 2264: a study based on the  corot photometric observations	the young cluster ngc 2264 was observed with the corot satellite for 23 daysuninterruptedly in march 2008 with unprecedent photometric accuracy. we presenthere the first results of the analysis of the accreting population. we intendedto look for possible light curve variability of the same nature as thatobserved in the classical t tauri star aa tau, which was attributed to amagnetically controlled inner disk warp, which is directly associated with theinteraction between the stellar magnetic field and the inner disk region. weanalysed the corot light curves of 83 previously known classical t tauri starsthat belong to ngc 2264 and classified them according to their morphology. wealso studied the corot light curve morphology as a function of a spitzer-basedclassification of the star-disk systems. the classification derived on thebasis of the corot light curve morphology agrees very well with the spitzerirac-based classification of the systems. the percentage of aa tau-like lightcurves decreases as the inner disk dissipates, from 40% +- 10% in systems withthick inner disks to 36% +- 16% in systems with anemic disks and none in nakedphotosphere systems. indeed, 91% +- 29% of the ctts with naked photospheresexhibit pure spot-like variability, while only 18% +- 7% of the thick disksystems do so, presumably those seen at low inclination and thus free ofvariable obscuration. aa tau-like light curves are found to be fairly common,with a frequency of at least ~ 30 to 40% in young stars with inner dusty disks.the temporal evolution of the light curves indicates that the structure of theinner disk warp, located close to the corotation radius and responsible for theobscuration episodes, varies over a timescale of a few (~ 1-3) rotationalperiods. this probably reflects the highly dynamical nature of the star-diskmagnetospheric interaction.

1007.0682	the 2008 outburst in the young stellar system zcma: i. evidence of an  enhanced bipolar wind on the au-scale	accretion is a fundamental process in star formation. although the timeevolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modellingstudies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate theformation of the protostar. observing young stellar objects during theseelevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteadyaccretion. zcma is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embeddedherbig be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a fu orionis star. theherbig be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburstdetected so far. we aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studyingthe emission region of the hi brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer ofaccretion/ejection processes on the au-scale in young stars. using theamber/vlti instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performedspatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gasemitting across the brackett gamma emission line, during and after theoutburst. from the visibilities and differential phases, we derivecharacteristic sizes for the brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometricmeasurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. we find that theline profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistentwith the signature of either a keplerian disk or infall of matter. they are,instead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk holeinside the dust sublimation radius. the disappearance of the brackett gammaemission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to aperiod of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along theline of sight. based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of theoutburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring inex ors and fu ors.

0710.0827	multiple protostellar systems. ii. a high resolution near-infrared  imaging survey in nearby star-forming regions	(abridged) our project endeavors to obtain a robust view of multiplicityamong embedded class i and flat spectrum protostars in a wide array of nearbymolecular clouds to disentangle ``universal'' from cloud-dependent processes.we have used near-infrared adaptive optics observations at the vlt through theh, ks and l' filters to search for tight companions to 45 class i and flatspectrum protostars located in 4 different molecular clouds (taurus-auriga,ophiuchus, serpens and l1641 in orion). we complemented these observations withpublished high-resolution surveys of 13 additional objects in taurus andophiuchus. we found multiplicity rates of 32+/-6% and 47+/-8% over the 45-1400au and 14-1400 au separation ranges, respectively. these rates are in excellentagreement with those previously found among t tauri stars in taurus andophiuchus, and represent an excess of a factor ~1.7 over the multiplicity rateof solar-type field stars. we found no non-hierarchical triple systems, nor anyquadruple or higher-order systems. no significant cloud-to-cloud difference hasbeen found, except for the fact that all companions to low-mass orionprotostars are found within 100 au of their primaries whereas companions foundin other clouds span the whole range probed here. based on this survey, weconclude that core fragmentation always yields a high initial multiplicityrate, even in giant molecular clouds such as the orion cloud or in clusteredstellar populations as in serpens, in contrast with predictions of numericalsimulations. the lower multiplicity rate observed in clustered class ii andclass iii populations can be accounted for by a universal set of properties foryoung systems and subsequent ejections through close encounters with unrelatedcluster members.

1203.6331	accretion dynamics in the classical t tauri star v2129 oph	we analyze the photometric and spectroscopic variability of the classical ttauri star v2129 oph over several rotational cycles to test the dynamicalpredictions of magnetospheric accretion models. the photometric variability andthe radial velocity variations in the photospheric lines can be explained byrotational modulation due to cold spots, while the radial velocity variationsof the he i (5876 \aa) line and the veiling variability are due to hot spotrotational modulation. the hot and cold spots are located at high latitudes andabout the same phase, but the hot spot is expected to sit at the chromosphericlevel, while the cold spot is at the photospheric level. using thedipole+octupole magnetic-field configuration previously proposed in theliterature for the system, we compute 3d mhd magnetospheric simulations of thestar-disk system. we use the simulation's density, velocity and scaledtemperature structures as input to a radiative transfer code, from which wecalculate theoretical line profiles at all rotational phases. the theoreticalprofiles tend to be narrower than the observed ones, but the qualitativebehavior and the observed rotational modulation of the h\alpha and h\betaemission lines are well reproduced by the theoretical profiles. thespectroscopic and photometric variability observed in v2129 oph support thegeneral predictions of complex magnetospheric accretion models withnon-axisymmetric, multipolar fields.

0712.2921	accretion funnels onto weakly magnetized young stars	aims : we re-examine the conditions required to steadily deviate an accretionflow from a circumstellar disc into a magnetospheric funnel flow onto a slowrotating young forming star. methods : new analytical constraints on theformation of accretion funnels flows due to the presence of a dipolar stellarmagnetic field disrupting the disc are derived. the versatile advection code isused to confirm these constraints numerically. axisymmetric mhd simulations areperformed, where a stellar dipole field enters the resistive accretion disc,whose structure is self-consistently computed. results : the analyticalcriterion derived allows to predict a priori the position of the truncationradius from a non perturbative accretion disc model. accretion funnels arefound to be robust features which occur below the co-rotation radius, where thestellar poloidal magnetic pressure becomes both at equipartition with the discthermal pressure and is comparable to the disc poloidal ram pressure. weconfirm the results of romanova et al. 2002 and find accretion funnels forstellar dipole fields as low as 140 g in the low accretion rate limit of$10^{-9} m_\odot.yr^{-1}$. with our present numerical setup with no discmagnetic field, we found no evidence of winds, neither disc driven nor x-winds,and the star is only spun up by its interaction with the disc. conclusions :weak dipole fields, similar in magnitude to those observed, lead to thedevelopment of accretion funnel flows in weakly accreting t tauri stars.however, the higher accretion observed for most t tauri stars (${\dot m} \sim10^{-8} m_\odot.yr^{-1}$) requires either larger stellar field strength and/ordifferent magnetic topologies to allow for magnetospheric accretion.

0801.0670	brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the hyades cluster : a  dynamically evolved mass function	we conducted a search for brown dwarfs (bds) and very low mass (vlm) stars inthe 625 myr-old hyades cluster in order to derive the cluster's mass functionacross the stellar-substellar boundary. we performed a deep (i=23, z=22.5)photometric survey over 16 sq.deg. around the cluster center, followed up withk-band photometry to measure the proper motion of candidate members, andoptical and near-ir spectroscopy of probable bd and vlm members. we report thediscovery of the first 2 brown dwarfs in the hyades cluster. the 2 objects havea spectral type early-t and their optical and near-ir photometry as well astheir proper motion are consistent with them being cluster members. accordingto models, their mass is 50 jupiter masses at an age of 625 myr. we also reportthe discovery of 3 new very low mass stellar members of the cluster, andconfirm the membership of 16 others. we combine these results with a list ofpreviously known cluster members to build the present-day mass function (pdmf)of the hyades cluster from 50 jupiter masses to 3mo. we find the hyades pdmf tobe strongly deficient in very low mass objects and brown dwarfs compared to theimf of younger open clusters such as the pleiades. we interpret this deficiencyas the result of dynamical evolution over the past few 100 myr, i.e., thepreferential evaporation of low mass cluster members due to weak gravitationalencounters. we thus estimate that the hyades cluster currently hosts about10-15 brown dwarfs, while its initial substellar population may have amountedup to 150-200 members.

1306.4122	substellar multiplicity in the hyades cluster	we present the first high-angular resolution survey for multiple systemsamong very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the hyades open cluster. usingthe keck\,ii adaptive optics system, we observed a complete sample of 16objects with estimated masses $\lesssim$0.1 msun. we have identified threeclose binaries with projected separation $\lesssim$0.11", or $\lesssim$5 au. anumber of wide, mostly faint candidate companions are also detected in ourimages, most of which are revealed as unrelated background sources based onastrometric and/or photometric considerations. the derived multiplicityfrequency, 19+13/-6 % over the 2-350 au range, and the rarity of systems widerthan 10 au are both consistent with observations of field very low-massobjects. in the limited 3-50 au separation range, the companion frequency isessentially constant from brown dwarfs to solar-type stars in the hyadescluster, which is also in line with our current knowledge for field stars.combining the binaries discovered in this surveys with those already known inthe pleiades cluster reveals that very low-mass binaries in open clusters, aswell as in star-forming regions, are skewed toward lower mass ratios ($0.6\lesssim q \lesssim 0.8$) than are their field counterparts, a result thatcannot be accounted for by selection effects. although the possibility ofsevere systematic errors in model-based mass estimates for very low-mass starscannot be completely excluded, it is unlikely to explain this difference. wespeculate that this trend indicates that surveys among very low-mass fieldstars may have missed a substantial population of intermediate mass ratiosystems, implying that these systems are more common and more diverse thanpreviously thought.

0802.2052	magnetospheric accretion on the t tauri star bp tauri	from observations collected with the espadons and narval spectropolarimeters,we report the detection of zeeman signatures on the classical t tauri star bptau. circular polarisation signatures in photospheric lines and in narrowemission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion are monitored throughout mostof the rotation cycle of bp tau at two different epochs in 2006. we observethat rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of bothunpolarised and circularly polarised spectral proxies tracing the photosphereand the footpoints of accretion funnels.  from the complete data sets at each epoch, we reconstruct the large-scalemagnetic topology and the location of accretion spots at the surface of bp tauusing tomographic imaging. we find that the field of bp tau involves a 1.2 kgdipole and 1.6 kg octupole, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotationaxis. accretion spots coincide with the two main magnetic poles at highlatitudes and overlap with dark photospheric spots; they cover about 2% of thestellar surface. the strong mainly-axisymmetric poloidal field of bp tau isvery reminiscent of magnetic topologies of fully-convective dwarfs. it suggeststhat magnetic fields of fully-convective cttss such as bp tau are likely notfossil remants, but rather result from vigorous dynamo action operating withinthe bulk of their convective zones.  preliminary modelling suggests that the magnetosphere of bp tau extends todistances of at least 4 r* to ensure that accretion spots are located at highlatitudes, and is not blown open close to the surface by a putative stellarwind. it apparently succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out asthe corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of bp tau.

1404.2733	stellar magnetism: empirical trends with age and rotation	we investigate how the observed large-scale surface magnetic fields oflow-mass stars (~0.1 -- 2 msun), reconstructed through zeeman-doppler imaging(zdi), vary with age t, rotation and x-ray emission. our sample consists of 104magnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequenceobjects (1 myr &lt; t &lt; 10 gyr). for non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find thatthe unsigned average large-scale surface field &lt;|bv|&gt; is related to age as$t^{-0.655 \pm 0.045}$. this relation has a similar dependence to thatidentified by skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology. likewise,our relation could be used as an age-dating method ("magnetochronology"). thetrends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism areconsistent with the trends found from zeeman broadening measurements (sensitiveto large- and small-scale fields). these similarities indicate that the fieldsrecovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting thatsmall- and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generationprocesses. for the accreting objects, fewer statistically significant relationsare found, with one being a correlation between the unsigned magnetic flux androtation period. we attribute this to a signature of star-disc interaction,rather than being driven by the dynamo.

1503.00180	a maximum entropy approach to detect close-in giant planets around  active stars	(shortened for arxiv) we aim to progress towards more efficient exoplanetdetection around active stars by optimizing the use of doppler imaging inradial velocity measurements. we propose a simple method to simultaneouslyextract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographicinversion technique derived from classical doppler mapping. based on themaximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set oforbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resultingdoppler map. we carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform apreliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual dopplermap of the very active star hr 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data setfor various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit.using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peakactivity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radialvelocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planetdown to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocityscatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). onenoticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation,in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radialvelocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustlyrecovered. the present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbitalparameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when moreclassical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. it is easilyadaptable to most existing doppler imaging codes, paving the way towards asystematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.

1504.04717	investigating the rotational evolution of young, low mass stars using  monte carlo simulations	we investigate the rotational evolution of young stars through monte carlosimulations. we simulate 280,000 stars, each of which is assigned a mass, arotational period, and a mass accretion rate. the mass accretion rate dependson mass and time, following power-laws indices 1.4 and -1.5, respectively. amass-dependent accretion threshold is defined below which a star is consideredas diskless, which results in a distribution of disk lifetimes that matchesobservations. stars are evolved at constant angular spin rate while accretingand at constant angular momentum when they become diskless. we recover thebimodal period distribution seen in several young clusters. the short periodpeak consists mostly of diskless stars and the long period one is mainlypopulated by accreting stars. both distributions present a long tail towardslong periods and a population of slowly rotating diskless stars is observed atall ages. we reproduce the observed correlations between disk fraction and spinrate, as well as between ir excess and rotational period. the period-massrelation we derive from the simulations exhibits the same global trend asobserved in young clusters only if we release the disk locking assumption forthe lowest mass stars. we find that the time evolution of median specificangular momentum follows a power law index of -0.65 for accreting stars and of-0.53 for diskless stars, a shallower slope that results from a widedistribution of disk lifetimes. using observationally-documented distributionsof disk lifetimes, mass accretion rates, and initial rotation periods, andevolving an initial population from 1 to 12 myr, we reproduce the maincharacteristics of pre-main sequence angular momentum evolution, which supportsthe disk locking hypothesis.

1504.04824	spectro-astrometry of lkca 15 with x-shooter: searching for emission  from lkca 15b	planet formation is one explanation for the partial clearing of dust observedin the disks of some t tauri stars. indeed studies using state-of-the-art highangular resolution techniques have very recently begun to observe planetarycompanions in these so-called transitional disks. the goal of this work is touse spectra of the transitional disk object lkca 15 obtained with x-shooter onthe very large telescope to investigate the possibility of usingspectro-astrometry to detect planetary companions to t tauri stars. it isargued that an accreting planet should contribute to the total emission ofaccretion tracers such as h$\alpha$ and therefore planetary companions could bedetected with spectro-astrometry in the same way as it has been used to detectstellar companions to young stars. a probable planetary-mass companion wasrecently detected in the disk of lkca 15. therefore, it is an ideal target forthis pilot study. we studied several key accretion lines in the wavelengthrange 300 nm to 2.2 $\mu$m with spectro-astrometry. while nospectro-astrometric signal is measured for any emission lines the accuracyachieved in the technique is used to place an upper limit on the contributionof the planet to the flux of the h$\alpha$, pa$\gamma$, and pa$\beta$ lines.the derived upper limits on the flux allows an upper limit of the massaccretion rate, log($\dot{m}_{acc}$) = -8.9 to -9.3 for the mass of thecompanion between 6 m$_{jup}$ and 15 m$_{jup}$, respectively, to be estimated(with some assumptions).

1509.02951	protostellar spin-down: a planetary lift?	when they first appear in the hr diagram, young stars rotate at a mere 10\%of their break-up velocity. they must have lost most of the angular momentuminitially contained in the parental cloud, the so-called angular momentumproblem. we investigate here a new mechanism by which large amounts of angularmomentum might be shed from young stellar systems, thus yielding slowlyrotating young stars. assuming that planets promptly form in circumstellardisks and rapidly migrate close to the central star, we investigate how thetidal and magnetic interactions between the protostar, its close-in planet(s),and the inner circumstellar disk can efficiently remove angular momentum fromthe central object. we find that neither the tidal torque nor the variety ofmagnetic torques acting between the star and the embedded planet are able tocounteract the spin up torques due to accretion and contraction. indeed, theformer are orders of magnitude weaker than the latter beyond the corotationradius and are thus unable to prevent the young star from spinning up. weconclude that star-planet interaction in the early phases of stellar evolutiondoes not appear as a viable alternative to magnetic star-disk coupling tounderstand the origin of the low angular momentum content of young stars.

(1998). assuming a power law imf across the substellar boundary,we find a slope dn/dm ~ m^{-0.53}, implying that the number of objects per massbin is still rising but the contribution to the total mass of the cluster isdeclining in the brown dwarf regime.

astro-ph;0106493	the formation and evolution of binary systems. iii. low-mass binaries in  the praesepe cluster	with the aim of investigating the binary population of the 700 myr oldpraesepe cluster, we have observed 149 g and k-type cluster members usingadaptive optics. we detected 26 binary systems with an angular separationranging from less than 0.08 to 3.3 arcsec (15-600 au). after correcting fordetection biases, we derive a binary frequency (bf) in the logp (days) rangefrom 4.4 to 6.9 of 25.3 +/- 5.4%, which is similar to that of field g-typedwarfs (23.8%, duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991). this result, complemented by similarones obtained for the 2 myr old star forming cluster ic 348 (paper ii) and the120 myr old pleiades open cluster (paper i), indicates that the fraction oflong-period binaries does not significantly evolve over the lifetime ofgalactic open clusters. we compare the distribution of cluster binaries to thebinary populations of star forming regions, most notably orion and taurus, tocritically review current ideas regarding the binary formation process. weconclude that it is still unclear whether the lower binary fraction observed inyoung clusters compared to t associations is purely the result of the earlydynamical disruption of primordial binaries in dense clusters or whether itreflects intrinsically different modes of star formation in clusters andassociations. we also note that if taurus binaries result from the dynamicaldecay of small-n protostellar aggregates, one would predict the existence of ayet to be found dispersed population of mostly single substellar objects in thetaurus cloud.

astro-ph;0109327	visual binaries among high-mass stars - an adaptive optics survey of ob  stars in the ngc 6611 cluster	we have searched for visual binaries with projected separations in the range200-3000 au (0.1"-1.5") among a sample of 96 stars in the massive young ngc6611 cluster, 60 of them being subsequently identified as high probabilitycluster members of mainly ob spectral type. this is the first visual binarysurvey among such a large and homogeneous sample of high-mass stars. we find anuncorrected binary frequency of 18+/-6% over the surveyed separation range.considering only binaries with mass ratios q&gt;0.1, we find that ob stars in ngc6611 host more companions than solar-type field stars. we derive mass ratiosfor the detected binaries from their near-infrared flux ratios and concludethat about half of the detected binaries have q&lt;0.2, which does not contradictthe assumption that companion masses are randomly drawn from the initial massfunction. there is no evidence in our sample that wide-binary properties dependupon the mass of the primary star. the high frequency of massive binaries in acluster as rich as ngc 6611 and the lack of a strong mass dependence of theirproperties are difficult to reconcile with the scenario whereby massive starsform as the result of mergers of smaller stars. the canonical protostellaraccretion scenario together with cloud fragmentation, on the other hand, cannaturally explain most of the observed binary properties, although the veryhigh stellar density in the protocluster is likely to require significantmodification to that picture as well.

astro-ph;0212571	brown dwarfs in the pleiades cluster : clues to the substellar mass  function	we present the results of a 6.4 square degrees imaging survey of the pleiadescluster in the i and z-bands. the survey extends up to 3 degrees from thecluster center and is 90% complete down to i~22. it covers a mass range from0.03 msun to 0.48 msun and yields 40 brown dwarf candidates (bdcs) of which 29are new. the spatial distribution of bdcs is fitted by a king profile in orderto estimate the cluster substellar core radius. the pleiades mass function isthen derived accross the stellar-substellar boundary and we find that, between0.03 msun and 0.48 msun, it is well represented by a single power-law, dn/dm\propto m^{-alpha}, with an index alpha=0.60 +/- 0.11. over a larger massdomain, however, from 0.03 msun to 10 msun, the mass function is better fittedby a log-normal function. we estimate that brown dwarfs represent about 25% ofthe cluster population which nevertheless makes up less than 1.5% of thecluster mass. the early dynamical evolution of the cluster appears to have hadlittle effect on its present mass distribution at an age of 120 myr. comparisonbetween the pleiades mass function and the galactic field mass functionsuggests that apparent differences may be mostly due to unresolved binarysystems.

astro-ph;0306552	constraints on the disk geometry of the t tauri star aa tau from linear  polarimetry	we have simultaneously monitored the photometric and polarimetric variationsof the classical t tauri star aa tau during the fall of 2002. we combine thesedata with previously published polarimetric data covering two earlier epochs.the phase coverage is complete, although not contiguous. aa tau clearly showscyclic variations coupled with the rotation of the system. the star-disk systemproduces a repeatable polarisation curve where the polarisation increases withdecreasing brightness. the data fit well with the model put forward by bouvieret al. (1999) where aa tau is viewed almost edge-on and its disk is activelydumping material onto the central star via magnetospheric accretion. the inneredge of the disk is deformed by its interaction with the tilted magnetosphere,producing eclipses as it rotates and occults the photosphere periodically. fromthe shape of the polarisation curve in the qu-plane we confirm that theaccretion disk is seen at a large inclination, almost edge-on, and predict thatits position angle is pa~90 deg., i.e., that the disk's major axis is orientedin the east-west direction.

(abridged) the recent evidence obtained by briceno et al. that star-formationin taurus-auriga (ta) may be producing significantly fewer brown dwarfs (bds)per star than the onc is investigated by setting up a realistic model stellarplus bd population and explicitly taking into account a high binary proportionand dynamical evolution in the ta groups and the onc. the briceno result isreproduced almost exactly despite an identical imf in both systems because manybd-bd and star-bd binaries are disrupted in the onc thus freeing bds, while theta groups remain unevolved dynamically. however, the resulting populations donot have the correct star-star, star-bd and expecially bd-bd binary properties,even if a variable bd imf is allowed for. the conclusion is therefore that bdsneed to be added as a separate population which has its own binary properties.such an extra population can have various origins which are briefly discussedin this contribution but more fully in an associated paper.

astro-ph;0603498	magnetospheric accretion in classical t tauri stars	the inner 0.1 au around accreting t tauri stars hold clues to many physicalprocesses that characterize the early evolution of solar-type stars. theaccretion-ejection connection takes place at least in part in this compactmagnetized region around the central star, with the inner disk edge interactingwith the star's magnetosphere thus leading simultaneously to magneticallychanneled accretion flows and to high velocity winds and outflows. the magneticstar-disk interaction is thought to have strong implications for the angularmomentum evolution of the central system, the inner structure of the disk, andpossibly for halting the migration of young planets close to the stellarsurface. we review here the current status of magnetic field measurements in ttauri stars, the recent modeling efforts of the magnetospheric accretionprocess, including both radiative transfer and multi-d numerical simulations,and summarize current evidence supporting the concept of magnetically-channeledaccretion in young stars. we also discuss the limits of the models andhighlight observational results which suggest that the star-disk interaction isa highly dynamical and time variable process in young stars.

astro-ph;0608696	x-ray emission from the young brown dwarfs of the taurus molecular cloud	the xmm-newton extended survey of the tmc (xest) is a large program designedto systematically investigate the x-ray properties of young stellar/substellarobjects in the tmc. in particular, the area surveyed by 15 xmm-newton pointings(of which three are archival observations), supplemented with one archivalchandra observation, allows us to study 17 bds with m spectral types. half ofthis sample (9 out of 17 bds) is detected; 7 bds are detected here for thefirst time in x-rays. we observed a flare from one bd. we confirm severalprevious findings on bd x-ray activity: a log-log relation between x-ray andbolometric luminosity for stars (with l*&lt;10 lsun) and bds detected in x-rays; ashallow log-log relation between x-ray fractional luminosity and mass; alog-log relation between x-ray fractional luminosity and effective temperature;a log-log relation between x-ray surface flux and effective temperature. wefind no significant log-log correlation between the x-ray fractional luminosityand ew(halpha). accreting and nonaccreting bds have a similar x-ray fractionalluminosity. the median x-ray fractional luminosity of nonaccreting bds is about4 times lower than the mean saturation value for rapidly rotating low-massfield stars. our tmc bds have higher x-ray fractional luminosity than bds inthe chandra orion ultradeep project. the x-ray fractional luminosity declinesfrom low-mass stars to m-type bds, and as a sample, the bds are less efficientx-ray emitters than low-mass stars. we thus conclude that while the bdatmospheres observed here are mostly warm enough to sustain coronal activity, atrend is seen that may indicate its gradual decline due to the drop inphotospheric ionization degree (abridged).

astro-ph;0609160	the xmm-newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud (xest)	(abridged:) the xmm-newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud(xest) surveys the most populated ~5 square degrees of the taurus starformation region, using the xmm-newton x-ray observatory to study the thermalstructure, variability, and long-term evolution of hot plasma, to investigatethe magnetic dynamo, and to search for new potential members of theassociation. many targets are also studied in the optical, and high-resolutionx-ray grating spectroscopy has been obtained for selected bright sources. thex-ray spectra have been coherently analyzed with two different thermal models(2-component thermal model, and a continuous emission measure distributionmodel). we present overall correlations with fundamental stellar parametersthat were derived from the previous literature. a few detections from chandraobservations have been added. the present overview paper introduces the projectand provides the basic results from the x-ray analysis of all sources detectedin the xest survey.comprehensive tables summarize the stellar properties of alltargets surveyed. the survey goes deeper than previous x-ray surveys of taurusby about an order of magnitude and for the first time systematically accessesvery faint and strongly absorbed tmc objects. we find a detection rate of 85%and 98% for classical and weak-line t tau stars (ctts resp. wtts), and identifyabout half of the surveyed protostars and brown dwarfs. overall, 136 out of 169surveyed stellar systems are detected. we describe an x-ray luminosity vs. masscorrelation, discuss the distribution of x-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratios,and show evidence for lower x-ray luminosities in ctts compared to wtts.detailed analysis (e.g., variability, rotation-activity relations, influence ofaccretion on x-rays) will be discussed in a series of accompanying papers.

astro-ph;0611028	results of the rotor-program. i. the long-term photometric variability  of classical t tauri stars	we present a unique, homogeneous database of photometric measurements forclassical t tauri stars extending up to 20 years. the database contains morethan 21,000 ubvr observations of 72 ctts. all the data were collected withinthe framework of the rotor-program at mount maidanak observatory (uzbekistan)and together they constitute the longest homogeneous, accurate record of ttsvariability ever assembled. we characterize the long term photometricvariations of 49 ctts with sufficient data to allow a robust statisticalanalysis and propose an empirical classification scheme. several patterns oflong term photometric variability are identified. the most common pattern,exhibited by a group of 15 stars which includes t tau itself, consists of lowlevel variability (delta(v)&lt;=0.4mag) with no significant changes occurring fromseason to season over many years. a related subgroup of 22 stars exhibits asimilar stable long term variability pattern, though with larger amplitudes (upto delta(v)~1.6 mag). besides these representative groups, we identify threesmaller groups of 3-5 stars each which have distinctive photometric properties.the long term variability of most ctts is fairly stable and merely reflectsshorter term variability due to cold and hot surface spots. only a smallfraction of ctts undergo significant brightness changes on the long term(months, years), which probably arise from slowly varying circumstellarextinction.

astro-ph;0611787	magnetospheric accretion-ejection processes in the classical t tauri  star aa	from a long time series of high resolution (r=115,000) harps spectra andsimultaneous broad-band photometry, we report new evidence for magnetosphericaccretion as well as ejection processes in the nearly edge-on classical t tauristar aa tau.  aa tau's light curve is modulated with a period of 8.22d. the recurrentluminosity dips are due to the periodic occultation of the central star by themagnetically-warped inner disk edge located at about 9 rstar. balmer lineprofiles exhibit a clear rotational modulation of high-velocity redshiftedabsorption components with a period of 8.22 days as well, with a maximumstrength when the main accretion funnel flow passes through the line of sight.at the same time, the luminosity of the system decreases by about 1 mag,indicative of circumstellar absorption of the stellar photosphere by themagnetically-warped, corotating inner disk edge. the photospheric and heiradial velocities also exhibit periodic variations, and the veiling ismodulated by the appearance of the accretion shock at the bottom of theaccretion funnel. diagnostics of hot winds and their temporal behaviour arealso presented.  the peculiar geometry of the young aa tau system (nearly edge-on) allows usto uniquely probe the acretion-ejection region close to the star. we find thatmost spectral and photometric diagnostics vary as expected from models ofmagnetically-channelled accretion in young stars, with a large scalemagnetosphere tilted by 20 deg onto the star's spin axis. we also find evidencefor time variability of the magnetospheric accretion flow on a timescale of afew rotational periods.

astro-ph;0701422	the x-ray activity-rotation relation of t tauri stars in taurus-auriga	the taurus-auriga star-forming complex hosts the only population of t tauristars in which an anticorrelation of x-ray activity and rotation period hasbeen observed. we have used xmm-newton's european photon imaging cameras toperform the most sensitive survey to date of x-ray emission (0.3-10 kev) fromyoung stars in taurus-auriga and investigate the dependences of x-ray activitymeasures -- x-ray luminosity, lx, its ratio with the stellar luminosity,lx/lstar, and the surface-averaged x-ray flux, fxs -- on rotation period. wetested for differences in the distributions of lx/lstar of fast and slowrotators, accretors and non-accretors, and compared the dependence of lx/lstaron the ratio of the rotation period and the convective turnover timescale, therossby number, with that of late-type main-sequence stars. we found significantanticorrelations of lx and fxs with rotation period, but these could beexplained by the typically higher stellar luminosity and effective temperatureof fast-rotators in taurus-auriga and a near-linear dependence of lx on lstar.we found no evidence for a dependence of lx/lstar on rotation period, but foraccretors to have lower lx/lstar than non-accretors at all rotation periods.the rossby numbers of accretors and non-accretors were found to be the same asthose of late-type main-sequence stars showing saturated x-ray emission. weconclude that non-accreting t tauri stars show x-ray activity entirelyconsistent with the saturated activity of late-type main-sequence stars.accreting t tauri stars show lower x-ray activity, which cannot be attributedto their slower rotation.

astro-ph;9803138	the rotational velocity of low-mass stars in the pleiades	we present new vsini measurements for 235 low-mass stars in the pleiades. thedifferential rotational broadening has been resolved for all the stars in oursample. these results, combined with previously published measurements, providea complete and unbiased rotation data set for stars in the mass range from 0.6to 1.2 msol. applying a numerical inversion technique on the vsinidistributions, we derive the distributions of velocities for low-mass pleiadesmembers. comparison of the rotational distributions of low-mass members betweenic 2602/2391 and the pleiades suggests that g dwarfs behave like solid-bodiesand follow skumanich's law during this time span. however, comparison betweenpleiades and older clusters (m34 and hyades) indicates that the braking of slowrotators on the early main sequence is weaker than predicted by an asymptoticalskumanich's law. this strongly supports the view that angular momentum tappedin the radiative core of slow rotators on the zero age main sequence (zams)resurfaces into the convective envelope between pleiades and hyades age. forthe g-dwarfs, we derive a characteristic coupling time scale between the coreand the envelope of about 100--200myr. the relationship between rotation andcoronal activity in the pleiades is in agreement with previous observations inother clusters and field stars. we show that the rossby diagram provides anexcellent description of the x-ray activity for all stars in the mass domainstudied. the pleiades data for slow and moderate rotators fills the gap betweenthe x-ray--rotation correlation found for slow rotators and the x-ray``saturation plateau'' observed for young fast rotators.

astro-ph;9909207	keck spectra of brown dwarf candidates and a precise determination of  the lithium depletion boundary in the alpha persei open cluster	we have identified twenty-seven candidate very low mass members of therelatively young alpha persei open cluster from a six square degree ccd imagingsurvey. based on their i magnitudes and the nominal age and distance to thecluster, these objects should have masses less than 0.1 msunif they are clustermembers. we have subsequently obtained intermediate resolution spectra ofseventeen of these objects using the keck ii telescope and lris spectrograph.we have also obtained near-ir photometry for many of the stars. our primarygoal was to determine the location of the "lithium depletion boundary" andhence to derive a precise age for the cluster. we detect lithium withequivalent widths greater than or equal to 0.4 \aa in five of the programobjects. we have constructed a color-magnitude diagram for the faint end of thealpha persei main sequence. these data allow us to accurately determine thealpha persei single-star lithium depletion boundary at m(i$_c$) = 11.47, m(bol)= 11.42, (r-i)$_{c0}$ = 2.12, spectral type m6.0. by reference to theoreticalevolutionary models, this converts fairly directly into an age for the alphapersei cluster of 90 $\pm$ 10 myr. at this age, the two faintest of ourspectroscopically confirmed members should be sub-stellar (i.e., brown dwarfs)according to theoretical models.

0810.1836	further x-ray detections of herbig stars	the interpretation of x-ray detections from herbig ae/be stars is disputed asit is not clear if these intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars are able todrive a dynamo and ensuing phenomena of magnetic activity. alternative x-rayproduction mechanisms, related to stellar winds, star-disk magnetospheres, orunresolved late-type t tauri star companions have been proposed. in a series ofpapers we have been investigating high-resolution x-ray chandra images ofherbig ae/be and main-sequence b-type stars to test the t tauri hypothesis byspatially resolving known visual companions from the primaries. here we reporton six as yet unpublished chandra exposures from our x-ray survey of herbigstars. the target list comprises six herbig stars with known cool companions,and three further a/b-type stars that are serendipitously in the chandrafield-of-view. in this sample we record a detection rate of 100%, i.e. alla/b-type stars display x-ray emission at levels of log(l_x/l_bol) ~ -5...-7.the analysis of hardness ratios confirms that haebe's have hotter and/or moreabsorbed x-ray emitting plasma than more evolved b-type stars. radiative windsare ruled out as exclusive emission mechanism on basis of the high x-raytemperatures. confirming earlier results, the x-ray properties of herbig ae/bestars are not vastly different from those of their late-type companion stars(if such are known). the diagnostics provided by the presently available dataleave open if the hard x-ray emission of herbig stars is due to young age orindicative of further coronally active low-mass companion stars. in the lattercase, our detection statistics imply a high fraction of higher-order multiplesystems among herbig stars.
