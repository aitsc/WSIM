0904.2921	inter-session network coding with strategic users: a game-theoretic  analysis of network coding	a common assumption in the existing network coding literature is that theusers are cooperative and non-selfish. however, this assumption can be violatedin practice. in this paper, we analyze inter-session network coding in a wirednetwork using game theory. we assume selfish users acting strategically tomaximize their own utility, leading to a resource allocation game among users.in particular, we study the well-known butterfly network topology where abottleneck link is shared by several network coding and routing flows. we provethe existence of a nash equilibrium for a wide range of utility functions. weshow that the number of nash equilibria can be large (even infinite) forcertain choices of system parameters. this is in sharp contrast to a similargame setting with traditional packet forwarding where the nash equilibrium isalways unique. we then characterize the worst-case efficiency bounds, i.e., theprice-of-anarchy (poa), compared to an optimal and cooperative network design.we show that by using a novel discriminatory pricing scheme which chargesencoded and forwarded packets differently, we can improve the poa. however,regardless of the discriminatory pricing scheme being used, the poa is stillworse than for the case when network coding is not applied. this implies that,although inter-session network coding can improve performance compared toordinary routing, it is significantly more sensitive to users' strategicbehaviour. for example, in a butterfly network where the side links have zerocost, the efficiency can be as low as 25%. if the side links have non-zerocost, then the efficiency can further reduce to only 20%. these resultsgeneralize the well-known result of guaranteed 67% worst-case efficiency fortraditional packet forwarding networks.

1005.2061	cooperative diversity with mobile nodes: capacity outage rate and  duration	the outage probability is an important performance measure for cooperativediversity schemes. however, in mobile environments, the outage probability doesnot completely describe the behavior of cooperative diversity schemes since themobility of the involved nodes introduces variations in the channel gains. as aresult, the capacity outage events are correlated in time and second-orderstatistical parameters of the achievable information-theoretic capacity such asthe average capacity outage rate (aor) and the average capacity outage duration(aod) are required to obtain a more complete description of the properties ofcooperative diversity protocols. in this paper, assuming slow rayleigh fading,we derive exact expressions for the aor and the aod of three well-knowncooperative diversity protocols: variable-gain amplify-and-forward,decode-and-forward, and selection decode-and-forward relaying. furthermore, wedevelop asymptotically tight high signal-to-noise ratio (snr) approximations,which offer important insights into the influence of various system and channelparameters on the aor and aod. in particular, we show that on adouble-logarithmic scale, similar to the outage probability, the aorasymptotically decays with the snr with a slope that depends on the diversitygain of the cooperative protocol, whereas the aod asymptotically decays with aslope of -1/2 independent of the diversity gain.

1105.3835	protocols for relay-assisted free-space optical systems	we investigate transmission protocols for relay-assisted free-space optical(fso) systems, when multiple parallel relays are employed and there is nodirect link between the source and the destination. as alternatives toall-active fso relaying, where all the available relays transmit concurrently,we propose schemes that select only a single relay to participate in thecommunication between the source and the destination in each transmission slot.this selection is based on the channel state information (csi) obtained eitherfrom all or from some of the fso links. thus, the need for synchronizing therelays' transmissions is avoided and the slowly varying nature of theatmospheric channel is exploited. for both relay selection and all-activerelaying, novel closed-form expressions for their outage performance arederived, assuming the versatile gamma-gamma channel model. furthermore, basedon the derived analytical results, the problem of allocating the optical powerresources to the fso links is addressed, and optimum and suboptimum solutionsare proposed. numerical results are provided for equal and non-equal length fsolinks, which illustrate the outage behavior of the considered relayingprotocols and demonstrate the significant performance gains offered by theproposed power allocation schemes.

1108.3873	the diversity potential of relay selection with practical channel  estimation	we investigate the diversity order of decode-and-forward relay selection innakagami-m fading, in cases where practical channel estimation techniques areapplied. in this respect, we introduce a unified model for the imperfectchannel estimates, where the effects of noise, time-varying channels, andfeedback delays are jointly considered. based on this model, the correlationbetween the actual and the estimated channel values, \rho, is expressed as afunction of the signal-to-noise ratio (snr), yielding closed-form expressionsfor the overall outage probability as a function of \rho. the resultingdiversity order and power gain reveal a high dependence of the performance ofrelay selection on the high snr behavior of \rho, thus shedding light onto theeffect of channel estimation on the overall performance. it is shown that whenthe channel estimates are not frequently updated in applications involvingtime-varying channels, or when the amount of power allocated for channelestimation is not sufficiently high, the diversity potential of relay selectionis severely degraded. in short, the main contribution of this paper lies inanswering the following question: how fast should \rho tend to one, as the snrtends to infinity, so that relay selection does not experience any diversityloss?

1202.5349	buffer-aided relaying with adaptive link selection	in this paper, we consider a simple network consisting of a source, ahalf-duplex decode-and-forward relay, and a destination. we propose a newrelaying protocol employing adaptive link selection, i.e., in any given timeslot, based on the channel state information of the source-relay and therelay-destination link a decision is made whether the source or the relaytransmits. in order to avoid data loss at the relay, adaptive link selectionrequires the relay to be equipped with a buffer such that data can be queueduntil the relay-destination link is selected for transmission. we study bothdelay constrained and delay unconstrained transmission. for the delayunconstrained case, we characterize the optimal link selection policy, derivethe corresponding throughput, and develop an optimal power allocation scheme.for the delay constrained case, we propose to starve the buffer of the relay bychoosing the decision threshold of the link selection policy smaller than theoptimal one and derive a corresponding upper bound on the average delay.furthermore, we propose a modified link selection protocol which avoids bufferoverflow by limiting the queue size. our analytical and numerical results showthat buffer-aided relaying with adaptive link selection achieves significantthroughput gains compared to conventional relaying protocols with and withoutbuffers where the relay employs a fixed schedule for reception andtransmission.

1207.4763	buffer-aided relaying with adaptive link selection - fixed and mixed  rate transmission	we consider a simple network consisting of a source, a half-duplex df relaywith a buffer, and a destination. we assume that the direct source-destinationlink is not available and all links undergo fading. we propose two newbuffer-aided relaying schemes. in the first scheme, neither the source nor therelay have csit, and consequently, both nodes are forced to transmit with fixedrates. in contrast, in the second scheme, the source does not have csit andtransmits with fixed rate but the relay has csit and adapts its transmissionrate accordingly. in the absence of delay constraints, for both fixed rate andmixed rate transmission, we derive the throughput-optimal buffer-aided relayingprotocols which select either the source or the relay for transmission based onthe instantaneous snrs of the source-relay and the relay-destination links. inaddition, for the delay constrained case, we develop buffer-aided relayingprotocols that achieve a predefined average delay. compared to conventionalrelaying protocols, which select the transmitting node according to apredefined schedule independent of the link instantaneous snrs, the proposedbuffer-aided protocols with adaptive link selection achieve large performancegains. in particular, for fixed rate transmission, we show that the proposedprotocol achieves a diversity gain of two as long as an average delay of morethan three time slots can be afforded. furthermore, for mixed rate transmissionwith an average delay of $e{t}$ time slots, a multiplexing gain of$r=1-1/(2e{t})$ is achieved. hence, for mixed rate transmission, forsufficiently large average delays, buffer-aided half-duplex relaying with andwithout adaptive link selection does not suffer from a multiplexing gain losscompared to full-duplex relaying.

1209.2192	power allocation for conventional and buffer-aided link adaptive  relaying systems with energy harvesting nodes	energy harvesting (eh) nodes can play an important role in cooperativecommunication systems which do not have a continuous power supply. in thispaper, we consider the optimization of conventional and buffer-aided linkadaptive eh relaying systems, where an eh source communicates with thedestination via an eh decode-and-forward relay. in conventional relaying,source and relay transmit signals in consecutive time slots whereas inbuffer-aided link adaptive relaying, the state of the source-relay andrelay-destination channels determines whether the source or the relay isselected for transmission. our objective is to maximize the system throughputover a finite number of transmission time slots for both relaying protocols. incase of conventional relaying, we propose an offline and several online jointsource and relay transmit power allocation schemes. for offline powerallocation, we formulate an optimization problem which can be solved optimally.for the online case, we propose a dynamic programming (dp) approach to computethe optimal online transmit power. to alleviate the complexity inherent to dp,we also propose several suboptimal online power allocation schemes. forbuffer-aided link adaptive relaying, we show that the joint offlineoptimization of the source and relay transmit powers along with the linkselection results in a mixed integer non-linear program which we solveoptimally using the spatial branch-and-bound method. we also propose anefficient online power allocation scheme and a naive online power allocationscheme for buffer-aided link adaptive relaying. our results show that linkadaptive relaying provides performance improvement over conventional relayingat the expense of a higher computational complexity.

1303.1647	relay selection for simultaneous information transmission and wireless  energy transfer: a tradeoff perspective	in certain applications, relay terminals can be employed to simultaneouslydeliver information and energy to a designated receiver and a radio frequency(rf) energy harvester, respectively. in such scenarios, the relay that ispreferable for information transmission does not necessarily coincide with therelay with the strongest channel to the energy harvester, since thecorresponding channels fade independently. relay selection thus entails atradeoff between the efficiency of the information transfer to the receiver andthe amount of energy transferred to the energy harvester. the study of thistradeoff is the subject on which this work mainly focuses. specifically, weinvestigate the behavior of the ergodic capacity and the outage probability ofthe information transmission to the receiver, for a given amount of energytransferred to the rf energy harvester. we propose two relay selection methodsthat apply to any number of available relays. furthermore, for the case of tworelays, we develop the optimal relay selection method in a maximum capacity /minimum outage probability sense, for a given energy transfer constraint. aclose-to-optimal selection method that is easier to analyze than the optimalone is also examined. closed-form expressions for the capacity-energy and theoutage-energy tradeoffs of the developed schemes are provided and corroboratedby simulations. interesting insights on the aforementioned tradeoffs areobtained.

cs;0606090	error rate analysis for coded multicarrier systems over quasi-static  fading channels	several recent standards such as ieee 802.11a/g, ieee 802.16, and ecmamultiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (mb-ofdm) for highdata-rate ultra-wideband (uwb), employ bit-interleaved convolutionally-codedmulticarrier modulation over quasi-static fading channels. motivated by thelack of appropriate error rate analysis techniques for this popular type ofsystem and channel model, we present two novel analytical methods for bit errorrate (ber) estimation of coded multicarrier systems operating overfrequency-selective quasi-static channels with non-ideal interleaving. in thefirst method, the approximate performance of the system is calculated for eachrealization of the channel, which is suitable for obtaining the outage berperformance (a common performance measure for e.g. mb-ofdm systems). the secondmethod assumes rayleigh distributed frequency-domain subcarrier channel gainsand knowledge of their correlation matrix, and can be used to directly obtainthe average ber performance. both methods are applicable toconvolutionally-coded interleaved multicarrier systems employing quadratureamplitude modulation (qam), and are also able to account for narrowbandinterference (modeled as a sum of tone interferers). to illustrate theapplication of the proposed analysis, both methods are used to study theperformance of a tone-interference-impaired mb-ofdm system.
