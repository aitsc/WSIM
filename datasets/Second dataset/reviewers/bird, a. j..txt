0901.2215	igr j16351-5806: another close by compton-thick agn	igr j16351-5806 has been associated with the seyfert 2 galaxy eso 137-g34,having been first reported as a high energy emitter in the third integral/ibissurvey. using a new diagnostic tool based on x-ray column density measurementsvs softness ratios, malizia et al. (2007) identified this source as a candidatecompton thick agn. in the present work we have analysed combined xmm-newton andintegral data of igr j16351-5806 in order to study its broad band spectrum andinvestigate its compton thick nature. the prominent k_alpha fluorescence linearound 6.4 kev (ew &gt; 1 kev) together with a flat 2-10 kev spectrum immediatelypoint to a highly obscured source. the overall spectrum can be interpreted interms of a transmission scenario where some of the high energy radiation isable to penetrate through the thick absorption but a good fit is also obtainedusing a pure reflection spectrum. an alternative possibility is that of acomplex absorption, where two layers of absorbing matter each partiallycovering the central nucleus are present in igr j16351-5806. all threescenarios are compatible from a statistical viewpoint and provide reasonableagn spectral parameters; more importantly all point to a source with anabsorbing column greater than 1.5 x 10^24 cm^-2, i.e. to a compton thick agn.because of this heavy obscuration, some extra components which would otherwisebe hidden are able to emerge at low energies and can be studied. by providingstrong evidence for the compton thick nature of igr j16351-5806, we indirectlyconfirm the validity of the malizia et al. diagnostic diagram.

0901.2499	the nature of the asca/integral source ax j183039-1002: a new  compton-thick agn?	we report on the identification of the x/soft gamma-ray source axj183039-1002 detected with asca and integral/ibis. the source, which has anobserved 20-100 kev flux of about 8.6 x 10^-11 erg/cm^2/s, is inside a diffuseradio supernova remnant (snr) and is spatially coincident with a compact radiosource. we analyzed archival chandra and xmm-newton observations in order toidentify the asca/integral source. a point-like chandra x-ray object was foundto be positionally coincident with the compact radio source and within theerror circle of the asca and integral sources. although the association of acompact radio/x-ray source with a radio supernova remnant could be indicativeof a pulsar wind nebula (pwn), the xmm-newton x-ray spectrum is compatible withan absorbed, seyfert-2 like agn, since it provides evidence for an ironemission line of about 1 kev equivalent width; furthermore the x-ray sourcespectrum is similar to that of other compton thick agn where the &lt;2 kev dataare associated to a warm reflector and the &gt;10 kev one to a cold reflector.

0706.3460	the agn nature of 11 out of 12 swift/rxte unidentified sources through  optical and x-ray spectroscopy	the swift burst alert telescope (bat) is performing a high galactic latitudesurvey in the 14-195 kev band at a flux limit of ~10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1},leading to the discovery of new high energy sources, most of which have not sofar been properly classified. a similar work has also been performed with therxte slew survey leading to the discovery of 68 sources detected above 8 kev,many of which are still unclassified. follow-up observations with the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) provide, for many of these objects, source localizationwith a positional accuracy of few arcsec, thus allowing the search for opticalcounterparts to be more efficient and reliable. we present the results ofoptical/x-ray follow-up studies of 11 swift bat detections and one agn detectedin the rxte slew survey, aimed at identifying their counterparts and atassessing their nature. these data allowed, for the first time, the opticalclassification of 8 objects and a distance determination for 3 of them. foranother object, a more refined optical classification than that available inthe literature is also provided. for the remaining sources, opticalspectroscopy provides a characterization of the source near in time to thex-ray measurement. the sample consists of 6 seyfert 2 galaxies, 5 seyferts ofintermediate type 1.2-1.8, and one object of galactic nature - an intermediatepolar (i.e., magnetic) cataclysmic variable. out of the 11 agns, 8 (~70%)including 2 seyferts of type 1.2 and 1.5, are absorbed with nh &gt; 10^{22}cm^{-2}. up to 3 objects could be compton thick (i.e. nh &gt; 1.5 x 10^{24}cm^{-2}), but only in one case (swift j0609.1-8636) does all the observationalevidence strongly suggests this possibility.

0906.2909	the integral complete sample of type 1 agn	in this paper we discuss the broad-band x-ray characteristics of a completesample of 36 type 1 agn, detected by integral in the 20-40 kev band above the5.5sigma level. we present, for all the objects in the sample, the broad-band(1-110 kev) spectral analysis obtained by using integral/swift-bat observationstogether with xmm-newton, chandra, asca and swift/xrt data. we also present thegeneral average properties of the sample, i.e. the distribution of photonindices, high energy cut-offs, reflection fractions and absorption properties,together with an in-depth analysis of their parameter space. we find that theaverage seyfert 1 power law has an index of 1.7 with a dispersion of 0.2. themean cut-off energy is at around 100 kev, with most objects displaying ec inthe range 50-150 kev; the average amount of compton reflection is 1.5 with atypical dispersion of 0.7. we do not find any convincing correlation betweenthe various parameters, an indication that our analysis is not stronglydependent by the interplay between them. finally, we investigate how theresults presented in this work fit into current frameworks for agn spectralmodeling and cosmic diffuse x-ray background synthesis models.

0906.5544	the fraction of compton-thick sources in an integral complete agn sample	we study the nh distribution in a complete sample of 88 agn selected in the20-40 kev band from integral/ibis observations. we find that the fraction ofabsorbed (nh &gt; 10^{22} cm^2) sources is 43% while the compton thick agncomprise 7% of the sample. while these estimates are fully compatible withprevious soft gamma-ray surveys, they would appear to be in contrast withresults reported by risaliti et al. (1999) using an optically selected sample.this apparent difference can be explained as being due to a selection biascaused by the reduction in high energy flux in compton thick objects renderingthem invisible at our sensitivity limit. taking this into account we estimatethat the fraction of highly absorbed sources is actually in close agreementwith the optically selected sample. furthermore we show that the measuredfraction of absorbed sources in our sample decreases from 80% to about 20-30%as a function of redshift with all compton thick agn having z &lt; 0.015. if welimit our analysis to this distance and compare only the type 2 objects in oursample with the risaliti et al. objects below this redshift value, we find aperfect match to their nh distribution. we conclude that in the low redshiftbin we are seeing almost the entire agn population, from unabsorbed to at leastmildly compton thick objects, while in the total sample we lose the heavilyabsorbed 'counterparts' of distant and therefore dim sources with little or noabsorption. taking therefore this low z bin as the only one able to provide the'true' distribution of absorption in type 1 and 2 agn, we estimate the fractionof compton thick objects to be &gt;24%.

0707.0832	hess j1616-508: likely powered by psr j1617-5055	hess j1616-508 is one of the brightest emitters in the tev sky. recentobservations with the ibis/isgri telescope on board the integral spacecrafthave revealed that a young, nearby and energetic pulsar, psr j1617-5055, is apowerful emitter of soft gamma-rays in the 20-100 kev domain. in this paper wepresent an analysis of all available data from the integral, swift, bepposaxand xmm-newton telescopes with a view to assessing the most likely counterpartto the hess source. we find that the energy source that fuels the x/gamma-rayemissions is derived from the pulsar, both on the basis of the positionalmorphology, the timing evidence and the energetics of the system. likewise, the1.2% of the pulsar's spin down energy loss needed to power the 0.1-10 tevemission is also fully consistent with other hess sources known to beassociated with pulsars. the relative sizes of the x/gamma-ray and vhe sourcesare consistent with the expected lifetimes against synchrotron and comptonlosses for a single source of parent electrons emitted from the pulsar. we findthat no other known object in the vicinity could be reasonably considered as aplausible counterpart to the hess source. we conclude that there is goodevidence to assume that the hess j1616-508 source is driven by psr j1617-5055in which a combination of synchrotron and inverse compton processes combine tocreate the observed morphology of a broad-band emitter from kev to tevenergies.

0910.0954	hard x-ray properties of magnetic cataclysmic variables	hard x-ray surveys have proven remarkably efficient in detecting intermediatepolars and asynchronous polars, two of the rarest type of cataclysmic variable(cv). here we present a global study of hard x-ray selected intermediate polarsand asynchronous polars, focusing particularly on the link between hard x-rayproperties and spin/orbital periods. to this end, we first construct a newsample of these objects by cross-correlating candidate sources detected inintegral/ibis observations against catalogues of known cvs. we find 23cataclysmic variable matches, and also present an additional 9 (of which 3 aredefinite) likely magnetic cataclysmic variables (mcvs) identified by othersthrough optical follow-ups of ibis detections. we also include in our analysishard x-ray observations from swift/bat and suzaku/hxd in order to make ourstudy more complete. we find that most hard x-ray detected mcvs havep_{spin}/p_{orb}&lt;0.1 above the period gap. in this respect we also point outthe very low number of detected systems in any band betweenp_{spin}/p_{orb}=0.3 and p_{spin}/p_{orb}=1 and the apparent peak of thep_{spin}/p_{orb} distribution at about 0.1. the observational features of thep_{spin} - p_{orb} plane are discussed in the context of mcv evolutionscenarios. we also present for the first time evidence for correlations betweenhard x-ray spectral hardness and p_{spin}, p_{orb} and p_{spin}/p_{orb}. anattempt to explain the observed correlations is made in the context of mcvevolution and accretion footprint geometries on the white dwarf surface.

0709.1895	broadband x-ray spectrum of the newly discovered broad line radio galaxy  igr j21247+5058	in this paper we present radio and high energy observations of the integralsource igr j21247+5058, a broad line emitting galaxy obscured by the galacticplane. archival vla radio data indicate that igr j21247+5058 can be classifiedas an frii broad line radio galaxy. the spectrum between 610 mhz and 15 ghz istypical of synchrotron self-absorbed radiation with a peak at 8 ghz and a lowenergy turnover; the core fraction is 0.1 suggestive of a moderate dopplerboosting of the base of the jet. the high energy broad-band spectrum wasobtained by combining xmm-newton and swift/xrt observation with integral/ibisdata. the 0.4-100 kev spectrum is well described by a power law, with slope$\gamma$=1.5, characterised by complex absorption due to two layers of materialpartially covering the source and a high energy cut-off around 70-80 kev.features such as a narrow iron line and a compton reflection component, ifpresent, are weak, suggesting that reprocessing of the power law photons in theaccretion disk plays a negligible role in the source.

1201.1906	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  ix. 22 more identifications, and a glance into the far hard x-ray universe	(abridged) since its launch in october 2002, the integral satellite hasrevolutionized our knowledge of the hard x-ray sky thanks to its unprecedentedimaging capabilities and source detection positional accuracy above 20 kev.nevertheless, many of the newly-detected sources in the integral sky surveysare of unknown nature. the combined use of available information at longerwavelengths (mainly soft x-rays and radio) and of optical spectroscopy on theputative counterparts of these new hard x-ray objects allows us to pinpointtheir exact nature. continuing our long-standing program that has been runningsince 2004, and using 6 different telescopes of various sizes, we report theclassification through optical spectroscopy of 22 more unidentified or poorlystudied high-energy sources detected with the ibis instrument onboard integral.we found that 16 of them are active galactic nuclei (agns), while the remaining6 objects are within our galaxy. among the identified extragalactic sources, 14are type 1 agns; of these, 6 lie at redshift larger than 0.5 and one has z =3.12, which makes it the second farthest object detected in the integralsurveys up to now. the remaining agns are of type 2, and one of them is a pairof interacting seyfert 2 galaxies. the galactic objects are identified as twocataclysmic variables, one high-mass x-ray binary, one symbiotic binary and twochromospherically active stars. we thus still find that agns are the mostabundant population among hard x-ray objects identified through opticalspectroscopy. moreover, we note that the higher sensitivity of the more recentintegral surveys is now enabling the detection of high-redshift agns, thusallowing the exploration of the most distant hard x-ray emitting sources andpossibly of the most extreme blazars.

0711.0648	integral observations of psr j1811-1925 and its associated pulsar wind  nebula	we present spectral measurements made in the soft (20-100 kev) gamma-ray bandof the region containing the composite supernova remnant g11.2-0.3 and itsassociated pulsar psr j1811-1925. analysis of integral/ibis data allowscharacterisation of the system above 10 kev. the ibis spectrum is best fittedby a power law having photon index of 1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3} and a 20-100 kev fluxof 1.5e{-11} erg/cm^2/s. analysis of archival chandra data over differentenergy bands rules out the supernova shell as the site of the soft gamma-rayemission while broad band (1-200 kev) spectral analysis strongly indicates thatthe integral/ibis photons originate in the central zone of the system whichcontains both the pulsar and its nebula. the composite x-ray and soft gamma-rayspectrum indicates that the pulsar provides around half of the emission seen inthe soft gamma-ray domain; its spectrum is hard with no sign of a cut off up toat least 80 kev. the other half of the emission above 10 kev comes from thepwn; with a power law slope of 1.7 its spectrum is softer than that of thepulsar. from the ibis/isgri mosaics we are able to derive 2 sigma upper limitsfor the 20-100 kev flux from the location of the nearby tev source hessj1809-193 to be 4.8e{-12} erg/cm^2/s. we have also examined the likelihood ofan association between psr j1811-1925 and hess j1809-193. although psrj1811-1925 is the most energetic pulsar in the region, the only one detectedabove 10 kev and thus a possible source of energy to fuel the tev fluxes, thereis no morphological evidence to support this pairing, making it an unlikelycounterpart.

1304.7783	contrasting behaviour from two be/x-ray binary pulsars: insights into  differing neutron star accretion modes	in this paper we present the identification of two periodic x-ray signalscoming from the direction of the small magellanic cloud (smc). on detectionwith the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte), the 175.4s and 85.4s pulsationswere considered to originate from new be/x-ray binary (bexrb) pulsars withunknown locations. using rapid follow-up integral and xmm-newton observations,we show the first pulsar (designated sxp175) to be coincident with a candidatehigh-mass x-ray binary (hmxb) in the northern bar region of the smc undergoinga small type ii outburst. the orbital period (87d) and spectral class(b0-b0.5iiie) of this system are determined and presented here for the firsttime. the second pulsar is shown not to be new at all, but is consistent withbeing sxp91.1 - a pulsar discovered at the very beginning of the 13 year longrxte key monitoring programme of the smc. whilst it is theoretically possiblefor accreting neutron stars to change spin period so dramatically over such ashort time, the x-ray and optical data available for this source suggest thisspin-up is continuous during long phases of x-ray quiescence, where accretiondriven spin-up of the neutron star should be minimal.

1305.2722	hard x-ray spectra of agn in the integral complete sample	in this paper, we present the hard x-ray spectral analysis of a completesample of agn de- tected by integral/ibis. in conjunction with ibis spectra, wemake use of swift/bat data, with the aim of cross-calibrating the twoinstruments, studying source variability and con- straining some importantspectral parameters. we find that flux variability is present in at least 14%of the sample, while spectral variability is found only in one object. there isgeneral good agreement between bat and ibis spectra, despite a systematicmismatch of about 22% in normalisation. when fitted with a simple power-lawmodel, type 1 and type 2 sources appear to have very similar average photonindices, suggesting that they are powered by the same mechanism. as expected,we also find that a simple power-law does not always describe the datasufficiently well, thus indicating a certain degree of spectral complexity,which can be ascribed to features like a high energy cut-off and/or areflection component. fixing the reflection to be 0, 1 or 2, we find that oursample covers quite a large range in photon indices as well as cut-offenergies; however, the spread is due only to a small number of objects, whilethe majority of the agn lie within well defined boundaries of photon index(1&lt;{\gamma}&lt;2) and cut-off energy (30&lt;ecut&lt;300 kev).

0803.0896	the broad-band xmm-newton and integral spectra of bright type 1 seyfert  galaxies	the 0.5-150 kev broad-band spectra of a sample of nine bright type 1 seyfertgalaxies are analyzed here. these sources have been discovered/detected byintegral and subsequently observed with xmm--newton for the first time withhigh sensitivity below 10 kev. the sample, although small, is representative ofthe population of type 1 agn which are now being observed above 20 kev. theintrinsic continuum has been modeled using three different parameterizations: apower-law model, an exponential cut-off power-law and an exponential cut-offpower-law with a compton reflection component. in each model the presence ofintrinsic absorption, a soft component and emission line reprocessing featureshas also been tested. a simple power-law model is a statistically gooddescription of most of the spectra presented here; an fek line, fully and/orpartial covering absorption and a soft spectral component are detected in themajority of the sample sources. the average photon index (&lt; gamma &gt; = 1.7 $\pm$0.2) is consistent, within errors, with the canonical spectral slope oftenobserved in agn although the photon index distribution peaks in our case atflat gamma (~ 1.5) values. for four sources, we find a significantly improvedfit when the power-law is exponentially cut-off at an energy which isconstrained to be below ~ 150 kev. the compton reflection parameter could beestimated in only two objects of the sample and in both cases is found to be r&gt; 1.

astro-ph;0101035	flat-fielding batse occultation data for use in a hard x-ray all sky  survey	the batse mission aboard cgro can be used to observe hard x-ray sources byusing the earth occultation method. this method relies on measuring a step inthe count rate profile in each batse detector as a source rises above or setsbelow the earth's limb. a major problem in determining the step sizes (andhence the flux) is in extracting the steps from the varying background. atechnique for flat-fielding the response of gamma ray detectors has beendeveloped at southampton. the technique uses a dynamic monte-carlo model tosimulate the dominant components of the gamma-ray background encountered by theexperiment at any point in its orbit. a maximum likelihood imaging method isalso being developed that will be used to make a sky survey with all 9 years ofthe batse continuous data set in the 20 - 500 kev range. an all sky map of 25 -35 kev emission has been made using 60 days of data and has a 3 sigma fluxsensitivity of 14 mcrab.

astro-ph;0211424	a mass model for estimating the gamma ray background of the burst and  transient source experiment	orbiting x-ray and gamma ray instruments are subject to large backgroundcount rates due to local particle fluxes in the space environment. the abilityof an instrument to make calibrated measurements of the flux from a source ofinterest is highly dependent on accurately determining the background level. wepresent here a method of calculating the energy dependent background flux forany point in the complete data set recorded by the burst and transient sourceexperiment (batse) in its nine year mission. the batse mass model (bamm) uses amonte carlo mass modelling approach to produce a data base of the gamma raybackground which is then filtered to simulate the background count rate with a2.048 second time resolution. this method is able to reduce the variations inthe background flux by a factor of 8 - 10, effectively `flat-fielding' thedetector response. with flat-fielded batse data it should be possible to usethe earth occultation technique to produce a hard x-ray all sky survey to the1-2 mcrab sensitivity limit. bamm is also capable of estimating thecontribution to the spectra measured from gamma ray sources due to thereprocessing of source photons in inactive material surrounding a gamma raydetector. possible applications of this aspect of the model in the area ofgamma ray burst spectral analysis are discussed.

astro-ph;0610880	integral and swift observations of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  axj1845.0-0433=igrj18450-0435	context: axj1845.0-0433 was discovered by asca in 1993 during fast outburstactivity characterized by several flares on short timescales. up to now, thesource was not detected again by any x-ray mission. its optical counterpart issuggested to be an o9.5i supergiant star, which is the only remarkable objectfound inside the asca error box. aims: to detect and characterize new fastoutbursts of axj1845.0-0433 and confirm its supergiant hmxb nature, usingintegral and archival swift xrt observations. methods: we performed an analysisof integral ibis and jem-x data with osa 5.1 as well as an analysis of archiveswift xrt data. results: we report on fast flaring activity from the source ontimescales of a few tens of minutes, the first to be reported since itsdiscovery in 1993. two outbursts have been detected by integral (apr 2005 andapr 2006) with similar peak fluxes and peak luminosities of 80 mcrab and9.3x10^35 erg s^-1 (20--40 kev), respectively. two other outbursts weredetected by swift xrt on nov 2005 and mar 2006. the refined swift xrt positionof axj1845.0-0433 confirms its association with the supergiant star previouslyproposed as optical counterpart. conclusions: our integral and swift resultsfully confirm the supergiant hmxb nature of axj1845.0-0433 which can thereforebe classified as a supergiant fast x-ray transient. moreover they provide forthe first time evidence of its recurrent fast transient behaviour.

astro-ph;0702477	igr j18483-0311: an accreting x-ray pulsar observed by integral	igr j18483-0311 is a poorly known transient hard x-ray source discovered byintegral during observations of the galactic center region performed between23--28 april 2003. aims: to detect new outbursts from igr j18483-0311 usingintegral and archival swift xrt observations and finally to characterize thenature of this source using the optical/near-infrared (nir) informationavailable through catalogue searches. results: we report on 5 newly discoveredoutbursts from igr j18483-0311 detected by integral.for two of them it waspossible to constrain a duration of the order of a few days. the strongestoutburst reached a peak flux of 120 mcrab (20--100 kev): its broad bandjem--x/isgri spectrum (3--50 kev) is best fitted by an absorbed cutoff powerlaw with photon index=1.4+/-0.3, cutoff energy of ~22 kev and nh ~9x10^22cm^-2. timing analysis of integral data allowed us to identify periodicities of18.52 days and 21.0526 seconds which are likely the orbital period of thesystem and the spin period of the x-ray pulsar respectively. swift xrtobservations of igr j18483$-$0311 provided a very accurate source positionwhich strongly indicates a highly reddened star in the usno--b1.0 and 2masscatalogues as its possible optical/nir counterpart. conclusions: the x-rayspectral shape, the periods of 18.52 days and 21.0526 seconds, the highintrinsic absorption, the location in the direction of the scutum spiral armand the highly reddened optical object as possible counterpart, all favour thehypothesis that igr j18483-0311 is a hmxb with a neutron star as compactcompanion. the system is most likely a be x-ray binary, but a supergiant fastx-ray transient nature can not be entirely excluded.

astro-ph;0702738	polarisation studies of the prompt gamma-ray emission from grb 041219a  using the spectrometer aboard integral	the spectrometer aboard integral, spi, has the capability to detect thesignature of polarised emission from a bright gamma-ray source. grb 041219a isthe most intense burst localised by integral and is an ideal candidate for sucha study. polarisation can be measured using multiple events scattered intoadjacent detectors because the compton scatter angle depends on thepolarisation of the incoming photon. a search for linear polarisation in themost intense pulse of duration 66 seconds and in the brightest 12 seconds ofgrb 041219a was performed in the 100-350kev, 100-500kev and 100kev-1mev energyranges. the multiple event data from the spectrometer was analysed and comparedwith the predicted instrument response obtained from monte-carlo simulationsusing the geant 4 integral mass model. the chi^2 distribution between the realand simulated data as a function of the percentage polarisation andpolarisation angle was calculated for all three energy ranges. the degree oflinear polarisation in the brightest pulse of duration 66s was found to be63+/-31% at an angle of 70+/-14 degrees in the 100-350kev energy range. thedegree of polarisation was also constrained in the brightest 12s of the grb anda polarisation fraction of 96+/-40% at an angle of 60+/-14 degrees wasdetermined over the same energy range. however, despite extensive analysis andsimulations, a systematic effect that could mimic the weak polarisation signalcould not be definitively excluded. our results over several energy ranges andtime intervals are consistent with a polarisation signal of about 60% at a lowlevel of significance (2 sigma). we conclude that the procedure described heredemonstrates the effectiveness of using spi as a polarimeter, and is a viablemethod of measuring polarisation levels in intense gamma--ray bursts.

0810.1844	integral/ibis and swift/xrt observations of hard cataclysmic variables	the analysis of the third integral/ibis survey has revealed several newcataclysmic variables, most of which turned out to be intermediate polars, thusconfirming that these objects are strong emitters in hard x-rays. here wepresent high energy spectra of all 22 cataclysmic variables detected in the 3rdibis survey and provide the first average spectrum over the 20-100 kev band forthis class. our analysis indicates that the best-fit model is a thermalbremsstrahlung with an average temperature of &lt;kt&gt; ~22 kev. recently, eleven(ten intermediate polars and one polar) of these systems have been followed-upby swift/xrt (operating in the 0.3-10 kev energy band), thus allowing us toinvestigate their spectral behaviour over the range ~0.3-100 kev. thanks tothis wide energy coverage, it was possible for these sources to simultaneouslymeasure the soft and hard components and estimate their temperatures. the softemission, thought to originate in the irradiated poles of the white dwarfatmosphere, is well described by a blackbody model with temperatures in therange ~60-120 ev. the hard emission, which is supposed to be originated fromoptically thin plasma in the post-shock region above the magnetic poles, isindeed well modelled with a bremsstrahlung model with temperatures in the range~16-33 kev, similar to the values obtained from the integral data alone. inseveral cases we also find the presence of a complex absorber: one totally(with nh ~(0.4-28) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}) and one partially (with nh ~(0.7-9) x10^{23} cm^{-2}) covering the source. only in four cases (v709 cas, gk per, igrj06253+7334 and igr j17303-0601), we find evidence for the presence of an ironline at 6.4 kev. we discuss our findings in the light of the systems parametersand cataclysmic variables/intermediate polars modelling scenario.

0810.1878	the integral long monitoring of persistent ultra compact x-ray bursters	the combination of compact objects, short period variability and peculiarchemical composition of the ultra compact x-ray binaries make up a veryinteresting laboratory to study accretion processes and thermonuclear burningon the neutron star surface. the improved large optical telescopes and moresensitive x-ray satellites have increased the number of known ultra compactx-ray binaries allowing their study with unprecedented detail. we analyze theaverage properties common to all ultra compact bursters observed by integralfrom ~0.2kev to ~150kev. we have performed a systematic analysis of theintegral public data and key-program proprietary observations of a sample ofthe ultra compact x-ray binaries. in order to study their average properties ina very broad energy band, we combined integral with bepposax and swift datawhenever possible. for sources not showing any significant flux variationsalong the integral monitoring, we build the average spectrum by combining allavailable data; in the case of variable fluxes, we use simultaneous integraland swift observations when available. otherwise we compared ibis and pds datato check the variability and combine bepposax with integral/ibis data. allspectra are well represented by a two component model consisting of adisk-blackbody and comptonised emission. the majority of these compact sourcesspend most of the time in a canonical low/hard state, with dominatingcomptonised component and accretion rate lower than ~10^{-9}msolar/yr, notdepending on the used model to fit the data.

0811.2318	the agn nature of three integral sources: igr j18249-3243, igr  j19443+2117 and igr j22292+6647	the third integral/ibis survey has revealed several new hard x-ray sources,which are still unclassified. to identify these sources, we need to find theircounterparts at other wavelengths and then study their nature. the capabilityof xrt on board swift to localize the sources with a positional accuracy of fewarcseconds allows the search for optical/uv, infrared and radio counterparts tobe more efficient and reliable. we analysed all xrt observations available forthree unidentified integral sources, igr j18249-3243, igr j19443+2117 and igrj22292+6647, localized their soft x-ray counterparts and searched forassociations with objects in the radio band. we also combined x-/gamma-raydata, as well as all the available radio, infrared and optical/uv information,in order to provide a broad-band spectral characterization of each source andinvestigate its nature. all three sources are found to be bright and repeatedlyobserved radio objects, although poorly studied. the x-/gamma-ray spectrum ofeach source is well described by power laws with photon indices typical of agn;only igr j19443+2117 may have absorption in excess of the galactic value, whileigr j22292+6647 is certainly variable at x-ray energies. igr j18249-3243 has acomplex radio morphology and a steep radio spectrum; the other two sources showflatter radio spectra and a more compact morphology. overall, their radio,optical/uv and infrared characteristics, as well as their x-/gamma-rayproperties, point to an agn classification for all three objects.

0811.4085	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  vii. identification of 20 galactic and extragalactic hard x-ray sources	within the framework of our program of assessment of the nature ofunidentified or poorly known integral sources, we present here spectroscopy ofoptical objects, selected through positional cross-correlation with soft x-raydetections (afforded with satellites such as swift, rosat, chandra and/orxmm-newton) as putative counterparts of hard x-ray sources detected with theibis instrument onboard integral. using 6 telescopes of various sizes andarchival data from two on-line spectroscopic surveys we are able to identify,either for the first time or independent of other groups, the nature of 20integral hard x-ray sources. our results indicate that: 11 of these objects areactive galactic nuclei (agns) at redshifts between 0.014 and 0.978, 7 of whichdisplay broad emission lines, 2 show narrow emission lines only, and 2 haveunremarkable or no emission lines (thus are likely compton thick agns); 5 arecataclysmic variables (cvs), 4 of which are (possibly magnetic) dwarf novae andone is a symbiotic star; and 4 are galactic x-ray binaries (3 with high-masscompanions and one with a low-mass secondary). it is thus again found that themajority of these sources are agns or magnetic cvs, confirming our previousfindings. when possible, the main physical parameters for these hard x-raysources are also computed using the multiwavelength information available inthe literature. these identifications support the importance of integral in thestudy of the hard x-ray spectrum of all classes of x-ray emitting objects, andthe effectiveness of a strategy of multi-catalogue cross-correlation plusoptical spectroscopy to securely pinpoint the actual nature of unidentifiedhard x-ray sources.
