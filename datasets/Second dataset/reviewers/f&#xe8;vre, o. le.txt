0909.1951	the zcosmos redshift survey: how group environment alters global  downsizing trends	we took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first ~10000galaxies of the zcosmos-bright survey and its group catalogue to study thecomplex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. theclassical indicator f_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simplebut powerful diagnostic tool. we studied its variation for different luminosityand mass selected galaxy samples. using rest-frame b-band selected samples, thegroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,but maintains a lower f_blue with respect both to the global and the isolatedgalaxy population. however moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparentthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the b-bandluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright bluegalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. byfocusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomesnegligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logmass &lt;= 10.6)does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function ofenvironment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. ourresults indicate that red galaxies of logmass &gt;= 10.8 are already in place at z~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possiblyoriginating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. in contrast, for lowergalaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence ingroups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from thetrend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, andmore so with cosmic time. these galaxies exhibit signatures of group-relatedsecular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0910.2705	the cosmos-wircam near-infrared imaging survey: i: bzk selected passive  and star forming galaxy candidates at z&gt;1.4	(abridged) we present a new near-infrared survey covering the 2 deg sq cosmosfield. combining our survey with subaru b and z images we construct a deep,wide-field optical-infrared catalogue. at ks&lt;23 (ab magnitudes) our surveycompleteness is greater than 90% and 70% for stars and galaxies respectivelyand contains 143,466 galaxies and 13,254 stars. at z~2 our catalogues contain3931 quiescent and 25,757 star-forming bzk-selected galaxies representing thelargest and most secure sample of these objects to date. our counts ofquiescent galaxies turns over at ks~22 an effect which we demonstrate cannot bedue to sample incompleteness. in our survey both the number of faint and brightquiescent objects exceeds the predictions of a semi-analytic galaxy formationmodel, indicating potentially the need for further refinements in the amount ofmerging and agn feedback at z~2 in these models. we measure the angularcorrelation function for each sample and find that at small scales thecorrelation function for passive bzk galaxies exceeds the clustering of darkmatter. we use 30-band photometric redshifts to derive the spatial correlationlength and the redshift distributions for each object class. at ks&lt;22 we findr_0^{\gamma/1.8}=7.0 +/-0.5h^{-1} mpc for the passive bzk candidates and4.7+/-0.8h^{-1} mpc for the star-forming bzk galaxies. our pbzk galaxies havean average photometric redshift of z_p~1.4, in approximate agreement with thelimited spectroscopic information currently available. the stacked ks imagewill be made publicly available from irsa.

0911.2252	the zcosmos-bright survey: the clustering of early and late galaxy  morphological types since z~1	we measure the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of theirmorphological type at z~0.8, for the first time in a deep redshift survey withfull morphological information. this is obtained by combining high-resolutionhst imaging and vlt spectroscopy for about 8,500 galaxies to i_ab=22.5 withaccurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos-bright redshift survey. atthis epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly strongerclustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. a comparison to thesdss at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early andlate morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at smallseparations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution sincez~0.8. this suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed inintermediate and dense environments at this epoch. our results are consistentwith a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphologicaltypes between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in themorphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-drivenevolution.

0911.3740	the vimos vlt deep survey: the group catalogue	[abridged] we present a homogeneous and complete catalogue of optical groupsidentified in the purely flux limited (17.5&lt;=i&lt;=24.0) vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). we use mock catalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, tocorrect for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution aswell as the individual properties of the identified systems. simulated samplesallow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can bepotentially found in a survey with vvds-like selection functions. we use themto correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxyredshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying massoverdensity. in particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adoptedgroup-finding technique (the voronoi-delaunay method, vdm). the goal is tofine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way theredshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the levelof completeness (c) and purity (p) of the group catalogue. we identify 318 vvdsgroups with at least 2 members within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1.0, among which 144 (/30) withat least 3 (/5) members. the sample has globally c=60% and p=50%. nearly 45% ofthe groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithmwith a parameter set which maximizes p (75%). we exploit the group sample tostudy the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (u-b&lt;=1)within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1. we find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in thewhole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. thesequantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginallysignificant steeper increase. we also confirm that, at any explored redshift,f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainterluminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

0912.4166	the x-ray to optical-uv luminosity ratio of x-ray selected type 1 agn in  xmm-cosmos	we present a study of the x-ray to optical properties of a sample of 545x-ray selected type 1 agn, from the xmm-cosmos survey, over a wide range ofredshifts ($0.04&lt;\z&lt;4.25$) and x-ray luminosities ($40.6 \leq \log \lhard \leq45.3$). about 60% of them are spectroscopically identified type 1 agn, whilethe others have a reliable photometric redshift and are classified as type 1agn on the basis of their multi-band spectral energy distributions. we discussthe relationship between uv and x-ray luminosity, as parameterized by the$\alphaox$ spectral slope, and its dependence on redshift and luminosity. wecompare our findings with previous investigations of optically selectedbroad-line agn (mostly from sdss). a highly significant correlation between$\alphaox$ and $\lo$ is found, in agreement with previous investigations ofoptically selected samples. we calculate bolometric corrections, $\kbol$, forthe whole sample using hard x-ray luminosities ($\lhard$), and the eddingtonratios for a subsample of 150 objects for which black hole mass estimates areavailable. we confirm the trend of increasing bolometric correction withincreasing eddington ratio as proposed in previous works. a tight correlationis found between $\alphaox$ and $\kbol$, which can be used to estimate accuratebolometric corrections using only optical and x-ray data. we find a significantcorrelation between $\alphaox$ and eddington ratio, in which $\alphaox$increases for increasing eddington ratios.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

0709.1950	the xmm-lss survey: the class 1 cluster sample over the initial 5 square  degrees and its cosmological modelling	we present a sample of 29 galaxy clusters from the xmm-lss survey over anarea of some 5deg2 out to a redshift of z=1.05. the sample clusters, whichrepresent about half of the x-ray clusters identified in the region, followwell defined x-ray selection criteria and are all spectroscopically confirmed.for all clusters, we provide x-ray luminosities and temperatures as well asmasses. the cluster distribution peaks around z=0.3 and t =1.5 kev, half of theobjects being groups with a temperature below 2 kev. our l-t(z) relation pointstoward self-similar evolution, but does not exclude other physically plausiblemodels. assuming that cluster scaling laws follow self-similar evolution, ournumber density estimates up to z=1 are compatible with the predictions of theconcordance cosmology and with the findings of previous rosat surveys. our wellmonitored selection function allowed us to demonstrate that the inclusion ofselection effects is essential for the correct determination of the evolutionof the l-t relation, which may explain the contradictory results from previousstudies. extensive simulations show that extending the survey area to 10deg2has the potential to exclude the non-evolution hypothesis, but that constraintson more refined icm models will probably be limited by the large intrinsicdispersion of the l-t relation. we further demonstrate that increasing thedispersion in the scaling laws increases the number of detectable clusters,hence generating further degeneracy [in addition to sigma8, omega_m, l(m,z) andt(m,z)] in the cosmological interpretation of the cluster number counts. weprovide useful empirical formulae for the cluster mass-flux and mass-count-raterelations as well as a comparison between the xmm-lss mass sensitivity and thatof forthcoming sz surveys.

0704.2545	the angular correlations of galaxies in the cosmos field	we present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation functionw(\theta) in the cosmos field. independent determinations of w(\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the hst acs catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from subaru and the cfht. despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. at brightmagnitudes (iab&lt;22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of kitzbichler and white from the millennium simulation. theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \theta &gt; 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. for fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median iab magnitude of 24. atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the canada-france legacy survey. this level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). the semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. we therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1201.1673	a journey from the outskirts to the cores of groups i: color- and  mass-segregation in 20k-zcosmos groups	using the group catalog obtained from zcosmos spectroscopic data and thecomplementary photometric data from the cosmos survey, we explore segregationeffects occurring in groups of galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts. webuilt two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.45) and high (0.45 &lt;z &lt;= 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxiesinto three samples according to their distance from the group center. weexplored how galaxy stellar masses and colors - working in narrow bins ofstellar masses - vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the groupcenter. we found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (log(m_gal/m_sun)&gt;= 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions ofred/blue objects. for galaxies of lower masses (9.8 &lt;= log(m_gal/m_sun) &lt;=10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and bluegalaxies. this dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groupsdo not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. interestingly, masssegregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups,while poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as afunction of radius. we suggest a simple scenario where color- andmass-segregation originate from different physical processes. while dynamicalfriction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, bothstarvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench starformation in groups at a faster rate than in the field. in poorer groups theenvironmental effects are caught in action superimposed to secular galaxyevolution. their member galaxies display increasing blue fractions when movingfrom the group center to more external regions, presumably reflecting therecent accretion history of these groups.

1208.5020	massiv: mass assembly survey with sinfoni in vvds. v. the major merger  rate of star-forming galaxies at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 from ifs-based close pairs	we aim to measure the major merger rate of star-forming galaxies at 0.9 &lt; z&lt;1.8, using close pairs identified from integral field spectroscopy (ifs). weuse the velocity field maps obtained with sinfoni/vlt on the massiv sample,selected from the star-forming population in the vvds. we identify physicalpairs of galaxies from the measurement of the relative velocity and theprojected separation (r_p) of the galaxies in the pair. using the wellconstrained selection function of the massiv sample we derive the gas-richmajor merger fraction (luminosity ratio mu = l_2/l_1 &gt;= 1/4), and, using mergertime scales from cosmological simulations, the gas-rich major merger rate at amean redshift up to z = 1.54. we find a high gas-rich major merger fraction of20.8+15.2-6.8 %, 20.1+8.0-5.1 % and 22.0+13.7-7.3 % for close pairs with r_p &lt;=20h^-1 kpc in redshift ranges z = [0.94, 1.06], [1.2, 1.5) and [1.5, 1.8),respectively. this translates into a gas-rich major merger rate of0.116+0.084-0.038 gyr^-1, 0.147+0.058-0.037 gyr^-1 and 0.127+0.079-0.042 gyr^-1at z = 1.03, 1.32 and 1.54, respectively. combining our results with previousstudies at z &lt; 1, the gas-rich major merger rate evolves as (1+z)^n, with n =3.95 +- 0.12, up to z = 1.5. from these results we infer that ~35% of thestar-forming galaxies with stellar masses m = 10^10 - 10^10.5 m_sun haveundergone a major merger since z ~ 1.5. we develop a simple model which showsthat, assuming that all gas-rich major mergers lead to early-type galaxies, thecombined effect of gas-rich and dry mergers is able to explain most of theevolution in the number density of massive early-type galaxies since z ~ 1.5,with our measured gas-rich merger rate accounting for about two-thirds of thisevolution.

1212.1356	mass assembly of high-z galaxies with massiv	massiv (mass assembly survey with sinfoni in vvds) is a sample of 84 distantstar-forming galaxies observed with the sinfoni integral field unit (ifu) onthe vlt. these galaxies are selected inside a redshift range of 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.9,i.e. where they are between 3 and 5 billion years old. the sample aims to probethe dynamical and chemical abundances properties of representative galaxies ofthis cosmological era. on the one hand, close environment study shows thatabout a third of the sample is involved in major mergers. on the other hand,kinematical analysis revealed that 42% of the sample is rotating disks, inaccordance with higher redshift samples. the remaining 58% show complexkinematics, suggesting a dynamical support based on dispersion, and about halfof these galaxies is involved in major mergers. spheroids, unrelaxed mergerremnants, or extremely turbulent disks might be an explanation for such abehavior. furthermore, the spatially resolved metallicity analysis revealspositive gradients, adding a piece to the puzzle of galaxies evolutionscenarios.

1310.2172	the wircam deep survey ii: mass selected clustering	we present an analysis of the clustering of galaxies from z ~ 2 to thepresent day using the wircam deep survey (wirds). wirds combines deepnear-infrared data with the deep optical data from the cfhtls deep fields,providing a photometric data-set over an effective area of 2.4 sq. deg., fromwhich accurate photometric redshifts and stellar masses can be estimated. weuse the data to calculate the angular correlation function for galaxy samplessplit by star-formation activity, stellar mass and redshift. we estimate thereal-space clustering for each sample, determining clustering lengths andpower-law slopes. for galaxies selected by constant mass, we find that theclustering scale shows no evolution up to z ~ 2. splitting the galaxy sample bymass, we see that higher mass galaxies have larger clustering scales at allredshifts. we use our results to test the galform semi-analytical galaxyformation model and find the two are consistent. we split the galaxy populationinto passive and star-forming populations and find that the passive galaxypopulation shows a significantly larger clustering scale at all redshifts thanthe star-forming population below masses of ~$10^{11}m_\odot/h$, showing thateven at z ~ 2 passive galaxies exist in denser environments than the bulk ofthe star-forming galaxy population. for star-forming galaxies with stellarmasses $&gt;10^{11}m_\odot/h$, we find a clustering strength of ~8mpc/h across allredshifts, comparable to the measurements for the passive population. also, forstar-forming galaxies we see that clustering strength increases for higherstellar mass systems, however there is little sign of a mass dependence inpassive galaxies. finally, we investigate the connection between galaxy stellarmass and dark matter halo mass, showing a clear correlation between the two inboth the wirds data and the galform predictions.

1310.3380	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): $\omega_{\rm  m_0}$ from the galaxy clustering ratio measured at $z \sim 1$	we use a sample of about 22,000 galaxies at $0.65&lt;z&lt;1.2$ from the viperspdr-1 catalogue, to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement ofthe galaxy {\it clustering ratio} $\eta_{g,r}$. this statistic has favourableproperties, being defined as the ratio of two quantities characterizing thesmoothed density field in spheres of given radius $r$: the value of itscorrelation function on a multiple of this scale, $\xi(nr)$, and its variance$\sigma^2(r)$. for sufficiently large values of $r$, this is a universalnumber, capturing 2-point clustering information independently of the linearbias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. inthis paper we discuss in detail how to extend the application of $\eta_{g,r}$to quasi-linear scales and how to control and remove observational selectioneffects which are typical of redshift surveys as vipers. we verify the accuracyand efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that match the surveyselection process. these results evidence the robustness of $\eta_{g,r}$ tonon-linearities and observational effects, which is related to its verydefinition as a ratio of quantities that are similarly affected.  we measure $\omega_{m,0}=0.270_{-0.025}^{+0.029}$. in addition to the greatprecision achieved on our estimation of $\omega_m$ using vipers pdr-1, thisresult is remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recentestimate $z\simeq 0.3$, obtained applying the same technique to the sdss-lrgcatalogue. it, therefore, suports the robustness of the present analysis.moreover, the combination of these two measurements at $z\sim 0.3$ and $z\sim0.9$ provides us with a very precise estimate $\omega_{m,0}=0.274\pm0.017$which highlights the great consistency between our estimation and othercosmological probes such as baos, cmb and supernovae.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

1502.02867	the galaxy-halo connection from a joint lensing, clustering and  abundance analysis in the cfhtlens/vipers field	we present new constraints on the relationship between galaxies and theirhost dark matter halos, measured from the location of the peak of thestellar-to-halo mass ratio (shmr), up to the most massive galaxy clusters atredshift $z\sim0.8$ and over a volume of nearly 0.1~gpc$^3$. we use a uniquecombination of deep observations in the cfhtlens/vipers field from the near-uvto the near-ir, supplemented by $\sim60\,000$ secure spectroscopic redshifts,analysing galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and the stellar massfunction. we interpret our measurements within the halo occupation distribution(hod) framework, separating the contributions from central and satellitegalaxies. we find that the shmr for the central galaxies peaks at $m_{\rm h,peak} = 1.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1}\times10^{12} m_{\odot}$ with an amplitude of $0.025$,which decreases to $\sim0.001$ for massive halos ($m_{\rm h} &gt; 10^{14}m_{\odot}$). compared to central galaxies only, the total shmr (includingsatellites) is boosted by a factor 10 in the high-mass regime (cluster-sizehalos), a result consistent with cluster analyses from the literature based onfully independent methods. after properly accounting for differences inmodelling, we have compared our results with a large number of results from theliterature up to $z=1$: we find good general agreement, independently of themethod used, within the typical stellar-mass systematic errors at low tointermediate mass (${m}_{\star} &lt; 10^{11} m_{\odot}$) and the statisticalerrors above. we have also compared our shmr results to semi-analyticsimulations and found that the shmr is tilted compared to our measurements insuch a way that they over- (under-) predict star formation efficiency incentral (satellite) galaxies.

1505.00442	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): on the correct  recovery of the count-in-cell probability distribution function	we compare three methods to measure the count-in-cell probability densityfunction of galaxies in a spectroscopic redshift survey. from this comparisonwe found that when the sampling is low (the average number of object per cellis around unity) it is necessary to use a parametric method to model the galaxydistribution. we used a set of mock catalogues of vipers, in order to verify ifwe were able to reconstruct the cell-count probability distribution once theobservational strategy is applied. we find that in the simulated catalogues,the probability distribution of galaxies is better represented by a gammaexpansion than a skewed log-normal. finally, we correct the cell-countprobability distribution function from the angular selection effect of thevimos instrument and study the redshift and absolute magnitude dependency ofthe underlying galaxy density function in vipers from redshift $0.5$ to $1.1$.we found very weak evolution of the probability density distribution functionand that it is well approximated, independently from the chosen tracers, by agamma distribution.
