0904.0007	prominence formation associated with an emerging helical flux rope	the formation and evolution process and magnetic configuration of solarprominences remain unclear. in order to study the formation process ofprominences, we examine continuous observations of a prominence in noaa ar10953 with the solar optical telescope on the \emph{hinode} satellite. asreported in our previous letter, we find a signature suggesting that a helicalflux rope emerges from below the photosphere under a pre-existing prominence.here we investigate more detailed properties and photospheric indications ofthe emerging helical flux rope, and discuss their relationship to the formationof the prominence. our main conclusions are: (1) a dark region with absence ofstrong vertical magnetic fields broadens and then narrows in ca \textsc{ii}h-line filtergrams. this phenomenon is consistent with the emergence of thehelical flux rope as photospheric counterparts. the size of the flux rope isroughly 30,000 km long and 10,000 km wide. the width is larger than that of theprominence. (2) no shear motion or converging flows are detected, but we finddiverging flows such as mesogranules along the polarity inversion line. thepresence of mesogranules may be related to the emergence of the helical fluxrope. (3) the emerging helical flux rope reconnects with magnetic fields of thepre-existing prominence to stabilize the prominence for the next several days.we thus conjecture that prominence coronal magnetic fields emerge in the formof helical flux ropes that contribute to the formation and maintenance of theprominence.

0706.3519	triggering mechanism for the filament eruption on 2005 september 13 in  active region noaa 10808	on 2005 september 13 a filament eruption accompanied by a halo cme occurredin the most flare-productive active region noaa 10808 in solar cycle 23. usingmulti-wavelength observations before the filament eruption on sep. 13th, weinvestigate the processes leading to the catastrophic eruption. we find thatthe filament slowly ascended at a speed of 0.1km/s over two days before theeruption. during slow ascending, many small flares were observed close to thefootpoints of the filament, where new magnetic elements were emerging. on thebasis of the observational facts we discuss the triggering mechanism leading tothe filament eruption. we suggest the process toward the eruption as follows:first, a series of small flares played a role in changing the topology of theloops overlying the filament. second, the small flares gradually changed theequilibrium state of the filament and caused the filament to ascend slowly overtwo days. finally, a c2.9 flare that occurred when the filament was close tothe critical point for loss of equilibrium directly led to the catastrophicfilament eruption right after itself.

1001.4307	nonlinear propagation of alfven waves driven by observed photospheric  motions: application to the coronal heating and spicule formation	we have performed mhd simulations of alfven wave propagation along an openflux tube in the solar atmosphere. in our numerical model, alfven waves aregenerated by the photospheric granular motion. as the wave generator, we used aderived temporal spectrum of the photospheric granular motion from g-bandmovies of hinode/sot. it is shown that the total energy flux at the coronabecomes larger and the transition region height becomes higher in the case whenwe use the observed spectrum rather than white/pink noise spectrum as the wavegenerator. this difference can be explained by the alfven wave resonancebetween the photosphere and the transition region. after performing fourieranalysis on our numerical results, we have found that the region between thephotosphere and the transition region becomes an alfven wave resonant cavity.we have confirmed that there are at least three resonant frequencies, 1, 3 and5 mhz, in our numerical model. alfven wave resonance is one of the mosteffective mechanisms to explain the dynamics of the spicules and the sufficientenergy flux to heat the corona.

1002.1360	generation of alfven waves by magnetic reconnection	in this paper, results of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulationsare reported for the magnetic reconnection of non-perfectly antiparallelmagnetic fields. the magnetic field has a component perpendicular to thecomputational plane, that is, guide field. the angle theta between magneticfield lines in two half regions is a key parameter in our simulations whereasthe initial distribution of the plasma is assumed to be simple; density andpressure are uniform except for the current sheet region. alfven waves aregenerated at the reconnection point and propagate along the reconnected fieldline. the energy fluxes of the alfven waves and magneto-acoustic waves (slowmode and fast mode) generated by the magnetic reconnection are measured. eachflux shows the similar time evolution independent of theta. the percentage ofthe energies (time integral of energy fluxes) carried by the alfven waves andmagneto-acoustic waves to the released magnetic energy are calculated. thealfven waves carry 38.9%, 36.0%, and 29.5% of the released magnetic energy atthe maximum (theta=80^\circ) in the case of beta=0.1, 1, and 20 respectively,where beta is the plasma beta (the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure).the magneto-acoustic waves carry 16.2% (theta=70^\circ), 25.9%(theta=60^\circ), and 75.0% (theta=180^\circ) of the energy at the maximum.implications of these results for solar coronal heating and acceleration ofhigh-speed solar wind are discussed.

1002.2143	observations of chromospheric anemone jets with hinode sot and hida ca  ii spectroheliogram	we present the first simultaneous observations of chromospheric "anemone"jets in solar active regions with hinode sot ca ii h broadband filetergram andca ii k spetroheliogram on the domeless solar telescope (dst) at hidaobservatory. during the coordinated observation, 9 chromospheric anemone jetswere simultaneously observed with the two instruments. these observationsrevealed three important features, i.e.: (1) the jets are generated in thelower chromosphere, (2) the length and lifetime of the jets are 0.4-5 mm and40-320 sec, (3) the apparent velocity of the jets with hinode sot are 3-24km/s, while ca ii k3 component at the jets show blueshifts (in 5 events) in therange of 2- 6 km/s. the chromospheric anemone jets are associated with mixedpolarity regions which are either small emerging flux regions or movingmagnetic features. it is found that the ca ii k line often show red or blueasymmetry in k2/k1 component: the footpoint of the jets associated withemerging flux regions often show redshift (2-16 km/s), while the one withmoving magnetic features show blueshift (around 5 km/s). detailed analysis ofmagnetic evolution of the jet foaming regions revealed that the reconnectionrate (or canceling rate) of the total magnetic flux at the footpoint of thejets are of order of 10^{16} mx/s, and the resulting magnetic energy releaserate (1.1-10) x 10^{24} erg/s, with the total energy release (1-13) x 10^{26}erg for the duration of the magnetic cancellations, 130s. these are comparableto the estimated total energy, 10^{26} erg, in a single chromospheric anemonejet. an observation-based physical model of the jet is presented. the relationbetween chromospheric anemone jets and ellerman bombs is discussed.

1002.2288	spicule dynamics over plage region	we studied spicular jets over a plage area and derived their dynamiccharacteristics using hinode solar optical telescope (sot) high-resolutionimages. the target plage region was near the west limb of the solar disk. thislocation permitted us to study the dynamics of spicular jets without theoverlapping effect of spicular structures along the line of sight.  in this work, to increase the ease with which we can identify spicules on thedisk, we applied the image processing method `madmax' developed by koutchmy etal. (1989). it enhances fine, slender structures (like jets), over a diffusebackground. we identified 169 spicules over the target plage. this samplepermits us to derive statistically reliable results regarding spiculardynamics.  the properties of plage spicules can be summarized as follows: (1) in a plagearea, we clearly identified spicular jet features. (2) they were shorter inlength than the quiet region limb spicules, and followed ballistic motion underconstant deceleration. (3) the majority (80%) of the plage spicules showed thecycle of rise and retreat, while 10% of them faded out without a completeretreat phase. (4) the deceleration of the spicule was proportional to thevelocity of ejection (i.e. the initial velocity).

1006.0307	mhd modeling for formation process of coronal mass ejections:  interaction between ejecting flux rope and ambient field	we performed magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a formation process of coronalmass ejections (cmes), focusing on interaction (reconnection) between anejecting flux rope and its ambient field. we examined three cases withdifferent ambient fields: no ambient field, and cases with dipole field of twoopposite directions which are parallel and anti-parallel to that of the fluxrope surface. as a result, while the flux rope disappears in the anti-parallelcase, in other cases the flux ropes can evolve to cmes and show differentamounts of rotation of the flux rope. the results imply that the interactionbetween an ejecting flux rope and its ambient field is an important process fordetermining cme formation and cme orientation, and also show that the amountand direction of magnetic flux within the flux rope and the ambient field arekey parameters for cme formation. especially, the interaction (reconnection)plays a significant role to the rotation of the flux rope, with a processsimilar to "tilting instability" in a spheromak-type experiment of laboratoryplasma.

1007.1909	evolution of the kippenhahn-schlueter prominence model magnetic field  under cowling resistivity	we present the results from 1.5d diffusion simulations of thekippenhahn-schlueter prominence model magnetic field evolution under theinfluence of the ambipolar terms of cowling resistivity. we show that initiallythe evolution is determined by the ratio of the horizontal and verticalmagnetic fields, which gives current sheet thinning (thickening) when thisratio is large (small) and a marginal case where a new characteristic currentsheet length scale is formed. after a timespan greater than the cowlingresistivity time, the current sheet thickens as a power law of $t$ independentof the ratio of the field strengths. these results imply that when cowlingresistivity is included in the model, the tearing instability time scale isreduced by more than one order of magnitude when the ratio of the horizontalfield to the vertical field is 20\% or less. these results imply that, over thecourse of its lifetime, the structure of the prominence can be significantlyaltered by cowling resistivity, and in some cases will allow the tearinginstability to occur.

1012.2551	fan-shaped jets in three dimensional reconnection simulation as a model  of ubiquitous solar jets	magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in space and astrophysicalplasmas in which oppositely directed magnetic fields changes its connectivityand eventually converts its energy into kinetic and thermal energy of theplasma. recently, ubiquitous jets (for example, chromospheric anemone jets,penumbral microjets, umbral light bridge jets) have been observed by solaroptical telescope on board the satellite hinode. these tiny and frequentlyoccurring jets are considered to be a possible evidence of small-scaleubiquitous reconnection in the solar atmosphere. however, the details of threedimensional magnetic configuration are still not very clear. here we propose anew model based on three dimensional simulations of magnetic reconnection usinga typical current sheet magnetic configuration with a strong guide field. themost interesting feature is that the jets produced by the reconnectioneventually move along the guide field lines. this model provides a freshunderstanding of newly discovered ubiquitous jets and moreover a newobservational basis for the theory of astrophysical magnetic reconnection.

1101.0978	dependence of the magnetic energy of solar active regions on the twist  intensity of the initial flux tubes	we present a series of numerical experiments that model the evolution ofmagnetic flux tubes with a different amount of initial twist. as a result ofcalculations, tightly twisted tubes reveal a rapid two-step emergence to theatmosphere with a slight slowdown at the surface, while weakly twisted tubesshow a slow two-step emergence waiting longer the secondary instability to betriggered. this picture of the two-step emergence is highly consistent withrecent observations. these tubes show multiple magnetic domes above thesurface, indicating that the secondary emergence is caused by interchange modeof magnetic buoyancy instability. as for the weakest twist case, the tubeexhibits an elongated photospheric structure and never rises into the corona.the formation of the photospheric structure is due to inward magnetic tensionforce of the azimuthal field component of the rising flux tube (i.e., tube'stwist). when the twist is weak, azimuthal field cannot hold the tube'scoherency, and the tube extends laterally at the subadiabatic surface. inaddition, we newly find that the total magnetic energy measured above thesurface depends on the initial twist. strong twist tubes follow the initialrelation between the twist and the magnetic energy, while weak twist tubesdeviates from this relation, because these tubes store their magnetic energy inthe photospheric structures.

1103.1939	special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of two-component  outflow powered by magnetic explosion on compact stars	the nonlinear dynamics of outflows driven by magnetic explosion on thesurface of a compact star is investigated through special relativisticmagnetohydrodynamic simulations. we adopt, as the initial equilibrium state, aspherical stellar object embedded in hydrostatic plasma which has a density$\rho(r) \propto r^{- \alpha}$ and is threaded by a dipole magnetic field. theinjection of magnetic energy at the surface of compact star breaks theequilibrium and triggers a two-component outflow. at the early evolutionarystage, the magnetic pressure increases rapidly around the stellar surface,initiating a magnetically driven outflow. a strong forward shock driven outflowis then excited. the expansion velocity of the magnetically driven outflow ischaracterized by the alfv\'en velocity on the stellar surface, and follows asimple scaling relation $v_{\rm mag} \propto {v_{\rm a}}^{1/2}$. when theinitial density profile declines steeply with radius, the strong shock isaccelerated self-similarly to relativistic velocity ahead of the magneticallydriven component. we find that it evolves according to a self-similar relation$\gamma_{\rm sh} \propto r_{\rm sh}$, where $\gamma_{\rm sh}$ is the lorentzfactor of the plasma measured at the shock surface $r_{\rm sh}$. purelyhydrodynamic process would be responsible for the acceleration mechanism of theshock driven outflow. our two-component outflow model, which is the naturaloutcome of the magnetic explosion, can provide a better understanding of themagnetic active phenomena on various magnetized compact stars.

(1) two footpoints separateeach other at a speed of 4.2 km/s during the initial phase of evolution anddecreases to about 1 km/s in 10 minutes later. (2) ca ii h filaments appearalmost simultaneously with the formation of dark lanes in stokes i in theobservational cadence of 2 minutes. (3) the lifetime of the dark lanes instokes i and g-band is 8 minutes, while that of ca filament is 12 minutes. aninteresting phenomena was observed that an emerging flux tube expands laterallyin the photosphere with a speed of 3.8 km/s. discussion on the horizontalexpansion of flux tube will be given with refernce to previous simulationstudies.

1106.2613	numerical simulations of the magnetic rayleigh-taylor instability in the  kippenhahn-schl\"{u}ter prominence model	the launch of the hinode satellite has allowed unprecedented high resolution,stable images of solar quiescent prominences to be taken over extended periodsof time.  these new images led to the discovery of dark upflows that propagated fromthe base of prominences developing highly turbulent profiles.  as yet, how these flows are driven is not fully understood.  to study the physics behind this phenomena we use 3-d magnetohydrodynamic(mhd) simulations to investigate the nonlinear stability of thekippenhahn-shl\"{u}ter prominence model to the magnetic rayleigh-taylorinstability.  the model simulates the rise of a buoyant tube inside a quiescent prominence,where the upper boundary between the tube and prominence model is perturbed toexcite the interchange of magnetic field lines.  we found upflows of constant velocity (maximum found 6\,km\,s$^{-1}$) and amaximum plume width $\approx 1500$\,km which propagate through a height ofapproximately 6\,mm in the no guide field case. the case with the strong guidefield (initially $b_y=2b_x$) results in a large plume that rises though theprominence model at $\sim 5$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ with width $\sim 900$\,km (resultingin width of 2400\,km when viewed along the axis of the prominence) reaching aheight of $\sim 3.1$\,mm. in both cases nonlinear processes were important fordetermining plume dynamics.

1204.5697	effect of interacting rarefaction waves on relativistically hot jets	the effect of rarefaction acceleration on the propagation dynamics andstructure of relativistically hot jets is studied through relativistichydrodynamic simulations. we emphasize the nonlinear interaction of rarefactionwaves excited at the interface between a cylindrical jet and the surroundingmedium. from simplified one-dimensional models with radial jet structure, wefind that a decrease in the relativistic pressure due to the interactingrarefaction waves in the central zone of the jet transiently yields a morepowerful boost of the bulk jet than that expected from single rarefactionacceleration. this leads to a cyclic in-situ energy conversion between thermaland bulk kinetic energies which induces radial oscillating motion of the jet.the oscillation timescale is characterized by the initial pressure ratio of thejet to the ambient medium, and follows a simple scaling relation $\tau_{\rmoscillation} \propto (p_{\rm jet,0}/p_{\rm amb,0})^{1/2}$. it is confirmed fromextended two-dimensional simulations that this radial oscillating motion in theone-dimensional system manifests as modulation of the structure of the jet in amore realistic situation where a relativistically hot jet propagates through anambient medium. it is found that when the ambient medium has a power lawpressure distribution, the size of the reconfinement region along thepropagation direction of the jet in the modulation structure $\lambda$ evolvesaccording to a self-similar relation $\lambda \propto t^{\alpha/2}$ where$\alpha$ is the power-law index of the pressure distribution.

1301.7325	numerical simulations of solar chromospheric jets associated with  emerging flux	we studied the acceleration mechanisms of chromospheric jets associated withemerging flux using a two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulation. wefound that slow mode shock waves generated by magnetic reconnection in thechromosphere and the photosphere play key roles in the acceleration mechanismsof chromospheric jets. an important parameter is the height of magneticreconnection. when magnetic reconnection takes place near the photosphere, thereconnection out- flow collides with the region where the plasma beta is muchlarger than unity. then the plasma moves along a magnetic field. this motiongenerates a slow mode wave. the slow mode wave develops to a strong slow shockas it propagates upward. when the slow shock crosses the transition region, thetransition region is lifted up. as a result, we obtain a chromospheric jet asthe lifted transition region. when magnetic reconnection takes place in theupper chromosphere, the chromospheric plasma is accelerated due to thecombination of the lorentz force and the whip-like motion of magnetic field. wefound that the chromospheric plasma is further accelerated through theinteraction between the transition region (steep density gradient) and a slowshock emanating from the reconnection point. this is an mhd effect which hasnot been discussed before.

1304.7361	superflares on solar-type stars observed with kepler ii. photometric  variability of superflare-generating stars : a signature of stellar rotation  and starspots	we performed simple spot-model calculations for quasi-periodic brightnessvariations of solar-type stars showing superflares, by using kepler photometricdata. most of superflare stars show quasi-periodic brightness modulations withthe typical period of one to a few tens of days. our results indicate thatthese brightness variations of superflare stars can be explained by therotation of the star with fairly large starspots. using the result of theperiod analysis, we investigated the relation between the energy and frequencyof superflares and the rotation period. stars with relatively slower rotationrates can still produce flares that are as energetic as those of more rapidlyrotating stars, although the average flare frequency is lower for more slowlyrotating stars. we found that the energy of superflares are related to thetotal coverage of starspots. the correlation between the spot coverage and theflare energy in superflares is similar to that in solar flares. these resultssuggest that the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energystored around starspots.

(2) theseabutting regions contained vertically-weak, but horizontally-strong magneticfields. (3) the orientations of the horizontal magnetic fields along the pil onthe photosphere gradually changed with time from a normal-polarityconfiguration to a inverse-polarity one. (4) the horizontal-magnetic fieldregion was blueshifted. these indicate that helical flux rope was emerging frombelow the photosphere into the corona along the pil under the pre-existingprominence. we suggest that this supply of a helical magnetic flux into thecorona is associated with evolution and maintenance of active-regionprominences.

1307.4929	high dispersion spectroscopy of the superflare star kic6934317	we conducted the high-resolution spectroscopic observation with subaru/hdsfor a g-type star (kic6934317). we selected this star from the data of thekepler spacecraft. this star produces a lot of superflares, and the totalenergy of the largest superflare on this star is ~10^3 times larger (~2.2*10^35erg) than that of the most energetic flare on the sun (~10^32 erg). the coredepth and emission flux of ca ii infrared triplet lines and ha line show highchromospheric activity in this star, in spite of its low lithium abundance andthe small amplitude of the rotational modulation. using the empirical relationsbetween emission flux of chromospheric lines and x-ray flux, this star isconsidered to show much higher coronal activity than that of the sun. itprobably has large starspots which can store a large amount of magnetic energyenough to give rise to superflares. we also estimated the stellar parameters,such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, projectedrotational velocity (v sin_i), and radial velocity. kic6934317 is thenconfirmed to be an early g-type main sequence star. the value of v sin_i isestimated to be ~1.91 km s^-1. in contrast, the rotational velocity iscalculated to be ~20 km s^-1 by using the period of the brightness variation asthe rotation period. this difference can be explained by its small inclinationangle (nearly pole-on). the small inclination angle is also supported by thecontrast between the large superflare amplitude and the small stellarbrightness variation amplitude. the lithium abundance and isochrones impliesthat the age of this star is more than about a few gyr, though a problem whythis star with such an age has a strong activity remains unsolved.

1307.6098	diffraction, refraction, and reflection of an extreme-ultraviolet wave  observed during its interactions with remote active regions	we present observations of the diffraction, refraction, and reflection of aglobal extreme-ultraviolet (euv) wave propagating in the solar corona. theseintriguing phenomena are observed when the wave interacts with two remoteactive regions, and they together exhibit the wave property of this euv wave.when the wave approached ar11465, it became weaker and finally disappeared inthe active region, but a few minutes latter a new wavefront appeared behind theactive region, and it was not concentric with the incoming wave. in addition, areflected wave was also observed simultaneously on the wave incoming side. whenthe wave approached ar11459, it transmitted through the active region directlyand without reflection. the formation of the new wavefront and the transmissioncould be explained with diffraction and refraction effects, respectively. wepropose that the different behaviors observed during the interactions maycaused by different speed gradients at the boundaries of the two activeregions. for the origin of the euv wave, we find that it formed ahead of agroup of expanding loops a few minutes after the start of the loops' expansion,which represents the initiation of the associated coronal mass ejection (cme).based on these results, we conclude that the euv wave should be a nonlinearmagnetosonic wave or shock driven by the associated cme, which propagatedfaster than the ambient fast-mode speed and gradually slowed down to anordinary linear wave. our observations support the hybrid model that includesboth fast wave and slow non-wave components.

(2012), we searched forsuperflares on g-type dwarfs (solar type stars) using kepler data for a longerperiod (500 days) than that (120 days) in our previous study. as a result, wefound 1547 superflares on 279 g-type dwarfs, which are much more than previous365 superflares on 148 stars. using these new data, we studied the statisticalproperties of occurrence frequency of superflares, and basically confirmed theprevious results, i.e., the occurrence frequency (dn/de) of superflares vsflare energy (e) shows power-law distribution with dn/de \propto e^{-\alpha},where \alpha ~ 2. it is interesting that this distribution is roughly on thesame line as that for solar flares. in the case of the sun-like stars (withsurface temperature 5600-6000k and slowly rotating with a period longer than 10days), the occurrence frequency of superflares with energy of 10^34 -10^35 ergis once in 800-5000 years.  we also studied long term (500 days) stellar brightness variation of thesesuperflare stars, and found that in some g-type dwarfs the occurrence frequencyof superflares was extremely high, ~ 57 superflares in 500 days (i.e., once in10 days). in the case of sun-like stars, the most active stars show thefrequency of one superflares (with 10^34 erg) in 100 days. there is evidencethat these superflares have extremely large starspots with a size about 10times larger than that of the largest sunspot. we argue that the physicalorigin of extremely high occurrence frequency of superflares in these stars maybe attributed to the existence of extremely large starspots.

1402.3772	two sun-like superflare stars rotating as slow as the sun	we report on the results of high dispersion spectroscopy of two `superflarestars', kic 9766237, and kic 9944137 with subaru/hds. superflare stars areg-type main sequence stars, but show gigantic flares compared to the sun, whichhave been recently discovered in the data obtained with the kepler spacecraft.though most of these stars are thought to have a rotation period shorter than10 days on the basis of photometric variabilities, the two targets of thepresent paper are estimated to have a rotation period of 21.8 d, and 25.3 d.our spectroscopic results clarified that these stars have stellar parameterssimilar to those of the sun in terms of the effective temperature, surfacegravity, and metallicity. the projected rotational velocities derived by us areconsistent with the photometric rotation period, indicating a fairy highinclination angle. the average strength of the magnetic field on the surface ofthese stars are estimated to be 1-20 g, by using the absorption line of ca ii8542. we could not detect any hint of binarity in our spectra, although moredata are needed to firmly rule out the presence of an unseen low-masscompanion. these results claim that the spectroscopic properties of thesesuperflare stars are very close to those of the sun, and support the hypothesisthat the sun might cause a superflare.

1403.7705	a chain of winking (oscillating) filaments triggered by an invisible  extreme-ultraviolet wave	winking (oscillating) filaments have been observed for many years. however,observations of successive winking filaments in one event have not beenreported yet. in this paper, we present the observations of a chain of winkingfilaments and a subsequent jet that are observed right after the x2.1 are inar11283. the event also produced an extreme-ultraviolet (euv) wave that has twocomponents: upward dome-like wave (850 km/s) and lateral surface wave (554km/s) which was very weak (or invisible) in imaging observations. by analyzingthe temporal and spatial relationships between the oscillating filaments andthe euv waves, we propose that all the winking filaments and the jet weretriggered by the weak (or invisible) lateral surface euv wave. the oscillationof the filaments last for two or three cycles, and their periods, dopplervelocity amplitudes, and damping times are 11 - 22 minutes, 6 - 14 km/s, and 25- 60 minutes, respectively. we further estimate the radial component magneticfield and the maximum kinetic energy of the filaments, and they are 5 - 10gauss and ~ 10^19 j, respectively. the estimated maximum kinetic energy iscomparable to the minimum energy of ordinary euv waves, suggesting that euvwaves can efficiently launch filament oscillations on their path. based on ouranalysis results, we conclude that the euv wave is a good agent for triggeringand connecting successive but separated solar activities in the solaratmosphere, and it is also important for producing solar sympathetic eruptions.

1405.1453	superflare occurrence and energies on g-, k- and m-type dwarfs	kepler data from g-, k- and m-type stars are used to study conditions thatlead to superflares with energies above $10^{34} {\rm erg}$. from the 117,661stars included, 380 show superflares with a total of 1690 such events. we studywhether parameters, like effective temperature or the rotation rate, have anyeffect on the superflare occurrence rate or energy. with increasing effectivetemperature we observe a decrease in the superflare rate, which is analogous tothe previous findings of a decrease in dynamo activity with increasingeffective temperature. for slowly rotating stars, we find a quadratic increaseof the mean occurrence rate with the rotation rate up to a critical point,after which the rate decreases linearly. motivated by standard dynamo theory,we study the behavior of the relative starspot coverage, approximated as therelative brightness variation. for faster rotating stars, an increased fractionof stars shows higher spot coverage, which leads to higher superflare rates. aturbulent dynamo is used to study the dependence of the ohmic dissipation as aproxy of the flare energy on the differential rotation or shear rate. theresulting statistics of the dissipation energy as a function of dynamo numberis similar to the observed flare statistics as a function of the inverse rossbynumber and shows similarly strong fluctuations. this supports the idea thatsuperflares might well be possible for solar-type g stars.

0803.3818	solar-type magnetic reconnection model for magnetar giant flare	we present a theoretical model describing magnetar giant flares on the basisof solar flare/coronal mass ejection theory. in our model, a preflare activityplays a crucial role in driving evaporating flows and supplying baryonicmatters into the magnetosphere. the loaded baryonic matter, that is called"prominence", is then gradually uplifted via crustal cracking with maintaininga quasi-force-free equilibrium of the magnetosphere. finally the prominence iserupted by the magnetic pressure force due to the loss of equilibrium triggeredby the explosive magnetic reconnection. the giant flare should be induced as afinal outcome of the prominence eruption accompanied by large-scale fieldreconfigurations. an essential difference between solar and magnetar flares isthe control process of their evolutionary dynamics. the flaring activity onmagnetars is mainly controlled by the radiative process unlike the solar flaregoverned by the electron conduction. it is highly suggestive that our model isaccountable for the physical properties of the extraordinary giant flareobserved on 2004 december 27 from sgr1806-20, including the source of baryonicmatters loaded in the expanding ejecta observed after the giant burst.

1412.8243	high dispersion spectroscopy of solar-type superflare stars. i.  temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and $v \sin i$	we conducted high dispersion spectroscopic observations of 50 superflarestars with subaru/hds, and measured the stellar parameters of them. these 50targets were selected from the solar-type (g-type main sequence) superflarestars that we had discovered from the kepler photometric data. as a result ofthese spectroscopic observations, we found that more than half (34 stars) ofour 50 targets have no evidence of binary system. we then estimated effectivetemperature ($t_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log g$), metallicity ([fe/h]),and projected rotational velocity ($v\sin i$) of these 34 superflare stars onthe basis of our spectroscopic data. the accuracy of our estimations is higherthan that of kepler input catalog (kic) values, and the differences between ourvalues and kic values ($(\delta t_{\rm{eff}})_{\rm{rms}} \sim 219$k, $(\delta\log g)_{\rm{rms}} \sim 0.37$ dex, and $(\delta\rm{[fe/h]})_{\rm{rms}} \sim0.46$ dex) are comparable to the large uncertainties and systematic differencesof kic values reported by the previous researches. we confirmed that theestimated $t_{\rm{eff}}$ and $\log g$ values of the 34 superflare stars areroughly in the range of solar-type stars. in particular, these parameters andthe brightness variation period ($p_{0}$) of 9 stars are in the range of"sun-like" stars ($5600\leq t_{\rm{eff}}\leq 6000$k, $\log g\geq$4.0, and$p_{0}&gt;$10 days). five of the 34 target stars are fast rotators ($v \sin i \geq10$km s$^{-1}$), while 22 stars have relatively low $v \sin i$ values ($v \sini&lt;5$km s$^{-1}$). these results suggest that stars whose spectroscopicproperties similar to the sun can have superflares, and this supports thehypothesis that the sun might cause a superflare.

1412.8245	high dispersion spectroscopy of solar-type superflare stars. ii. stellar  rotation, starspots, and chromospheric activities	we conducted high dispersion spectroscopic observations of 50 superflarestars with subaru/hds. these 50 stars were selected from the solar-typesuperflare stars that we had discovered from the kepler data. more than half(34 stars) of these 50 target superflare stars show no evidence of binarity,and we estimated stellar parameters of these 34 stars in our previous study(notsu et al. 2015, hereafter called paper i). according to our previousstudies using kepler data, superflare stars show quasi-periodic brightnessvariations whose amplitude (0.1-10\%) is much larger than that of the solarbrightness variations (0.01-0.1\%) caused by the existence of sunspots on therotating solar surface. in this study, we investigated whether thesequasi-periodic brightness variations of superflare stars are explained by therotation of a star with fairly large starspots, by using stellar parametersderived in paper i. first, we confirmed that the value of the projectedrotational velocity $v \sin i$ is consistent with the rotational velocityestimated from the period of the brightness variation. next, we measured theintensity of ca ii infrared triplet lines and h$\alpha$ line, good indicatorsof the stellar chromospheric activity, and compared them with other stellarproperties. the intensity of ca ii infrared triplet lines indicates that themean magnetic field strength ($\langle fb\rangle$) of the target superflarestars can be higher than that of the sun. a correlation between the amplitudeof the brightness variation and the intensity of ca ii triplet line was found.all the targets expected to have large starspots because of their largeamplitude of the brightness variation show high chromospheric activitiescompared to the sun. these results support that the brightness variation ofsuperflare stars is due to the rotation with large starspots.

1501.01592	prominence activation by coronal fast mode shock	an x5.4 class flare occurred in active region (ar) noaa11429 on 2012 march 7.the flare was associated with very fast coronal mass ejection (cme) with itsvelocity of over 2500 km/s. in the images taken with stereo-b/cor1, a dome-likedisturbance was seen to detach from expanding cme bubble and propagatedfurther. a type-ii radio burst was also observed at the same time. on the otherhand, in euv images obtained by sdo/aia, expanding dome-like structure and itsfoot print propagating to the north were observed. the foot print propagatedwith its average speed of about 670 km/s and hit a prominence located at thenorth pole and activated it. while the activation, the prominence was stronglybrightened. on the basis of some observational evidence, we concluded that thefoot print in aia images and the ones in cor1 images are the same, that is mhdfast mode shock front. with the help of a linear theory, the fast mode machnumber of the coronal shock is estimated to be between 1.11 and 1.29 using theinitial velocity of the activated prominence. also, the plasma compressionratio of the shock is enhanced to be between 1.18 and 2.11 in the prominencematerial, which we consider to be the reason of the strong brightening of theactivated prominence. the applicability of linear theory to the shock problemis tested with nonlinear mhd simulation.

1504.00074	statistical properties of superflares on solar-type stars based on 1-min  cadence data	we searched for superflares on solar-type stars using kepler data with 1 minsampling in order to detect superflares with short duration. we found 187superflares on 23 solar-type stars whose bolometric energy ranges from theorder of $10^{32}$ erg to $10^{36}$ erg. some superflares show multiple peakswith the peak separation of the order of $100$-$1000$ seconds which iscomparable to the periods of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellarflares. using these new data combined with the results from the data with 30min sampling, we found the occurrence frequency ($dn/de$) of superflares as afunction of flare energy ($e$) shows the power-law distribution ($dn/de \proptoe^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha \sim -1.5$ for $10^{33}&lt;e&lt;10^{36}$ erg which isconsistent with the previous results. the average occurrence rate ofsuperflares with the energy of $10^{33}$ erg which is equivalent to x100 solarflares is about once in 500-600 years. the upper limit of energy released bysuperflares is basically comparable to a fraction of the magnetic energy storednear starspots which is estimated from the photometry. we also found that theduration of superflares ($\tau$) increases with the flare energy ($e$) as $\tau\propto e^{0.39\pm 0.03}$. this can be explained if we assume the time-scale offlares is determined by the alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n time.

1504.05677	a theoretical model of pinching current sheet in low-beta plasmas	magnetic reconnection is an important physical process in various explosivephenomena in the universe. in the previous studies, it was found that fast re-connection takes place when the thickness of a current sheet becomes on theorder of a microscopic length such as the ion larmor radius or the ion inertiallength. in this study, we investigated the pinching process of a current sheetby the lorentz force in a low-{\beta} plasma using one-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynam- ics (mhd) simulations. it is known that there is an exactself-similar solution for this problem that neglects gas pressure. we comparedthe non-linear mhd dynamics with the analytic self-similar solution. from themhd simulations, we found that with the gas pressure included the implosionprocess deviates from the analytic self-similar solution as t {\rightarrow} t0, where t 0 is the explosion time when the thickness of a current sheet of theanalytic solution becomes 0. we also found a pair of mhd fast-mode shocks aregenerated and propagate after the formation of the pinched current sheet as t{\rightarrow} t 0 . on the basis of the rankine-hugoniot relations, we derivedthe scaling law of the physical quantities with respect to the initial plasmabeta in the pinched current sheet. our study could help us to estimate thephysical quantities in the pinched current sheet formed in a low-\b{eta}plasma.

1504.05700	magnetohydrodynamic shocks in and above post-flare loops:  two-dimensional simulation and a simplified model	solar flares are an explosive phenomenon, where super-sonic flows and shocksare expected in and above the post-flare loops. to understand the dynamics ofpost-flare loops, a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (2d mhd) simulation ofa solar flare has been carried out. we found new shock structures in and abovethe post-flare loops, which were not resolved in the previous work by yokoyamaand shibata 2001. to study the dynamics of flows along the reconnected magneticfield, kinematics and energetics of the plasma are investigated along selectedfield lines. it is found that shocks are crucial to determine the thermal andflow structures in the post-flare loops. on the basis of the 2d mhd simulation,we have developed a new post-flare loop model which we call the pseudo-2d mhdmodel. the model is based on the 1d mhd equations, where all the variablesdepend on one space dimension and all the three components of the magnetic andvelocity fields are considered. our pseudo-2d model includes many features ofthe multi-dimensional mhd processes related to magnetic reconnection(particularly mhd shocks), which the previous 1d hydrodynamic models are notable to include. we compare the shock formation and energetics of a specificfield line in the 2d calculation with those in our pseudo-2d mhd model, and wefound that they give similar results. this model will allow us to study theevolution of the post-flare loops in a wide parameter space without expensivecomputational cost and without neglecting important physics associated withmagnetic reconnection.

0805.4474	characteristics of anemone active regions appearing in coronal holes  observed with {\it yohkoh} soft x-ray telescope	coronal structure of active regions appearing in coronal holes is studied byusing the data obtained with the soft x-ray telescope (sxt) aboard {\it yohkoh}from 1991 november to 1993 march. the following characteristics are found; manyof active regions appearing in coronal holes show a structure that looks like a``sea-anemone''. such active regions are called {\it anemone ars}. aboutone-forth of all active regions that were observed with sxt from their birthsshowed the anemone structure. for almost all the anemone ars, the order ofmagnetic polarities is consistent with the hale-nicholson's polarity law. theseanemone ars also showed more or less east-west asymmetry in x-ray intensitydistribution, such that the following (eastern) part of the ars is brighterthan its preceding (western) part. this, as well as the anemone shape itself,is consistent with the magnetic polarity distribution around the anemone ars.these observations also suggest that an active region appearing in coronalholes has simpler (less sheared) and more preceding-spot-dominant magneticstructure than those appearing in other regions.

astro-ph;0009088	two-dimensional mhd numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection  triggered by a supernova shock in interstellar medium, generation of x-ray  gas in galaxy	we examine the magnetic reconnection triggered by a supernova (or a pointexplosion) in interstellar medium, by performing two-dimensional resistivemagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) numerical simulations with high spatial resolution.we found that the magnetic reconnection starts long after a supernova shock(fast-mode mhd shock) passes a current sheet. the current sheet evolves asfollows: (i) tearing-mode instability is excited by the supernova shock, andthe current sheet becomes thin in its nonlinear stage. (ii) the current-sheetthinning is saturated when the current-sheet thickness becomes comparable tothat of sweet-parker current sheet. after that, sweet-parker type reconnectionstarts, and the current-sheet length increases. (iii) ``secondary tearing-modeinstability'' occurs in the thin sweet-parker current sheet. (iv) as a result,further current-sheet thinning occurs and anomalous resistivity sets in,because gas density decreases in the current sheet. petschek type reconnectionstarts and heats interstellar gas. magnetic energy is released quickly whilemagnetic islands are moving in the current sheet during petschek typereconnection. the released magnetic energy is determined by the interstellarmagnetic field strength, not energy of initial explosion nor distance toexplosion. we suggest that magnetic reconnection is a possible mechanism togenerate x-ray gas in galaxy.

astro-ph;0101008	plasmoid-induced-reconnection and fractal reconnection	as a key to undertanding the basic mechanism for fast reconnection in solarflares, plasmoid-induced-reconnection and fractal reconnection are proposed andexamined. we first briefly summarize recent solar observations that give ushints on the role of plasmoid (flux rope) ejections in flare energy release. wethen discuss the plasmoid-induced-reconnection model, which is an extention ofthe classical two-ribbon-flare model which we refer to as the cshkp model. anessential ingredient of the new model is the formation and ejection of aplasmoid which play an essential role in the storage of magnetic energy (byinhibiting reconnection) and the induction of a strong inflow into reconnectionregion. using a simple analytical model, we show that the plasmoid ejection andacceleration are closely coupled with the reconnection process, leading to anonlinear instability for the whole dynamics that determines the macroscopicreconnection rate uniquely. next we show that the current sheet tends to have afractal structure via the following process path: tearing, sheet thinning,sweet- parker sheet, secondary tearing, further sheet thinning... theseprocesses occur repeatedly at smaller scales until a microscopic plasma scale(either the ion larmor radius or the ion inertial length) is reached whereanomalous resistivity or collisionless reconnection can occur. the currentsheet eventually has a fractal structure with many plasmoids (magnetic islands)of different sizes. when these plasmoids are ejected out of the current sheets,fast reconnection occurs at various different scales in a highly time dependentmanner. finally, a scenario is presented for fast reconnection in the solarcorona on the basis of above plasmoid-induced-reconnection in a fractal currentsheet.

astro-ph;0206016	a hr-like diagram for solar/stellar flares and corona -- emission  measure vs temperature diagram	in our previous paper, we have presented a theory to explain the observeduniversal correlation between the emission measure ($em=n^2 v$) and temperature(t) for solar/stellar flares on the basis of the magnetic reconnection modelwith heat conduction and chromospheric evaporation. here n is the electrondensity and v is the volume. by extending our theory to general situations, weexamined the em-t diagram in detail, and found the following properties: 1) theuniversal correlation sequence (``main sequence flares'') with $em \proptot^{17/2}$ corresponds to the case of constant heating flux or equivalently thecase of constant magnetic field strength in the reconnection model. 2) the em-tdiagram has a forbidden region, where gas pressure of flares exceeds magneticpressure. 3) there is a coronal branch with $em \propto t^{15/2}$ for $t&lt; 10^7$k, and $em \propto t^{13/2}$ for $t&gt; 10^7$ k. this branch is situated left sideof the main sequence flares in the em-t diagram. 4) there is another forbiddenregion determined by the length of flare loop; a lower limit of flare loop is$10^7$ cm. small flares near this limit correspond to nanoflares observed bysoho/eit. 5) we can plot flare evolution track on the em-t diagram. a flareevolves from the coronal branch to main sequence flares, then returns to thecoronal branch eventually. these properties of the em-t diagram are similar tothose of the hr diagram for stars, and thus we propose that the em-t diagram isquite useful to estimate the physical quantities (loop length, heating flux,magnetic field strength, total energy and so on) of flares and corona whenthere is no spatially resolved imaging observations.

astro-ph;0307306	magnetohydrodynamical accretion flows: formation of magnetic tower jet  and subsequent quasi-steady state	we present three-dimensional (3-d) magnetohydrodynamical (mhd) simulations ofradiatively inefficient accretion flow around black holes. general relativisticeffects are simulated by using the pseudo-newtonian potential. we startcalculations with a rotating torus threaded by localized poloidal magneticfields with plasma beta, a ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure,$\beta =10$ and 100. when the bulk of torus material reaches the innermostregion close to a central black hole, a magnetically driven jet emerges. thismagnetic jet is derived by vertically inflating toroidal fields (`magnetictower') and has a two-component structure: low-$\beta$ ($\lsim 1$) plasmasthreaded with poloidal (vertical) fields are surrounded by that with toroidalfields. the collimation width of the jet depends on external pressure, pressureof ambient medium; the weaker the external pressure is, the wider and thelonger-lasting becomes the jet. unless the external pressure is negligible, thebipolar jet phase ceases after several dynamical timescales at the originaltorus position and a subsequent quasi-steady state starts. the black hole issurrounded by quasi-spherical zone with highly inhomogeneous structure in whichtoroidal fields are dominant except near the rotation axis. mass accretiontakes place mainly along the equatorial plane. comparisons with other mhdsimulation results and observational implications are discussed.

astro-ph;0310017	general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars	we have performed 2.5-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic(mhd) simulations of the gravitational collapse of a magnetized rotatingmassive star as a model of gamma ray bursts (grbs). the current calculationfocuses on general relativistic mhd with simplified microphysics (we ignoreneutrino cooling, physical equation of state, and photodisintegration).initially, we assume that the core collapse has failed in this star. a few$m_{\odot}$ black hole is inserted by hand into the calculation. thesimulations presented in the paper follow the accretion of gas into a blackhole that is assumed to have formed before the calculation begins.thesimulation results show the formation of a disk-like structure and thegeneration of a jetlike outflow inside the shock wave launched at the corebounce. we have found that the jet is accelerated by the magnetic pressure andthe centrifugal force and is collimated by the pinching force of the toroidalmagnetic field amplified by the rotation and the effect of geometry of thepoloidal magnetic field. the maximum velocity of the jet is mildly relativistic(0.3c). the velocity of the jet becomes larger as the initial rotationalvelocity of stellar matter gets faster. on the other hand, the dependence onthe initial magnetic field strength is a bit more complicated: the velocity ofthe jet increases with the initial field strength in the weak field regime,then is saturated at some intermediate field strength, and decreases beyond thecritical field strength. these results are related to the stored magneticenergy determined by the balance between the propagation time of the alfvenwave and the rotation time of the disk (or twisting time).

astro-ph;0401352	the log-normal distributions of physical quantities of flare associated  coronal mass ejections (cmes), and flare/cme model of gamma-ray bursts	we investigated the statistical distributions of physical quantities of solarflares and associated coronal mass ejections (cmes). we found that thedistributions of the x-ray peak fluxes of cme-related flares, their timeintervals, and speeds of associated cmes are in good agreement with log-normaldistributions. one possible interpretation of this is that only large energeticmass ejections can escape from the solar corona, which become cmes in theinterplanetary space. this ``filtering effect'' may be the reason whystatistical distributions of some physical quantities are similar to log-normaldistribution. it is known that the distributions of several physical quantitiesof gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are also log-normal distributions, and that the timevariations of gamma-ray intensity in grbs are very similar to those of hardx-rays of solar flares. on the basis of these similarities and physicalconsideration of magnetohydrodynamic properties of an accretion disk around ablack hole, which is supposed to be situated in the central engine of a grb, wepropose a new model of the central engine of grbs, the {\it flare/cme model},in which grbs are formed by nonsteady jets consisting of intermittent ejectionsof mass (like solar cmes) associated with reconnection events (like solarflares) in the accretion disk corona. such nonsteady mhd jets would producemany shocks as well as local reconnection events far from the central engine.in this model, only large energetic mass ejections can escape from theaccretion disk corona, so that statistical distributions of some physicalquantities are similar to log-normal distributions.

astro-ph;0404152	general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars:  rotating black hole cases	we have performed 2.5-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic(mhd) simulations of collapsars including a rotating black hole. this paper isan extension of our previous paper (mizuno et al. 2004). the currentcalculation focuses on the effect of black hole rotation using generalrelativistic mhd with simplified microphysics. initially, we assume that thecore collapse is failed in this star. a few solar mass rotating black hole isinserted by hand into the calculation. we consider two cases, the co-rotatingcase and counter-rotating case with respect to the black hole rotation.although the counter-rotating case may be unrealistic for collapsar, we performas a maximally dragging case of magnetic field. the simulation results show theformation of a disk-like structure and the generation of a jet-like outflownear the central black hole. the jet-like outflow propagates outwardly with thetwisted magnetic field and becomes collimated. we have found that the jets aregenerated and accelerated mainly by the magnetic field. the total jet velocityin the rotating black hole case is comparable to that of the non-rotating blackhole case (mizuno et al. 2004), 0.3c. when the rotation of the black hole isfaster, the magnetic field is twisted strongly owing to the frame-draggingeffect. the magnetic energy stored by the twisting magnetic field is convertedto kinetic energy of the jet directly rather than propagating as an alfvenwave. thus, as the rotation of the black hole becomes faster, the poloidalvelocity of the jet becomes faster. in the rapidly rotating black hole case thejet-like outflow can be produced by the frame dragging effect only through thetwisting of magnetic field even if there is no stellar rotation.

(2002), the non-dimensionalreconnection rate vin/va has been determined for the impulsive phase of threetwo-ribbon flares, where vin is the velocity of the reconnection inflow and vais the alfven velocity. the non-dimensional reconnection rate is important tomake a constraint on the theoretical models of magnetic reconnection. in orderto reduce the uncertainty of the reconnection rate, it is important todetermine the energy release rate of the flares from observational data asaccurately as possible. to this end, we have carried out one dimensionalhydrodynamic simulations of a flare loop and synthesized the count ratedetected by the soft x-ray telescope (sxt) aboard yohkoh satellite. we foundthat the time derivative of the thermal energy contents in a flare arcadederived from sxt data is smaller than the real energy release rate by a factorof 0.3 - 0.8, depending on the loop length and the energy release rate. theresult of simulation is presented in the paper and used to calculate thereconnection rate. we found that reconnection rate is 0.047 for the x2.3 flareon 2000 november 24, 0.015 for the m3.7 flare on 2000 july 14, and 0.071 forthe c8.9 flare on 2000 november 16. these values are similar to that derivedfrom the direct observation of the reconnection inflow by yokoyama et al.(2001), and consistent with the fast reconnection models such as that ofpetschek (1964).

astro-ph;0508478	self-consistent mhd modeling of a coronal mass ejection, coronal  dimming, and a giant cusp-shaped arcade formation	we performed magnetohydrodynamic simulation of coronal mass ejections (cmes)and associated giant arcade formations, and the results suggested newinterpretations of observations of cmes. we performed two cases of thesimulation: with and without heat conduction. comparing between the results ofthe two cases, we found that reconnection rate in the conductive case is alittle higher than that in the adiabatic case and the temperature of the looptop is consistent with the theoretical value predicted by the yokoyama-shibatascaling law. the dynamical properties such as velocity and magnetic fields aresimilar in the two cases, whereas thermal properties such as temperature anddensity are very different.in both cases, slow shocks associated with magneticreconnectionpropagate from the reconnection region along the magnetic fieldlines around the flux rope, and the shock fronts form spiral patterns. justoutside the slow shocks, the plasma density decreased a great deal. the softx-ray images synthesized from the numerical results are compared with the softx-ray images of a giant arcade observed with the soft x-ray telescope aboard{\it yohkoh}, it is confirmed that the effect of heat conduction is significantfor the detailed comparison between simulation and observation. the comparisonbetween synthesized and observed soft x-ray images provides new interpretationsof various features associated with cmes and giant arcades.

astro-ph;0612664	dead zone formation and nonsteady hyperaccretion in collapsar disks : a  possible origin of short-term variability in the prompt emission of gamma-ray  bursts	the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is believed to be a hot anddense disk with hyperaccretion onto a few solar-mass black hole. we investigatewhere the magnetorotational instability (mri) actively operates in thehyperaccretion disk, which can cause angular momentum transport in the disk.the inner region of hyperaccretion disks can be neutrino opaque, and theenergy- and momentum-transport by neutrinos could affect the growth of the mrisignificantly. assuming reasonable disk models and a weak magnetic field $b\lesssim 10^{14} \rm{g}$, it is found that the mri is strongly suppressed bythe neutrino viscosity in the inner region of hyperaccretion disks. on theother hand, the mri can drive active mhd turbulence in the outerneutrino-transparent region regardless of the field strength. this suggeststhat the baryonic matter is accumulated into the inner dead zone where the mrigrows inactively and the angular momentum transport is inefficient. when thedead zone gains a large amount of mass and becomes gravitationally unstable,intense mass accretion onto the central black hole would occur episodicallythrough the gravitational torque. this process can be a physical mechanism ofthe short-term variability in the prompt emission of grbs. finally, the originof flaring activities in the x-ray afterglow is predicted in the context of ourepisodic accretion scenario.

astro-ph;9907434	general relativistic simulations of jet formation by a rapidly rotating  black hole	recent observations of galactic black hole candidates (bhcs) suggest thatthose that are superluminal jet sources have more rapid black hole spin ratesthan otherwise normal bhcs. this provides observational support for models ofrelativistic jet formation that extract rotational energy of the central blackhole. to investigate this mechanism, we have developed a new generalrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic code in kerr geometry. here we report on thefirst numerical simulation of the formation of a relativistic jet in arapidly-rotating (a=0.95) kerr black hole magnetosphere. we assume that theinitial velocity of the disk is zero. we find that the maximum velocity of thejet reaches 0.93c (lorentz factor, 2.7) and the terminal velocity of the jet is0.85c (lorentz factor, 1.9). on the other hand, for a non-rotating (a=0)schwarzschild black hole, the maximum outflow velocity is less than 0.6c forinitial magnetospheric conditions similar to to those of the kerr black holecase. these numerical results show the importance of the rapidly rotating blackhole for the relativistic jet formation.

astro-ph;9907435	general relativistic simulations of jet formation in a rapidly rotating  black hole magnetosphere	to investigate the formation mechanism of relativistic jets in activegalactic nuclei and micro-quasars, we have developed a new general relativisticmagnetohydrodynamic code in kerr geometry. here we report on the firstnumerical simulation of jet formation in a rapidly-rotating (a=0.95) kerr blackhole magnetosphere. we study cases in which the keplerian accretion disk isboth co-rotating and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole rotation.in the co-rotating disk case, our results are almost the same as those inschwarzschild black hole cases: a gas pressure-driven jet is formed by a shockin the disk, and a weaker magnetically-driven jet is also generated outside thegas pressure-driven jet. on the other hand, in the counter-rotating disk case,a new powerful magnetically-driven jet is formed inside the gas pressure-drivenjet. the newly found magnetically-driven jet in the latter case is acceleratedby a strong magnetic field created by frame dragging in the ergosphere. throughthis process, the magnetic field extracts the energy of the black holerotation.

0812.2063	evolution of anemone ar noaa 10798 and the related geo-effective flares  and cmes	we present a detailed examination of the features of the active region (ar)noaa 10798. this ar generated coronal mass ejections (cmes) that caused a largegeomagnetic storm on 24 august 2005 with the minimum dst index of -216 nt. weexamined the evolution of the ar and the features on/near the solar surface andin the interplanetary space. the ar emerged in the middle of a small coronalhole, and formed a {\it sea anemone} like configuration. h$\alpha$ filamentswere formed in the ar, which have southward axial field. three m-class flareswere generated, and the first two that occurred on 22 august 2005 were followedby halo-type cmes. the speeds of the cmes were fast, and recorded about 1200and 2400 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. the second cme was especially fast, andcaught up and interacted with the first (slower) cme during their travelingstoward earth. these acted synergically to generate an interplanetarydisturbance with strong southward magnetic field of about -50 nt, which wasfollowed by the large geomagnetic storm.
