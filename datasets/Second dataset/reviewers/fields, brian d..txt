hep-ph;9512321	nucleosynthesis limits on the mass of long lived tau and muon neutrinos	we compute the nucleosynthesis bounds on the masses of stable dirac andmajorana neutrinos by solving an evolution equation network comprising of allneutrino species which in the dirac case includes different helicity states asseparate species. we will not commit ourselves to any particular value of thenucleosynthesis bound on effective number of light neutrino degrees of freedom$n_\nu$, but present all our mass bounds as {\em functions} of $\dnu$. forexample, we find that the excluded region in the mass of a majorana $\mu$- or$\tau$- neutrino, $0.31$ mev $&lt; m_{\nu}^m &lt; 52$ mev corresponding to a bound$\dnu &lt; 0.3$ gets relaxed to $0.93$ mev $&lt; m_{\nu}^m &lt; 31$ mev if $\dnu &lt; 1.0$is used instead. for the dirac neutrinos this latter constraint gives the upperlimits (for $t_{\rm qcd} = 100$ mev): $\mnm &lt; 0.31$ mev and $\mnt &lt; 0.37$ mev.also, the constraint $\dnu &lt;1$ {\it allows} a stable dirac neutrino with$m^d_{\nu_\tau} &gt; 22$ mev.

0901.1143	the implications of a high cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse  interstellar clouds	diffuse interstellar clouds show large abundances of h_3^+ which can bemaintained only by a high ionization rate of h_2. cosmic rays are the dominantionization mechanism in this environment, so the large ionization rate impliesa high cosmic-ray flux, and a large amount of energy residing in cosmic rays.in this paper we find that the standard propagated cosmic-ray spectrum predictsan ionization rate much lower than that inferred from h_3^+. low-energy (~10mev) cosmic rays are the most efficient at ionizing hydrogen, but cannot bedirectly detected; consequently, an otherwise unobservable enhancement of thelow-energy cosmic-ray flux offers a plausible explanation for the h_3^+results. beyond ionization, cosmic rays also interact with the interstellarmedium by spalling atomic nuclei and exciting atomic nuclear states. theseprocesses produce the light elements li, be, and b, as well as gamma-ray lines.to test the consequences of an enhanced low-energy cosmic-ray flux, we adopttwo physically-motivated cosmic-ray spectra which by construction reproduce theionization rate inferred in diffuse clouds, and investigate the implications ofthese spectra on dense cloud ionization rates, light element abundances,gamma-ray fluxes, and energetics. one spectrum proposed here provides anexplanation for the high ionization rate seen in diffuse clouds while stillappearing to be broadly consistent with other observables, but the shape ofthis spectrum suggests that supernovae remnants may not be the predominantaccelerators of low-energy cosmic rays.

0910.4961	the deuterium abundance in the local interstellar medium	as the galaxy evolves, the abundance of deuterium in the interstellar medium(ism) decreases from its primordial value: deuterium is "astrated". thedeuterium astration factor, f_d, the ratio of the primordial d abundance (the dto h ratio by number) to the ism d abundance, is determined by the competitionbetween stellar destruction and infall, providing a constraint on models of thechemical evolution of the galaxy. although conventional wisdom suggests thatthe local ism (i.e., within ~1-2 kpc of the sun) should be well mixed andhomogenized on timescales short compared to the chemical evolution timescale,the data reveal gas phase variations in the deuterium, iron, and other metalabundances as large as factors of ~4-5 or more, complicating the estimate ofthe "true" ism d abundance and of the deuterium astration factor. here,assuming that the variations in the observationally inferred ism d abundancesresult entirely from the depletion of d onto dust, rather than from unmixedaccretion of nearly primordial material, a model-independent, bayesian approachis used to determine the undepleted abundance of deuterium in the ism (or, alower limit to it). we find the best estimate for the undepleted, ism deuteriumabundance to be d/h_ism &gt;= (2.0+-0.1)x10^(-5). this result is used to providean estimate of (or, an upper bound to) the deuterium astration factor, f_d =(d/h)_p/d/h_ism &lt;= 1.4+-0.1.

1001.3678	synoptic sky surveys and the diffuse supernova neutrino background:  removing astrophysical uncertainties and revealing invisible supernovae	the cumulative (anti)neutrino production from all core-collapse supernovaewithin our cosmic horizon gives rise to the diffuse supernova neutrinobackground (dsnb), which is on the verge of detectability. the observed fluxdepends on supernova physics, but also on the cosmic history of supernovaexplosions; currently, the cosmic supernova rate introduces a substantial(+/-40%) uncertainty, largely through its absolute normalization. however, anew class of wide-field, repeated-scan (synoptic) optical sky surveys is comingonline, and will map the sky in the time domain with unprecedented depth,completeness, and dynamic range. we show that these surveys will obtain thecosmic supernova rate by direct counting, in an unbiased way and with highstatistics, and thus will allow for precise predictions of the dsnb. upcomingsky surveys will substantially reduce the uncertainties in the dsnb sourcehistory to an anticipated +/-5% that is dominated by systematics, so that theobserved high-energy flux thus will test supernova neutrino physics. theportion of the universe (z &lt; 1) accessible to upcoming sky surveys includes theprogenitors of a large fraction (~ 87%) of the expected 10-26 mev dsnb eventrate. we show that precision determination of the (optically detected) cosmicsupernova history will also make the dsnb into a strong probe of an extra fluxof neutrinos from optically invisible supernovae, which may be unseen eitherdue to unexpected large dust obscuration in host galaxies, or because somecore-collapse events proceed directly to black hole formation and fail to givean optical outburst.

1007.4173	nuclear reaction uncertainties, massive gravitino decays and the  cosmological lithium problem	we consider the effects of uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates on thecosmological constraints on the decays of unstable particles during or afterbig-bang nucleosynthesis (bbn). we identify the nuclear reactions due tonon-thermal hadrons that are the most important in perturbing standard bbn,then quantify the uncertainties in these reactions and in the resultinglight-element abundances. these results also indicate the key nuclear processesfor which improved cross section data would allow different light-elementabundances to be determined more accurately, thereby making possible moreprecise probes of bbn and evaluations of the cosmological constraints onunstable particles. applying this analysis to models with unstable gravitinosdecaying into neutralinos, we calculate the likelihood function for thelight-element abundances measured currently, taking into account the currentexperimental errors in the determinations of the relevant nuclear reactionrates. we find a region of the gravitino mass and abundance in which theabundances of deuterium, he4 and li7 may be fit with chi^2 = 5.5, compared withchi^2 = 31.7 if the effects of gravitino decays are unimportant. the best-fitsolution is improved to chi^2 ~ 2.0 when the lithium abundance is taken fromglobular cluster data. some such re-evaluation of the observed light-elementabundances and/or nuclear reaction rates would be needed if this region ofgravitino parameters is to provide a complete solution to the cosmological li7problem.

1010.3252	investigating the cosmic-ray ionization rate near the supernova remnant  ic 443 through h3+ observations	observational and theoretical evidence suggests that high-energy galacticcosmic rays are primarily accelerated by supernova remnants. if also true forlow-energy cosmic rays, the ionization rate near a supernova remnant should behigher than in the general galactic interstellar medium (ism). we have searchedfor h3+ absorption features in 6 sight lines which pass through molecularmaterial near ic 443---a well-studied case of a supernova remnant interactingwith its surrounding molecular material---for the purpose of inferring thecosmic-ray ionization rate in the region. in 2 of the sight lines (toward als8828 and hd 254577) we find large h3+ column densities, n(h3+)~3*10^14 cm^-2,and deduce ionization rates of zeta_2~2*10^-15 s^-1, about 5 times larger thaninferred toward average diffuse molecular cloud sight lines. however, the 3sigma upper limits found for the other 4 sight lines are consistent withtypical galactic values. this wide range of ionization rates is likely theresult of particle acceleration and propagation effects, which predict that thecosmic-ray spectrum and thus ionization rate should vary in and around theremnant. while we cannot determine if the h3+ absorption arises in post-shock(interior) or pre-shock (exterior) gas, the large inferred ionization ratessuggest that ic 443 is in fact accelerating a large population of low-energycosmic rays. still, it is unclear whether this population can propagate farenough into the ism to account for the ionization rate inferred in diffusegalactic sight lines.

1010.5726	cosmic chemical evolution with an early population of intermediate mass  stars	we explore the consequences of an early population of intermediate mass starsin the 2 - 8 m\odot range on cosmic chemical evolution. we discuss theimplications of this population as it pertains to several cosmological andastrophysical observables. for example, some very metal-poor galactic starsshow large enhancements of carbon, typical of the c-rich ejecta of low-massstars but not of supernovae; moreover, halo star carbon and oxygen abundancesshow wide scatter, which imply a wide range of star-formation andnucleosynthetic histories contributed to the first generations of stars. also,recent analyses of the 4he abundance in metal-poor extragalactic h ii regionssuggest an elevated abundance yp \simeq 0.256 by mass, higher than thepredicted result from big bang nucleosynthesis assuming the baryon densitydetermined by wmap, yp = 0.249. although there are large uncertainties in theobservational determination of 4he, this offset may suggest a prompt initialenrichment of 4he in early metal-poor structures. we also discuss the effect ofintermediate mass stars on global cosmic evolution, the reionization of theuniverse, the density of white dwarfs, as well as snii and snia rates at highredshift. we also comment on the early astration of d and 7li. we conclude thatif intermediate mass stars are to be associated with population iii stars,their relevance is limited (primarily from observed abundance patterns) to lowmass structures involving a limited fraction of the total baryon content of theuniverse.

1011.0722	resonant destruction as a possible solution to the cosmological lithium  problem	we explore a nuclear physics resolution to the discrepancy between thepredicted standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) abundance of 7li and itsobservational determination in metal-poor stars. the theoretical 7li abundanceis 3-4 times greater than the observational values, assuming thebaryon-to-photon ratio, eta_wmap, determined by wmap. the 7li problem could beresolved within the standard bbn picture if additional destruction of a=7isotopes occurs due to new nuclear reaction channels or upward corrections toexisting channels. this could be achieved via missed resonant nuclearreactions, which is the possibility we consider here. we find some potentialcandidate resonances which can solve the lithium problem and specify theirrequired resonant energies and widths. for example, a 1^- or 2^- excited stateof 10c sitting at approximately 15.0 mev above its ground state with aneffective width of order 10 kev could resolve the 7li problem; the existence ofthis excited state needs experimental verification. other examples using knownstates include 7be+t \rightarrow 10b(18.80 mev), and 7be+d \rightarrow 9b(16.71mev). for all of these states, a large channel radius (a &gt; 10 fm) is needed togive sufficiently large widths. experimental determination of these reactionstrengths is needed to rule out or confirm these nuclear physics solutions tothe lithium problem.

0709.3300	cosmological cosmic rays: sharpening the primordial lithium problem	cosmic structure formation leads to large-scale shocked baryonic flows whichare expected to produce a cosmological population of structure-formation cosmicrays (sfcrs). interactions between sfcrs and ambient baryons will producelithium isotopes via \alpha+\alpha \to ^{6,7}li. this pre-galactic (butnon-primordial) lithium should contribute to the primordial 7li measured inhalo stars and must be subtracted in order to arrive to the true observedprimordial lithium abundance. in this paper we point out that the recent halostar 6li measurements can be used to place a strong constraint to the level ofsuch contamination, because the exclusive astrophysical production of 6li isfrom cosmic-ray interactions. we find that the putative 6li plateau, if due topre-galactic cosmic-ray interactions, implies that sfcr-produced lithiumrepresents li_{sfcr}/li_{plateau}\approx 15% of the observed elemental liplateau. taking the remaining plateau li to be cosmological 7li, we find arevised (and slightly worsened) discrepancy between the li observations and bigbang nucleosynthesis predictions by a factor of ^7li_{bbn}/^7li_{plateau}\approx 3.7. moreover, sfcrs would also contribute to the extragalacticgamma-ray background (egrb) through neutral pion production. this gamma-rayproduction is tightly related to the amount of lithium produced by the samecosmic rays; the 6li plateau limits the pre-galactic (high-redshift) sfcrcontribution to be at the level of i_{\pi_{\gamma}sfcr}/i_{egrb} &lt; 5% of thecurrently observed egrb.

1201.3447	the diffuse gamma-ray background from type ia supernovae	the origin of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (egb) has beenintensively studied but remains unsettled. current popular source candidatesinclude unresolved star-forming galaxies, starburst galaxies, and blazars. inthis paper we calculate the egb contribution from the interactions of cosmicrays accelerated by type ia supernovae (sne), extending earlier work which onlyincluded core-collapse sne. we consider type ia events in star-forminggalaxies, but also in quiescent galaxies that lack star formation. forstar-forming galaxies, consistently including type ia events makes littlechange to the star-forming egb prediction, so long as both sn types have thesame cosmic-ray acceleration efficiencies in star-forming galaxies. thus, ourupdated egb estimate continues to show that star-forming galaxies can representa substantial portion of the signal measured by fermi. for quiescent galaxies,conversely, we find a wide range of possibilities for the egb contribution. thedominant uncertainty we investigated comes from the mass in hot gas, whichprovides targets for cosmic rays; total gas masses are as yet poorly known,particularly at larger radii. additionally, the egb estimation is verysensitive to the cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency and confinement, especiallyin quiescent galaxies. in the most optimistic allowed scenarios, quiescentgalaxies can be an important source of the egb. in this case, star-forminggalaxies and quiescent galaxies together will dominate the egb and leave littleroom for other contributions. if other sources, such as blazars, are found tohave important contributions to the egb, then either the gas mass or cosmic-raycontent of quiescent galaxies must be significantly lower than in theirstar-forming counterparts. in any case, improved fermi egb measurements willprovide important constraints on hot gas and cosmic rays in quiescent galaxies.

1206.0770	inverse compton contribution to the star-forming extragalactic gamma-ray  background	fermi has resolved several star-forming galaxies, but the vast majority ofthe star-forming universe is unresolved and thus contributes to theextragalactic gamma ray background (egb). here, we calculate the contributionfrom star-forming galaxies to the egb in the fermi range from 100 mev to 100gev, due to inverse-compton (ic) scattering of the interstellar photon field bycosmic-ray electrons. we first construct a one-zone model for a singlestar-forming galaxy, assuming supernovae power the acceleration of cosmic rays.the same ic interactions leading to gamma rays also substantially contribute tothe energy loss of the high-energy cosmic-ray electrons. consequently, agalaxy's ic emission is determined by the relative importance of ic losses inthe cosmic-ray electron energy budget ("partial calorimetry"). we use ourtemplate for galactic ic luminosity to find the cosmological contribution ofstar-forming galaxies to the egb. for all of our models, we find the ic egbcontribution is almost an order of magnitude less than the peak of the emissiondue to cosmic-ray ion interactions (mostly pionic p_cr p_ism \rightarrow \pi_0\rightarrow \gamma \gamma); even at the highest fermi energies, ic issubdominant. moreover, the flatter ic spectrum increases the high-energy signalof the pionic+ic sum, bringing it into better agreement with the egb spectralindex observed by fermi . partial calorimetry ensures that the overall icsignal is well constrained, with only modest uncertainties in the amplitude andspectral shape for plausible model choices. partial calorimetry of cosmic-rayelectrons should hold true in both normal and starburst galaxies, and thus weinclude starbursts in our calculation. we conclude with a brief discussion onhow the pionic spectral feature and other methods can be used to measure thestar-forming component of the egb.

1207.3081	observation of interstellar lithium in the low-metallicity small  magellanic cloud	the primordial abundances of light elements produced in the standard theoryof big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) depend only on the cosmic ratio of baryons tophotons, a quantity inferred from observations of the microwave background. thepredicted primordial 7li abundance is four times that measured in theatmospheres of galactic halo stars. this discrepancy could be caused bymodification of surface lithium abundances during the stars' lifetimes or byphysics beyond the standard model that affects early nucleosynthesis. thelithium abundance of low-metallicity gas provides an alternative constraint onthe primordial abundance and cosmic evolution of lithium that is notsusceptible to the in situ modifications that may affect stellar atmospheres.here we report observations of interstellar 7li in the low-metallicity gas ofthe small magellanic cloud, a nearby galaxy with a quarter the sun'smetallicity. the present-day 7li abundance of the small magellanic cloud isnearly equal to the bbn predictions, severely constraining the amount ofpossible subsequent enrichment of the gas by stellar and cosmic-raynucleosynthesis. our measurements can be reconciled with standard bbn with anextremely fine-tuned depletion of stellar li with metallicity. they are alsoconsistent with non-standard bbn.

astro-ph;0010121	standard cosmic ray energetics and light element production	the recent observations of be and b in metal poor stars has led to areassessment of the origin of the light elements in the early galaxy. at low itis metallicity ([o/h] &lt; -1.75), it is necessary to introduce a productionmechanism which is independent of the interstellar metallicity (primary). athigher metallicities, existing data might indicate that secondary production isdominant. in this paper, we focus on the secondary process, related to thestandard galactic cosmic rays, and we examine the cosmic ray energyrequirements for both present and past epochs. we find the power input tomaintain the present-day galactic cosmic ray flux is about 1.5e41 erg/s = 5e50erg/century. this implies that, if supernovae are the sites of cosmic rayacceleration, the fraction of explosion energy going to accelerated particlesis about 30%, a value which we obtain consistently both from considering thepresent cosmic ray flux and confinement and from the present 9be and 6liabundances. using the abundances of 9be (and 6li) in metal-poor halo stars, weextend the analysis to show the effect of the interstellar gas mass on thestandard galactic cosmic ray energetic constraints on models of li, be, and bevolution. the efficiency of the beryllium production per erg may be enhancedin the past by a factor of about 10; thus the energetic requirement by itselfcannot be used to rule out a secondary origin of light elements. only a clearand undisputable observational determination of the o-fe relation in the halowill discriminate between the two processes.

astro-ph;0102179	the nacre thermonuclear reaction compilation and big bang  nucleosynthesis	the theoretical predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) are dominatedby uncertainties in the input nuclear reaction cross sections. in this paper,we examine the impact on bbn of the recent compilation of nuclear data andthermonuclear reactions rates by the nacre collaboration. we confirm that theadopted rates do not make large overall changes in central values ofpredictions, but do affect the magnitude of the uncertainties in thesepredictions. therefore, we then examine in detail the uncertainties in theindividual reaction rates considered by nacre. when the error estimates bynacre are treated as 1\sigma limits, the resulting bbn error budget is similarto those of previous tabulations. we propose two new procedures for derivingreaction rate uncertainties from the nuclear data: one which sets lower limitsto the error, and one which we believe is a reasonable description of thepresent error budget. we propagate these uncertainty estimates through the bbncode, and find that when the nuclear data errors are described most accurately,the resulting light element uncertainties are notably smaller than in someprevious tabulations, but larger than others. using these results, we derivelimits on the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, and compare this toindependent limits on $\eta$ from recent balloon-borne measurements of thecosmic microwave background radiation (cmb). we discuss means to improve thebbn results via key nuclear reaction measurements and light elementobservations.

astro-ph;0103083	a simple model for r-process scatter and halo evolution	recent observations of heavy elements produced by rapid neutron capture(r-process) in the halo have shown a striking and unexpected behavior: within asingle star, the relative abundances of r-process elements heavier than eu arethe same as the same as those of solar system matter, while across stars withsimilar metallicity fe/h, the r/fe ratio varies over two orders of magnitude.in this paper we present a simple analytic model which describes a star'sabundances in terms of its ``ancestry,'' i.e., the number of nucleosynthesisevents (e.g., supernova explosions) which contributed to the star'scomposition. this model leads to a very simple analytic expression for theabundance scatter versus fe/h, which is in good agreement with the data andwith more sophisticated numerical models. we investigate two classes ofscenarios for r-process nucleosynthesis, one in which r-process synthesisevents occur in only \sim 4% of supernovae but iron synthesis is ubiquitous,and one in which iron nucleosynthesis occurs in only about 9% of supernovae.(the wasserburg- qian model). we find that the predictions in these scenariosare similar for [fe/h] \ga -2.5, but that these models can be readilydistinguished observationally by measuring the dispersion in r/fe at [fe/h] \la-3.

astro-ph;0105207	diffuse gamma-rays from local group galaxies	diffuse gamma-ray radiation in galaxies is produced by cosmic rayinteractions with the interstellar medium. with the completion of egretobservations, the only extragalactic object from which there has been apositive detection of diffuse gamma-ray emission is the large magellanic cloud.we systematically estimate the expected diffuse gamma-ray flux from local groupgalaxies, and determine their detectability by new generation gamma-rayobservatories such as glast. for each galaxy, the expected gamma-ray fluxdepends only on its total gas content and its cosmic ray flux. we present amethod for calculating cosmic ray flux in these galaxies in terms of theobserved rate of supernova explosions, where cosmic ray acceleration isbelieved to take place. the difficulty in deriving accurate supernova ratesfrom observational data is a dominant uncertainty in our calculations. weestimate the gamma-ray flux for local group galaxies and find that ourpredictions are consistent with the observations for the lmc and with theobservational upper limits for the small magellanic cloud and m31. both theandromeda galaxy, with a flux of $\sim 1.0 \times 10^{-8}$ photons sec$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ above 100 mev, and the smc, with a flux of $\sim 1.7 \times 10^{-8}$photons sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ above 100 mev, are expected to be observable byglast. m33 is at the limit of detectability with a flux of $\sim 0.11 \times10^{-8}$ sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. other local group galaxies are at least twoorders of magnitude below glast sensitivity.

astro-ph;0105397	primordial nucleosynthesis with cmb inputs: probing the early universe  and light element astrophysics	cosmic microwave background (cmb) determinations of the baryon-to-photonratio $\eta \propto \omega_{\rm baryon} h^2$ will remove the last freeparameter from (standard) big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) calculations. thiswill make bbn a much sharper probe of early universe physics, for example,greatly refining the bbn measurement of the effective number of light neutrinospecies, $n_{\nu,eff}$. we show how the cmb can improve this limit, givencurrent light element data. moreover, it will become possible to constrain$n_{\nu,eff}$ independent of \he4, by using other elements, notably deuterium;this will allow for sharper limits and tests of systematics. for example, a 3%measurement of $\eta$, together with a 10% (3%) measurement of primordial d/h,can measure $n_{\nu,eff}$ to a 95% confidence level of $\sigma_{95%}(n_\nu) =1.8$ (1.0) if $\eta \sim 6.0\times 10^{-10}$. if instead, one adopts thestandard model value $n_{\nu,eff}=3$, then one can use $\eta$ (and itsuncertainty) from the cmb to make accurate predictions for the primordialabundances. these determinations can in turn become key inputs in thenucleosynthesis history (chemical evolution) of galaxies thereby placingconstraints on such models.

astro-ph;0107389	on the possible sources of d/h dispersion at high redshift	recent observations suggest the existence of a white dwarf population in thegalactic halo, while others suggest that deuterium has been astrated in systemsat high redshift and low metallicity. we propose that these observations couldbe signatures of an early population of intermediate-mass stars. such apopulation requires a population iii initial mass function different from thatof the solar neighborhood, as perhaps also suggested by the observed cosmicinfrared background. also, to avoid overproduction of c and n, it is requiredthat the z=0 yields of these stars have low ($\sim 10^{-3}$ solar) abundancesas suggested by some recent calculations. under these assumptions, we present amodel which reproduces the observed d vs si trend, and predicts a high cosmictype ia supernova rate, while producing a white dwarf population that accountsfor only $\sim$ 1.5% of the dark halo. this scenario can be tested byobservations of the cosmic supernova rate, and by confirmation and furtherstudies of the putative white dwarf halo population.

astro-ph;0107492	production of lithium, beryllium, and boron by hypernovae	we investigate a possible nucleosynthetic signature of highly energeticexplosions of c-o cores ("hypernovae," hne) which might be associated withgamma-ray bursts (grbs). we note that the direct impact of c- and o-enrichedhypernova ejecta on the ambient hydrogen and helium leads to spallationreactions which can produce large amounts of the light nuclides lithium,beryllium, and boron (libeb). using analytic velocity spectra of the hypernovaejecta, we calculate the libeb yields of different exploding c-o coresassociated with observed hypernovae. the deduced yields are $\sim 10^3$ timeshigher than those produced by similar (direct) means in normal type iisupernovae, and are higher than the commonly used ones arising from shock waveacceleration induced by type ii supernova (sn) explosions. to avoidoverproduction of these elements in our galaxy, hypernovae should be rareevents, with $\la 10^{-3}$ hypernovae per supernova, assuming a constant hn/snratio over time. this rate is in good agreement with that of long duration grbsif we assume that the gamma-ray emission is focussed with a beaming factor$\omega/4\pi \la 10^{-2}$. this encouraging result supports the possible hn-grbassociation. thus, galactic libeb abundance measurements offer a promising wayto probe the hn rate history and the possible hn-grb correlation. on the otherhand, if hypernovae are associated to very massive pregalactic stars(population iii) they would produce a libeb pre-enrichment in proto-galacticgas, which could show up as a plateau in the lowest metallicities of the be-ferelation in halo stars.

astro-ph;0203240	constraining strong baryon-dark matter interactions with primordial  nucleosynthesis and cosmic rays	self-interacting dark matter (sidm) was introduced by spergel &amp; steinhardt toaddress possible discrepancies between collisionless dark matter simulationsand observations on scales of less than 1 mpc. we examine the case in whichdark matter particles not only have strong self-interactions but also havestrong interactions with baryons. the presence of such interactions will havedirect implications for nuclear and particle astrophysics. among these are achange in the predicted abundances from big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) and theflux of gamma-rays produced by the decay of neutral pions which originate incollisions between dark matter and galactic cosmic rays (cr). from theseeffects we constrain the strength of the baryon--dark matter interactionsthrough the ratio of baryon - dark matter interaction cross section to darkmatter mass, $s$. we find that bbn places a weak upper limit to this ratio $&lt;10^8 cm^2/g$. cr-sidm interactions, however, limit the possible dm-baryon crosssection to $&lt; 5 \times 10^{-3} cm^2/g$; this rules out an energy-independentinteraction, but not one which falls with center-of-mass velocity as $s \propto1/v$ or steeper.

astro-ph;0207253	the guaranteed gamma-ray background	the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (egrb) above 100 mev encodesunique information about high-energy processes in the universe. numeroussources for the egrb have been proposed, but the two systems which are certainto make some contribution are active galaxies (blazars) as well as normalgalaxies. in this paper, we evaluate the contribution to the background fromboth sources. the active galaxy contribution arises from unresolved blazars. wecompute this contribution using the stecker-salamon model. for normal galaxies,the emission is due to cosmic-ray interactions with diffuse gas. our keyassumption here is that the cosmic-ray flux in a galaxy is proportional to thesupernova rate and thus the massive star formation rate, quantifiedobservationally by the cosmic star formation rate (csfr). in addition, theexistence of stars today requires a considerably higher ism mass in the past.using the csfr to compute both these effects, we find that normal galaxies areresponsible for a significant portion (\sim 1/3) of the egrb near 1 gev, butmake a smaller contribution at other energies. finally, we present a "minimal"two-component model which includes contributions from both normal galaxies andblazars. we show that the spectrum of the diffuse radiation is a key constrainton this model: while neither the blazar spectra, nor the galactic spectra, areseparately optimal fits to the observed spectrum, the combined emissionprovides an excellent fit. we close by noting key observational tests of thistwo-component model, which can be probed by future gamma-ray observatories suchas glast.

astro-ph;0207583	on the baryometric status of he3	recent observations by bania et al. (2002) measure he3 versus oxygen ingalactic hii regions, finding that he3/h is within a factor of 2 of the solarabundance for [o/h] &gt; -0.6. these results are consistent with a flat behaviorin this metallicity range, tempting one to deduce from these observations aprimordial value for the he3 abundance, which could join d and li7 as anindicator of the cosmic baryon density. however, using the same data, we showthat it is not possible to obtain a strong constraint on the baryon densityrange. this is due to (i) the intrinsically weak sensitivity of the primordialhe3 abundance to the baryon density; (ii) the limited range in metallicity ofthe sample; (iii) the intrinsic scatter in the data; and (iv) our limitedunderstanding of the chemical and stellar evolution of this isotope.consequently, the he3 observations correspond to an extended range ofbaryon-to-photon ratio, eta = (2.2 - 6.5) x 10^{-10}, which diminishes the roleof he3 as a precision baryometer. on the other hand, once the baryon-to-photonratio is determined by the cmb, d/h, or li7/h, the primordial value of he3/hcan be inferred. henceforth new observations of galactic he3, can in principlegreatly improve our understanding of stellar and/or chemical evolution andreconcile the observations of the hii regions and those of the planetarynebulae.

0808.2818	a bitter pill: the primordial lithium problem worsens	the lithium problem arises from the significant discrepancy between theprimordial 7li abundance as predicted by bbn theory and the wmap baryondensity, and the pre-galactic lithium abundance inferred from observations ofmetal-poor (population ii) stars. this problem has loomed for the past decade,with a persistent discrepancy of a factor of 2--3 in 7li/h. recent developmentshave sharpened all aspects of the li problem. namely: (1) bbn theorypredictions have sharpened due to new nuclear data, particularly theuncertainty on 3he(alpha,gamma)7be, has reduced to 7.4%, and with a centralvalue shift of ~ +0.04 kev barn. (2) the wmap 5-year data now yields a cosmicbaryon density with an uncertainty reduced to 2.7%. (3) observations ofmetal-poor stars have tested for systematic effects, and have reaped newlithium isotopic data. with these, we now find that the bbn+wmap predicts 7li/h= (5.24+0.71-0.67) 10^{-10}. the li problem remains and indeed is exacerbated;the discrepancy is now a factor 2.4--4.3 or 4.2sigma (from globular clusterstars) to 5.3sigma (from halo field stars). possible resolutions to the lithiumproblem are briefly reviewed, and key nuclear, particle, and astronomicalmeasurements highlighted.

astro-ph;0302431	primordial nucleosynthesis in light of wmap	big bang nucleosynthesis has long provided the primary determination of thecosmic baryon density $\omb h^2$, or equivalently the baryon-to-photon ratio,\eta. recently, data on cmb anisotropies have become increasingly sensitive to\eta. the comparison of these two independent measures provides a key test forbig bang cosmology. the first release of results from the wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe (wmap) marks a milestone in this test. with the precision ofwmap, the cmb now offers a significantly stronger constraint on \eta. wediscuss the current state of bbn theory and light element observations(including their possible lingering systematic errors). the resulting bbnbaryon density prediction is in overall agreement with the wmap prediction, animportant and non-trivial confirmation of hot big bang cosmology. going beyondthis, the powerful cmb baryometer can be used as an input to bbn and one canaccurately predict the primordial light element abundances. by comparing thesewith observations one can obtain new insight into post-bbn nucleosynthesisprocesses and associated astrophysics. finally, one can test the possibility ofnonstandard physics at the time of bbn, now with all light elements availableas probes. indeed, with the wmap precision \eta, deuterium is already beginningto rival \he4's sensitivity to nonstandard physics, and additional d/hmeasurements can improve this further.

astro-ph;0307183	on non-primordial deuterium production by accelerated particles	deuterium plays a crucial role in cosmology because the primordial d/habundance, in the context of big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) theory, yields aprecise measure of the cosmic baryon content. observations of d/h can limit ormeasure the true primordial abundance because d is thought to be destroyed bystars and thus d/h monotonically decreases after bbn. recently, however, mullan&amp; linsky have pointed out that d arises as a secondary product of neutrons instellar flares which then capture on protons via n+p \to d + gamma, and thatthis could dominate over direct d production in flares. mullan &amp; linsky notethat if this process is sufficiently vigorous in flaring dwarf stars, it couldlead to significant non-bbn d production. we have considered the production ofd in stellar flares, both directly and by n capture. we find that forreasonable flare spectra, n/d &lt; 10 and (n+d)/6li &lt; 400, both of which indicatethat the n-capture channel does not allow for galactic d production at a levelwhich will reverse the monotonic decline of d. we also calculate the 2.22 mevgamma-ray line production associated with n capture, and find that existingcomptel limits also rule out significant d production in the galaxy today.thus, we find flares in particular, and neutron captures in general, are not animportant galactic source of d. on the other hand, we cannot exclude that flareproduction might contribute to recent fuse observations of large variations inthe local interstellar d/h abundance; we do, however, offer importantconstraints on this possibility. finally, since flare stars should inevitablyproduce some n-capture events, a search for diffuse 2.22 mev gamma-rays byintegral can further constrain (or measure!) galactic deuterium production vian-capture.

astro-ph;0312629	solar neutrino constraints on the bbn production of li	using the recent wmap determination of the baryon-to-photon ratio, 10^{10}\eta = 6.14 to within a few percent, big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn)calculations can make relatively accurate predictions of the abundances of thelight element isotopes which can be tested against observational abundancedeterminations. at this value of \eta, the li7 abundance is predicted to besignificantly higher than that observed in low metallicity halo dwarf stars.among the possible resolutions to this discrepancy are 1) li7 depletion in theatmosphere of stars; 2) systematic errors originating from the choice ofstellar parameters - most notably the surface temperature; and 3) systematicerrors in the nuclear cross sections used in the nucleosynthesis calculations.here, we explore the last possibility, and focus on possible systematic errorsin the he3(\alpha,\gamma)be7 reaction, which is the only important li7production channel in bbn. the absolute value of the cross section for this keyreaction is known relatively poorly both experimentally and theoretically. theagreement between the standard solar model and solar neutrino data thusprovides additional constraints on variations in the cross section (s_{34}).using the standard solar model of bahcall, and recent solar neutrino data, wecan exclude systematic s_{34} variations of the magnitude needed to resolve thebbn li7 problem at &gt; 95% cl. additional laboratory data onhe3(\alpha,\gamma)be7 will sharpen our understanding of both bbn and solarneutrinos, particularly if care is taken in determining the absolute crosssection and its uncertainties. nevertheless, it already seems that this``nuclear fix'' to the li7 bbn problem is unlikely; other possible solutionsare briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0407314	lithium-6 and gamma rays: complementary constraints on cosmic-ray  history	the rare isotope 6li is made only by cosmic rays, dominantly in alpha+alphafusion reactions with ism helium. consequently, this nuclide provides a uniquediagnostic of the history of cosmic rays in our galaxy. the same hadroniccosmic-ray interactions also produce high-energy gamma rays (mostly via neutralpion production). thus, hadronic gamma-rays and 6li are intimately linked.specifically, 6li directly encodes the local cosmic-ray fluence over cosmictime, while extragalactic hadronic gamma rays encode an average cosmic-rayfluence over lines of sight out to the horizon. we examine this link and showhow 6li and gamma-rays can be used together to place importantmodel-independent limits on the cosmic-ray history of our galaxy and theuniverse. we first constrain gamma-ray production from ordinary galactic cosmicrays, using the local 6li abundance. we find that the solar 6li abundancedemands an accompanying extragalactic pionic gamma-ray intensity which exceedsthat of the entire observed egrb by a factor of 2-6. possible explanations forthis discrepancy are discussed. we then constrain li production using recentdeterminations of extragalactic gamma-ray background (egrb). we note thatcosmic rays created during cosmic structure formation would lead topre-galactic li production, which would act as a "contaminant" to theprimordial 7li content of metal-poor halo stars. we find the uncertainties inthe observed egrb are so large that we cannot exclude a pre-galactic li whichis comparable to primordial 7li. our limits and their more model-dependentextensions will improve significantly with additional observations of 6li inhalo stars, and with improved measurements of the egrb spectrum by glast.(abriged abstract)

astro-ph;0608411	radioactive probes of the supernova-contaminated solar nebula: evidence  that the sun was born in a cluster	we construct a simple model for radioisotopic enrichment of the protosolarnebula by injection from a nearby supernova, based on the inverse square lawfor ejecta dispersion. we find that the presolar radioisotopes abundances(i.e., in solar masses) demand a nearby supernova: its distance can be nolarger than 66 times the size of the protosolar nebula, at a 90% confidencelevel, assuming 1 solar mass of protosolar material. the relevant size of thenebula depends on its state of evolution at the time of radioactivityinjection. in one scenario, a collection of low-mass stars, including our sun,formed in a group or cluster with an intermediate- to high-mass star that endedits life as a supernova while our sun was still a protostar, a starless core,or perhaps a diffuse cloud. using recent observations of protostars to estimatethe size of the protosolar nebula constrains the distance of the supernova at0.02 to 1.6 pc. the supernova distance limit is consistent with the scales oflow-mass stars formation around one or more massive stars, but it is closerthan expected were the sun formed in an isolated, solitary state. consequently,if any presolar radioactivities originated via supernova injection, we mustconclude that our sun was a member of such a group or cluster that has sincedispersed, and thus that solar system formation should be understood in thiscontext. in addition, we show that the timescale from explosion to the creationof small bodies was on the order of 1.8 myr (formal 90% confidence range of 0to 2.2 myr), and thus the temporal choreography from supernova ejecta tometeorites is important. finally, we can not distinguish between progenitormasses from 15 to 25 solar masses in the nucleosynthesis models; however, the20 solar mass model is somewhat preferred.

astro-ph;0611923	analytical models for the energetics of cosmic accretion shocks, their  cosmological evolution, and the effect of environment	we present an analytical description of the energetics of the population ofcosmic accretion shocks, for a concordance cosmology. we calculate how theshock-processed accretion power and mass current are distributed amongdifferent shock mach numbers, and how they evolve with cosmic time. wecalculate the cumulative energy input of cosmic accretion shocks of any machnumber to the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift, and we compare itwith the energy output of supernova explosions as well as with the energy inputrequired to reionize the universe. in addition, we investigate and quantify theeffect of environmental factors, such as local clustering properties andfilament preheating on the statistical properties of these shocks. we find thatthe energy processed by accretion shocks is higher than the supernova energyoutput for z&lt;3 and that it becomes more than an order of magnitude higher inthe local universe. the energy processed by accretion shocks alone becomescomparable to the energy required to reionize the universe by z~3.5. finally,we establish both qualitative and quantitatively that both local clustering aswell as filament compression and preheating are important factors indetermining the statistical properties of the cosmic accretion shockpopulation.

astro-ph;9512034	libeb production by nuclei and neutrinos	the production of libeb isotopes by nuclear and neutrino spallation arecompared in the framework of galactic evolutionary models. as motivated by$\gamma$-ray observations of orion, different possible sources of low-energy cand o nuclei are considered, such as supernovae of various masses and wc stars.we confirm that the low energy nuclei (len), injected in molecular clouds bystellar winds and type ii supernovae originating from the most massiveprogenitors, can very naturally reproduce the observed be and b evolution inthe early galaxy (halo phase). assuming the global importance of the lencomponent, we compute upper and lower bounds to the neutrino processcontribution corresponding to limiting cases of len particle spectra. aconsistent solution is found with a spectrum of the kind proposed by ramaty\etal (1995a,b), e.g. flat up to $e_c=30$ mev/n and decreasing abruptly above.this solution fulfills the challenge of explaining at the same time the generalbe and b evolution, and their solar system abundances without overproducing\li7 at very low metallicities, and the meteoritic \b11/\b10 ratio. in thiscase, neutrino spallation is constrained to play a limited role in the genesisof the solar system \b11. galactic cosmic rays (gcr) become operative late inthe evolution of the disk ([fe/h]$&gt;$-1), but their contribution to the solarabundances of \be9, \b10 and \b11 is not dominant (35\%, 30\% and 20\%respectively). thus, with this len spectrum, gcr are {\it not}\ the main sourceof \be9 and b in the galaxy. the most favorable case for neutrinos, (adoptingthe same kind of spectrum) has $e_c=20$ mev/n. even in this case, the neutrinoyields of woosley and weaver (1995) must to be reduced by a factor of 5 toavoid \b11 overproduction. furthermore, this solution leads to a high b/be

astro-ph;9601032	nuclear and gamma-ray production by supernova ejecta	the fastest ejecta of supernova explosions propagate as a precursor to themain supernova shock wave, and can be quite energetic. the spectrum of suchfast ejecta is estimated based on recent analytic and numerical supernovamodels, and found to be a power law having a cutoff at an energy of order 10mev/nucl, the precise value of which depends on the supernova mass andenergetics. with cutoffs in this range there can be significant flux withenergies above the thresholds for $\gamma$-ray and li, be, and b production.these nuclear interactions should inevitably accompany the passage of promptsupernova ejecta through the surrounding medium. the fast particle compositionis that of the outermost layers of the progenitor; if the progenitorexperienced significant loss of its envelope to a companion or by mass loss,then the composition is nonsolar, and in particular, metal-rich. such acomposition and spectrum of fast particles is required to explain the recentcomptel observations of $\gamma$-ray emission in orion. supernova ejecta fromone progenitor having lost a large amount of mass are shown to quantitativelyaccount for the orion $\gamma$ rays, and to imply the presence of other, weakerlines and of a supernova explosion in orion in the last $\la 10^4$ years.implications for this mechanism as a mode of nucleosynthesis, and as apotential supernova diagnostic, are discussed. model dependences anduncertainties are noted, and the need is shown for accurate measurements of$\gamma$-ray and spallation production cross sections at energies nearthreshold.

astro-ph;9603009	model independent predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis from \he4 and  \li7: consistency and implications	we examine in detail how bbn theory is constrained, and what predictions itcan make, when using only the most model-independent observational constraints.we avoid the uncertainties and model-dependencies that necessarily arise whensolar neighborhood d and \he3 abundances are used to infer primordial d and\he3 via chemical and stellar evolution models. instead, we use \he4 and \li7,thoroughly examining the effects of possible systematic errors in each. via alikelihood analysis, we find near perfect agreement between bbn theory and themost model-independent data. given this agreement, we then {\it assume} thecorrectness of bbn to set limits on the single parameter of standard bbn, thebaryon-to-photon ratio, and to predict the primordial d and \he3 abundances. wealso repeat our analysis including recent measurements of d/h from quasarabsorption systems and find that the near perfect agreement between theory andobservation of the three isotopes, d, \he4 and \li7 is maintained. theseresults have strong implications for the chemical and stellar evolution of thelight elements, in particular for \he3. in addition, our results (especially ifthe d/h measurements are confirmed) have implications for the stellar depletionof \li7. finally, we set limits on the number \nnu\ of neutrino flavors, usingan analysis which carefully and systematically includes all availableexperimental constraints. the value \nnu = 3.0 fits best with bbn and a 95\% clupper limit of \nnu $\la 4$ is established.

astro-ph;9604095	halo white dwarfs and the hot intergalactic medium	we present a schematic model for the formation of baryonic galactic halos andhot gas in the local group and the intergalactic medium. we follow thedynamics, chemical evolution, heat flow and gas flows of a hierarchy of scales,including: protogalactic clouds, galactic halos, and the local group itself.within this hierarchy, the galaxy is built via mergers of protogalacticfragments. we find that early bursts of star formation lead to a largepopulation of remnants (mostly white dwarfs), which would reside presently inthe halo and contribute to the dark component observed in the microlensingexperiments. the hot, metal-rich gas from early starbursts and mergingevaporates from the clouds and is eventually incorporated into theintergalactic medium. the model thus suggests that most microlensing objectscould be white dwarfs ($m \sim 0.5 \msol$), which comprise a significantfraction of the halo mass. furthermore, the local group could have a componentof metal-rich hot gas similar to, although less than, that observed in largerclusters. we discuss the known constraints on such a scenario and show that alllocal observations can be satisfied with present data in this model. thebest-fit model has a halo that is 40% baryonic, with an upper limit of 77%.

astro-ph;9605128	geological isotope anomalies as signatures of nearby supernovae	nearby supernova explosions may cause geological isotope anomalies via thedirect deposition of debris or by cosmic-ray spallation in the earth'satmosphere. we estimate the mass of material deposited terrestrially by thesetwo mechanisms, showing the dependence on the supernova distance. a number ofradioactive isotopes are identified as possible diagnostic tools, such asbe-10, al-26, cl-36, mn-53, fe-60, and ni-59, as well as the longer-livedi-129, sm-146, and pu-244. we discuss whether the 35 and 60 kyr-old be-10anomalies observed in the vostok antarctic ice cores could be due to supernovaexplosions. combining our estimates for matter deposition with results ofrecent nucleosynthesis yields, we calculate the expected signal from nearbysupernovae using ice cores back to $\sim 300$ kyr ago, and we discuss usingdeep ocean sediments back to several hundred myr. in particular, we examine theprospects for identifying isotope anomalies due to the geminga supernovaexplosion, and signatures of the possibility that supernovae might have causedone or more biological mass extinctions.

astro-ph;9804232	massive compact halo objects viewed from a cosmological perspective:  contribution to the baryonic mass density of the universe	[abridged] we estimate the contribution of massive compact halo objects(machos) and their stellar progenitors to the mass density of the universe. ifthe machos that have been detected reside in the halo of our galaxy, then asimple extrapolation of the galactic population (out to 50 kpc) of machos tocosmic scales gives a cosmic density $\rho_{macho} = (1-5) \times 10^9 h \msun\mpc^{-3}$, which in terms of the critical density corresponds to$\omega_{macho}=(0.0036-0.017) h^{-1}$. such a mass density is comparable tothe baryon density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis. if we take the centralvalues of the estimates, then machos dominate the baryonic content of theuniverse today, with $\omega_{macho}/\omega_{baryon} \sim 0.7 h$. however, thecumulative uncertainties in the density determinations only require that$\omega_{macho}/\omega_{baryon} \geq 1/6 h f_{gal}$, where the fraction ofgalaxies that contain machos $f_{gal} &gt; 0.17$, and $h$ is the hubble constantin units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$. our best estimate for $\omega_{macho}$is hard to reconcile with the current best estimates of the baryonic content ofthe intergalactic medium indicated by measurements of the lyman-$\alpha$forest. we explore the addition constraints that arise if the machos are whitedwarfs as suggested by the present microlensing data. we discuss the challengesthis scenario presents at both the local and cosmic scales, emphasizing inparticular the constraints on the required mass budget and nucleosynthesisproducts (particularly carbon).

astro-ph;9806186	testing the relation between the local and cosmic star formation  histories	recently, there has been great progress toward observationally determiningthe mean star formation history of the universe. when accurately known, thecosmic star formation rate could provide much information about galacticevolution, if the milky way's star formation rate is representative of theaverage cosmic star formation history. a simple hypothesis is that our localstar formation rate is proportional to the cosmic mean. in addition, to specifya star formation history, one must also adopt an initial mass function (imf);typically it is assumed that the imf is a smooth function which is constant intime. we show how to test directly the compatibility of all these assumptions,by making use of the local (solar neighborhood) star formation record encodedin the present-day stellar mass function. present data suggests that at leastone of the following is false: (1) the local imf is constant in time; (2) thelocal imf is a smooth (unimodal) function; and/or (3) star formation in thegalactic disk was representative of the cosmic mean. we briefly discuss how todetermine which of these assumptions fail, and improvements in observationswhich will sharpen this test.

astro-ph;9809277	the revival of galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis?	because of the roughly linear correlation between be/h and fe/h in lowmetallicity halo stars, it has been argued that a ``primary'' component in thenucleosynthesis of be must be present in addition to the ``secondary''component from standard galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis. in this paper wecritically re-evaluate the evidence for the primary versus secondary characterof li, be, and b evolution, analyzing both in the observations and in galacticchemical evolution models. while it appears that [be/h] versus [fe/h] has alogarithmic slope near 1, it is rather the be-o trend that directly arises fromthe physics of spallation production. using new abundances for oxygen in halostars based on uv oh lines, we find that the be-o slope has a large uncertaintydue to systematic effects, rendering it difficult to distinguish from the databetween the secondary slope of 2 and the primary slope of 1. the possibledifference between the be-fe and be-o slopes is a consequence of the variationin o/fe versus fe: recent data suggests a negative slope rather than zero(i.e., fe $\propto$ o) as is often assumed. in addition to a phenomenologicalanalysis of be and b evolution, we have also examined the predicted libeb, o,and fe trends in galactic chemical evolution models which include outflow.based on our results, it is possible that a good fit to the libeb evolutionrequires only traditional the galactic cosmic ray spallation, and the (primary)neutrino-process contribution to b11. we thus suggest that these two processesmight be sufficient to explain li6, be, and b evolution in the galaxy, withoutthe need for an additional primary source of be and b.

astro-ph;9811183	the evolution of li6 in standard cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis	we review the galactic chemical evolution of li6 and compare these resultswith recent observational determinations of the lithium isotopic ratio. inparticular, we concentrate on so-called standard galactic cosmic-raynucleosynthesis in which li, be, and b are produced (predominantly) by theinelastic scattering of accelerated protons and \alpha's off of cno nuclei inthe ambient interstellar medium. if o/fe is constant at low metallicities, thenthe li6 vs fe/h evolution-as well as be and b vs fe/h-has difficulty inmatching the observations. however, recent determinations of population iioxygen abundances, as measured via oh lines, indicate that o/fe increases atlower metallicity; if this trend is confirmed, then the li6 evolution in astandard model of cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis is consistent with the data. wealso show that another key indicator of li6beb origin is the li6/be ratio whichalso fits the available data if o/fe is not constant at low metallicity.finally we note that li6 evolution in this scenario can strongly constrain thedegree to which li6 and li7 are depleted in halo stars.

astro-ph;9811457	on deep-ocean fe-60 as a fossil of a near-earth supernova	live $^{60}$fe has recently been reported in a deep-ocean ferromanganesecrust. analysis of the isotopic ratios in the sample suggests that the measured$^{60}$fe abundance exceeds the levels generated by terrestrial and cosmogenicsources, and it has been proposed that the excess of $^{60}$fe is a signatureof a supernova that exploded near the earth several myr ago. in this paper, weconsider the possible background sources, and confirm that the measured$^{60}$fe is significantly higher than all known backgrounds, in contrast withthe reported abundance of live $^{53}$mn. we discuss scenarios in which thedata are consistent with a supernova event at a distance $d \sim 30$ pc and anepoch $t_{\rm sn} \sim 5$ myr ago. we propose tests that could confirm orrefute the interpretation of the $^{60}$fe discovery, including searches for$^{10}$be, $^{129}$i and $^{146}$sm. such a nearby supernova event might havehad some impact on the earth's biosphere, principally by enhancing thecosmic-ray flux. this might have damaged the earth's ozone layer, enhancing thepenetration of solar ultraviolet radiation. in this connection, we comment onthe middle miocene and pliocene mini-extinction events. we also speculate onthe possibility of a supernova-induced "cosmic-ray winter," if cosmic rays playa significant role in seeding cloud formation.

astro-ph;9904291	chemical abundance constraints on white dwarfs as halo dark matter	we examine the chemical abundance constraints on a population of white dwarfsin the halo of our galaxy. we are motivated by microlensing evidence formassive compact halo objects (machos) in the galactic halo, but our workconstrains white dwarfs in the halo regardless of what the machos are. we focuson the composition of the material that would be ejected as the white dwarfsare formed; abundance patterns in the ejecta strongly constrain white dwarfproduction scenarios. using both analytical and numerical chemical evolutionmodels, we confirm that very strong constraints come from galactic pop ii andextragalactic carbon abundances. we also point out that depending on thestellar model, significant nitrogen is produced rather than carbon. thecombined constraints from c and n give $\omega_{wd} h &lt; 2 \times 10^{-4}$ fromcomparison with the low c and n abundances in the ly$\alpha$ forest. we note,however, that these results are subject to uncertainties regarding thenucleosynthesis of low-metallicity stars. we thus investigate additionalconstraints from d and $^4$he, finding that these light elements can be keptwithin observational limits only for $\omega_{wd} \la 0.003$ and for a whitedwarf progenitor initial mass function sharply peaked at low mass (2$m_\odot$).finally, we consider a galactic wind, which is required to remove the ejectaaccompanying white dwarf production from the galaxy. we show that such a windcan be driven by type ia supernovae arising from the white dwarfs themselves,but these supernovae also lead to unacceptably large abundances of iron. weconclude that abundance constraints exclude white dwarfs as machos.

astro-ph;9911320	testing spallation processes with beryllium and boron	the nucleosynthesis of be and b by spallation processes provides uniqueinsight into the origin of cosmic rays. namely, different spallation schemespredict sharply different trends for the growth of libeb abundances withrespect to oxygen. ``primary'' mechanisms predict beb $\propto$ o, and are wellmotivated by the data if o/fe is constant at low metallicity. in contrast,``secondary'' mechanisms predict beb $\propto$ o$^2$ and are consistent withthe data if o/fe increases towards low metallicity as some recent data suggest.clearly, any primary mechanism, if operative, will dominate early in thehistory of the galaxy. in this paper, we fit the beb data to a two-componentscheme which includes both primary and secondary trends. in this way, the datacan be used to probe the period in which primary mechanisms are effective. weanalyze the data using consistent stellar atmospheric parameters based onbalmer line data and the continuum infrared flux. results depend sensitively onpop ii o abundances and, unfortunately, on the choice of stellar parameters.when using recent results which show o/fe increasing toward lower metallicity,a two-component be-o fits indicates that primary and secondary componentscontribute equally at [o/h]$_{eq}$ = -1.8 for balmer line data; and[o/h]$_{eq}$ = -1.4 to -1.8 for irfm. we apply these constraints to recentmodels for libeb origin. the balmer line data does not show any evidence forprimary production. on the other hand, the irfm data does indicate a preferencefor a two-component model, such as a combination of standard gcr andmetal-enriched particles accelerated in superbubbles. these conclusions rely ona detailed understanding of the abundance data including systematic effectswhich may alter the derived o-fe and beb-fe relations.

hep-ph;0406001	imaging the earth's interior: the angular distribution of terrestrial  neutrinos	decays of radionuclides throughout the earth's interior produce geothermalheat, but also are a source of antineutrinos. the (angle-integrated)geoneutrino flux places an integral constraint on the terrestrial radionuclidedistribution. in this paper, we calculate the angular distribution ofgeoneutrinos, which opens a window on the differential radionuclidedistribution. we develop the general formalism for the neutrino angulardistribution, and we present the inverse transformation which recovers theterrestrial radioisotope distribution given a measurement of the neutrinoangular distribution. thus, geoneutrinos not only allow a means to image theearth's interior, but offering a direct measure of the radioactive earth, both(1) revealing the earth's inner structure as probed by radionuclides, and (2)allowing for a complete determination of the radioactive heat generation as afunction of radius. we present the geoneutrino angular distribution for thefavored earth model which has been used to calculate geoneutrino flux. in thismodel the neutrino generation is dominated by decays in the earth's mantle andcrust; this leads to a very ``peripheral'' angular distribution, in which 2/3of the neutrinos come from angles &gt; 60 degrees away from the downward vertical.we note the possibility of that the earth's core contains potassium; differentgeophysical predictions lead to strongly varying, and hence distinguishable,central intensities (&lt; 30 degrees from the downward vertical). otheruncertainties in the models, and prospects for observation of the geoneutrinoangular distribution, are briefly discussed. we conclude by urging thedevelopment and construction of antineutrino experiments with angularsensitivity.

hep-ph;0509136	probing the earth's interior with a large-volume liquid scintillator  detector	a future large-volume liquid scintillator detector would provide ahigh-statistics measurement of terrestrial antineutrinos originating from$\beta$-decays of the uranium and thorium chains. in addition, the forwarddisplacement of the neutron in the detection reaction $\bar\nu_e+p\to n+e^+$provides directional information. we investigate the requirements on suchdetectors to distinguish between certain geophysical models on the basis of theangular dependence of the geoneutrino flux. our analysis is based on amonte-carlo simulation with different levels of light yield, considering bothunloaded and gadolinium-loaded scintillators. we find that a 50 kt detectorsuch as the proposed lena (low energy neutrino astronomy) will detectdeviations from isotropy of the geoneutrino flux significantly. however, withan unloaded scintillator the time needed for a useful discrimination betweendifferent geophysical models is too large if one uses the directionalinformation alone. a gd-loaded scintillator improves the situationconsiderably, although a 50 kt detector would still need several decades todistinguish between a geophysical reference model and one with a large neutrinosource in the earth's core. however, a high-statistics measurement of the totalgeoneutrino flux and its spectrum still provides an extremely useful glance atthe earth's interior.
