0908.2451	the evolution of the high-energy cut-off in the x-ray spectrum of the gx  339-4 across a hard-to-soft transition	we report on x-ray observations of the black-hole candidate gx 339-4 duringits 2006/2007 outburst. the hardness-intensity diagram of all rxte/pca datacombined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.the evolution through the hid suggests that in the early phase of the outburstthe source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the softstate, which is supported by our timing analysis. broadband (4-200 kev)spectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hardspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the softstate. the high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 kev duringthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 kev during thesoftening in the hard intermediate state. in the short-lived soft intermediatestate the cutoff energy was ~ 130 kev, but was no longer detected in the softstate. this is one of the first times that the high-energy cut-off has beenfollowed in such detail across several state transitions. we find that incomparison to several other spectral parameters, the cut-off energy changesmore rapidly, just like the timing properties. the observed behaviour of thehigh energy cutoff of gx 339-4 is also similar to that observed withrxte-integral-swift during the 2005 outburst of gro j1655-40. these resultsconstitute a valuable reference to be considered when testing theoreticalmodels for the production of the hard component in these systems.

1001.4406	the complex behaviour of the microquasar grs 1915+105 in the rho class  observed with bepposax. i: timing analysis	grs 1915+105 was observed by bepposax for about 10 days in october 2000. forabout 80% of the time, the source was in the variability class $\rho$,characterised by a series of recurrent bursts. we describe the results of thetiming analysis performed on the mecs (1.6--10 kev) and pds (15--100 kev) data.the x-ray count rate from \grss showed an increasing trend with differentcharacteristics in the various energy bands. fourier and wavelet analysesdetect a variation in the recurrence time of the bursts, from 45--50 s to about75 s, which appear well correlated with the count rate. from the powerdistribution of peaks in fourier periodograms and wavelet spectra, wedistinguished between the {\it regular} and {\it irregular} variability modesof the $\rho$ class, which are related to variations in the count rate in the3--10 kev range. we identified two components in the burst structure: the slowleading trail, and the pulse, superimposed on a rather stable level. we foundthat the change in the recurrence time of the regular mode is caused by theslow leading trails, while the duration of the pulse phase remains far morestable. the evolution in the mean count rates shows that the time behaviour ofboth the leading trail and the baseline level are very similar to thoseobserved in the 1.6--3 and 15--100 kev ranges, while that of the pulse followsthe peak number. these differences in the time behaviour and count rates atdifferent energies indicate that the process responsible for the pulses mustproduce the strongest emission between 3 and 10 kev, while that associated withboth the leading trail and the baseline dominates at lower and higher energies

1002.3740	the intriguing nature of the high energy gamma ray source xssj12270-4859	the nature of the hard x-ray source xssj12270-4859 is still unclear though itwas claimed to be a magnetic cataclysmic variable. we here present a broad-bandx-ray and gamma ray study based on a recent xmm-newton observation and archivalintegral and rxte data. from the fermi/lat 1-year point source catalogue, wetentatively associate xssj12270-4859 with 1fglj1227.9-4852, a source of highenergy gamma rays with emission up to 10gev. we complement the study with uvphotometry from xmm-newton and ground-based optical and near-ir photometry. thex-ray emission is highly variable showing flares and intensity dips. the x-rayflares consist of flare-dip pairs. flares are also detected in the uv range butnot the dips. aperiodic dipping behaviour is also observed during x-rayquiescence but not in the uv. the 0.2-100kev spectrum is featureless anddescribed by a power law model with gamma=1.7. the 100mev-10gev spectrum isinstead represented by a power law index of 2.45. the luminosity ratio between0.1-100gev and 0.2--100kev is ~0.8, hence the gev emission is a significantcomponent of the total energy output. furthermore, the x-ray spectrum does notgreatly change during flares, quiescence and the dips seen in quiescence but ithardens during the post-flare dips. optical photometry reveals a period of4.32hr likely related to the binary orbit. near-ir, possibly ellipsoidal,variations are detected. large amplitude variability on shorter (tens mins)timescales are found to be non-periodic. the observed variability at allwavelengths and the spectral characteristics strongly favour a low-massatypical low-luminosity x-ray binary and are against a cataclysmic variablenature. the association with a fermi/lat high energy gamma ray source furtherstrengths this interpretation.

1004.1066	investigating the disc-jet coupling in accreting compact objects using  the black hole candidate swift j1753.5-0127	in studies of accreting black holes in binary systems, empirical relationshave been proposed to quantify the coupling between accretion processes andejection mechanisms. these processes are probed respectively by means of x-rayand radio/optical-infrared observations. the relations predict, given certainaccretion conditions, the expected energy output in the form of a jet. weinvestigated this coupling by studying the black hole candidate swiftj1753.5-0127, via multiwavelength coordinated observations over a period of ~4years. we present the results of our campaign showing that, all along theoutburst, the source features a jet that is fainter than expected from theempirical correlation between the radio and the x-ray luminosities in hardspectral state. because the jet is so weak in this system the near-infraredemission is, unusually for this state and luminosity, dominated by thermalemission from the accretion disc. we briefly discuss the importance and theimplications of a precise determination of both the slope and the normalisationof the correlations, listing some possible parameters that broadband jet modelsshould take into account to explain the population of sources characterized bya dim jet. we also investigate whether our data can give any hint about thenature of the compact object in the system, since its mass has not beendynamically measured.

1104.4264	spectral states evolution of 4u 1728-34 observed by integral and rxte:  non-thermal component detection	we report results of a one-year monitoring of the low mass x-ray binary(lmxb) source (atoll type) 4u 1728-34 with integral and rxte. three timeintervals were covered by integral, during which the source showed strongspectral evolution. we studied the broad-band x-ray spectra in detail byfitting several models in the different sections of the hardness-intensitydiagram. the soft states are characterised by prominent blackbody emission plusa contribution from a comptonized emission. the hard states are characterisedby the presence of an excess flux with respect to the comptonization modelabove 50 kev while the soft component is fainter. to obtain an acceptable fitto the data this excess is modeled either with a power law with photon indexgamma ~ 2 or a comptonization (compps) spectrum implying the presence of hybridthermal and non-thermal electrons in a corona. this makes 4u 1728-34 one of thefew lmxbs of atoll type showing non-thermal emission at high energy. from ouranalysis, it is also apparent that the presence of the hard tail is moreprominent as the overall spectrum becames harder. we discuss also alternativemodels which can discribe these hard states.

0712.0456	two years of integral monitoring of grs 1915+105 part 1: multiwavelength  coverage with integral, rxte, and the ryle radio telescope	(abridged) we report the results of monitoring observations of the galacticmicroquasar grs 1915+105 performed simultaneously with integral and rxte ryle .we present the results of the whole \integral campaign, report the sources thatare detected and their fluxes and identify the classes of variability in whichgrs 1915+105 is found. the accretion ejection connections are studied in amodel independent manner through the source light curves, hardness ratio, andcolor color diagrams. during a period of steady ``hard'' x-ray state (theso-called class chi) we observe a steady radio flux. we then turn to 3particular observations during which we observe several types of soft x-raydips and spikes cycles, followed by radio flares. during these observations grs1915+105 is in the so-called nu, lambda, and beta classes of variability. theobservation of ejections during class lambda are the first ever reported. wegeneralize the fact that a (non-major) discrete ejection always occurs, in grs1915+105, as a response to an x-ray sequence composed of a spectrally hardx-ray dip terminated by an x-ray spike marking the disappearance of the hardx-ray emission above 18 kev. we also identify the trigger of the ejection asthis x-ray spike. a possible correlation between the amplitude of the radioflare and the duration of the x-ray dip is found in our data. in this case thex-ray dips prior to ejections could be seen as the time during which the sourceaccumulates energy and material that is ejected later.

1211.2933	testing reflection features in 4u 1705-44 with xmm-newton, bepposax and  rxte in the hard and soft state	we use data of the bright atoll source 4u 1705-44 taken with xmm-newton,bepposax and rxte both in the hard and in the soft state to perform aself-consistent study of the reflection component in this source. although thedata from these x-ray observatories are not simultaneous, the spectraldecomposition is shown to be consistent among the different observations, whenthe source flux is similar. we therefore select observations performed atsimilar flux levels in the hard and soft state in order to study the spectralshape in these two states in a broad band (0.1-200 kev) energy range, with goodenergy resolution, and using self-consistent reflection models. thesereflection models provide a good fit for the x-ray spectrum both in the hardand in the soft state in the whole spectral range. we discuss the differencesin the main spectral parameters we find in the hard and the soft state,respectively, providing evidence that the inner radius of the optically thickdisk slightly recedes in the hard state.

1212.1615	x-ray follow-ups of xssj12270-4859: a low-mass x-ray binary with gamma  ray fermi-lat association	xssj1227.0-4859 is a peculiar, hard x-ray source recently positionallyassociated to the fermi-lat source 1fglj1227.9-4852/2fglj1227.7-4853.multi-wavelength observations have added information on this source, indicatinga low-luminosity low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb), but its nature is still unclear.to progress in our understanding, we present new x-ray data from a monitoringcampaign performed in 2011 with the xmm-newton, rxte, and swift satellites andcombine them with new gamma-ray data from the fermi and agile satellites. wecomplement the study with simultaneous near-uv photometry from xmm-newton andwith previous uv/optical and near-ir data. the x-ray history of xssj1227.0-4859over 7yr shows a persistent and rather stable low-luminosity (~6x10^33d_{1\,kpc}^2 erg/s) source, with flares and dips being peculiar and permanentcharacteristics. the associated fermi-lat source 2fglj1227.7-4853 is alsostable over an overlapping period of 4.7\,yr. searches for x-ray fastpulsations down to msec give upper limits to pulse fractional amplitudes of15-25% that do not rule out a fast spinning pulsar. the combineduv/optical/near-ir spectrum reveals a hot component at ~13\,kk and a cool oneat ~4.6\,kk. the latter would suggest a late-type k2-k5 companion star, adistance range of1.4--3.6kpc and an orbital period of 7--9 h. a near-uvvariability (&gt;6\,h) also suggests a longer orbital period than previouslyestimated. the analysis shows that the x-ray and uv/optical/near-ir emissionsare more compatible with an accretion-powered compact object than with arotational powered pulsar. the x-ray to uv bolometric luminosity ratio could beconsistent with a binary hosting a neutron star, but the uncertainties in theradio data may also allow an lmxb black hole with a compact jet. in this caseit would be the first associated with a high-energy gamma-ray source.

1303.6901	vlbi observations of the shortest orbital period black hole binary, maxi  j1659-152	the x-ray transient maxi j1659-152 was discovered by swift/bat and it wasinitially identified as a grb. soon its galactic origin and binary nature wereestablished. there exists a wealth of multi-wavelength monitoring data for thissource, providing a great coverage of the full x-ray transition in thiscandidate black hole binary system. we obtained two epochs of european vlbinetwork (evn) electronic-vlbi (e-vlbi) and four epochs of very long baselinearray (vlba) data of maxi j1659-152 which show evidence for outflow in theearly phases. the overall source properties (polarization, milliarcsecond-scaleradio structure, flat radio spectrum) are described well with the presence of acompact jet in the system through the transition from the hard-intermediate tothe soft x-ray spectral state. the apparent dependence of source size and theradio core position on the observed flux density (luminosity dependent coreshift) support this interpretation as well. we see no evidence for majordiscrete ejecta during the outburst. for the source proper motion we derive 2sigma upper limits of 115 microas/day in right ascension, and 37 microas/day indeclination, over a time baseline of 12 days. these correspond to velocities of1400 km/s and 440 km/s, respectively, assuming a source distance of 7 kpc.

1308.1282	x-ray variability and energy spectra from ngc5408 x-1 with xmm-newton	the notion of source states characterizing the x-ray emission from black holebinaries has revealed to be a very useful tool to disentangle the complexspectral and aperiodic phenomenology displayed by those classes of accretingobjects. we seek to use the same tools for ultra-luminous x-ray (ulx) sources.we analyzed the data from the longest observations obtained from the ulx sourcein ngc 5408 (ngc 5408 x-1) taken by xmm-newton. we performed a study of thetiming and spectral properties of the source. in accordance with previousstudies on similar sources, the intrinsic energy spectra of the source are welldescribed by a cold accretion disc emission plus a curved high-energy emissioncomponent. we studied the broad-band noise variability of the source and foundan anti-correlation between the root mean square variability in the0.0001-0.2hz and intensity, similarly to what is observed in black-holebinaries during the hard states. we discuss the physical processes responsiblefor the x-ray features observed and suggest that ngc 5408 x-1 harbors a blackhole accreting in an unusual bright hard-intermediate state.

1309.6101	quasi-periodic oscillations and energy spectra from the two brightest  ultra-luminous x-ray sources in m82	ultra-luminous x-ray sources are thought to be accreting black holes thatmight host intermediate mass black holes (imbh), proposed to exist bytheoretical studies, even though a firm detection (as a class) is stillmissing. the brightest ulx in m82 (m82 x-1) is probably one of the bestcandidates to host an imbh. in this work we analyzed the data of the recentrelease of observations obtained from m82 x-1 taken by xmm-newton. we performeda study of the timing and spectral properties of the source. we report on thedetection of (46+-2) mhz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in the powerdensity spectra of two observations. a comparison of the frequency of thesehigh-frequency qpos with previous detections supports the 1:2:3 frequencydistribution as suggested in other studies. we discuss the implications if the(46+-2) mhz qpo detected in m82 x-1 is the fundamental harmonic, in analogywith the high-frequency qpos observed in black hole binaries. for one of theobservations we have detected for the first time a qpo at 8 mhz (albeit at alow significance), that coincides with a hardening of the spectrum. we suggestthat the qpo is a milli-hertz qpo originating from the close-by transient ulxm82 x-2, with analogies to the low-frequency qpos observed in black holebinaries.

1310.0042	time lags in the ultraluminous x-ray source ngc 5408 x-1: implications  for the black hole mass	we present the analysis of the x-ray variability and spectral timingproperties of the ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) ngc 5408 x-1, one of themost variable ulxs known so far. the variability properties are used as adiagnostic of the accretion state of the source and to derive estimates of theblack hole (bh) mass. the observed high level of fast x-ray variability(fractional root-mean-square variability - rms - amplitude of $\sim$ 30 percentin the hard energy band), the hardening of the fractional rms spectrum, and theproperties of the qpo, all resemble those of a source in a hard-intermediateaccretion state. we confirm the previous detection of a soft lag in the x-raylight curves of the source during 2006 and 2008 observations and find that thesoft lag is still present in the more recent 2010/2011 observations. using theentire available xmm-newton data set (public as of february 2012) we observethat the soft lag (of few seconds amplitude) is detected over a relativelylarge range of frequencies ($\nu \sim 5-90$ mhz), which always includes the qpofrequencies. the soft lag displays energy-dependence, with the (absolute)amplitude increasing as a function of energy separation. we find closeanalogies with soft lags associated to type-c qpos in bh binary systems(although an association to other types of qpos cannot be completely excluded),as well as with reverberation lags observed in agn. in both cases anintermediate mass bh (imbh) solution appears the most plausible.

1312.3114	black hole spin measurements through the relativistic precession model:  xte j1550-564	we present a systematic analysis of the complete set of observations of theblack hole (bh) binary xte j1550-564 obtained by the rossi x-ray timingexplorer. we study the fast time variability properties of the source anddetermine the spin of the black hole through the relativistic precession model.similarly to what is observed in the bh binary gro j1655-40, the frequencies ofthe qpos and broad band noise components match the general relativisticfrequencies of particle motion close to the compact object predicted by therelativistic precession model. the combination of two simultaneously observedquasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) frequencies together with the dynamical bhmass from optical/infrared observations yields a spin equal to a = 0.34 +/-0.01, consistent with previous determinations from x-ray spectroscopy. based onthe derived bh parameters, the low frequency qpo emission radii vary from about30 gravitational radii to the innermost stable orbit for this spin (about 5gravitational radii), where they sharply disappear as observed for the case ofgro j1655-40.

1404.7293	geometrical constraints on the origin of timing signals from black holes	we present a systematic study of the orbital inclination effects onblack-hole transients fast time-variability properties. we have considered allthe black-hole binaries that have been densely monitored by the rossi xtesatellite. we find that the amplitude of low-frequency quasi periodicoscillations (qpos) depends on the orbital inclination. type-c qpos arestronger for nearly edge-on systems (high inclination), while type-b qpos arestronger when the accretion disk is closer to face-on (low inclination). ourresults also suggest that the noise associated with type-c qpos is consistentwith being stronger for low-inclination sources, while the noise associated totype-b qpos seems inclination independent. these results are consistent with ageometric origin of the type-c qpos - for instance arising from relativisticprecession of the inner flow within a truncated disk - while the noise wouldcorrespond to intrinsic brightness variability from mass accretion ratefluctuations in the accretion flow. the opposite behavior of type-b qpos -stronger in low inclinations sources - supports the hypothesis that type-b qposare related to the jet, the power of which is the most obvious measurableparameter expected to be stronger in nearly face-on sources.

1408.6526	the large observatory for x-ray timing	the large observatory for x-ray timing (loft) was studied within esa m3cosmic vision framework and participated in the final down-selection for alaunch slot in 2022-2024. thanks to the unprecedented combination of effectivearea and spectral resolution of its main instrument, loft will study thebehaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitationalfield in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes andneutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutronstars. the science payload is based on a large area detector (lad, 10 m 2effective area, 2-30 kev, 240 ev spectral resolution, 1 deg collimated field ofview) and a widefield monitor (wfm, 2-50 kev, 4 steradian field of view, 1arcmin source location accuracy, 300 ev spectral resolution). the wfm isequipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. grb) localization. thetrigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30s from discovery. in this paper we present the status of the mission at the endof its phase a study.

1410.0135	millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations and broad iron line from lmc x-1	we study the temporal and energy spectral characteristics of the persistentblack hole x-ray binary lmc x-1 using two xmm-newton and a suzaku observation.we report the discovery of low frequency (~ 26-29 mhz) quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos). we also report the variablity of the broad iron k-alphaline studied earlier with suzaku. the qpos are found to be weak with fractionalrms amplitude in the ~ 1-2 % range and quality factor q~2-10 . they areaccompanied by weak red noise or zero-centered lorentzian components with rmsvariability at the ~ 1-3 % level. the energy spectra consists of three varyingcomponents - multicolour disk blackbody (kt_{in} ~ 0.7-0.9 kev), high energypower-law tail (gamma ~ 2.4 - 3.3) and a broad iron line at 6.4-6.9 kev. thebroad iron line, the qpo and the strong power-law component are not alwayspresent. the qpos and the broad iron line appear to be clearly detected in thepresence of a strong power-law component. the broad iron line is found to beweaker when the disk is likely truncated and absent when the power-lawcomponent almost vanished. these results suggest that the qpo and the broadiron line together can be used to probe the dynamics of the accretion disk andthe corona.

0804.0148	studying the x-ray hysteresis in gx 339-4: the disc and iron line over  one decade	we report on a comprehensive and consistent investigation into the x-rayemission from gx 339-4. all public observations in the 11 year rxte archivewere analysed. three different types of model - single powerlaw, brokenpowerlaw and a disc + powerlaw - were fitted to investigate the evolution ofthe disc, along with a fixed gaussian component at 6.4 kev to investigate anyiron line in the spectrum. we show that the relative variation in flux andx-ray colour between the two best sampled outbursts are very similar. the decayof the disc temperature during the outburst is clearly seen in the soft state.the expected decay is s_disc \propto t^4; we measure t^4.75\pm0.23. thisimplies that the inner disc radius is approximately constant in the soft state.we also show a significant anti-correlation between the iron line significantwidth and the x-ray flux in the soft state while in the hard state the ew isindependent of the flux. this results in hysteresis in the relation betweenx-ray flux and both line flux and ew. to compare the x-ray binary outburst tothe behaviour seen in agn, we construct a disc fraction luminosity diagram forgx 339-4, the first for an x-ray binary. the shape qualitatively matches thatproduced for agn. linking this with the radio emission from gx 339-4 the changein radio spectrum between the disc and power-law dominated states is clearlyvisible.

0804.3445	bright flares from the x-ray pulsar swift j1626.6-5156	we have performed a timing and spectral analysis of the x-ray pulsar swiftj1626.6-5156 during a major x-ray outburst in order to unveil its nature andinvestigate its flaring activity. epoch- and pulse-folding techniques were usedto derive the spin period. time-average and pulse-phase spectroscopy wereemployed to study the spectral variability in the flare and out-of-flare statesand energy variations with pulse phase. power spectra were obtained toinvestigate the periodic and aperiodic variability. two large flares, with aduration of ~450 seconds were observed on 24 and 25 december 2005. during theflares, the x-ray intensity increased by a factor of 3.5, while thepeak-to-peak pulsed amplitude increased from 45% to 70%. a third, smaller flareof duration ~180 s was observed on 27 december 2005. the flares seen in swiftj1626.6-5156 constitute the shortest events of this kind ever reported in ahigh-mass x-ray binary. in addition to the flaring activity, strong x-raypulsations with pspin=15.3714+-0.0003 s characterise the x-ray emission inswift j1626.6-5156. after the major outburst, the light curve exhibits stronglong-term variations modulated with a 45-day period. we relate this modulationto the orbital period of the system or to a harmonic. power density spectrashow, in addition to the harmonic components of the pulsation, strongband-limited noise with an integrated 0.01-100 hz fractional rms of around 40%that increased to 64% during the flares. a weak qpo (fractional rms 4.7%) withcharacteristic frequency of 1 hz was detected in the non-flare emission. thetiming (short x-ray pulsations, long orbital period) and spectral (power-lawwith cut off energy and neutral iron line) properties of swift j1626.6-5156 arecharacteristic of be/x-ray binaries.

0805.3919	a swift gaze into the 2006 march 29th burst forest of sgr 1900+14	we report on the intense burst ``forest'' recorded on 2006 march 29 whichlasted for ~30s. more than 40 bursts were detected both by bat and by xrt,seven of which are rare intermediate flares (ifs): several times 10^{42} ergswere released. the bat data were used to carry out time-resolved spectroscopyin the 14-100kev range down to 8ms timescales.  this unique dataset allowed us to test the magnetar model predictions such asthe magnetically trapped fireball and the twisted magnetosphere over anunprecedented range of fluxes and with large statistics (in terms of bothphotons and ifs). we confirmed that a two blackbody component fits adequatelythe time-resolved and integrated spectra of ifs. however, comptonization modelsgive comparable good reduced chi^2. moreover, we found: i) a change ofbehavior, around ~10^{41} erg/s, above which the softer blackbody shows a sortof saturation while the harder one still grows to a few times 10^{41} erg/s;ii) a rather sharp correlation between temperature and radii of the blackbodies(r^2 prop kt^{-3}), which holds for the most luminous parts of the flares(approximately for l_{tot} &gt; 10^{41} erg/s). within the magnetar model, themajority of these findings can be accounted for in terms of thermalisedemission from the e-mode and o-mode photospheres. interestingly, the maximumobserved luminosity coming from a region of ~15km matches the magneticeddington luminosity at the same radius, for a surface dipole field of ~8 x10^{14} g (virtually equal to the one deduced from the spindown of sgr1900+14).

1509.08706	is 4u 0114+65 an eclipsing hmxb?	we present the pulsation and spectral characteristics of the hmxb 4u 0114+65during a \emph{suzaku} observation covering the part of the orbit that includedthe previously known low intensity emission of the source (dip) and the egressfrom this state. this dip has been interpreted in previous works as an x-rayeclipse. notably, in this suzaku observation, the count rate during and outsidethe dip vary by a factor of only 2-4 at odds with the eclipses of other hmxbs,where the intensity drops upto two orders of magnitude. the orbital intensityprofile of 4u 0114+65 is characterized by a narrow dip in the rxte-asm (2-12\rm{kev}) light curve and a shallower one in the swift-bat (15-50 \rm{kev}),which is different from eclipse ingress/egress behaviour of other hmxbs. thetime-resolved spectral analysis reveal moderate absorption column density(n$_{h}$ - 2-20 $\times$ $10^{22}$ atoms $cm^{-2}$) and a relatively lowequivalent width ($\sim$ 30 \rm{ev} \&amp; 12 \rm{ev} of the iron k$_\alpha$ andk$_\beta$ lines respectively) as opposed to the typical x-ray spectra of hmxbsduring eclipse where the equivalent width is $\sim$ 1 \rm{kev}. both xis andpin data show clear pulsations during the dip, which we have further confirmedusing the entire archival data of the ibis/isgri and jem-x instruments onboard\emph{integral}. the results we presented question the previous interpretationof the dip in the light curve of 4u 0114+65 as an x-ray eclipse. we thusdiscuss alternative interpretations of the periodic dip in the light curve of4u 0114+65.

0807.1018	spectral variability of gx 339-4 in a hard-to-soft state transition	we report on integral observations of the bright black-hole transient gx339-4 performed during the period august-september 2004. our data cover threedifferent spectral states, namely hard/intermediate state, soft/intermediatestate and high/soft state. we investigate the spectral variability of thesource across the different spectral states. the hard x-ray spectrum becomessofter during the hims-to-sims transition, but it hardens when reaching the hssstate. a principal component analysis demonstrates that most of the variabilityoccurs through two independent modes: a pivoting of the spectrum around 6 kev(responsible for 75% of the variance) and an intensity variation of the hardcomponent (responsible for 21%). the pivoting is interpreted as due to changesin the soft cooling photon flux entering the corona, the second mode asfluctuations of the heating rate in the corona. our spectral analysis of thespectra of gx 339-4 shows a high energy excess with respect to pure thermalcomptonisation models in the hims: a non-thermal power-law component seems tobe requested by data. in all spectral states joint ibis, spi and jem-x data arewell represented by hybrid thermal/non-thermal comptonisation (eqpair). thespectral evolution seems to be predominantly driven by a reduction of the ratioof the electron heating rate to the soft cooling photon flux in the corona,l_h/l_s. the inferred accretion disc soft thermal emission increases by abouttwo orders of magnitude, while the comptonised luminosity decreases by at mosta factor of 3. this confirms that the softening we observed is due to a majorincrease in the flux of soft cooling photons in the corona associated with amodest reduction of the electron heating rate.

astro-ph;0001103	a model-independent analysis of the variability of grs 1915+105	we analyzed 163 observations of the microquasar grs 1915+105 made with therossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) in the period 1996-1997. for eachobservation, we produced light curves and color-color diagrams. we classifiedthe observations in 12 separate classes, based on their count rate and colorcharacteristics. from the analysis of these classes, we reduced the variabilityof the source to transitions between three basic states: a hard statecorresponding to the non-observability of the innermost parts of the accretiondisk, and two softer states with a fully observable disk. these two soft statesrepresent different temperatures of the accretion disk, related to differentlocal values of the accretion rate. the transitions between these states can beextremely fast. the source moves between these three states following certainpatterns and avoiding others, giving rise to a relatively large but limitednumber of variability classes. these results are the first step towards alinking of the properties of this exceptional source with standard black-holesystems and with accretion disk models.

astro-ph;0005565	unusual quiescent x-ray activity from xte j0421+560 (ci cam)	we report on bepposax observations of the x-ray transient xte j0421+560 inquiescence 156, 541, and ~690 days after the maximum of the 1998 apriloutburst. in the first observation the source was soft with a power-law photonindex of 4.0 (+1.9 -0.9) and absorption, nh, of (1.1 +4.9 -1.1) x 10^21atom/cm2. in the second observation, the source brightened by a factor ~15 inthe 1-10 kev energy range, became significantly harder with a photon index of1.86 (+0.27 -0.32) and was strongly absorbed with nh = (4.0 +/- 0.8) x 10^23atom/cm2. there is evidence for a narrow emission line in both spectra at \~7kev. in the third observation, the source had faded by a factor ~$8 from theprevious observation to below the bepposax detection level. it is possible thatthese variations result from orbital motion of a compact object around the b[e]star companion with the intense, absorbed, spectrum arising during passagethrough dense circumstellar material. if this is the case, the system may becontinuing to exhibit periodic activity.

astro-ph;0008118	relativistic iron emission and disk reflection in galactic microquasar  xte j1748-288	we report evidence for an fe k-alpha fluorescence line feature and diskreflection in the very high, high, and low state x-ray spectra of the galacticmicroquasar xte j1748-288 during its june~1998 outburst. spectral analyses aremade on data gathered throughout the outburst by the rossi x-ray timingexplorer proportional counter array. gaussian line, relativistic disk emissionline, and ionized disk reflection models are fit to the data. in the very highstate the line profile appears strongly redshifted, consistent with diskemission from the innermost stable orbits around a maximally rotating kerrblack hole. in the high state the line profile is less redshifted andincreasingly prominent. the low state line profile is very strong (~0.5 kevequivalent width) and centered at 6.7 +/- 0.10 kev; disk line emission modelfits indicate that the inner edge of the disk fluctuates between ~20 and ~100gravitational radii in this state. the disk reflection fraction is tracedthrough the outburst; reflection from an ionized disk is preferred in the vhsand hs, and reflection from a relatively neutral disk is preferred in the ls.we discuss the implications of our findings for the binary system dynamics andaccretion flow geometry in xte j1748-288.

astro-ph;0107199	a measurement of the broad-band spectrum of xte j1118+480 with bepposax  and its astrophysical implications	we report on results of a target of opportunity observation of the x-raytransient xte j1118+480 performed on 2000 april 14-15 with the narrow fieldinstruments (0.1-200 kev) of the sax satellite. the measured spectrum is apower law with a photon index of ~1.7 modified by an ultrasoft x-ray excess anda high-energy cutoff above ~100 kev. the soft excess is consistent with ablackbody with temperature of ~40 ev and a low flux, while the cut-off powerlaw is well fitted by thermal comptonization in a plasma with an electrontemperature of 100 kev and an optical depth of order of unity. consistent withthe weakness of the blackbody, compton reflection is weak. though the data areconsistent with various geometries of the hot and cold phases of the accretinggas, we conclude that a hot accretion disk is the most plausible model. theeddington ratio implied by recent estimates of the mass and the distance isabout 10^{-3}, which may indicate that advection is probably not the dominantcooling mechanism. we finally suggest that the reflecting medium has a lowmetallicity, consistent with location of the system in the halo.

astro-ph;0107480	the x-ray emission of the intermediate polar v709 cas	we present rxte and bepposax observations of the intermediate polar v709 casacquired in 1997 and 1998 respectively. the x-ray emission from 0.1 to 30kev isdominated by the strong pulsation at the rotational period of the white dwarf(312.8s) with no sign of orbital or sideband periodicity, thus confirmingprevious rosat results. however, we detect changes in the power spectra betweenthe two epochs. while the second harmonic of the spin period is present duringboth observations, the first harmonic is absent in 1997. an increase in theamplitude of the spin pulsation is found between 1997 and 1998 together with adecrease in the x-ray flux. the average x-ray spectrum from 0.1 to 100kev iswell described by an isothermal plasma at ~27kev plus complex absorption and aniron k(alpha) fluorescent line, due to reflection from the white dwarf surface.the rotational pulsation is compatible with complex absorption dominating thelow energy range, while the high energy spin modulation can be attributed totall shocks above the accreting poles. the rxte spectrum in 1997 also shows thepresence of an absorption edge from ionized iron likely located in thepre-shock accretion flow. the variations along the spin period of the partialcovering absorber and of reflection are compatible with the classical accretioncurtain scenario. the variations in the spin pulse characteristics and x-rayflux indicate that v709 cas experiences changes in the mass accretion rate ontimescales from months to years.

astro-ph;0112485	the 1998 outburst of the x-ray transient xte j2012+381 as observed with  bepposax	we report on the results of a series of x-ray observations of the transientblack hole candidate xte j2012+381 during the 1998 outburst performed with thebepposax satellite. the observed broad-band energy spectrum can be describedwith the superposition of an absorbed disk black body, an iron line plus a highenergy component, modelled with either a power law or a comptonisation tail.the source showed pronounced spectral variability between our fiveobservations. while the soft component in the spectrum remained almostunchanged throughout our campaign, we detected a hard spectral tail whichextended to 200 kev in the first two observations, but became barely detectableup to 50 kev in the following two. a further re-hardening is observed in thefinal observation. the transition from a hard to a soft and then back to a hardstate occurred around an unabsorbed 0.1-200 kev luminosity of 10^38 erg/s (at10 kpc). this indicates that state transitions in xte 2012+281 are probably notdriven only by mass accretion rate, but additional physical parameters mustplay a role in the evolution of the outburst.

astro-ph;0306256	the optical and x-ray flickering of xte j1118+480	we use both time-domain and fourier techniques to study the correlatedoptical and x-rays variability in the black hole x-ray nova xte j1118+480. itsx-ray timing properties, such as the shape of the x-ray power spectrum andcross-correlation functions (ccfs) between x-ray energy bands, the slightdecrease of rms variability from 30 % in the 2-5.9 kev to 19 % in the15.5--44.4 kev band, as well as the x-ray hardness/flux anti-correlation, arevery similar to what is found in other black hole binaries in the hard state.the optical/x-ray ccf is virtually independent of the x-ray energies. theoptical flux appears to be correlated not only with the x-ray flux but alsowith the x-ray spectral variability. both the coherence function and the lagsbetween optical and the x-rays are fourier frequency dependent. theoptical/x-ray coherence function reaches its maximum (~0.3) in the 0.1-1 hzrange and the time-lags decrease with frequency approximatively like f^-0.8.the correlation between x-ray and optical light curves appears to havetime-scale-invariant properties. the x-ray/optical ccf maintains a similar butrescaled shape on time-scales ranging at least from 0.1 s to few 10 s. usingthe event superposition method we show that the correlation is not triggered bya single type of event (dip or flare) in the light curves. instead, optical andx-ray fluctuations of very different shapes, amplitudes and time-scales arecorrelated in a similar mode where the optical light curve is seemingly relatedto the time derivative of the x-rays.

astro-ph;0307394	chandra/hetgs spectroscopy of the galactic black hole gx 339-4: a  relativistic iron line and evidence for a seyfert-like warm absorber	we observed the galactic black hole gx 339-4 with the chandra high energytransmission grating spectrometer (hetgs) for 75 ksec during the decline of its2002-2003 outburst. the sensitivity of this observation provides anunprecedented glimpse of a galactic black hole at about a tenth of theluminosity of the outburst peak. the continuum spectrum is well described by amodel consisting of multicolor disk blackbody (kt = 0.6 kev) and power-law(gamma = 2.5) components. x-ray reflection models yield improved fits. astrong, relativistic fe k-alpha emission line is revealed, indicating that theinner disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit. the breadth of theline is sufficient to suggest that gx 339-4 may harbor a black hole withsignificant angular momentum. absorption lines from h-like and he-like o, andhe-like ne and mg are detected, as well as lines which are likely due to ne iiand ne iii. the measured line properties make it difficult to associate theabsorption with the coronal phase of the interstellar medium. a scenariowherein the absorption lines are due to an intrinsic agn-like warm-absorbergeometry -- perhaps produced by a disk wind in an extended disk-dominated state-- may be more viable. we compare our results to chandra observations of thegalactic black hole candidate xte j1650-500, and discuss our findings in termsof prominent models for galactic black hole accretion flows and connections tosupermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0312033	evidence for black hole spin in gx 339-4: xmm-newton epic-pn and rxte  spectroscopy of the very high state	we have analyzed spectra of the galactic black hole gx 339-4 obtained throughsimultaneous 76 ksec xmm-newton/epic-pn and 10 ksec rxte observations during abright phase of its 2002-2003 outburst. an extremely skewed, relativistic fek-alpha emission line and ionized disk reflection spectrum are revealed inthese spectra. self-consistent models for the fe k-alpha emission line profileand disk reflection spectrum rule-out an inner disk radius compatible with aschwarzschild black hole at more than the 8 sigma level of confidence. thebest-fit inner disk radius of 2-3 r_g suggests that gx 339-4 harbors a blackhole with a ~ 0.8-0.9 (where r_g = gm/c^2 and a=cj/gm^2, and assuming thatreflection in the plunging region is relatively small). this confirmsindications for black hole spin based on a chandra spectrum obtained later inthe outburst. the emission line and reflection spectrum also rule-out astandard power-law disk emissivity in gx 339-4; a broken power-law form withenhanced emissivity inside ~6 r_{g} gives improved fits at more than the 8sigma level of confidence. the extreme red wing of the line and steepemissivity require a centrally--concentrated source of hard x-rays which canstrongly illuminate the inner disk. hard x-ray emission from the base of a jet- enhanced by gravitational light bending effects - could create theconcentrated hard x-ray emission; this process may be related to magneticconnections between the black hole and the inner disk. we discuss these resultswithin the context of recent results from analyses of xte j1650-500 andmcg-6-30-15, and models for the inner accretion flow environment around blackholes.

astro-ph;0511725	bimodal spectral variability of cygnus x-1 in an intermediate state	we report the results of an observation of cygnus x-1 with integral, that wecombine with simultaneous radio observations with the ryle telescope. bothspectral and variability properties of the source indicate that cygnus x-1 wasin an intermediate state. the integral spectrum shows a high-energy cut-off orbreak around 100 kev. the shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermalcomptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higherenergies.the average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybridthermal/non-thermal comptonisation models. during the 4 day long observationthe source showed an important spectral and flux variability. a principalcomponent analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2independent modes. the first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosityon time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikinglyuncorrelated with the variable radio flux. we interpret this variability modeas variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. the second variabilitymode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 kev. it acts on a longertime-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in the first part of theobservation and then softens again. this pivoting pattern is stronglycorrelated with the radio (15 ghz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when theintegral spectrum is harder. we propose that the pivoting mode represents a'mini' state transition from a nearly high soft state to a nearly low hardstate, and back. this mini-transition would be caused by changes in the softcooling photons flux in the hot comptonising plasma associated with an increaseof the temperature of the accretion disc. the jet power then appears to beanti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to the coronal power.

astro-ph;9810150	the 1998 outburst of the x-ray transient 4u 1630-47 observed with  bepposax	we report results of five pointed bepposax observations of the black holecandidate 4u 1630-47 during part of its 1998 outburst when the 2-10 kev sourceluminosity decreased from 2.1x10^38 erg/s (for an assumed distance of 10 kpc)by a factor of ~7. the 2-200 kev spectrum can be modeled by a softmulti-temperature disk blackbody and a hard power-law. during four of theobservations, there is evidence for deviations from a pure power-law shape &gt;~20kev which may be due to reflection. as the outburst decayed a number ofspectral trends are evident: (1) the amount of photoelectric absorptiondecreased, (2) the spectrum became harder (i.e. the power-law index becamesmaller), (3) the temperature of the disk blackbody decreased and (4) theinferred inner disk radius increased by a factor of ~4. the change in theaccretion disk inner radius during the outburst is in contrast to results fromother soft x-ray transients. we find that the disk blackbody temperaturedepends on the inner disk radius roughly as t=r^(-3/4). for a standardshakura-sunyaev disk model this implies that the inferred mass accretion rateat the inner disk radius did not change appreciably during the part of theoutburst observed by bepposax.

astro-ph;9907124	on the nature of xte j0421+560/ci cam	we present the results of the analysis of rxte, batse and optical/infrareddata of the 1998 outburst of the x-ray transient system xte j0421+560 (ci cam).the x-ray outburst shows a very fast decay (initial e-folding time ~0.5 days,slowing down to ~2.3 days). the x-ray spectrum in the 2-25 kev band is complex,softening considerably during decay and with strongly variable intrinsicabsorption. a strong iron emission line is observed. no fast time variabilityis detected (&lt;0.5 % rms in the 1-4096 hz band at the outburst peak). theanalysis of the optical/ir data suggests that the secondary is a b[e] starsurrounded by cool dust and places the system at a distance of &gt;~ 2 kpc. atthis distance the peak 2-25 kev luminosity is ~4 x 10^37 erg/s. we compare theproperties of this peculiar system with those of the be/ns lmc transient a0538-66 and suggest that ci cam is of similar nature. the presence of strongradio emission during outburst indicates that the compact object is likely tobe a black hole or a weakly magnetized neutron star.

astro-ph;9909465	inner accretion disk disappearance during a radio flare in grs 1915+105	simultaneous x-ray (bepposax, 0.1-300 kev) and radio (ryle telescope, 15 ghz)observations of the superluminal galactic source grs 1915+105 in high fluxstate were carried out starting october 1996. here we present the simultaneousradio/x-ray light curves of the flare event and the spectral and timinganalysis of the relevant bepposax data. we obtain evidence for a temporarydisappearance and subsequent restoring of the inner portion of the accretiondisk during the flare from the spectral analysis of the x-ray data. we find avariable power law photon index positively correlated to the variability of theexponential cut-off energy. in addition, frequency and intensity variations ofa $\sim$4-5~hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) are detected during the sametime interval. the centroid frequency of the qpo is found to be correlated tothe spectral power law photon index, and to the x-ray flux from the disk andthe high energy flux from the power law. these observational results arediscussed in the framework of the disk-instability model proposed for thissource.

astro-ph;9912028	the timing evolution of 4u 1630-47 during its 1998 outburst	we report on the evolution of the timing of 4u1630-47 during its 1998outburst using data obtained with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). thecount rate and position in hardness-intensity, color-color diagrams and simplespectral fits are used to track the concurrent spectral changes. the sourceshowed seven distinct types of timing behavior, most of which show differenceswith the canonical black hole spectral/timing states. in marked contrast toprevious outbursts, we find quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) signals duringnearly all stages of the outburst with frequencies between 0.06hz and 14hz anda remarkable variety of other characteristics. in particular we find large (upto 23% rms) amplitude qpo on the early rise. later, slow 0.1hz semi- regularshort (~ 5 sec), 9 to 16% deep dips dominate the light curve. at this timethere are two qpos, one stable near 13.5hz and the other whose frequency dropsfrom 6--8hz to ~4.5 hz during the dips. bepposax observations during the verylate declining phase show 4u1630-47 in a low state.
