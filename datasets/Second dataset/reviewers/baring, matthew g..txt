hep-th;0003186	magnetic photon splitting: the s-matrix formulation in the landau  representation	calculations of reaction rates for the third-order qed process of photonsplitting in strong magnetic fields traditionally have employed either theeffective lagrangian method or variants of schwinger's proper-time technique.recently, mentzel, berg and wunner (1994) presented an alternative derivationvia an s-matrix formulation in the landau representation. advantages of such aformulation include the ability to compute rates near pair resonances abovepair threshold. this paper presents new developments of the landaurepresentation formalism as applied to photon splitting, providing significantadvances beyond the work of mentzel et al. by summing over the spin quantumnumbers of the electron propagators, and analytically integrating over thecomponent of momentum of the intermediate states that is parallel to field. theensuing tractable expressions for the scattering amplitudes are satisfyinglycompact, and of an appearance familiar to s-matrix theory applications. suchdevelopments can facilitate numerical computations of splitting considerablyboth below and above pair threshold. specializations to two regimes of interestare obtained, namely the limit of highly supercritical fields and the domainwhere photon energies are far inferior to that for the threshold ofsingle-photon pair creation. in particular, for the first time thelow-frequency amplitudes are simply expressed in terms of the gamma function,its integral and its derivatives. in addition, the equivalence of theasymptotic forms in these two domains to extant results from effectivelagrangian/proper-time formulations is demonstrated.

0901.2535	probes of diffusive shock acceleration using gamma-ray burst prompt  emission	the principal paradigm for gamma-ray bursts (grbs) suggests that the prompttransient gamma-ray signal arises from multiple shocks internal to therelativistic expansion. this paper explores how grb prompt emission spectra canconstrain electron (or ion) acceleration properties at the relativistic shocksthat pertain to grb models. the array of possible high-energy power-law indicesin accelerated populations is highlighted, focusing on how spectra above 1 mevcan probe the field obliquity in grb internal shocks, and the character ofhydromagnetic turbulence in their environs. when encompassing the mev-bandspectral break, fits to batse/egret burst data indicate that the preponderanceof electrons responsible for the prompt emission reside in an intrinsicallynon-thermal population. this differs markedly from typical populationsgenerated in acceleration simulations; potential resolutions of this conflictsuch as the action of self-absorption are mentioned. spectral modeling alsosuggests that the synchrotron mechanism is favored over synchrotronself-compton scenarios due to the latter's typically broad curvature near thepeak. such diagnostics will be enhanced by the broadband spectral coverage ofbursts by the fermi gamma-ray space telescope; the gbm will provide keyinformation on the lower energy portions of the non-thermal particlepopulation, while the lat will constrain the power-law regime of particleacceleration.

1002.3848	using gamma-ray burst prompt emission to probe relativistic shock  acceleration	it is widely accepted that the prompt transient signal in the 10 kev - 10 gevband from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) arises from multiple shocks internal to theultra-relativistic expansion. the detailed understanding of the dissipation andaccompanying acceleration at these shocks is a currently topical subject. thispaper explores the relationship between grb prompt emission spectra and theelectron (or ion) acceleration properties at the relativistic shocks thatpertain to grb models. the focus is on the array of possible high-energypower-law indices in accelerated populations, highlighting how spectra above 1mev can probe the field obliquity in grb internal shocks, and the character ofhydromagnetic turbulence in their environs. it is emphasized that diffusiveshock acceleration theory generates no canonical spectrum at relativistic mhddiscontinuities. this diversity is commensurate with the significant range ofspectral indices discerned in prompt burst emission. such system diagnosticsare now being enhanced by the broadband spectral coverage of bursts by thefermi gamma-ray space telescope; while the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm)provides key diagnostics on the lower energy portions of the particlepopulation, the focus here is on constraints in the non-thermal, power-lawregime of the particle distribution that are provided by the large areatelescope (lat).

1006.2214	photospheric radius expansion during magnetar bursts	on august 24th 2008 the new magnetar sgr 0501+4516 (discovered by swift)emitted a bright burst with a pronounced double-peak structure in hard x-rays,reminiscent of the double-peak temporal structure seen in some brightthermonuclear bursts on accreting neutron stars. in the latter case this is dueto photospheric radius expansion (pre): when the flux reaches the eddingtonlimit, the photosphere expands and cools so that emission becomes softer anddrops temporarily out of the x-ray band, re-appearing as the photospheresettles back down. we consider the factors necessary to generate double-peakedpre events, and show that such a mechanism could plausibly operate in magnetarbursts, despite the vastly different emission process. identification of themagnetic eddington limit in a magnetar would constrain magnetic field anddistance and could, in principle, enable a measurement of gravitationalredshift. it would also locate the emitting region at the neutron star surface,constraining the burst trigger mechanism. conclusive confirmation of pre eventswill require more detailed radiative models for bursts. however for sgr0501+4516 the predicted critical flux (using the magnetic field strengthinferred from timing and the distance suggested by its probable location in theperseus arm of our galaxy) is consistent with that observed in the august 24thburst.

1007.3699	lepton acceleration in pulsar wind nebulae	pulsar wind nebulae (pwne) act as calorimeters for the relativistic pairwinds emanating from within the pulsar light cylinder. their radiativedissipation in various wavebands is significantly different from that of theirpulsar central engines: the broadband spectra of pwne possess characteristicsdistinct from those of pulsars, thereby demanding a site of lepton accelerationremote from the pulsar magnetosphere. a principal candidate for this locale isthe pulsar wind termination shock, a putatively highly-oblique,ultra-relativistic mhd discontinuity. this paper summarizes key characteristicsof relativistic shock acceleration germane to pwne, using predominantly montecarlo simulation techniques that compare well with semi-analytic solutions ofthe diffusion-convection equation. the array of potential spectral indices forthe pair distribution function is explored, defining how these dependcritically on the parameters of the turbulent plasma in the shock environs.injection efficiencies into the acceleration process are also addressed.informative constraints on the frequency of particle scattering and the levelof field turbulence are identified using the multiwavelength observations ofselected pwne. these suggest that the termination shock can be comfortablyinvoked as a principal injector of energetic leptons into pwne withoutresorting to unrealistic properties for the shock layer turbulence or mhdstructure.

1103.3356	cooling rates for relativistic electrons undergoing compton scattering  in strong magnetic fields	for inner magnetospheric models of hard x-ray and gamma-ray emission inhigh-field pulsars and magnetars, resonant compton upscattering is anticipatedto be the most efficient process for generating continuum radiation. this isdue in part to the proximity of a hot soft photon bath from the stellar surfaceto putative radiation dissipation regions in the inner magnetosphere. moreover,because the scattering process becomes resonant at the cyclotron frequency, theeffective cross section exceeds the classical thomson value by over two ordersof magnitude, thereby enhancing the efficiency of continuum production and thecooling of relativistic electrons. this paper presents computations of theelectron cooling rates for this process, which are needed for resonant comptonmodels of non-thermal radiation from such highly-magnetized pulsars. thecomputed rates extend previous calculations of magnetic thomson cooling to thedomain of relativistic quantum effects, sampled near and above the quantumcritical magnetic field of 44.13 teragauss. this is the first exposition offully relativistic, quantum magnetic compton cooling rates for electrons, andit employs both the traditional johnson and lippman cross section, and a newersokolov and ternov (st) formulation of compton scattering in strong magneticfields. such st formalism is formally correct for treating spin-dependenteffects that are important in the cyclotron resonance, and has not beenaddressed before in the context of cooling by compton scattering. the qedeffects are observed to profoundly lower the rates below extrapolations of thefamiliar magnetic thomson results, as expected, when recoil and klein-nishinareductions become important.

1312.3458	multiwavelength probes of the environs of relativistic shocks in blazar  jets	diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) at relativistic shocks is likely to be animportant acceleration mechanism in various astrophysical jet sources,including radio-loud agn. an important recent development for blazar science isthe ability of fermi-lat data to pin down the power-law index of the highenergy portion of emission in these sources, and therefore also the index ofthe underlying non-thermal particle population. this diagnostic potential wasnot possible prior to fermi launch, when gamma-ray information was dominated bythe highly-absorbed tev band. this paper highlights how multiwavelength spectraincluding x-ray band and fermi data can be used to probe diffusive accelerationin relativistic, oblique, mhd shocks in blazar jets. the spectral index of thenon-thermal particle distributions resulting from monte carlo simulations ofdsa, and the fraction of thermal particles accelerated to non-thermal energies,depend sensitively on the particles' mean free path scale, and also on themagnetic field obliquity to the shock normal. we investigate self-consistentlythe radiative synchrotron/compton signatures of the resulting thermal andnon-thermal particle distributions. important constraints on the frequency ofparticle scattering and the level of field turbulence are identified for theblazar ao 0235+164. the possible interpretation that turbulence levels declinewith remoteness from jet shocks, and a significant role for non-gyroresonantdiffusion, are discussed.

1406.2767	magnetic pair creation transparency in gamma-ray pulsars	magnetic pair creation $\gamma \to e^+e^-$ has been at the core of radiopulsar paradigms and central to polar cap models of gamma-ray pulsars for overthree decades. the fermi gamma-ray pulsar population now exceeds 140 sourcesand has defined an important part of fermi's science legacy. among thepopulation characteristics well established is the common occurrence ofexponential turnovers in their spectra in the 1--10 gev range. these turnoversare too gradual to arise from magnetic pair creation in the strong magneticfields of pulsar inner magnetospheres. by demanding insignificant photonattenuation precipitated by such single-photon pair creation, the energies ofthese turnovers for fermi pulsars can be used to compute lower bounds for thetypical altitude of gev band emission. this paper explores such pairtransparency constraints below the turnover energy, and updates earlieraltitude bound determinations of that have been deployed in various fermipulsar papers. for low altitude emission locales, general relativisticinfluences are found to be important. rotational aberration influences are alsoexplored, and are found to be small at low altitudes, except near the magneticpole. the altitude bounds are typically in the range of 2-7 stellar radii forthe young fermi pulsar population, and provide key information on the emissionaltitude in radio quiet pulsars that do not possess double-peaked pulseprofiles. the bound for the crab pulsar is at a much higher altitude, with theputative detection by magic out to 350-400 gev implying a lower bound of 310kmto the emission region, i.e., approximately 20% of the light cylinder radius.these results are also extended to the super-critical field domain, where it isfound that emission in magnetars originating below around 10 stellar radii willnot appear in the fermi-lat band.

astro-ph;0010400	photon splitting and pair creation in highly magnetized pulsars	the absence of radio pulsars with long periods has lead to the popular notionof a high p ``death line.'' in the standard picture, beyond this boundary,pulsars with low spin rates cannot accelerate particles above the stellarsurface to high enough energies to initiate pair cascades, and the paircreation needed for radio emission is strongly suppressed. in this paper weexplore the possibility of another pulsar ``death line'' in the context ofpolar cap models, corresponding to high magnetic fields b in the upper portionof the period-period derivative diagram, a domain where few radio pulsars areobserved. the origin of this high b boundary, which may occur when b becomescomparable to or exceeds $b_{\rm cr} = 4.4 \times 10^{13}$ gauss, is also dueto the suppression of magnetic pair creation, but primarily because ofineffective competition with magnetic photon splitting. threshold pair creationalso plays a prominent role in the suppression of cascades. we present montecarlo calculations of the pair yields in photon splitting/pair cascades whichshow that, in the absence of scattering effects, pair production is effectivelysuppressed, but only if all three modes of photon splitting allowed by qed areoperating in high fields. this paper describes the probable shape and positionof the new ``death line,'' above which pulsars are expected to be radio quiet,but perhaps still x-ray and gamma-ray bright. the hypothesized existence ofradio-quiet sources finds dramatic support in the recent discovery ofultra-strong fields in soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous x-ray pulsars.guidelines for moderate to high b pulsar searches at radio wavelengths and alsoin the soft and hard gamma-ray bands are presented.

astro-ph;0307428	magnetohydrodynamic jump conditions for oblique relativistic shocks with  gyrotropic pressure	shock jump conditions are obtained for steady-state, plane shocks withoblique magnetic fields and arbitrary flow speeds. for ultrarelativistic andnonrelativistic shocks, the jump conditions may be solved analytically. formildly relativistic shocks, analytic solutions are obtained for isotropicpressure using an approximation for the adiabatic index that is valid in highsonic mach number cases. in the more general case of gyrotropic pressure, thejump conditions cannot be solved analytically without additional assumptions,and the effects of gyrotropic pressure are investigated by parameterizing thedistribution of pressure parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. ournumerical solutions reveal that relatively small departures from isotropy(e.g., about 20%) produce significant changes in the shock compression ratio,r, at all shock lorentz factors, including ultrarelativistic ones, where ananalytic solution with gyrotropic pressure is obtained. in particular, eitherdynamically important fields or significant pressure anisotropies can incurmarked departures from the canonical gas dynamic value of r=3 for a shockedultrarelativistic flow and this may impact models of particle acceleration ingamma-ray bursts and other environments where relativistic shocks are inferred.the jump conditions presented apply directly to test-particle acceleration, andwill facilitate future self-consistent numerical modeling of particleacceleration at oblique, relativistic shocks.

astro-ph;0308296	high-energy emission from pulsars: the polar cap scenario	the study of pulsars in the three and a half decades since their discoveryhas highlighted a handful of issues critical to their understanding. to datethere is no consensus on the physical mechanism for their radio radio emission,despite a rapid increase in the observed population due to the parkesmulti-beam survey and prospects for similar growth in the radio populationdatabase in the near future. the small subset of pulsars that emit at x-ray togamma-ray wavelengths are critical to refining the pulsar paradigm since thisenergy band (i) is where the vast majority of radiative luminosity is observed,and (ii) is intimately connected to the pair winds that form the dominant modeof energy deposition in the circum-pulsar environment. the most crucial pointof contention pertaining to the high energy astrophysics of pulsars is thelocation of the acceleration region in their magnetospheres: is an outer gapmodel or a polar cap scenario (or both) the most appropriate picture. radiativesignatures provide the clues to this current enigma. this review focuses onsalient characteristics of the polar cap scenario; these form the basis fordiscriminating observational diagnostics that should drive pulsars studies inthe glast era just three years away.

astro-ph;0406025	a study of prompt emission mechanisms in gamma-ray bursts	the principal paradigm for the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts invokesdiffusive acceleration at shocks internal to the dynamic ultrarelativisticoutflow. this paper explores expectations for burst emission spectra arisingfrom shock acceleration theory in the limit of particles cooling much slowerthan their acceleration. parametric fits to burst spectra obtained by thecompton gamma-ray observatory (cgro) are explored for the cases of thesynchrotron, inverse compton and synchrotron self-compton radiation mechanisms,using a linear combination of thermal and non-thermal electron populations.these fits demand that the preponderance of electrons that are responsible forthe prompt emission reside in an intrinsically non-thermal population, stronglycontrasting particle distributions obtained from acceleration simulations. thisimplies a potential conflict for acceleration scenarios where the non-thermalelectrons are drawn directly from a thermal gas. it is also found that the cgrodata preclude effective spectroscopic discrimination between the synchrotronand inverse compton mechanisms. this situation may be resolved with futuremissions probing gamma-ray bursts, namely swift and glast. however, thesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) spectrum is characteristically too broad nearthe $\nu f_{\nu}$ peak to viably account for bursts such as grb 910601, grb910814 and grb 990123. it is concluded that the ssc mechanism may be generallyincompatible with differential burst spectra steeper than around $e^{-2.5}$above the peak, unless the synchrotron component is strongly self-absorbed.

astro-ph;0409303	diffusive shock acceleration of high energy cosmic rays	the process of diffusive acceleration of charged particles in shocked plasmasis widely invoked in astrophysics to account for the ubiquitous presence ofsignatures of non-thermal relativistic electrons and ions in the universe. akey characteristic of this statistical energization mechanism is the absence ofa momentum scale; astrophysical systems generally only impose scales at theinjection (low energy) and loss (high energy) ends of the particle spectrum.the existence of structure in the cosmic ray spectrum (the "knee") at around3000 tev has promoted contentions that there are at least two origins forcosmic rays, a galactic one supplying those up to the knee, and even beyond,and perhaps an extragalactic one that can explain even the ultra-high energycosmic rays (uhecrs) seen at 1-300 eev. accounting for the uhecrs with familiarastrophysical sites of acceleration has historically proven difficult due tothe need to assume high magnetic fields in order to reduce the shortestdiffusive acceleration timescale, the ion gyroperiod, to meaningful values. yetactive galaxies and gamma-ray bursts remain strong and interesting candidatesources for uhecrs, turning the theoretical focus to relativistic shocks. thisreview summarizes properties of diffusive shock acceleration that are salientto the issue of uhecr generation. these include spectral indices, accelerationefficencies and timescales, as functions of the shock speed and mean fieldorientation, and also the nature of the field turbulence. the interpretation ofthese characteristics in the context of gamma-ray burst models for theproduction of uhecrs is also examined.

astro-ph;0502156	gamma-ray burst prompt emission: implications from shock acceleration  theory	the principal paradigm for gamma-ray bursts suggest that the prompt transientgamma-ray signal arises from multiple shocks internal to the relativisticexpansion. this paper illustrates some properties of diffusive acceleration atrelativistic shocks that pertain to grb models, providing interpretation of thebatse/egret data. using a standard monte carlo simulation, computations of thespectral shape, and the range of spectral indices are presented, as functionsof the shock speed, magnetic field obliquity and the type of particlescattering. it is clear that while quasi-parallel, relativistic shocks withfields approximately normal to the shock plane can efficiently accelerateparticles, highly oblique and perpendicular ones cannot unless the particlediffusion is almost isotropic, i.e. extremely close to the bohm limit.accordingly, an array of distribution indices should be present in the burstpopulation, as is exhibited by the egret data, and even mildly-relativisticinternal shocks require strong field turbulence in order to model the &gt;100 mevobservations. in addition, recent spectral fitting to burst data in the batseband is discussed, providing probes of the efficiency of injection ofnon-thermal electrons.

astro-ph;0505327	spin-dependent cyclotron decay rates in strong magnetic fields	cyclotron decay and absorption rates have been well studied in theliterature, focusing primarily on spectral, angular and polarizationdependence. astrophysical applications usually do not require retention ofinformation on the electron spin state, and these are normally averaged inobtaining the requisite rates. in magnetic fields, higher order quantumprocesses such as compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequencyand its harmonics, with the resonances being formally divergent. suchdivergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes ofexcited landau states. this practice requires the use of spin-dependentcyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations of process ratesvery near cyclotronic resonances, the phase space domain most relevant forcertain applications to pulsar models. this paper develops previous results inthe literature to obtain compact analytic expressions for cyclotron decayrates/widths in terms of a series of legendre functions of the second kind;these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models. the ratesare derived using two popular eigenstate formalisms, namely that due to sokolovand ternov, and that due to johnson and lippmann. these constitute two sets ofeigenfunctions of the dirac equation that diagonalize different operators, andaccordingly yield different spin-dependent cyclotron rates. this paperillustrates the attractive lorentz transformation characteristics of thesokolov and ternov formulation, which is another reason why it is preferablewhen electron spin information must be explicitly retained.

astro-ph;0505569	modeling accelerated pick-up ion distributions at an interplanetary  shock	the acceleration of interstellar pick-up ions as well as solar wind specieshas been observed at a multitude of interplanetary (ip) shocks by differentspacecraft. the efficiency of injection of the pick-up ion component differsfrom that of the solar wind, and is expected to be strongly enhanced at highlyoblique and quasi-perpendicular shock events, in accord with inferences from{\it in situ} observations. this paper explores theoretical modeling of thephase space distributions of accelerated ions obtained by the ulysses missionfor the day 292, 1991 shock associated with a corotating interaction region,encountered before ulysses' fly-by of jupiter. a monte carlo simulation is usedto model the acceleration process, adapting a technique that has beensuccessfully tested on earlier ip shocks possessing minimal pick-up ionpresence. phase space distributions from the simulation technique for variouslow mass ions are compared with swics and hi-scale data to deduce values of a``turbulence parameter'' that controls the efficiency of injection, and thedegree of cross-field diffusion. acceptable fits are obtained for the $h^+$ and$he^+$ populations using standard prescriptions for the pick-up iondistribution; $he^{++}$ spectral data was only fit well for scenarios veryclose to the bohm diffusion limit. it is also found that the simulationsuccessfully accounts for the observation of energetic protons farther upstreamof the forward shock than lower energy pick-up protons, using the sameturbulence parameter that is required to achieve reasonable spectral fits.

astro-ph;0506179	diffusive acceleration of ions at interplanetary shocks	heliospheric shocks are excellent systems for testing theories of particleacceleration in their environs. these generally fall into two classes: (1)interplanetary shocks that are linear in their ion accelerationcharacteristics, with the non-thermal ions serving as test particles, and (2)non-linear systems such as the earth's bow shock and the solar wind terminationshock, where the accelerated ions strongly influence the magnetohydrodynamicstructure of the shock. this paper explores the modelling of diffusiveacceleration at a particular interplanetary shock, with an emphasis onexplaining in situ measurements of ion distribution functions. theobservational data for this event was acquired on day 292 of 1991 by theulysses mission. the modeling is performed using a well-known kinetic montecarlo simulation, which has yielded good agreement with observations at severalheliospheric shocks, as have other theoretical techniques, namely hybrid plasmasimulations, and numerical solution of the diffusion-convection equation. inthis theory/data comparison, it is demonstrated that diffusive accelerationtheory can, to first order, successfully account for both the protondistribution data near the shock, and the observation of energetic protonsfarther upstream of this interplanetary shock than lower energy pick-upprotons, using a single turbulence parameter. the principal conclusion is thatdiffusive acceleration of inflowing upstream ions can model this pick-upion-rich event without the invoking any seed pre-acceleration mechanism, thoughthis investigation does not rule out the action of such pre-acceleration.

astro-ph;9809115	radio quiet pulsars with ultra-strong magnetic fields	the notable absence of radio pulsars having measured magnetic dipole surfacefield strengths above $b_0\sim 3\times 10^{13}$ gauss naturally raises thequestion of whether this forms an upper limit to pulsar magnetization. recentlythere has been increasing evidence that neutron stars possessing higher dipolespin-down fields do in fact exist, including a growing list of anomalous x-raypulsars (axps) with long periods and spinning down with high periodderivatives, implying surface fields of $10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ gauss.furthermore, the recently reported x-ray period and period derivative for thesoft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) source sgr1806-20 suggest a surface field around$10^{15}$ gauss. none of these high-field pulsars have yet been detected asradio pulsars. we propose that high-field pulsars should be radio-quiet becauseelectron-positron pair production in their magnetospheres, thought to beessential for radio emission, is efficiently suppressed in ultra-strong fields($b_0\gtrsim 4\times 10^{13}$ gauss) by the action of photon splitting, aquantum electrodynamical process in which a photon splits into two. ourcomputed radio quiescence boundary in the radio pulsar $p-\dot p$ diagram,where photon splitting overtakes pair creation, is located just above theboundary of the known radio pulsar population, neatly dividing them from theaxps. we thus identify a physical mechanism that defines a new class ofhigh-field radio-quiet neutron stars that should be detectable by their pulsedemission at x-ray and perhaps $\gamma$-ray energies.

astro-ph;9809137	direct acceleration of pickup ions at the solar wind termination shock:  the production of anomalous cosmic rays	we have modeled the injection and acceleration of pickup ions at the solarwind termination shock and investigated the parameters needed to produce theobserved anomalous cosmic ray (acr) fluxes. a non-linear monte carlo techniquewas employed, which in effect solves the boltzmann equation and is notrestricted to near-isotropic particle distribution functions. this techniquemodels the injection of thermal and pickup ions, the acceleration of theseions, and the determination of the shock structure under the influence of theaccelerated ions. the essential effects of injection are treated in a mostlyself-consistent manner, including effects from shock obliquity, cross-fielddiffusion, and pitch-angle scattering. using recent determinations of pickupion densities, we are able to match the absolute flux of hydrogen in the acrsby assuming that pickup ion scattering mean free paths, at the terminationshock, are much less than an au and that modestly strong cross-field diffusionoccurs. simultaneously, we match the flux ratios he$^{+}$/h$^{+}$ oro$^{+}$/h$^{+}$ to within a factor $\sim 5$. if the conditions of strongscattering apply, no pre-termination-shock injection phase is required and theinjection and acceleration of pickup ions at the termination shock is totallyanalogous to the injection and acceleration of ions at highly obliqueinterplanetary shocks recently observed by the ulysses spacecraft. the factthat acr fluxes can be modeled with standard shock assumptions suggests thatthe much-discussed "injection problem" for highly oblique shocks stems fromincomplete (either mathematical or computer) modeling of these shocks ratherthan from any actual difficulty shocks may have in injecting and acceleratingthermal or quasi-thermal particles.

astro-ph;9810158	radio to gamma-ray emission from shell-type supernova remnants:  predictions from non-linear shock acceleration models	supernova remnants (snrs) are widely believed to be the principal source ofgalactic cosmic rays. such energetic particles can produce gamma-rays and lowerenergy photons via interactions with the ambient plasma. in this paper, wepresent results from a monte carlo simulation of non-linear shock structure andacceleration coupled with photon emission in shell-like snrs. thesenon-linearities are a by-product of the dynamical influence of the acceleratedcosmic rays on the shocked plasma and result in distributions of cosmic rayswhich deviate from pure power-laws. such deviations are crucial to accelerationefficiency and spectral considerations, producing gev/tev intensity ratios thatare quite different from test particle predictions. the sedov scaling solutionfor snr expansions is used to estimate important shock parameters for inputinto the monte carlo simulation. we calculate ion and electron distributionsthat spawn neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse compton, and synchrotronemission, yielding complete photon spectra from radio frequencies to gamma-rayenergies. the cessation of acceleration caused by the spatial and temporallimitations of the expanding snr shell in moderately dense interstellar regionscan yield spectral cutoffs in the tev energy range; these are consistent withwhipple's tev upper limits on unidentified egret sources. supernova remnants inlower density environments generate higher energy cosmic rays that producepredominantly inverse compton emission at super-tev energies; such sources willgenerally be gamma-ray dim at gev energies.

astro-ph;9810160	highly-magnetized pulsars and integral	the complete absence of radio pulsars with periods exceeding a few secondshas lead to the popular notion of the existence of a high period death line. wehave recently postulated the existence of another radio quiescence boundary athigh magnetic fields ($b\gtrsim 4\times 10^{13}$g) in the upper portion of theperiod-period derivative diagram, a domain where no radio pulsars are observed.the origin of this high b boundary is also due to the suppression of magneticpair creation, $\gamma\to e^{\pm}$, but mainly because of competition with theexotic qed process of magnetic photon splitting, $\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$,coupled with ground state pair creation. this mechanism could also explain thelow spectral cutoff energy of the gamma-ray pulsar psr1509-58, which lies nearthe high b death-line. in this paper, we summarize the hypothesis of this new``death line,'' and discuss some subtleties of pair suppression that relate tophoton polarization and positronium formation. we identify several ways inwhich integral will serve as a useful tool in probing high field pulsars, giventhat the radio quiescence boundary is transparent to the high energy bands.

astro-ph;9908327	inverse bremsstrahlung in shocked astrophysical plasmas	there has recently been interest in the role of inverse bremsstrahlung, theemission of photons by fast suprathermal ions in collisions with ambientelectrons possessing relatively low velocities, in tenuous plasmas in variousastrophysical contexts. this follows a long hiatus in the application ofsuprathermal ion bremsstrahlung to astrophysical models since the early 1970s.the potential importance of inverse bremsstrahlung relative to normalbremsstrahlung, i.e. where ions are at rest, hinges upon the underlyingvelocity distributions of the interacting species. in this paper, we identifythe conditions under which the inverse bremsstrahlung emissivity is significantrelative to that for normal bremsstrahlung in shocked astrophysical plasmas. wedetermine that, since both observational and theoretical evidence favorselectron temperatures almost comparable to, and certainly not very deficientrelative to proton temperatures in shocked plasmas, these environmentsgenerally render inverse bremsstrahlung at best a minor contributor to theoverall emission. hence inverse bremsstrahlung can be safely neglected in mostmodels invoking shock acceleration in discrete sources such as supernovaremnants. however, on scales &gt; 100pc distant from these sources, coulombcollisional losses can deplete the cosmic ray electrons, rendering inversebremsstrahlung, and perhaps bremsstrahlung from knock-on electrons, possiblydetectable.

astro-ph;9910125	photons and particle production in cassiopeia a: predictions from  nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration	we calculate particle spectra and continuum photon emission from thecassiopeia a supernova remnant (snr). the particle spectra, ion and electron,result from diffusive shock acceleration at the forward snr shock and aredetermined with a nonlinear monte carlo calculation. the calculationself-consistently determines the shock structure under the influence of ionpressure, and includes a simple parameterized treatment of electron injectionand acceleration. our results are compared to photon observations,concentrating on the connection between the radio and gev-tev gamma-ray range,and to cosmic ray ion observations. we include new upper limits from thecherenkov array at themis (cat) imaging cherenkov telescope and the whipple 10mgamma-ray telescope at &gt; 400 gev. these new limits support the suggestion (e.g.cowsik &amp; sarkar 1980; allen et. al. 1997) that energetic electrons are emittingsynchrotron radiation in an extremely high magnetic field (~ 1000 microgauss),far greater than values routinely assigned to the ism, and help to constrainour model. the large magnetic field allows acceleration of cosmic ray ions towell above $10^{15}$ ev per nucleon in the ~ 300 yr lifetime of cas a.

astro-ph;9911060	modelling hard gamma-ray emission from supernova remnants	the observation by the cangaroo experiment of tev emission from sn 1006, inconjunction with several instances of non-thermal x-ray emission from supernovaremnants, has led to inferences of super-tev electrons in these extendedsources. while this is sufficient to propel the theoretical community in theirmodelling of particle acceleration and associated radiation, the anticipatedemergence in the next decade of a number of new experiments probing the tev andsub-tev bands provides further substantial motivation for modellers. inparticular, the quest for obtaining unambiguous gamma-ray signatures of cosmicray ion acceleration defines a ``holy grail'' for observers and theoristsalike. this review summarizes theoretical developments in the prediction ofmev-tev gamma-rays from supernova remnants over the last five years, focusingon how global properties of models can impact, and be impacted by, hardgamma-ray observational programs, thereby probing the supernova remnantenvironment. properties of central consideration include the maximum energy ofaccelerated particles, the density of the unshocked interstellar medium, theambient magnetic field, and the relativistic electron-to-proton ratio. criteriafor determining good candidate remnants for observability in the tev band areidentified.

0812.2742	search for redshifted 2.2 mev neutron capture line from a0535+262 in  outburst	the be/x-ray binary system a0535+262 underwent a giant outburst in may-june2005, followed by a dimmer outburst in august-september 2005. this increasedintensity provided an opportunity to search for redshifted neutron-capturelines from the surface of the neutron star. if discovered, such lines wouldconstrain the neutron star equation of state, providing the motivation of thissearch. the spectrometer (spi) on board the integral satellite observed thedimmer outburst and provided the data for this research. we have not detected aline with enough significance, with the width-dependent upper limits on thebroadened and redshifted neutron capture line in the range of (2 - 11) x10^(-4) photons cm^(-2) s^(-1). to our knowledge, these are the strongest upperlimits on the redshifted 2.2 mev emission from an accreting neutron star. ouranalysis of the transparency of the neutron star surface for 2.2 mev photonsshows that photons have a small but finite chance of leaving the atmosphereunscattered, which diminishes the possibility of detection.
