0905.0890	spatial correlation between submillimetre and lyman-alpha galaxies in  the ssa 22 protocluster	lyman-alpha emitters are thought to be young, low-mass galaxies with ages of~10^8 yr. an overdensity of them in one region of the sky (the ssa 22 field)traces out a filamentary structure in the early universe at a redshift of z =3.1 (equivalent to 15 per cent of the age of the universe) and is believed tomark a forming protocluster. galaxies that are bright at (sub)millimetrewavelengths are undergoing violent episodes of star formation, and there isevidence that they are preferentially associated with high-redshift radiogalaxies, so the question of whether they are also associated with the mostsignificant large-scale structure growing at high redshift (as outlined bylyman-alpha emitters) naturally arises. here we report an imaging survey of1,100-um emission in the ssa 22 region. we find an enhancement of submillimetregalaxies near the core of the protocluster, and a large-scale correlationbetween the submillimetre galaxies and the low-mass lyman-alpha emitters,suggesting synchronous formation of the two very different types ofstar-forming galaxy within the same structure at high redshift. these resultsare in general agreement with our understanding of the formation of cosmicstructure.

0906.0823	millimeter- and submillimeter-wave observations of the omc-2/3 region.  iv interaction between the outflow and the dense gas in the cluster forming  region of omc-2 fir 6	we have conducted millimeter interferometric observations of the orionmolecular cloud-2 (omc-2) fir 6 region at an angular resolution of $\sim$4$\arcsec$ - 7$\arcsec$ with the nobeyama millimeter array (nma). in the 3.3 mmcontinuum emission we detected dusty core counterparts of the previouslyidentified fir sources (fir 6a, 6b, 6c, and 6d), and moreover, resolved fir 6ainto three dusty cores. the size and mass of these cores are estimated to be1100-5900 au and 0.19-5.5 m$_{\odot}$, respectively. we found that in the$^{12}$co ($j$=1--0) emission fir 6b, 6c, and 6d eject the molecular outflowand that the fir 6c outflow also exhibits at least two collimated jet-likecomponents in the sio ($j$=2--1) emission. at the tip of one of the siocomponents there appears abrupt increase of the sio line width ($\sim$ 15 kms$^{-1}$), where the three resolved cores in fir 6a seem to delineate the tip.these results imply the presence of the interaction and the bowshock frontbetween the fir 6c molecular outflow and fir 6a.

0909.0344	evolutionary status of brightest and youngest source in the orion  molecular cloud-3 region	the brightest continuum source in the orion molecular cloud-3 region (omc-3),mms 6, was observed with the very large array (vla), the nobeyama millimeterarray (nma), and the submillimeter array (sma). our data were supplemented bynear- to mid-infrared archival data taken by spitzer space telescope. thecompact continuum source, mms 6-main, was detected with an h_2 mass of 3.0 msunwith a size of 510 au. despite its compact and well condensed appearance,neither clear co outflow, radio jet, nor infrared sources (at a wave-lengthshorter than 8 um) were detected at mms 6-main even with the presenthigh-spatial resolution and high-sensitivity observations. the derived h_2column density, 2.6x10^25 cm^-2, corresponds to a visual extinction ofa_v~15000 mag., and the derived number density is at least two orders ofmagnitude higher than for the other omc-2/3 continuum sources. the volumedensity profile of the source was estimated to have a power-law index of 2 orsteeper down to a radius of ~450 au. the time scale to form a protostar at thecenter or the time scale elapsed after its formation is estimated to be 830 to7600 yr. this is much shorter than the typical lifetime of the class 0/iprotostars, which is ~10^(4-5) yr, suggesting that mms 6-main is probably ineither the earliest stage of the proto-stellar core or in the latest stage ofthe pre-stellar phase.

0909.1132	a mapping survey of dense clumps associated with embedded clusters :  evolutionary stages of cluster-forming clumps	we have carried out a survey of the dense clumps associated with 14 embeddedclusters in the c^18o (j=1-0) line emission with the nobeyama 45m telescope inorder to understand the formation and evolution of stellar clusters in denseclumps of molecular clouds. we have selected these clusters at distances from0.3 to 2.1kpc and have mapped about 6' x 6' to 10' x 10'regions (correspondingto 3.8pc x 3.8pc at 2.1kpc) for all the clumps with 22" resolution(corresponding to jeans length at 2.1kpc). we have obtained dense clumps withradii of 0.40-1.6pc, masses of 150-4600m_sun, and velocity widths in fwhm of1.4-3.3kms^-1. most of the clumps are found to be approximately in virialequilibrium, which implies that c^18o gas represents parental dense clumps forcluster formation. from the spatial relation between the distributions ofclumps and clusters, we classified c^18o clumps into three types (type a, b,and c). the c^18o clumps as classified into type a have emission distributionswith a single peak at the stellar clusters and higher brightness contrast thanthat of other target sources. type b clumps have double or triple peaks whichare associated with the cluster and moderately high brightness contraststructure. type c clumps have also multiple peaks although they are notassociated with the cluster and low brightness contrast structure. we suggestthat our classification represents an evolutionary trend of cluster-formingdense clumps because dense gas in molecular clouds is expected to be convertedinto stellar constituents, or to be dispersed by stellar activities. moreover,although there is a scatter, we found a tendency that the sfes of the denseclumps increase from type a to type c, which also supports our scenario.

1001.1764	an investigation of the dust content in the galaxy pair ngc 1512/1510  from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths	we combine new aste/aztec 1.1 mm maps of the galaxy pair ngc 1512/1510 witharchival spitzer irac and mips images covering the wavelength range 3.6--160 umfrom the sings project to derive accurate dust masses in each galaxy, and insub--galactic regions in ngc 1512. the two galaxies form a pair consisting of alarge, high--metallicity spiral (ngc 1512) and a low metallicity, blue compactdwarf (ngc 1510). the derived total dust masses are (2.4+/-0.6) 10^7 msun and(1.7+/-3.6) 10^5 msun for ngc 1512 and ngc 1510, respectively. the derivedratio of dust mass to h i gas mass for the galaxy pair (0.0034) is much lowerthan expected, while regions within ngc 1512, specifically the central regionand the arms, do not show such unusually low ratios; furthermore, thedust--to--gas ratio is within expectations for ngc 1510. these results suggestthat a fraction of the h i included in the determination of the m_d/m_hi ratioof the ngc 1512/1510 pair is not associated with the star forming disks/regionsof either galaxy. we also perform simple two--temperature (warm + cold)modified--blackbody fits to the far--infrared/mm data. the warm dusttemperature of the low--metallicity ngc 1510 (~36 k) is substantially higherthan that of the high--metallicity ngc 1512 (~24 k). in both galaxies, asubstantial fraction (&gt;93%) of the total dust mass is in a cool dust component,with temperatures 14--16 k for ngc 1512 and 15--24 k for ngc 1510. in contrast,the warm dust in the arms and central regions of ngc 1512 represents a muchlarger fraction of the total dust content, in agreement with the fact that allthree regions have higher specific star formation rates than the average in thegalaxy.

0708.1020	evidence for a population of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies from  interferometric imaging	we have used the submillimeter array to image a flux limited sample of sevensubmillimeter galaxies, selected by the aztec camera on the jcmt at 1.1 mm, inthe cosmos field at 890um with 2" resolution. all of the sources - tworadio-bright and five radio-dim - are detected as single point-sources at highsignificance (&gt; 6\sigma), with positions accurate to 0.2" that enablecounterpart identification at other wavelengths observed with similarly highangular resolution. all seven have irac counterparts, but only two have securecounterparts in deep hst/acs imaging. as compared to the two radio-brightsources in the sample, and those in previous studies, the five radio-dimsources in the sample (1) have systematically higher submillimeter-to-radioflux ratios, (2) have lower irac 3.6-8.0um fluxes, and (3) are not detected at24um. these properties, combined with size constraints at 890um (\theta &lt;1.2"), suggest that the radio-dim submillimeter galaxies represent a populationof very dusty starbursts, with physical scales similar to local ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, and an average redshift higher than radio-bright sources.

1110.6225	evidence for cloud-cloud collision and parsec-scale stellar feedback  within the l1641-n region	we present high spatial resolution $^{12}$co ($j=1-0$) images taken by thenobeyama 45m telescope toward a $48' \times 48'$ area including the l1641-ncluster. the effective spatial resolution of the maps is $21"$, correspondingto 0.04 pc at a distance of 400 pc. a recent 1.1 mm dust continuum map revealsthat the dense gas is concentrated in several thin filaments. we find that afew dust filaments are located at the parts where $^{12}$co ($j=1-0$) emissiondrops sharply. furthermore, the filaments have two-components with differentvelocities. the velocity difference between the two-components is about 3 kms$^{-1}$, corresponding to a mach number of 10, significantly larger than thelocal turbulent velocity in the cloud. these facts imply that the collision ofthe two components (hereafter, the cloud-cloud collision) possibly contributedto the formation of these filaments. since the two components appear to overlaptoward the filaments on the plane of the sky, the collision may have occurredalmost along the line of sight. star formation in the l1641-n cluster wasprobably triggered by such a collision. we also find several parsec-scale coshells whose centers are close to either the l1641-n cluster or v 380 oricluster. we propose that these shells were created by multiple winds and/oroutflows from cluster ysos, i.e., "protocluster winds." one exceptional dustfilament located at the western cloud edge lies along a shell; it is presumablya part of the expanding shell. both the cloud-cloud collision and protoclusterwinds are likely to influence the cloud structure and kinematics in thisregion.

0704.3654	a search for co(j=3-2) emission from the host galaxy of grb 980425 with  the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment	we report on a deep search for co(j=3-2) line emission from the host galaxyof grb 980425 with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment (aste). weobserved five points of the galaxy covering the entire region. after combiningall of the spectra, we obtained a global spectrum with the rms noise level of3.3 mk in t_mb scale at a velocity resolution of 10 km s^-1. no significantemission was detected, though we find a marginal emission feature in thevelocity range corresponding to the redshift of the galaxy. we derive 3 sigmaupper limits on the global properties: the velocity-integrated co(3-2)intensity of i_co(3-2) &lt; 0.26 k km s^-1 by adopting a velocity width of 67 kms^-1; the h_2 column density of n(h_2) &lt; 3 x 10^20 cm^-2; the molecular gasmass of m(h_2) &lt; 3 x 10^8 m_sun, by assuming a co line luminosity to h_2molecular gas mass conversion factor of x_co = 5.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1; and the star formation rate of sfr &lt; 0.1 m_sun yr^-1, based on theschmidt law. the sfr is consistent with the previous results of h_alpha andmid-ir observations, thereby suggesting that there is no significant obscuredstar formation in the host galaxy of grb 980425. this result implies that thereis a variety of grb hosts with regard to the presence of obscured starformation.

1209.3801	substellar-mass condensations in prestellar cores	we present combined submillimeter-array (sma) + single-dish images of the(sub)millimeter dust continuum emission toward two prestellar cores sm1 andb2-n5 in the nearest star cluster forming region, $\rho$ ophiuchus. ourcombined images indicate that sm1 and b2-n5 consist of three and fourcondensations, respectively, with masses of $10^{-2}-10^{-1}m_\odot$ and sizesof a few hundred au. the individual condensations have mean densities of$10^8-10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and the masses are comparable to or larger than thecritical bonner-ebert mass, indicating that the self-gravity plays an importantrole in the dynamical evolution of the condensations. the coalescence timescaleof these condensations is estimated to be about $10^4$ yr, which is comparableto the local gravitational collapse timescale, suggesting that merging of thecondensations, instead of accretion, plays an essential role in the starformation process. these results challenge the standard theory of starformation, where a single, rather featureless prestellar core collapses to format most a couple of condensations, each of which potentially evolves into aprotostar that is surrounded by a rotating disk where planets are created.

1210.3801	gmc evolutions in the nearby spiral galaxy m33	we present a giant molecular cloud (gmc) catalog toward m33, containing 71gmcs in total, based on wide field and high sensitivity co(j=3-2) observationswith a spatial resolution of 100 pc using the aste 10 m telescope. employingarchival optical data, we identify 75 young stellar groups (ysgs) from theexcess of the surface stellar density, and estimate their ages by comparingwith stellar evolution models. a spatial comparison among the gmcs, ysgs, andhii regions enable us to classify gmcs into four categories: type a showing nosign of massive star formation (sf), type b being associated only with hiiregions, type c with both hii regions and &lt;10 myr-old ysgs and type-d with bothhii regions and 10--30 myr ysgs. out of 65 gmcs (discarding those at the edgesof the observed fields), 1 (1%), 13 (20%), 29 (45%), and 22 (34%) are types a,b, c, and d, respectively. we interpret these categories as stages in a gmcevolutionary sequence. assuming that the timescale for each evolutionary stageis proportional to the number of gmcs, the lifetime of a gmc with a mass &gt;10^5mo is estimated to be 20--40 myr. in addition, we find that the dense gasfraction as traced by the co(j=3-2)/co(j=1-0) ratio is enhanced around sfregions. this confirms a scenario where dense gas is preferentially formedaround previously generated stars, and will be the fuel for the next stellargeneration. in this way, massive sf gradually propagates in a gmc until gas isexhausted.

1210.6285	nro m33 all-disk survey of giant molecular clouds (nro magic): ii. dense  gas formation within giant molecular clouds in m33	we report the results of our observations of the 12co (j=1-0) and 12co(j=3-2) line emission of 74 major giant molecular clouds (gmcs) within thegalactocentric distance of 5.1 kpc in the local group galaxy m33. theobservations have been conducted as part of the nobeyama radio observatory m33all-disk survey of giant molecular clouds project (nro magic). the spatialresolutions are 80 pc for 12co (j=1-0) and 100 pc for 12co (j=3-2). we detect12co (j=3-2) emission of 65 gmcs successfully. furthermore, we find that thecorrelation between the surface density of the star formation rate, which isderived from a linear combination of halpha and 24um emissions, and the 12co(j=3-2) integrated intensity still holds at this scale. this result show thatthe star-forming activity is closely associated with warm and dense gases thatare traced with the 12co (j=3-2) line, even in the scale of gmcs. we also findthat the gmcs with a high star-forming activity tend to show a high integratedintensity ratio (r3-2/1-0). moreover, we also observe a mass-dependent trend ofr3-2/1-0 for the gmcs with a low star-forming activity. from these results, wespeculate that the r3-2/1-0 values of the gmcs with a low star-forming activitymainly depend on the dense gas fraction and not on the temperature, andtherefore, the dense gas fraction increases with the mass of gmcs, at least inthe gmcs with a low star-forming activity.

1301.3199	maps of massive clumps in the early stage of cluster formation: two  modes of cluster formation, coeval or non-coeval?	we present maps of 7 young massive molecular clumps within 5 target regionsin the c18o (j=1-0) line emission, using the nobeyama 45m telescope. theseclumps, which are not associated with clusters, lie at distances between 0.7 to2.1 kpc. we find c18o clumps with radii of 0.5-1.7 pc, masses of 470-4200 msun,and velocity widths of 1.4-3.3 km/s. all of the clumps are massive andapproximately in virial equilibrium, suggesting they will potentially formclusters. three of our target regions are associated with h ii regions ("cwhrs"from clump with h ii regions), and the other two are without h ii regions(cwohrs). the c18o clumps can be classified into two morphological types: cwhrsshape a filamentary or shell-like structure, cwohrs are spherical. the twocwohrs have systematic velocity gradients. using the publicly released wisedatabase, class i and class ii protostellar candidates were identified withinthe c18o clumps. the fraction of the class i candidates among all ysocandidates (class i+class ii) is &gt; 50 % in cwhrs, and &lt; 50 % in cwohrs. weconclude that effects from the h ii regions can be seen in (1) spatialdistributions of the clumps: filamentary or shell-like structure running alongthe h ii regions, (2) velocity structures of the clumps: large velocitydispersion along shells, and (3) small age spreads of ysos. the small spread inage of the ysos show that the presence of h ii regions tend to trigger coevalcluster formation.

1301.6171	submm/mm galaxy counterpart identification using a characteristic  density distribution	we present a new submm/mm galaxy counterpart identification technique whichbuilds on the use of spitzer irac colors as discriminators between likelycounterparts and the general irac galaxy population. using 102 radio- andsma-confirmed counterparts to aztec sources across three fields (goods-n,goods-s, and cosmos), we develop a non-parametric irac color-colorcharacteristic density distribution (cdd), which, when combined with positionaluncertainty information via likelihood ratios, allows us to rank all potentialirac counterparts around smgs and calculate the significance of each rankingvia the reliability factor. we report all robust and tentative radiocounterparts to smgs, the first such list available for aztec/cosmos, as wellas the highest ranked irac counterparts for all aztec smgs in these fields asdetermined by our technique. we demonstrate that the technique is free of radiobias and thus applicable regardless of radio detections. for observations madewith a moderate beamsize (~18"), this technique identifies ~85 per cent of smgcounterparts. for much larger beamsizes (&gt;30"), we report identification ratesof 33-49 per cent. using simulations, we demonstrate that this technique is animprovement over using positional information alone for observations withfacilities such as aztec on the lmt and scuba-2 on jcmt.

1302.0842	x-ray detections of sub-millimetre galaxies: active galactic nuclei  versus starburst contribution	we present a large-scale study of the x-ray properties and near-ir-to-radioseds of submillimetre galaxies (smgs) detected at 1.1mm with the aztecinstrument across a ~1.2 square degree area of the sky. combining deep 2-4 mschandra data with spitzer irac/mips and vla data within the goods-n/s andcosmos fields, we find evidence for agn activity in ~14 percent of 271 aztecsmgs, ~28 percent considering only the two goods fields. through x-ray spectralmodeling and sed fitting using monte carlo markov chain techniques tosiebenmorgen et al. (2004) (agn) and efstathiou et al. (2000) (starburst)templates, we find that while star formation dominates the ir emission, withsfrs ~100-1000 m_sun/yr, the x-ray emission for most sources is almostexclusively from obscured agns, with column densities in excess of 10^23 cm^-2.only for ~6 percent of our sources do we find an x-ray-derived sfr consistentwith nir-to-radio sed derived sfrs. inclusion of the x-ray luminosities as aprior to the nir-to-radio sed effectively sets the agn luminosity and sfr,preventing significant contribution from the agn template. our sed modelingfurther shows that the agn and starburst templates typically lack the required1.1 mm emission necessary to match observations, arguing for an extended, cooldust component. the cross correlation function between the full samples ofx-ray sources and smgs in these fields does not indicate a strong correlationbetween the two populations at large scales, suggesting that smgs and agns donot necessarily trace the same underlying large scale structure. combined withthe remaining x-ray-dim smgs, this suggests that sub-mm bright sources mayevolve along multiple tracks, with x-ray-detected smgs representingtransitionary objects between periods of high star formation and agn activitywhile x-ray-faint smgs represent a brief starburst phase of more normalgalaxies.

1302.3941	unveiling the detailed density and velocity structures of the  protostellar core b335	we present an observational study of the protostellar core b335 harboring alow-mass class 0 source. the observations of the h13co+(j=1-0) line emissionwere carried out using the nobeyama 45 m telescope and nobeyama millimeterarray. our combined image of the interferometer and single-dish data depictsdetailed structures of the dense envelope within the core. we found that thecore has a radial density profile of n(r) prop. r^-p and a reliable differencein the power-law indices between the outer and inner regions of the core: p~2for r &gt;= 4000 au and p ~ 1.5 for r &lt;= 4000 au}. the dense core shows a slightoverall velocity gradient of ~1.0 km s^-1 over the scale of 20,000 au acrossthe outflow axis. we believe that this velocity gradient represents asolid-body-like rotation of the core. the dense envelope has a quitesymmetrical velocity structure with a remarkable line broadening toward thecore center, which is especially prominent in the position-velocity diagramacross the outflow axis. the model calculations of position-velocity diagramsdo a good job of reproducing observational results using the collapse model ofan isothermal sphere in which the core has an inner free-fall region and anouter region conserving the conditions at the formation stage of a centralstellar object. we derived a central stellar mass of ~0.1 m_sun, and suggest asmall inward velocity, v(r&gt;r_inf) ~ 0 km s^-1 in the outer core at &gt;= 4000 au.we concluded that our data can be well explained by gravitational collapse witha quasi-static initial condition, such as shu's model, or by the isothermalcollapse of a marginally critical bonnor-ebert sphere.

1309.2425	the dynamical state of the serpens south filamentary infrared dark cloud	we present the results of n$_2$h$^+$ ($j=1-0$) observations toward serpenssouth, the nearest cluster-forming, infrared dark cloud. the physicalquantities are derived by fitting the hyperfine structure of n$_2$h$^+$. theherschel and 1.1-mm continuum maps show that a pc-scale filament fragments intothree clumps with radii of $0.1-0.2$ pc and masses of $40-230m_\odot$. we findthat the clumps contain smaller-scale ($\sim 0.04$ pc) structures, i.e., densecores. we identify 70 cores by applying clumpfind to the n$_2$h$^+$ data cube.in the central cluster-forming clump, the excitation temperature and line-widthtend to be large, presumably due to protostellar outflow feedback and stellarradiation. however, for all the clumps, the virial ratios are evaluated to be$0.1-0.3$, indicating that the internal motions play only a minor role in theclump support. the clumps exhibit no free-fall, but low-velocity infall, andthus the clumps should be supported by additional forces. the most promisingforce is the globally-ordered magnetic field observed toward this region. wepropose that the serpens south filament was close to magnetically-critical andambipolar diffusion triggered the cluster formation. we find that the northernclump, which shows no active star formation, has a mass and radius comparableto the central cluster-forming clump, and therefore, it is a likely candidateof a {\it pre-protocluster clump}. the initial condition for cluster formationis likely to be a magnetically-supported clump of cold, quiescent gas. thisappears to contradict the accretion-driven turbulence scenario, for which theturbulence in the clumps is maintained by the accretion flow.

1407.6873	cold molecular gas in merger remnants: i. formation of molecular gas  disks	we present &lt; 1 kpc resolution co imaging study of 37 optically-selected localmerger remnants using new and archival interferometric maps obtained with alma,carma, sma and pdbi. we supplement a sub-sample with single-dish measurementsobtained at the nro 45 m telescope for estimating the molecular gas mass (10^7- 10^11 m_sun), and evaluating the missing flux of the interferometricmeasurements. among the sources with robust co detections, we find that 80 %(24/30) of the sample show kinematical signatures of rotating molecular gasdisks (including nuclear rings) in their velocity fields, and the sizes ofthese disks vary significantly from 1.1 kpc to 9.3 kpc. the size of themolecular gas disks in 54 % of the sources is more compact than the k-bandeffective radius. these small gas disks may have formed from a past gas inflowthat was triggered by a dynamical instability during a potential merging event.on the other hand, the rest (46 %) of the sources have gas disks which areextended relative to the stellar component, possibly forming a late-type galaxywith a central stellar bulge. our new compilation of observational datasuggests that nuclear and extended molecular gas disks are common in the finalstages of mergers. this finding is consistent with recent major-mergersimulations of gas rich progenitor disks. finally, we suggest that some of therotation-supported turbulent disks observed at high redshifts may result fromgalaxies that have experienced a recent major merger.

1410.7368	phase characteristics of the alma 3 km baseline data	we present the phase characteristics study of the atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) long (up to 3 km) baseline, which is thelongest baseline tested so far using alma. the data consist of long time-scale(10 - 20 minutes) measurements on a strong point source (i.e., bright quasar)at various frequency bands (bands 3, 6, and 7, which correspond to thefrequencies of about 88 ghz, 232 ghz, and 336 ghz). water vapor radiometer(wvr) phase correction works well even at long baselines, and the efficiency isbetter at higher pwv (&gt;1 mm) condition, consistent with the past studies. wecalculate the spatial structure function of phase fluctuation, and display thatthe phase fluctuation (i.e., rms phase) increases as a function of baselinelength, and some data sets show turn-over around several hundred meters to 1 kmand being almost constant at longer baselines. this is the firstmillimeter/submillimeter structure function at this long baseline length, andto show the turn-over of the structure function. furthermore, the observationof the turn-over indicates that even if the alma baseline length extends to theplanned longest baseline of 15 km, fringes will be detected at a similar rmsphase fluctuation as that at a few km baseline lengths. we also calculate thecoherence time using the 3 km baseline data, and the results indicate that thecoherence time for band 3 is longer than 400 seconds in most of the data (bothin the raw and wvr-corrected data). for bands 6 and 7, wvr-corrected data haveabout twice longer coherence time, but it is better to use fast switchingmethod to avoid the coherence loss.

1509.02631	z45: a new 45-ghz band dual-polarization hemt receiver for the nro 45-m  radio telescope	we developed a dual-linear-polarization hemt (high electron mobilitytransistor) amplifier receiver system of the 45-ghz band (hereafter z45), andinstalled it in the nobeyama 45-m radio telescope. the receiver system isdesigned to conduct polarization observations by taking the cross correlationof two linearly-polarized components, from which we process full-stokesspectroscopy. we aim to measure the magnetic field strength through the zeemaneffect of the emission line of ccs ($j_n=4_3-3_2$) toward pre-protostellarcores. a linear-polarization receiver system has a smaller contribution ofinstrumental polarization components to the stokes $v$ spectra than that of thecircular polarization system, so that it is easier to obtain the stokes $v$spectra. the receiver has an rf frequency of 42 $-$ 46 ghz and an intermediatefrequency (if) band of 4$-$8 ghz. the typical noise temperature is about 50 k,and the system noise temperature ranges from 100 k to 150k over the frequencyof 42 $-$ 46 ghz. the receiver system is connected to two spectrometers, sam45and polaris. sam45 is a highly flexible fx-type digital spectrometer with afinest frequency resolution of 3.81 khz. polaris is a newly-developed digitalspectrometer with a finest frequency resolution of 60 hz, having a capabilityto process the full-stokes spectroscopy. the half power beam width (hpbw) ofthe beam was measured to be 37$"$ at 43 ghz. the main beam efficiency of thegaussian main beam was derived to be 0.72 at 43 ghz. the sio maser observationsshow that the beam pattern is reasonably round at about 10 \% of the peakintensity and the side-lobe level was less than 3 \% of the peak intensity.finally, we present some examples of astronomical observations using z45.

astro-ph;0101555	impact of future submillimeter and millimeter large facilities on the  studies of galaxy formation and evolution	we investigate what we can learn about galaxy formation and evolution fromthe data which will be obtained by the forthcoming largesubmillimeter/millimeter facilities, mainly by the atacama submillimetertelescope experiment (aste) and the atacama large millimeter array/largemillimeter and submillimeter array (alma/lmsa). we first calculate the sourcecounts from 350 um to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy number countmodel of takeuchi et al. (2001). based on the number counts, we evaluate thesource confusion and determine the confusion limit at various wavebands as afunction of the characteristic beam size. at submillimeter wavelengths, sourceconfusion with the 10-15-m class facilities becomes severe at 0.1 to 1 mjylevel, and astrometry and flux measurements will be difficult. however, we showthat very a large-area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mjycan provide a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z = 1-2. wealso find that the 5\sigma-confusion limit of the lmsa is fainter than 1 \mujy. the source counts at such faint flux levels give important information ofthe epoch of galaxy formation. we then show that multiband photometry from theinfrared (by astro-f) to the millimeter can be utilized as a redshiftestimator. in addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8-ghz source countswith our model counts to examine the contribution of star forming galaxies tothe faint radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0106252	missing link found? --- the ``runaway'' path to supermassive black holes	observations of stellar kinematics, gas dynamics and masers around galacticnuclei have now firmly established that many galaxies host central supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) with masses in the range $10^6 \sim 10^9$m$_{\odot}$.however, how these smbhs formed is not well understood. one reason for thissituation is the lack of observations of intermediate-mass bhs (imbhs), whichcould bridge the gap between stellar-mass bhs and smbhs. recently, this missinglink (i.e., an imbh) has been found in observations made by the asca and thechandra of the central region of the starburst galaxy m82 \citep{mt99, pg99,mt01, ka01}. subsequent observations by subaru have revealed that this imbhapparently coincides with a young compact star cluster. based on thesefindings, we suggest a new formation scenario for smbhs. in this scenario,imbhs first form in young compact star clusters through runaway merging ofmassive stars. while these imbhs are forming, the host star clusters sinktoward the galactic nucleus through dynamical friction, and upon evaporationdeposit their imbhs near the galactic center. the imbhs then form binaries andeventually merge via gravitational radiation, forming an smbh.

astro-ph;9808229	dense molecular gas associated with the circumnuclear star forming ring  in the barred spiral galaxy ngc 6951	we present high resolution (3" - 5") observations of co(1-0) and hcn(1-0)emission from the circumnuclear star forming ring in the barred spiral galaxyngc 6951, a host of a type-2 seyfert, using the nobeyama millimeter array and45 m telescope. we find that most of the hcn emission is associated with thecircumnuclear ring, where vigorous star formation occurs. the hcn to cointegrated intensity ratio is also enhanced in the star forming ring; the peakvalue of hcn/co ratio is 0.18, which is comparable to the ratio in thestarbursts ngc 253 and m82. the formation mechanism of dense molecular gas hasbeen investigated. we find that the shocks along the orbit crowding do notpromote the formation of the dense molecular gas effectively but enhance thepresence of low density gmcs. instead, gravitational instabilities of the gascan account for the dense molecular gas formation. the hcn/co ratio toward theseyfert nucleus of ngc 6951 is a rather normal value (0.086), in contrast withother seyferts ngc 1068 and m51 where extremely high hcn/co value of ~ 0.5 havebeen reported.

astro-ph;9902351	submillimeter detection of the sunyaev -- zel'dovich effect toward the  most luminous x-ray cluster at z=0.45	we report on the detection of the sunyaev -- zel'dovich (sz) signals towardthe most luminous x-ray cluster rxj1347-1145 at nobeyama radio observatory (21and 43 ghz) and at james clerk maxwell telescope (350 ghz). in particular thelatter is the first successful detection of the sz temperature increment in thesubmillimeter band which resolved the profile of a cluster of galaxies. boththe observed spectral dependence and the radial profile of the sz signals arefully consistent with those expected from the x-ray observation of the cluster.the combined analysis of 21ghz and 350ghz data reproduces the temperature andcore-radius of the cluster determined with the rosat and asca satellites whenwe adopt the slope of the density profile from the x-ray observations.therefore our present data provide the strongest and most convincing case forthe detection of the submillimeter sz signal from the cluster, as well as inthe rayleigh -- jeans regime. we also discuss briefly the cosmologicalimplications of the present results.

astro-ph;9909422	aperture synthesis images of dense molecular gas in nearby galaxies with  the nobeyama millimeter array	in order to study the distribution of dense molecular gas and its relation tothe central activities (starburst and agn) in galaxies, we have conducted animaging survey of hcn(1-0) and hco+(1-0) emissions from nearby spiral galaxieswith the nobeyama millimeter array. in starburst galaxies, we find that thereis good spatial coincidence between dense molecular gas and star-formingregions. the ratios of hcn to co integrated intensities on the brightnesstemperature scale, r(hcn/co), are as high as 0.1 to 0.2 in the starburstregions, and quickly decrease outside of these regions. in contrast, we find aremarkable decrease of the hcn emission in the post-starburst nuclei, despitethe strong co concentrations there. the r(hcn/co) values in the central a few100 pc regions of these quiescent galaxies are very low, 0.02 to 0.04. a roughcorrelation between r(hcn/co) and ha/co ratios, which is an indicator of starformation efficiency, is found at a few 100 pc scale. the fraction of densemolecular gas in the total molecular gas, measured from r(hcn/co), may be animportant parameter that controls star formation. in some seyfert galaxies wefind extremely high r(hcn/co) exceeding 0.3. these very high ratios are neverobserved even in strong starburst regions, implying a physical link betweenextremely high r(hcn/co) and seyfert activity.

0812.2828	molecular superbubbles and outflows from starburst galaxy ngc 2146	we present results from a deep (1 sigma = 5.7 mjy beam^{-1} per 20.8 kms^{-1} velocity channel) ^{12}co(1-0) interferometric observation of thecentral 60" region of the nearby edge-on starburst galaxy ngc 2146 observedwith the nobeyama millimeter array (nma). two diffuse expanding molecularsuperbubbles and one molecular outflow are successfully detected. one molecularsuperbubble, with a size of ~1 kpc and an expansion velocity of ~50 km s^{-1},is located below the galactic disk; a second molecular superbubble, this timewith a size of ~700 pc and an expansion velocity of ~35 km s^{-1}, is also seenin the position-velocity diagram; the molecular outflow is located above thegalactic disk with an extent ~2 kpc, expanding with a velocity of up to ~200 kms^{-1}. the molecular outflow has an arc-like structure, and is located at thefront edge of the soft x-ray outflow. in addition, the kinetic energy (~3e55erg) and the pressure (~1 e-12 \pm 1 dyne cm ^{-2}) of the molecular outflow iscomparable to or smaller than that of the hot thermal plasma, suggesting thatthe hot plasma pushes the molecular gas out from the galactic disk. inside the~1 kpc size molecular superbubble, diffuse soft x-ray emission seems to exist.but since the superbubble lies behind the inclined galactic disk, it is largelyabsorbed by the molecular gas.
