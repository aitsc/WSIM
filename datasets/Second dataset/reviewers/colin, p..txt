0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

0911.0873	a connection between star formation activity and cosmic rays in the  starburst galaxy m 82	although galactic cosmic rays (protons and nuclei) are widely believed to bedominantly accelerated by the winds and supernovae of massive stars, definitiveevidence of this origin remains elusive nearly a century after their discovery[1]. the active regions of starburst galaxies have exceptionally high rates ofstar formation, and their large size, more than 50 times the diameter ofsimilar galactic regions, uniquely enables reliable calorimetric measurementsof their potentially high cosmic-ray density [2]. the cosmic rays produced inthe formation, life, and death of their massive stars are expected toeventually produce diffuse gamma-ray emission via their interactions withinterstellar gas and radiation. m 82, the prototype small starburst galaxy, ispredicted to be the brightest starburst galaxy in gamma rays [3, 4]. here wereport the detection of &gt;700 gev gamma rays from m 82. from these data wedetermine a cosmic-ray density of 250 ev cm-3 in the starburst core of m 82, orabout 500 times the average galactic density. this result strongly supportsthat cosmic-ray acceleration is tied to star formation activity, and thatsupernovae and massive-star winds are the dominant accelerators.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1103.4151	on the stellar and baryonic mass fractions of central blue and red  galaxies	by means of the abundance matching technique, we infer the local stellar andbaryonic mass-halo mass (ms-mh and mb-mh) relation for central blue and redgalaxies separately in the mass range ms~10^8.5-10^12.0 msun. the observationalinputs are the sdss central blue and red galaxy stellar mass functions reportedin yang et al. 2009, and the measured local gas mass-ms relations for blue andred galaxies. for the halo mass function associated to central blue galaxies,the distinct lcdm one is used and set up to exclude: (i) the observedgroup/cluster mass function (blue galaxies are rare as centers ofgroups/clusters), and (ii) halos with a central major merger at resdshiftsz&lt;0.8 (dry late major mergers destroy the disks of blue galaxies). for redgalaxies, we take the complement of this function to the total. the obtainedmean ms-mh and mb-mh relations of central blue and red galaxies do not differsignificantly from the respective relations for all central galaxies. formh&gt;10^11.5 msun, the ms's of red galaxies tend to be higher than those of blueones for a given mh, the difference not being larger than 1.7. for mh&lt;10^11.5msun, this trend is inverted. for blue (red) galaxies: (a) the maximum value offs=ms/mh is 0.021^{+0.016}_{-0.009} (0.034{+0.026}_{-0.015}) and it is attainedatlog(mh/msun)~12.0 (log(mh/msun)~11.9); (b) fs\propto mh (fs\propto mh^3) atthe low-mass end while at the high-mass end, fs\propto mh^-0.4 (fs\proptomh^-0.6). the baryon mass fractions, fb=mb/mh, of blue and red galaxies reachmaximum values of fb=0.028^{+0.018}_{-0.011} and fb=0.034^{+0.025}_{-0.014},respectively. for mh&lt;10^11.3 msun, a much steeper dependence of fb on mh isobtained for the red galaxies than for the blue ones. we discuss on thedifferences found in the fs-mh and fb-mh relations between blue and redgalaxies in the light of of semi-empirical galaxy models.

1103.5677	a search for very high energy gamma-ray emission from scorpius x-1 with  the magic telescopes	the acceleration of particles up to gev or higher energies in microquasarshas been the subject of considerable theoretical and observational efforts inthe past few years. sco x-1 is a microquasar from which evidence of highlyenergetic particles in the jet has been found when it is in the so-calledhorizontal branch (hb), a state when the radio and hard x-ray fluxes are higherand a powerful relativistic jet is present. here we present the first very highenergy gamma-ray observations of sco x-1 obtained with the magic telescopes. ananalysis of the whole dataset does not yield a significant signal, with 95% clflux upper limits above 300 gev at the level of 2.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s.simultaneous rxte observations were conducted to search for tev emission duringparticular x-ray states of the source. a selection of the gamma-ray dataobtained during the hb based on the x-ray colors did not yield a signal either,with an upper limit of 3.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s. these upper limits place aconstraint on the maximum tev luminosity to non-thermal x-ray luminosity ofl_{vhe}/l_{ntx}&lt;0.02, that can be related to a maximum tev luminosity to jetpower ratio of l_{vhe}/l_{j}&lt;10^{-3}. our upper limits indicate that theunderlying high-energy emission physics in sco x-1 must be inherently differentfrom that of the hitherto detected gamma-ray binaries.

0709.4027	on the structure of dark matter halos at the damping scale of the power  spectrum with and without relict velocities	we report a series of high-resolution cosmological n-body simulationsdesigned to explore the formation and properties of dark matter halos withmasses close to the damping scale of the primordial power spectrum of densityfluctuations. we further investigate the effect that the addition of a randomcomponent, v_rms, into the particle velocity field has on the structure ofhalos. we adopted as a fiducial model the lambda warm dark matter cosmologywith a non-thermal sterile neutrino mass of 0.5 kev. the filtering masscorresponds then to m_f = 2.6x10^12 m_sun/h. halos of masses close to m_f weresimulated with several million of particles. the results show that, on onehand, the inner density slope of these halos (at radii &lt;~0.02 the virial radiusrvir) is systematically steeper than the one corresponding to the nfw fit or tothe cdm counterpart. on the other hand, the overall density profile (radiilarger than 0.02rvir) is less curved and less concentrated than the nfw fit,with an outer slope shallower than -3. for simulations with v_rms, the innerhalo density profiles flatten significantly at radii smaller than 2-3 kpc/h(&lt;~0.010-0.015rvir). a constant density core is not detected in oursimulations, with the exception of one halo for which the flat core radius is~1 kpc/h. nevertheless, if ``cored'' density profiles are used to fit the haloprofiles, the inferred core radii are ~0.1-0.8 kpc/h, in rough agreement withtheoretical predictions based on phase-space constrains, and on dynamicalmodels of warm gravitational collapse. a reduction of v_rms by a factor of 3produces a modest decrease in core radii, less than a factor of 1.5. we discussthe extension of our results into several contexts, for example, to thestructure of the cold dm micro-halos at the damping scale of this model.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1109.6124	phase-resolved energy spectra of the crab pulsar in the range of 50-400  gev measured with the magic telescopes	we use 73 h of stereoscopic data taken with the magic telescopes toinvestigate the very high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission of the crab pulsar.our data show a highly significant pulsed signal in the energy range from 50 to400 gev in both the main pulse (p1) and the interpulse (p2) phase regions. weprovide the widest spectra to date of the vhe components of both peaks, andthese spectra extend to the energy range of satellite-borne observatories. thegood resolution and background rejection of the stereoscopic magic systemallows us to cross-check the correctness of each spectral point of the pulsarby comparison with the corresponding (strong and well-known) crab nebula flux.the spectra of both p1 and p2 are compatible with power laws with photonindices of 4.0 \pm 0.8 (p1) and 3.42 \pm 0.26 (p2), respectively, and the ratiop1/p2 between the photon counts of the two pulses is 0.54 \pm 0.12. the vheemission can be understood as an additional component produced by the inversecompton scattering of secondary and tertiary e\pm pairs on ir-uv photons.

1111.5343	an experiment to locate the site of tev flaring in m87	we describe a chandra x-ray too project designed to isolate the site of tevflaring in the radio galaxy m87. to date, we have triggered the chandraobservations only once (2010 april) and by the time of the first of our 9observations, the tev flare had ended. however, we found that the x-rayintensity of the unresolved nucleus was at an elevated level for our firstobservation. of the more than 60 chandra observations we have made of the m87jet covering 9 years, the nucleus was measured at a comparably high level only3 times. two of these occasions can be associated with tev flaring, and at thetime of the third event, there were no tev monitoring activities. from therapidity of the intensity drop of the nucleus, we infer that the size of theemitting region is of order a few light days times the unknown beaming factor;comparable to the same sort of estimate for the tev emitting region. we alsofind evidence of spectral evolution in the x-ray band which seems consistentwith radiative losses affecting the non-thermal population of the emittingelectrons within the unresolved nucleus.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1112.3917	detection of very-high energy \gamma-ray emission from ngc 1275 by the  magic telescopes	we report on the detection of very-high energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rayemission from ngc 1275, the central radio galaxy of the perseus cluster ofgalaxies. the source has been detected by the magic telescopes with astatistical significance of 6.6 sigma above 100 gev in 46 hr of stereoobservations carried out between august 2010 and february 2011. the measureddifferential energy spectrum between 70 gev and 500 gev can be described by apower law with a steep spectral index of \gamma=-4.1+/-0.7stat+/-0.3syst, andthe average flux above 100 gev is f_{gamma}=(1.3+/-0.2stat+/-0.3syst) x 10^-11cm^-2 s^-1. these results, combined with the power-law spectrum measured in thefirst two years of observations by the fermi-lat above 100 mev, with a spectralindex of gamma ~ -2.1, strongly suggest the presence of a break or cut-offaround tens of gev in the ngc 1275 spectrum. the light curve of the sourceabove 100 gev does not show hints of variability on a month time scale.finally, we report on the nondetection in the present data of the radio galaxyic 310, previously discovered by the fermi-lat and magic. the derived fluxupper limit f^{u.l.}_{gamma} (&gt;300 gev)=1.2 x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1 is a factor ~ 3lower than the mean flux measured by magic between october 2009 and february2010, thus confirming the year time-scale variability of the source at vhe.

(&gt;1 tev). the spatialdistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of theemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or themolecular cloud. however, the modeling of the spectral energy distributionpresented by the fermi/lat collaboration suggests a hadronic emissionmechanism. we performed observations of the w51 complex with the magictelescopes for more than 50 hours. the good angular resolution in the medium(few hundred gev) to high (above 1 tev) energies allow us to performmorphological studies. we detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gammarays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. we extend the spectrumfrom the highest fermi/lat energies to \sim 5 tev and find that it follows asingle power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . the mainpart of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find afeature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. the possible contribution ofthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence onenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. the broad band spectralenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies protonacceleration above 100 tev. this result, together with the morphology of thesource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions inthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. these results shedlight on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.01126	insights into the particle acceleration of a peculiar gamma -ray radio  galaxy ic 310	ic 310 has recently been identified as a gamma-ray emitter based onobservations at gev energies with fermi-lat and at very high energies (vhe, e &gt;100 gev) with the magic telescopes. despite ic 310 having been classified as aradio galaxy with the jet observed at an angle &gt; 10 degrees, it exhibits amixture of multiwavelength properties of a radio galaxy and a blazar, possiblymaking it a transitional object. on the night of 12/13th of november 2012 themagic telescopes observed a series of violent outbursts from the direction ofic 310 with flux-doubling time scales faster than 5 min and a peculiar spectrumspreading over 2 orders of magnitude. such fast variability constrains the sizeof the emission region to be smaller than 20% of the gravitational radius ofits central black hole, challenging the shock acceleration models, commonlyused in explanation of gamma-ray radiation from active galaxies. here we willshow that this emission can be associated with pulsar-like particleacceleration by the electric field across a magnetospheric gap at the base ofthe jet.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

astro-ph;0010525	formation and structure of halos in a warm dark matter cosmology	(abridged) using high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations, we studyhow the density profiles of dark matter halos are affected by the filtering ofthe density power spectrum below a given scale length and by the introductionof a thermal velocity dispersion. in the warm dark matter (wdm) scenario, boththe free-streaming scale, r_f, and the velocity dispersion, v_w, are determinedby the mass m_w of the wdm particle. we find that v_w is too small to affectthe density profiles of wdm halos. down to the resolution attained in oursimulations, there is not any significant difference in the density profilesand concentrations of halos obtained in simulations with and without theinclusion of v_w. the density profiles of halos with masses down to ~0.01 thefiltering mass m_f can be described by the nfw shape; significant soft coresare not formed. nevertheless, the concentrations of these halos are lower thanthose of the cdm counterparts and are approximately independent of mass. thelower concentrations of wdm halos with respect to their cdm counterparts can beaccounted for their late formation epoch. overall, our results point to aseries of advantages of a wdm model over the cdm one. in addition to solvingthe substructure problem, a wdm model with r_f~0.16 mpc (m_w~0.75 kev; flatcosmology with omega_l=h=0.7) also predicts concentrations, a tully-fisherrelation, and formation epochs for small halos which seems to be in betteragreement with observations, relative to cdm predictions.

(sig_0&lt;0.5), thecore density of the halos at z=0 is typically higher at a given mass for lowervalues of sig_0 or, at a given sig_0, for lower masses. for values of sig_0 ashigh as 3.0, the halos may undergo the gravothermal catastrophe before z=0.when alpha = 1, the core density of cluster- and mw-sized halos is similar.using sigma = 0.5-1.0x(1/v_100), our predictions agree with the centraldensities and the core scaling laws of halos both inferred from theobservations of dwarf and lsb galaxies and clusters of galaxies. the cumulativevmax-functions of subhalos in mw-sized halos with (sig_0,alpha) = (0.1,0.0),(0.5,0.0) and (0.5,1.0) agree roughly with observations (luminous satellites)for vmax &gt; 30 km/s, while at vmax = 20 km/s the functions are a factor 5-8higher, similar to the cdm predictions. the halos with si have slightly morespecific angular momentum at a given mass shell and are rounder than their cdmcounterparts. we conclude that the introduction of si particles with sigma\propto 1/v_100 may remedy the cuspy core problem of the cdm cosmogony, whilethe subhalo population number remains similar to that of the cdm halos.

astro-ph;0308348	dwarf dark matter halos	we study properties of dark matter halos at high redshifts z=2-10 for a vastrange of masses with the emphasis on dwarf halos with masses 10^7-10^9 msun/h.we find that the density profiles of relaxed dwarf halos are well fitted by thenfw profile and do not have cores. we compute the halo mass function and thehalo spin parameter distribution and find that the former is very wellreproduced by the sheth &amp; tormen model while the latter is well fitted by alognormal distribution with lambda_0 = 0.042 and sigma_lambda = 0.63. weestimate the distribution of concentrations for halos in mass range that coverssix orders of magnitude from 10^7 msun/h to 10^13} msun/h, and find that thedata are well reproduced by the model of bullock et al. the extrapolation ofour results to z = 0 predicts that present-day isolated dwarf halos should havea very large median concentration of ~ 35. we measure the subhalo circularvelocity functions for halos with masses that range from 4.6 x 10^9 msun/h to10^13 msun/h and find that they are similar when normalized to the circularvelocity of the parent halo. dwarf halos studied in this paper are many ordersof magnitude smaller than well-studied cluster- and milky way-sized halos. yet,in all respects the dwarfs are just down-scaled versions of the large halos.they are cuspy and, as expected, more concentrated. they have the same spinparameter distribution and follow the same mass function that was measured forlarge halos.

0808.3422	dynamics of barred galaxies: effects of disk height	we study dynamics of bars in models of disk galaxies embeded in realisticdark matter halos. we find that disk thickness plays an important, if notdominant, role in the evolution and structure of the bars. we also makeextensive numerical tests of different n-body codes used to study bar dynamics.models with thick disks typically used in this type of modeling(height-to-length ratio hz/rd=0.2) produce slowly rotating, and very long,bars. in contrast, more realistic thin disks with the same parameters as in ourgalaxy (hz/rd= 0.1) produce bars with normal length rbar approx r_d, whichrotate quickly with the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar radius1.2-1.4 compatible with observations. bars in these models do not show atendency to slow down, and may lose as little as 2-3 percent of their angularmomentum due to dynamical friction with the dark matter over cosmological time.we attribute the differences between the models to a combined effect of highphase-space density and smaller jeans mass in the thin disk models, whichresult in the formation of a dense central bulge. special attention is paid tonumerical effects such as the accuracy of orbital integration, force and massresolution. using three n-body codes -- gadget, art, and pkdgrav -- we findthat numerical effects are very important and, if not carefully treated, mayproduce incorrect and misleading results. once the simulations are performedwith sufficiently small time-steps and with adequate force and mass resolution,all the codes produce nearly the same results: we do not find any systematicdeviations between the results obtained with tree codes (gadget and pkdgrav)and with the adaptive-mesh-refinement (art) code.

astro-ph;0506627	bars and cold dark matter halos	the central part of a dark matter halo reacts to the presence and evolutionof a bar. not only does the halo absorb angular momentum from the disk, it canalso be compressed and have its shape modified. we study these issues in aseries of cosmologically motivated, highly resolved n-body simulations ofbarred galaxies run under different initial conditions. in all models we findthat the inner halo's central density increases. we model this density increaseusing the standard adiabatic approximation and the modified formula by gnedinet al. and find that halo mass profiles are better reproduced by this latter.in models with a strong bar, the dark matter in the central region forms abar-like structure (``dark matter bar''), which rotates together with thenormal bar formed by the stellar component (``stellar bar''). theminor-to-major axial ratio of a halo bar changes with radius with a typicalvalue 0.7 in the central disk region. dm bar amplitude is mostly a function ofthe stellar bar strength. models in which the bar amplitude increases or staysroughly constant with time, initially large (40%-60%) misalignment between thehalo and disk bars quickly decreases with time as the bar grows. the halo baris nearly aligned with the stellar bar (~10 degrees lag for the halo) after ~2gyr. the torque, which the halo bar exerts on the stellar bar, can serve as amechanism to regulate the angular momentum transfer from the disk to the halo.

astro-ph;0508053	the dependence on environment of cold dark matter halo properties	high-resolution lcdm cosmological n-body simulations are used to study theproperties of galaxy-size dark halos in different environments (cluster, void,and "field"). halos in clusters and their surroundings have a median spinparameter ~1.3 times lower, and tend to be more spherical and to have lessaligned internal angular momentum than halos in voids and the field. for halosin clusters the concentration parameters decrease on average with mass with aslope of ~0.1; for halos in voids these concentrations do not change with mass.for masses &lt;5 10^11 m_sh^-1, halos in clusters are on average ~30-40% moreconcentrated and have ~2 times higher central densities than halos in voids.when comparing only parent halos, the differences are less pronounced but theyare still significant. the vmax-and vrms-mass relations are shallower and morescattered for halos in clusters than in voids, and for a given vmax or vrms,the mass is smaller at z=1 than at z=0 in all the environments. at z=1, thedifferences in the halo properties with environment almost dissapear,suggesting this that the differences were stablished mainly after z~1. thehalos in clusters undergo more dramatic changes than those in the field or thevoids. the differences with environment are owing to (i) the dependence of haloformation time on environment, and (ii) local effects as tidal stripping andthe tumultuos histories that halos suffer in high-density regions. we calculateseminumerical models of disk galaxy evolution in halos with the propertiesfound for the different environments. for a given disk mass, the galaxy diskshave higher surface density, larger vd,max and secular bulge-to-disk ratio,lower gas fraction, and are redder as one goes from cluster to voidenvironments, in rough agreement with observations.

astro-ph;0606360	the dependence of the mass assembly history of cold dark matter halos on  environment	we show by means of a high-resolution n-body simulation how the mass assemblyhistories of galaxy-size cold dark matter (cdm) halos depend on environment.halos in high density environments form earlier and a higher fraction of theirmass is assembled in major mergers, compared to low density environments. thedistribution of the present-day specific mass aggregation rate is stronglydependent on environment. while in low density environments only ~20% of thehalos are not accreting mass at the present epoch, this fraction rises to ~80%at high densities. at z=1 the median of the specific aggregation rate is ~4times larger than at z=0 and almost independent on environment. all thedependences on environment found here are critically enhanced by localprocesses associated to subhalos because the fraction of subhalos increases asthe environment gets denser. the distribution of the halo specific massaggregation rate as well as its dependence on environment resemble therelations for the specific star formation rate distribution of galaxies. ananalogue of the morphology-density relation is also present at the level of cdmhalos, being driven by the halo major merging history. nevertheless, baryonicprocesses are necessary in order to explain further details and the evolutionof the star formation rate-, color- and morphology-environment relations.

astro-ph;0612110	measurement of air and nitrogen fluorescence light yields induced by  electron beam for uhecr experiments	most of the ultra high energy cosmic ray (uhecr) experiments and projects(hires, auger, ta, euso, tus,...) use air fluorescence to detect and measureextensive air showers (eas). the precise knowledge of the fluorescence lightyield (fly) is of paramount importance for the reconstruction of uhecr. themacfly - measurement of air cherenkov and fluorescence light yield - experimenthas been designed to perform such fly measurements. in this paper we willpresent the results of fly in the 290-440 nm wavelength range for dry air andpure nitrogen, both excited by electrons with energy of 1.5 mev, 20 gev and 50gev. the experiment uses a 90sr radioactive source for low energy measurementand a cern sps electron beam for high energy. we find that the fly isproportional to the deposited energy (e_d) in the gas and we show that the airfluorescence properties remain constant independently of the electron energy.at the reference point: atmospheric dry air at 1013 hpa and 23c, the ratiofly/e_d=17.6 photon/mev with a systematic error of 13.2%.

astro-ph;9604071	the omega dependence of the evolution of xi(r)	the evolution of the two-point correlation function, xi(r,z), and thepairwise velocity dispersion, sigma(r,z), for both the matter and halopopulation, in three different cosmological models:(omega_m,omega_lambda)=(1,0), (0.2,0) and (0.2,0.8) are described. if theevolution of xi is parameterized by xi(r,z)=(1+z)^{-(3+eps)}xi(r,0), wherexi(r,0)=(r/r_0)^{-gamma}, then eps(mass) ranges from 1.04 +/- 0.09 for (1,0) to0.18 +/- 0.12 for (0.2,0), as measured by the evolution of at 1 mpc (from z ~ 5to the present epoch). for halos, eps depends on their mean overdensity. haloswith a mean overdensity of about 2000 were used to compute the halo two-pointcorrelation function tested with two different group finding algorithms: thefriends of friends and the spherical overdensity algorithm. it is certainlybelieved that the rate of growth of this xihh will give a good estimate of theevolution of the galaxy two-point correlation function, at least from z ~ 1 tothe present epoch. the values we get for eps(halos) range from 1.54 for (1,0)to -0.36 for (0.2,0), as measured by the evolution of xi(halos) from z ~ 1.0 tothe present epoch. these values could be used to constrain the cosmologicalscenario. the evolution of the pairwise velocity dispersion for the mass andhalo distribution is measured and compared with the evolution predicted by thecosmic virial theorem (cvt). according to the cvt, sigma(r,z)^2 ~ g q rho(z)r^2 xi(r,z) or sigma proportional to (1+z)^{-eps/2}. the values of eps measuredfrom our simulated velocities differ from those given by the evolution of xiand the cvt, keeping gamma and q constant: eps(cvt) = 1.78 +/- 0.13 for (1,0)or 1.40 +/- 0.28 for (0.2,0).
