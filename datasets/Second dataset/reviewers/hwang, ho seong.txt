0903.2922	the mid-infrared view of red sequence galaxies in abell 2218 with akari	we present the {\it akari} infrared camera (irc) imaging observation ofearly-type galaxies in a2218 at z $\simeq$ 0.175. mid-infrared (mir) emissionfrom early-type galaxies traces circumstellar dust emission from agb starsor/and residual star formation. including the unique imaging capability at 11and 15 $\mu$m, our {\it akari} data provide an effective way to investigate mirproperties of early-type galaxies in the cluster environment. among ourflux-limited sample of 22 red sequence early-type galaxies with precisedynamical and line strength measurements ($&lt;$ 18 mag at 3 $\mu m$), we findthat at least 41% have mir-excess emission. the $n3-s11$ versus $n3$ (3 and 11$\mu$m) color-magnitude relation shows the expected blue sequence, but themir-excess galaxies add a red wing to the relation especially at the fainterend. a sed analysis reveals that the dust emission from agb stars is the mostlikely cause for the mir-excess, with low level of star formation being thenext possible explanation. the mir-excess galaxies show a wide spread of$n3-s11$ colors, implying a significant spread (2--11 gyr) in the estimatedmean ages of stellar populations. we study the environmental dependence ofmir-excess early-type galaxies over an area out to a half virial radius($\sim$1 mpc). we find that the mir-excess early-type galaxies arepreferentially located in the outer region. from these evidences, we suggestthat the fainter, mir-excess early-type galaxies have just joined the redsequence, possibly due to the infall and subsequent morphological/spectraltransformation induced by the cluster environment.

0905.2586	evidence for morphology and luminosity transformation of galaxies at  high redshifts	we study the galaxy morphology-luminosity-environmental relation and itsredshift evolution using a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the greatobservatories origins deep survey (goods). in the redshift range of $0.4\leqz\leq1.0$ we detect conformity in morphology between neighboring galaxies. therealm of conformity is confined within the virialized region associated witheach galaxy plus dark matter halo system. when a galaxy is located within thevirial radius of its nearest neighbor galaxy, its morphology strongly dependson the neighbor's distance and morphology: the probability for a galaxy to bean early type ($f_e$) strongly increases as it approaches an early-typeneighbor, but tends to decrease as it approaches a late-type neighbor. we findthat $f_e$ evolves much faster in high density regions than in low densityregions, and that the morphology-density relation becomes significantly weakerat $z\approx 1$. this may be because the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions ishigher in high density regions, and a series of interactions and mergers overthe course of galaxy life eventually transform late types into early types. wefind more isolated galaxies are more luminous, which supports luminositytransformation through mergers at these redshifts. our results are consistentwith those from nearby galaxies, and demonstrate that galaxy-galaxyinteractions have been strongly affecting the galaxy evolution over a longperiod of time.

0912.1728	the globular cluster system of the virgo giant elliptical galaxy ngc  4636: ii. kinematics of the globular cluster system	we present a kinematic analysis of the globular cluster(gc) system in thegiant elliptical galaxy (ge) ngc 4636 in the virgo cluster. using thephotometric and spectroscopic database of 238 gcs, we have investigated thekinematics of the gc system. the ngc 4636 gc system shows weak overallrotation, which is dominated by the red gcs. however, both the blue gcs and redgcs show some rotation in the inner region at r&lt;4.3'. the velocity dispersionfor all the gcs is derived to be sigma_p = 225{+12-9} km/s. the velocitydispersion for the blue gcs (sig=251 km/s) is slightly larger than that for thered gcs (sig=205 km/s). the velocity dispersions for the blue gcs about themean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve have a significantvariation depending on the galactocentric radius. comparison of observedstellar and gc velocity dispersion profiles with the velocity dispersionprofiles calculated from the stellar mass profile shows that the mass-to-lightratio should increase as the galactocentric distance increases, indicating theexistence of an extended dark matter halo. from the comparison of the observedgc velocity dispersion profiles and the velocity dispersion profiles calculatedfor the x-ray mass profiles in the literature, we find that the orbit of the gcsystem is tangential, and that the orbit of the red gcs is slightly moretangential than that of the blue gcs. we compare the gc kinematics of ngc 4636with those of other six ges, finding that the kinematic properties of the gcsare diverse among ges. we find several correlations between the kinematics ofthe gcs and the global parameters of their host galaxies. we discuss theimplication of the results for the formation models of the gc system in ges,and suggest a mixture scenario for the origin of the gcs in ges.

1003.5773	a multi-wavelength view of the star formation activity at z~3	we present a multi-wavelength, uv-to-radio analysis for a sample of massive(m$_{\ast}$ $\sim$ 10$^{10}$ m$_\odot$) irac- and mips 24$\mu$m-detected lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) with spectroscopic redshifts z$\sim$3 in the goods-northfield (l$_{\rm uv}$$&gt;1.8\times$l$^{\ast}_{z=3}$). for lbgs without individual24$\mu$m detections, we employ stacking techniques at 24$\mu$m, 1.1mm and1.4ghz, to construct the average uv-to-radio spectral energy distribution andfind it to be consistent with that of a luminous infrared galaxy (lirg) withl$\rm_{ir}$=4.5$^{+1.1}_{-2.3}$$\times 10^{11}$ l$_{\odot}$ and a specific starformation rate (ssfr) of 4.3 gyr$^{-1}$ that corresponds to a mass doublingtime $\sim$230 myrs. on the other hand, when considering the 24$\mu$m-detectedlbgs we find among them galaxies with l$\rm_{ir}&gt; 10^{12}$ l$_{\odot}$,indicating that the space density of $z\sim$3 uv-selected ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies (ulirgs) is $\sim$(1.5$\pm$0.5)$\times 10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$.we compare measurements of star formation rates (sfrs) from data at differentwavelengths and find that there is tight correlation (kendall's $\tau &gt;$ 99.7%)and excellent agreement between the values derived from dust-corrected uv,mid-ir, mm and radio data for the whole range of l$\rm_{ir}$ up to l$\rm_{ir}$$\sim$ 10$^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$. this range is greater than that for which thecorrelation is known to hold at z$\sim$2, possibly due to the lack ofsignificant contribution from pahs to the 24$\mu$m flux at $z\sim$3. the factthat this agreement is observed for galaxies with l$\rm_{ir}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{12}$l$_{\odot}$ suggests that star-formation in uv-selected ulirgs, as well as thebulk of star-formation activity at this redshift, is not embedded in opticallythick regions as seen in local ulirgs and submillimeter-selected galaxies at$z=2$.

1006.0775	distribution of satellite galaxies in high redshift groups	we use galaxy groups at redshifts between 0.4 and 1.0 selected from the greatobservatories origins deep survey (goods) to study the color-morphologicalproperties of satellite galaxies, and investigate possible alignment betweenthe distribution of the satellites and the orientation of their central galaxy.we confirm the bimodal color and morphological type distribution for satellitegalaxies at this redshift range: the red and blue classes corresponds to theearly and late morphological types respectively, and the early-type satellitesare on average brighter than the late-type ones. furthermore, there is a {\itmorphological conformity} between the central and satellite galaxies: thefraction of early-type satellites in groups with an early-type central ishigher than those with a late-type central galaxy. this effect is stronger atsmaller separations from the central galaxy. we find a marginally significantsignal of alignment between the major axis of the early-type central galaxy andits satellite system, while for the late-type centrals no significant alignmentsignal is found. we discuss the alignment signal in the context of shapeevolution of groups.

1006.2166	environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies	we study the environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) found in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data. the lirg and ulirg samples are constructed bycross-correlating spectroscopic catalogs of galaxies of the sdss data release 7and the infrared astronomical satellite faint source catalog. we examine theeffects of the large-scale background density (sigma_5), galaxy clusters, andthe nearest neighbor galaxy on the properties of infrared galaxies (irgs). wefind that the fraction of lirgs plus ulirgs among irgs (f_(u)lirgs) and theinfrared luminosity (l_ir) of irgs strongly depend on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy: the probability for an irg to be a(u)lirg (f_(u)lirgs) and its l_ir both increase as it approaches a late-typegalaxy, but decrease as it approaches an early-type galaxy (within half thevirial radius of its neighbor). we find no dependence of f_(u)lirgs on thebackground density (surface galaxy number density) at fixed stellar mass ofgalaxies. the dependence of f_(u)lirgs on the distance to galaxy clusters isalso found to be very weak, but in highest-density regions such as the centerof galaxy clusters, few (u)lirgs are found. these environmental dependence oflirgs and ulirgs and the evolution of star formation rate (sfr)-environmentrelation from high redshifts to low redshifts seem to support the idea thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions/merging play a critical role in triggering the starformation activity of lirgs and ulirgs.

1007.2051	orbital dependence of galaxy properties in satellite systems of galaxies	we study the dependence of satellite galaxy properties on the distance to thehost galaxy and the orbital motion using the sdss data. from sdss dr7 we find3515 isolated satellite systems of galaxies at z&lt;0.03 that contain 8904satellite galaxies. using this sample we construct a catalog of 635 satellitesassociated with 215 host galaxies whose spin directions are determined by ourinspection of the sdss color images and/or by spectroscopic observations in theliterature. we divide satellite galaxies into prograde and retrograde orbitsubsamples depending on their orbital motion respect to the spin direction ofthe host. we find that the number of galaxies in prograde orbit is nearly equalto that of retrograde orbit galaxies: the fraction of satellites in progradeorbit is 50+/-2%. the velocity distribution of satellites with respect to theirhosts is found almost symmetric: the median bulk rotation of satellites is-1+/- 8 km/s. it is found that the radial distribution of early-type satellitesin prograde orbit is strongly concentrated toward the host while that ofretrograde ones shows much less concentration. we also find the orbital speedof late-type satellites in prograde orbit increases as the projected distanceto the host (r) decreases while the speed decreases for those in retrogradeorbit. at r less than 0.1 times the host virial radius the orbital speeddecreases in both prograde and retrograde orbit cases. prograde satellites areon average fainter than retrograde satellites for both early and latemorphological types. the u-r color becomes redder as r decreases for bothprograde and retrograde orbit late-type satellites. the differences betweenprograde and retrograde orbit satellites may be attributed to their differentorigin or the different strength of physical processes that they haveexperienced through hydrodynamic interactions with their host galaxies.

1008.2832	quantifying galactic morphological transformations in the cluster  environment	we study the effects of the cluster environment on galactic morphology bydefining a dimensionless angular momentum parameter $\lambda_{d}$, to obtain aquantitative and objective measure of galaxy type. the use of this physicalparameter allows us to take the study of morphological transformations inclusters beyond the measurements of merely qualitative parameters, e.g. s/eratios, to a more physical footing. to this end, we employ an extensive sloandigital sky survey sample (data release 7), with galaxies associated with abellgalaxy clusters. the sample contains 121 relaxed abell clusters and over 51,000individual galaxies, which guarantees a thorough statistical coverage over awide range of physical parameters. we find that the median $\lambda_{d}$ valuetends to decrease as we approach the cluster center, with different dependencesaccording to the mass of the galaxies and the hosting cluster; low andintermediate mass galaxies showing a strong dependence, while massive galaxiesseems to show, at all radii, low $\lambda_{d}$ values. by analysing trends in$\lambda_{d}$ as functions of the nearest neighbour environment, clustercentricradius and velocity dispersion of clusters, we can identify clearly the leadingphysical processes at work. we find that in massive clusters ($\sigma&gt;700$km/s), the interaction with the cluster central region dominates, whilst insmaller clusters galaxy-galaxy interactions are chiefly responsible for drivinggalactic morphological transformations.

0704.2272	the connection between star-forming galaxies, agn host galaxies and  early-type galaxies in the sdss	we present a study of the connection between star-forming galaxies, agn hostgalaxies, and normal early-type galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). using the sdss dr5 and dr4plus data, we select our early-type galaxysample in the color versus color-gradient space, and we classify the spectraltypes of the selected early-type galaxies into normal, star-forming, seyfert,and liner classes, using several spectral line flux ratios. we investigate theslope in the fundamental space for each class of early-type galaxies and findthat there are obvious differences in the slopes of the fundamental planes(fps) among the different classes of early-type galaxies, in the sense that theslopes for seyferts and star-forming galaxies are flatter than those for normalgalaxies and liners. this may be the first identification of the systematicvariation of the fp slope among the subclasses of early-type galaxies. thedifference in the fp slope might be caused by the difference in the degree ofnonhomology among different classes or by the difference of gas contents intheir merging progenitors. one possible scenario is that the agn host galaxiesand star-forming galaxies are formed by gas-rich merging and that they mayevolve into normal early-type galaxies after finishing their star formation oragn activities.

1011.6408	merging galaxy cluster abell 2255 in mid-infrared	we present the mid-infrared (mir) observation of a nearby galaxy cluster,abell 2255 by the akari space telescope. using the akari's continuouswavelength coverage between 3-24 micron and the wide field of view, weinvestigate the properties of cluster member galaxies to see how the infall ofthe galaxies, the cluster substructures, and the cluster-cluster mergerinfluence their evolution. we show that the excess of mir (11 micron) flux is agood indicator to discriminate galaxies at different evolutionary stages, anddivide galaxies into three classes accordingly : strong mir-excess (n3-s11&gt;0.2)galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star-forming galaxies, weakmir-excess (-2.0&lt;n3-s11&lt;-1.2) galaxies that are quiescent, old (&gt;5 gyr)galaxies where the mir emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dustaround agb stars, and intermediate mir-excess (-1.2&lt;n3-s11&lt;0.2) galaxies inbetween the two classes that are less than a few gyrs old past the prime starformation activity. with the mir-excess diagnostics, we investigate how localand cluster-scale environments affect the individual galaxies. we derive thetotal star formation rate of ~130 msun/yr for a2255 using the strong mir-excessgalaxies, which is consistent with other clusters of galaxies at similarredshifts and with similar masses. we find no strong evidence that supportsenhanced star formation neither inside the cluster nor in the substructureregion. the intermediate mir-excess galaxies, representing galaxies intransition from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies, are locatedpreferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures. ourfindings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star-forming galaxiesinto red, quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core,which can be well-explained by the ram-pressure stripping as previoussimulation suggests.

1110.4057	goods-herschel and candels: the morphologies of ultraluminous infrared  galaxies at z~2	using deep 100-160 micron observations in goods-s from the goods-h survey,combined with hst/wfc3 nir imaging from candels, we present the firstmorphological analysis of a complete, fir selected sample of 52 ulirgs at z~2.we also make use of a comparison sample of galaxies without herschel detectionsbut with the same z and magnitude distribution. our visual classifications ofthese two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroidmorphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ulirgs. the combination of diskand irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactionsand minor mergers could play an important role in ulirgs at z~2. we comparethese fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range andfind that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with l_ir while thefraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.at comparable luminosities, the fraction of ulirgs with various morphologicalclassifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. we investigate the position of theulirgs, along with 70 lirgs, on the specific star formation rate versusredshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (lie more than a factor of3 above the main sequence relation). the morphologies of starbursts aredominated by interacting and merging systems (50%). if irregular disks areincluded as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starburstsare involved in a merger or interaction at some level. although the finalcoalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities ofulirgs at z~2 as is the case locally, the large fraction of interactions at allstages and potential minor mergers suggest that the high star formation ratesof ulirgs are still largely externally triggered at z~2.

1111.1973	activity in galactic nuclei of cluster and field galaxies in the local  universe	we study the environmental effects on the activity in galactic nuclei bycomparing galaxies in clusters and in the field. using a spectroscopic sampleof galaxies in abell clusters from the sdss dr7, we investigate the dependenceof nuclear activity on the physical parameters of clusters as well as thenearest neighbor galaxy. we also compare galaxy properties between agn hostsand non-agn galaxies. we find that the agn fraction of early-type galaxiesstarts to decrease around one virial radius of clusters (r_{200,cl}) asdecreasing clustercentric radius, while that of late types starts to decreaseclose to the cluster center (r~0.1-0.5r_{200,cl}). the agn fractions ofearly-type cluster galaxies on average are found to be lower than those ofearly-type field galaxies by a factor ~3. however, the mean agn fractions oflate-type cluster galaxies are similar to those of late-type field galaxies.the agn fraction of early-type bcgs lies between those of other early-type,cluster and field galaxies with similar luminosities. in the field, the agnfraction strongly depends on the morphology of and the distance to the nearestneighbor galaxy. we find an anti-correlation between the agn fraction and thevelocity dispersion of clusters for all subsamples divided by morphology andluminosity of host galaxies. the agn power indicated by l_[oiii]/m_bh is foundto depend strongly on the mass of host galaxies rather than the clustercentricradius. the difference in physical parameters such as luminosity, (u-r) colors,sfrs, and (g-i) color gradients between agn hosts and non-agn galaxies is seenfor both early and late types at all clustercentric radii, while the differencein structure parameters between the two is significant only for late types.these results support the idea that the nuclear activity is triggered throughgalaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers when gas supply for agn is available.

1111.6693	akari observation of the north ecliptic pole (nep) supercluster at z =  0.087: mid-infrared view of transition galaxies	we present the mid-infrared (mir) properties of galaxies within asupercluster in the north ecliptic pole region at z?0.087 observed with theakari satellite. we use data from the akari nep-wide (5.4 deg2) ir survey andthe clusters of galaxies evolution studies (clevl) mission program. we showthat near-ir (3 {\mu}m)-mid- ir (11 {\mu}m) color can be used as an indicatorof the specific star formation rate and the presence of intermediate agestellar populations. from the mir observations, we find that red-sequencegalaxies consist not only of passively evolving red early-type galaxies, butalso of 1) "weak-sfg" (disk-dominated star-forming galaxies which have starformation rates lower by \sim 4 \times than blue-cloud galaxies), and 2)"intermediate- mxg" (bulge-dominated galaxies showing stronger mir dustemission than normal red early-type galaxies). those two populations can be aset of transition galaxies from blue, star-forming, late-type galaxies evolvinginto red, quiescent, early-type ones. we find that the weak-sfg are predominantat intermediate masses (1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1010.5m\odot) and are typicallyfound in local densities similar to the outskirts of galaxy clusters. as muchas 40% of the supercluster member galaxies in this mass range can be classifiedas weak-sfgs, but their proportion decreases to &lt; 10% at larger masses (m\star&gt; 1010.5 m\odot) at any galaxy density. the fraction of the intermediate-mxgamong red- sequence galaxies at 1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1011m\odot also decreasesas the density and mass increase. in particular, \sim42% of the red-sequencegalaxies with early-type morphologies are classified as intermediate-mxg atintermediate densities. these results suggest that the star formation activityis strongly dependent on the stellar mass, but that the morphologicaltransformation is mainly controlled by the environment.

1204.2597	a wise view of a nearby supercluster a2199	we use wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) data covering the entireregion (~130 deg^2) of the a2199 supercluster at z=0.03 to study themid-infrared (mir) properties of supercluster galaxies. we identify a `mirstar-forming sequence' in the wise [3.4]-[12] color-12 \mu m luminositydiagram, consisting of late-type, star-forming galaxies. at a fixed starformation rate (sfr), the mir-detected galaxies at 22 \mu m or 12 \mu m tend tobe more metal rich and to have higher surface brightness than those without mirdetection. using these mir-detected galaxies, we construct the ir luminosityfunction (lf) and investigate its environmental dependence. both total ir (tir)and 12 \mu m lfs are dominated by late-type, star-forming galaxies. thecontribution of active galactic nuclei (agn)-host galaxies increases with bothtir and 12 \mu m luminosities. the contribution of early-type galaxies to the12 \mu m lfs increases with decreasing luminosity. the faint-end slope of thetir lfs does not change with environment, but the change of faint-end slope inthe 12 \mu m lfs with the environment is significant: there is a steeperfaint-end slope in the cluster core than in the cluster outskirts. thissteepening results primarily from the increasing contribution of early-typegalaxies toward the cluster. these galaxies are passively evolving, and containold stellar populations with weak mir emission from the circumstellar dustaround asymptotic giant branch stars.

1204.4236	the spin of late-type galaxies at redshifts z &lt; 1.2	we study the evolution of the galactic spin using data of high redshiftgalaxies in the fields of the great observatories origins deep survey (goods).through simple dynamical considerations we estimate the spin for the discgalaxies in our sample and find that its distribution is consistent with thatfound for nearby galaxies. defining a dimensionless angular momentum parameterfor the disc component of the galaxies ($\lambda_{d}$), we do not find signs ofevolution in the redshift range $0.4 \leq z \leq 1.2$. we find that the massand environmental dependence of the spin of our high redshift galaxies aresimilar to that of low-$z$ galaxies; showing a strong dependence on mass, inthe sense that low-mass systems present higher $\lambda_{d}$ values thanhigh-mass galaxies, with no significant dependence on the environmentaldensity. these results lead us to conclude that, although individual discgalaxies might occasionally suffer from strong evolution, they evolve in such away that the overall spin distribution of the galactic population remainsconstant from $z\sim1$ to the present epoch.

0711.1232	wide-field survey of globular clusters in m31. ii. kinematics of the  globular cluster system	we present a kinematic analysis of the globular cluster(gc) system in m31.using the photometric and spectroscopic database of 504 gcs, we haveinvestigated the kinematics of the m31 gc system. we find that the all gcsystem shows strong rotation, with rotation amplitude of v_rot~190km/s, andthat a weak rotation persists even for the outermost samples at |y|&gt;5kpc. therotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the gc system is estimated to besigma_{p,r}~130km/s, and it increases from sigma_{p,r}~120km/s at |y|&lt;1kpc tosigma_{p,r}~150km/s at |y|&gt;5kpc. these results are very similar to those forthe metal-poor gcs. this shows that there is a dynamically hot halo in m31 thatis rotating but primarily pressure-supported. we have identified 50"friendless" gcs, and they appear to rotate around the major axis of m31. forthe subsamples of metal-poor and metal-rich gcs, we have found that themetal-rich gcs are more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor gcs, andboth subsamples show strong rotation. for the subsamples of bright and faintgcs, it is found that the rotation for the faint gcs is stronger than that forthe bright gcs. we have identified 56 gcs and gc candidates with x-raydetection. it is found that the majority of x-ray emitting gcs follow the diskrotation, and that the redder, more metal-rich, and brighter gcs are morelikely to be detected as x-ray emitting gcs. we have derived a rotation curveof m31 using the gcs at |y|&lt;0.6kpc. we have estimated the dynamical mass of m31using `projected mass estimator(pme)' and `tracer mass estimator(tme)'. wefinally discuss the implication of these results and compare the kinematics ofgcs with that of planetary nebulae in m31.

1209.2707	evidence for a wide range of uv obscuration in z ~ 2 dusty galaxies from  the goods-herschel survey	dusty galaxies at z ~ 2 span a wide range of relative brightness betweenrest-frame mid-infrared (8um) and ultraviolet wavelengths. we attempt todetermine the physical mechanism responsible for this diversity. dust-obscuredgalaxies (dogs), which have rest-frame mid-ir to uv flux density ratios &gt; 1000,might be abnormally bright in the mid-ir, perhaps due to prominent agn and/orpah emission, or abnormally faint in the uv. we use far-infrared data from thegoods-herschel survey to show that most dogs with 10^12 l_sun &lt; l_ir &lt; 10^13l_sun are not abnormally bright in the mid-ir when compared to other dustygalaxies with similar ir (8--1000um) luminosities. we observe a relationbetween the median ir to uv luminosity ratios and the median uv continuumpower-law indices for these galaxies, and we find that only 24% have specificstar formation rates which indicate the dominance of compact star-formingregions. this circumstantial evidence supports the idea that the uv- andir-emitting regions in these galaxies are spatially coincident, which implies aconnection between the abnormal uv faintness of dogs and dust obscuration. weconclude that the range in rest-frame mid-ir to uv flux density ratios spannedby dusty galaxies at z ~ 2 is due to differing amounts of uv obscuration. ofgalaxies with these ir luminosities, dogs are the most obscured. we attributedifferences in uv obscuration to either: 1) differences in the degree ofalignment between the spatial distributions of dust and massive stars, or 2)differences in the total dust content.

1209.4902	goods-herschel: impact of active galactic nuclei and star formation  activity on infrared spectral energy distributions at high redshift	we explore the effects of active galactic nuclei (agn) and star formationactivity on the infrared (0.3-1000 microns) spectral energy distributions ofluminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.5 to 4.0. we have compiled a large sampleof 151 galaxies selected at 24 microns (s24 &gt; 100 ujy) in the goods-n and ecdfsfields for which we have deep spitzer irs spectroscopy, allowing us todecompose the mid-ir spectrum into contributions from star formation and agnactivity. a significant portion (~25%) of our sample is dominated by an agn inthe mid-ir. based on the mid-ir classification, we divide our full sample intofour sub-samples: z~1 star-forming (sf) sources; z~2 sf sources; agn with clear9.7 micron silicate absorption; and agn with featureless mid-ir spectra. fromour large spectroscopic sample and wealth of multi-wavelength data, includingdeep herschel imaging at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 microns, we use 95galaxies with complete spectral coverage to create a composite spectral energydistribution (sed) for each sub-sample. we then fit a two-temperature componentmodified blackbody to the seds. we find that the ir seds have similar cold dusttemperatures, regardless of the mid-ir power source, but display a markeddifference in the warmer dust temperatures. we calculate the average effectivetemperature of the dust in each sub-sample and find a significant (~20 k)difference between the sf and agn systems. we compare our composite seds tolocal templates and find that local templates do not accurately reproduce themid-ir features and dust temperatures of our high redshift systems. highredshift ir luminous galaxies contain significantly more cool dust than theirlocal counterparts. we find that a full suite of photometry spanning the irpeak is necessary to accurately account for the dominant dust temperaturecomponents in high redshift ir luminous galaxies.

1212.2971	goods-herschel: separating high redshift active galactic nuclei and star  forming galaxies using infrared color diagnostics	we have compiled a large sample of 151 high redshift (z=0.5-4) galaxiesselected at 24 microns (s24&gt;100 ujy) in the goods-n and ecdfs fields for whichwe have deep spitzer irs spectroscopy, allowing us to decompose themid-infrared spectrum into contributions from star formation and activity inthe galactic nuclei. in addition, we have a wealth of photometric data fromspitzer irac/mips and herschel pacs/spire. we explore how effective differentinfrared color combinations are at separating our mid-ir spectroscopicallydetermined active galactic nuclei from our star forming galaxies. we look indepth at existing irac color diagnostics, and we explore new color-colordiagnostics combining mid-ir, far-ir, and near-ir photometry, since thesecombinations provide the most detail about the shape of a source's ir spectrum.an added benefit of using a color that combines far-ir and mid-ir photometry isthat it is indicative of the power source driving the ir luminosity. for ourdata set, the optimal color selections are s250/s24 vs. s8.0/s3.6 and s100/s24vs. s8.0/s3.6; both diagnostics have ~10% contamination rate in the regionsoccupied primarily by star forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei,respectively. based on the low contamination rate, these two new ir color-colordiagnostics are ideal for estimating both the mid-ir power source of a galaxywhen spectroscopy is unavailable and the dominant power source contributing tothe ir luminosity. in the absence of far-ir data, we present color diagnosticsusing the wise mid-ir bands which can efficiently select out high z (z~2) starforming galaxies.

1404.7526	the universal relation of galactic chemical evolution: the origin of the  mass-metallicity relation	we examine the mass-metallicity relation for $z\lesssim 1.6$. themass-metallicity relation follows a steep slope with a turnover or `knee' atstellar masses around $10^{10} m_\odot$. at stellar masses higher than thecharacteristic turnover mass, the mass-metallicity relation flattens asmetallicities begin to saturate. we show that the redshift evolution of themass-metallicity relation depends only on evolution of the characteristicturnover mass. the relationship between metallicity and the stellar massnormalized to the characteristic turnover mass is independent of redshift. wefind that the redshift independent slope of the mass-metallicity relation isset by the slope of the relationship between gas mass and stellar mass. theturnover in the mass-metallicity relation occurs when the gas-phase oxygenabundance is high enough that the amount of oxygen locked up in low mass starsis an appreciable fraction of the amount of oxygen produced by massive stars.the characteristic turnover mass is the stellar mass where the stellar-to-gasmass ratio is unity. numerical modeling suggests that the relationship betweenmetallicity and stellar-to-gas mass ratio is a redshift independent, universalrelationship followed by all galaxies as they evolve. the mass-metallicityrelation originates from this more fundamental universal relationship betweenmetallicity and stellar-to-gas mass ratio. we test the validity of thisuniversal metallicity relation in local galaxies where stellar mass,metallicity and gas mass measurements are available. the data are consistentwith a universal metallicity relation. we derive an equation for estimating thehydrogen gas mass from measurements of stellar mass and metallicity valid for$z\lesssim1.6$ and predict the cosmological evolution of galactic gas masses.

1405.2934	the number density of quiescent compact galaxies at intermediate  redshift	massive compact systems at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 are the missing link between thepredominantly compact population of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshiftand their analogs and relics in the local volume. the evolution in numberdensity of these extreme objects over cosmic time is the crucial constrainingfactor for the models of massive galaxy assembly. we select a large sample of~200 intermediate-redshift massive compacts from the boss spectroscopic datasetby identifying point-like sdss photometric sources with spectroscopicsignatures of evolved redshifted galaxies. a subset of our targets havepublicly available high-resolution ground-based images that we use to augmentthe dynamical and stellar population properties of these systems by theirstructural parameters. we confirm that all boss compact candidates are ascompact as their high-redshift massive counterparts and less than half the sizeof similarly massive systems at z~0. we use the completeness-corrected numbersof boss compacts to compute lower limits on their number densities in narrowredshift bins spanning the range of our sample. the abundance of extremelydense quiescent galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 is in excellent agreement with the numberdensities of these systems at high redshift. our lower limits support themodels of massive galaxy assembly through a series of minor mergers over theredshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2.

1405.7704	shels: a complete galaxy redshift survey with r$\leq$20.6	the shels (smithsonian hectospec lensing survey) is a complete redshiftsurvey covering two well-separated fields (f1 and f2) of the deep lens surveyto a limiting r = 20.6. here we describe the redshift survey of the f2 field(r.a.$_{2000}$ = 09$^h$19$^m$32.4$^s$ and decl.$_{2000}$ =+30$^{\circ}$00$^{\prime}$00$^{\prime\prime}$). the survey includes 16,294 newredshifts measured with the hectospec on the mmt. the resulting survey of the 4deg$^2$ f2 field is 95\% complete to r = 20.6, currently the densest survey tothis magnitude limit. the median survey redshift is $ z = 0.3$; the surveyprovides a view of structure in the range 0.1 $ \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$. amovie displays the large-scale structure in the survey region. we provide aredshift, spectral index d$_n$4000, and stellar mass for each galaxy in thesurvey. we also provide a metallicity for each galaxy in the range 0.2 $&lt; z &lt;0.38$. to demonstrate potential applications of the survey, we examine thebehavior of the index d$_n$4000 as a function of galaxy luminosity, stellarmass, and redshift. the known evolutionary and stellar mass dependentproperties of the galaxy population are cleanly evident in the data. we alsoshow that the mass-metallicity relation previously determined from these datais robust to the analysis approach.

1407.3525	tracing recent star formation of red early-type galaxies out to $z$  $\sim$ 1	we study the mid-infrared (ir) excess emission of early-type galaxies (etgs)on the red-sequence at $z &lt;$ 1 using a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in thefields of great observatories origins deep survey (goods). in the mass-limitedsample of 1025 galaxies with $m_{star}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{10.5}$ $m_{\odot}$ and$0.4&lt;z&lt;1.05$, we identify 696 $spitzer$ 24 $\mu$m detected (above the5$\sigma$) galaxies and find them to have a wide range of nuv-$r$ and $r$-[12$\mu$m] colors despite their red optical $u-r$ colors. even in the sample ofvery massive etgs on the red sequence with $m_{star}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{11.2}$$m_{\odot}$, more than 18% show excess emission over the photospheric emissionin the mid-ir. the combination with the results of red etgs in the localuniverse suggests that the recent star formation is not rare among quiescent,red etgs at least out to $z \sim 1$ if the mid-ir excess emission results fromintermediate-age stars or/and from low-level ongoing star formation. ourcolor$-$color diagram including near-uv and mid-ir emissions are efficient notonly for identifying etgs with recent star formation, but also fordistinguishing quiescent galaxies from dusty star-forming galaxies.

1407.5072	goods-herschel: star formation, dust attenuation and the fir-radio  correlation on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies up to z~4	we use deep panchromatic datasets in the goods-n field, from galex to thedeepest herschel far-infrared and vla radio continuum imaging, to explore,using mass-complete samples, the evolution of the star formation activity anddust attenuation of star-forming galaxies to z~4. our main results can besummarized as follows: i) the slope of the sfr-m correlation is consistent withbeing constant, and equal to ~0.8 at least up to z~1.5, while its normalizationkeeps increasing with redshift; ii) for the first time here we are able toexplore the fir-radio correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forminggalaxies: the correlation does not evolve up to z~4; iii) we confirm thatgalaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for uv dust attenuation in star-forminggalaxies, with more massive galaxies being more dust attenuated, strikingly wefind that this attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, theamount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 magnitudes over theredshift range [0.5-4] for a fixed stellar mass, as opposed to a tenfoldincrease of star formation rate; iv) the correlation between dust attenuationand the uv spectral slope evolves in redshift, with the median uv spectralslope of star-forming galaxies becoming bluer with redshift. by z~3, typical uvslopes are inconsistent, given the measured dust attenuation, with thepredictions of commonly used empirical laws. finally, building on existingresults, we show that gas reddening is marginally larger (by a factor of around1.3) than stellar reddening at all redshifts probed, and also that the amountof dust attenuation at a fixed ism metallicity increases with redshift. wespeculate that our results support evolving ism conditions of typicalstar-forming galaxies such that at z~1.5 main sequence galaxies have ismconditions getting closer to those of local starbursts.

1410.3883	comparing dense galaxy cluster redshift surveys with weak lensing maps	we use dense redshift surveys of nine galaxy clusters at $z\sim0.2$ tocompare the galaxy distribution in each system with the projected matterdistribution from weak lensing. by combining 2087 new mmt/hectospec redshiftsand the data in the literature, we construct spectroscopic samples within theregion of weak-lensing maps of high (70--89%) and uniform completeness. withthese dense redshift surveys, we construct galaxy number density maps usingseveral galaxy subsamples. the shape of the main cluster concentration in theweak-lensing maps is similar to the global morphology of the number densitymaps based on cluster members alone, mainly dominated by red members. we crosscorrelate the galaxy number density maps with the weak-lensing maps. the crosscorrelation signal when we include foreground and background galaxies at0.5$z_{\rm cl}&lt;z&lt;2z_{\rm cl}$ is $10-23$% larger than for cluster members aloneat the cluster virial radius. the excess can be as high as 30% depending on thecluster. cross correlating the galaxy number density and weak-lensing mapssuggests that superimposed structures close to the cluster in redshift spacecontribute more significantly to the excess cross correlation signal thanunrelated large-scale structure along the line of sight. interestingly, theweak-lensing mass profiles are not well constrained for the clusters with thelargest cross correlation signal excesses ($&gt;$20% for a383, a689 and a750). thefractional excess in the cross correlation signal including foreground andbackground structures could be a useful proxy for assessing the reliability ofweak-lensing cluster mass estimates.

0705.1862	detection of cfirb with akari/fis deep observations	the cosmic far-infrared background (cfirb) contains information about thenumber and distribution of contributing sources and thus gives us an importantkey to understand the evolution of galaxies. using a confusion study to set afundamental limit to the observations, we investigate the potential to explorethe cfirb with akari/fis deep observations. the far-infrared surveyor (fis) isone of the focal-plane instruments on the akari (formerly known as astro-f)satellite, which was launched in early 2006. based upon source distributionmodels assuming three different cosmological evolutionary scenarios (noevolution, weak evolution, and strong evolution), an extensive model fordiffuse emission from infrared cirrus, and instrumental noise estimates, wepresent a comprehensive analysis for the determination of the confusion levelsfor deep far-infrared observations. we use our derived sensitivities to suggestthe best observational strategy for the akari/fis mission to detect the cfirbfluctuations. if the source distribution follows the evolutionary models,observations will be mostly limited by source confusion. we find that we willbe able to detect the cfirb fluctuations and that these will in turn provideinformation to discriminate between the evolutionary scenarios of galaxies inmost low-to-medium cirrus regions.

1412.3996	galaxy evolution in the mid-infrared green valley: a case of the a2199  supercluster	we study the mid-infrared (mir) properties of the galaxies in the a2199supercluster at z = 0.03 to understand the star formation activity of galaxygroups and clusters in the supercluster environment. using the wide-fieldinfrared survey explorer data, we find no dependence of mass-normalizedintegrated sfrs of galaxy groups/clusters on their virial masses. we classifythe supercluster galaxies into three classes in the mir color-luminositydiagram: mir blue cloud (massive, quiescent and mostly early-type), mirstar-forming sequence (mostly late-type), and mir green valley galaxies. thesemir green valley galaxies are distinguishable from the optical green valleygalaxies, in the sense that they belong to the optical red sequence. we findthat the fraction of each mir class does not depend on virial mass of eachgroup/cluster. we compare the cumulative distributions of surface galaxy numberdensity and cluster/group-centric distance for the three mir classes. mir greenvalley galaxies show the distribution between mir blue cloud and mir sfsequence galaxies. however, if we fix galaxy morphology, early- and late-typemir green valley galaxies show different distributions. our results suggest apossible evolutionary scenario of these galaxies: 1) late-type mir sf sequencegalaxies -&gt; 2) late-type mir green valley galaxies -&gt; 3) early-type mir greenvalley galaxies -&gt; 4) early-type mir blue cloud galaxies. in this sequence,star formation of galaxies is quenched before the galaxies enter the mir greenvalley, and then morphological transformation occurs in the mir green valley.

1412.5047	the double galaxy cluster abell 2465 - ii. star formation in the cluster	we investigate the star formation rate and its location in the major mergercluster abell 2465 at $z$ = 0.245. optical properties of the cluster aredescribed in paper i. measurements of the h$\alpha$ and infrared dust emissionof galaxies in the cluster were made with an interference filter centred on theredshifted line at a wavelength of 817 nm and utilized data from the wisesatellite 12 $\mu$m band. imaging in the johnson $u$ and $b$ bands wasobtained, and along with sdss $u$ and $r$ was used to study the blue fraction,which appears enhanced, as a further signatures of star formation in thecluster. star formation rates were calculated using standard calibrations. thetotal star formation rate normalized by the cluster mass, $\sigma sfr/m_{cl}$compared to compilations for other clusters indicate that the components ofabell 2465 lie above the mean $z$ and $m_{cl}$ relations, suggestive thatinteracting galaxy clusters have enhanced star formation. the projected radialdistribution of the star forming galaxies does not follow a nfw profile and isrelatively flat indicating that fewer star forming galaxies are in the clustercentre. the morphologies of the h$\alpha$ sources within $r_{200}$ for thecluster as a whole indicate that many are disturbed or merging, suggesting thata combination of merging or harassment is working.

1507.07932	a rise in the ionizing photons in star-forming galaxies over the past 5  billion years	we investigate the change in ionizing photons in galaxies between 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6using the f2 field of the shels complete galaxy redshift survey. we show, forthe first time, that while the [oiii]/hb and [oiii]/[oii] ratios rise, the[nii]/h-alpha and [sii]/h-alpha ratios fall significantly over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.35redshift range for stellar masses between 9.2&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.6. the[oiii]/h-beta and [oiii]/[oii] ratios continue to rise across the full0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.8&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.0. weconclusively rule out agn contamination, a changing ism pressure, and a changein the hardness of the euv radiation field as the cause of the change in theline ratios between 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.35. we find that the ionization parameter risessignificantly with redshift (by 0.1 to 0.25 dex depending on the stellar massof the sample). we show that the ionization parameter is strongly correlatedwith the fraction of young-to-old stars, as traced by the h-beta equivalentwidth. we discuss the implications of this result on higher redshift studies,and we consider the implications on the use of standard optical metallicitydiagnostics at high redshift.

1507.08289	hecs-sz: the hectospec survey of sunyaev-zeldovich selected clusters	we estimate cluster masses and velocity dispersions for 123 clusters fromoptical spectroscopy to compare the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) mass proxy anddynamical masses. our new survey, hecs-sz (hectospec cluster survey ofsz-selected clusters), includes 7,721 new or remeasured redshifts frommmt/hectospec observations of 24 sz-selected clusters at redshifts$z$=0.05-0.20 and not in previous surveys. we supplement the hectospec datawith spectra from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and cluster data from thecluster infall regions in sdss (cirs) project and the hectospec cluster survey(hecs), our hectospec survey of clusters selected by x-ray flux. we measure thescaling relation between velocity dispersion and sz mass estimates from theintegrated compton parameter for an sz complete sample of 83 clusters. theobserved relation agrees very well with a simple virial scaling from mass(based on sz) to velocity dispersion. the sz mass estimates (calibrated withhydrostatic x-ray mass estimates) are not significantly biased. further, thevelocity dispersion of cluster galaxies is consistent with the expectedvelocity dispersion of dark matter particles, indicating that galaxies are gooddynamical tracers (i.e., velocity bias is small). significant mass bias in szmass estimates could relieve tension between cosmological results from plancksz cluster counts and planck cmb data. however, the excellent agreement betweenour measured velocity dispersions and those predicted from a virial scalingrelation suggests that any sz mass bias is too small to reconcile sz and cmbresults. in principle, sz mass bias and velocity bias of galaxies couldconspire to yield good agreement, but the required velocity bias is$\sigma_{galaxy}\approx 0.77\sigma_{dm}$, outside the range of plausible modelsof velocity bias in the literature.

astro-ph;0606608	the nature of blue early-type galaxies in the goods fields	we present a study of the nature of the blue early-type galaxies (begs) inthe goods north and south fields using the goods hst/acs archival data. usingvisual inspection, we have selected 58 begs and 113 normal red early-typegalaxies (regs) in the sample of 1,949 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts.we find that the begs are generally bluer, fainter, and less-massive than theregs, although a few begs are exceptionally bright and massive. the numberfraction of the begs to total early-type galaxies is almost constant($\sim0.3$) at $z \le 1.1$. in addition, we find that the size of the begs ingiven redshift bin decrease as redshift decreases. the begs look similar to theregs in the images and surface brightness profiles. however, at least 27 begsshow traces of tidal disturbances in their fine structures: elongated cores,off-centered cores, asymmetric internal color distributions, tidally distortedouter structures, collisional rings, or very nearby companions. twenty-one begsare detected in the x-ray bands and eleven of them are as luminous as$l_{0.5-10 {\rm kev}} \ge 10^{43.5} {\rm erg~s}^{-1}$, indicating the existenceof agns in their centers. these results show that at least a half of the begsmay be descendants of mergers/interacting-galaxies and that at least a quarterof the begs may be agn-host galaxies. the begs may evolve into regs, and thesize evolution of the begs is consistent with the galactic \emph{downsizing}scenario.

0812.2088	interactions of galaxies in the galaxy cluster environment	we study the dependence of galaxy properties on the clustercentric radius andthe environment attributed to the nearest neighbor galaxy using the sdssgalaxies associated with the abell galaxy clusters. we find that there exists acharacteristic scale where the properties of galaxies suddenly start to dependon the clustercentric radius at fixed neighbor environment. the characteristicscale is $1\sim 3$ times the cluster virial radius depending on galaxyluminosity. existence of the characteristic scale means that the local galaxynumber density is not directly responsible for the morphology-density relationin clusters because the local density varies smoothly with the clustercentricradius and has no discontinuity in general. what is really working in clustersis the morphology-clustercentric radius-neighbor environment relation, wherethe neighbor environment means both neighbor morphology and the local massdensity attributed to the neighbor. the morphology-density relation appearsworking only because of the statistical correlation between the nearestneighbor distance and the local galaxy number density. we find strong evidencethat the hydrodynamic interactions with nearby early-type galaxies is the maindrive to quenching star formation activity of late-type galaxies in clusters.the hot cluster gas seems to play at most a minor role down to one tenth of thecluster virial radius. we also find that the viable mechanisms which canaccount for the clustercentric radius dependence of the structural and internalkinematics parameters are harassment and interaction of galaxies with thecluster potential. the morphology transformation of the late-type galaxies inclusters seems to have taken place through both galaxy-galaxy hydrodynamicinteractions and galaxy-cluster/galaxy-galaxy gravitational interactions.
