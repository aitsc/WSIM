0901.1328	spitzer view of young massive stars in the lmc hii complex n44	the hii complex n44 in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) provides an excellentsite to perform a detailed study of star formation in a mild starburst, as ithosts three regions of star formation at different evolutionary stages and itis not as complicated and confusing as the 30 doradus giant hii region. we haveobtained spitzer space telescope observations and complementary ground-based 4mubvijk observations of n44 to identify candidate massive young stellar objects(ysos). we further classify the ysos into types i, ii, and iii, according totheir spectral energy distributions (seds). in our sample of 60 yso candidates,~65% of them are resolved into multiple components or extended sources inhigh-resolution ground-based images. we have modeled the seds of 36 ysos thatappear single or dominant within a group. we find good fits for types i andi/ii ysos,but types ii and ii/iii ysos show deviations between their observedseds and models that do not include pah emission. we have also found that sometype iii ysos have central holes in their disk components. yso counterparts arefound in four ultracompact hii regions and their stellar masses determined fromsed model fits agree well with those estimated from the ionization requirementsof the hii regions. the distribution of ysos is compared with those of theunderlying stellar population and interstellar gas conditions to illustrate acorrelation between the current formation of o-type stars and previousformation of massive stars. evidence of triggered star formation is alsopresented.

0903.1661	the mass-loss return from evolved stars to the lmc: empirical relations  for excess emission at 8 and 24 \mu m	we present empirical relations describing excess emission from evolved starsin the large magellanic cloud (lmc) using data from the sage (surveying theagents of a galaxy's evolution) survey which includes the irac 3.6, 4.5, 5.8and 8.0 \mu m and mips 24, 70 and 160 \mu m bands. we combine the sage datawith the two micron all sky survey (2mass; j, h and ks) and the opticalmagellanic cloud photometric survey (mcps; u, b, v and i) point source catalogsto create complete spectral energy distributions (seds) of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) star candidates in the lmc. agb star outflows are among the mainproducers of dust in a galaxy, and this mass loss results in an excess in thefluxes observed in the 8 and 24 \mic m bands. we identify oxygen-rich,carbon-rich and extreme agb star populations in our sample based on their 2massand irac colors. we calculate excesses fluxes in the mid-ir bands by comparisonof the seds with model photospheres. we find about 16,000 o-rich, 6300 c-richand 1000 extreme sources with reliable 8 \mu m excesses, and about 4500 o-rich,5300 c-rich and 960 extreme sources with reliable 24 \mic m excesses. theexcesses are in the range 0.1 mjy--5 jy. the 8 and 24 \mic m excesses for allthree types of agb candidates show a general increasing trend with luminosity.the dust color temperature derived from the ratio of the 8 and 24 \mic mexcesses decreases with an increase in excess, while the 24 \mic m opticaldepth increases with excess. the extreme agb candidates are the majorcontributors to the mass loss, and we estimate the total agb mass-loss returnto the lmc to be (5.9--13)\times 10^{-3} msun yr^{-1}.

0706.3501	the incidence of highly-obscured star-forming regions in sings galaxies	using the new capabilities of the spitzer space telescope and extensivemultiwavelength data from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings),it is now possible to study the infrared properties of star formation in nearbygalaxies down to scales equivalent to large hii regions. we are therefore ableto determine what fraction of large, infrared-selected star-forming regions innormal galaxies are highly obscured and address how much of the star formationwe miss by relying solely on the optical portion of the spectrum. employing anew empirical method for deriving attenuations of infrared-selectedstar-forming regions we investigate the statistics of obscured star formationon 500pc scales in a sample of 38 nearby galaxies. we find that the medianattenuation is 1.4 magnitudes in h-alpha and that there is no evidence for asubstantial sub-population of uniformly highly-obscured star-forming regions.the regions in the highly-obscured tail of the attenuation distribution(a_h-alpha &gt; 3) make up only ~4% of the sample of nearly 1800 regions, thoughvery embedded infrared sources on the much smaller scales and lowerluminosities of compact and ultracompact hii regions are almost certainlypresent in greater numbers. the highly-obscured cases in our sample aregenerally the bright, central regions of galaxies with high overall attenuationbut are not otherwise remarkable. we also find that a majority of the galaxiesshow decreasing radial trends in h-alpha attenuation. the small fraction ofhighly-obscured regions seen in this sample of normal, star-forming galaxiessuggests that on 500pc scales the timescale for significant dispersal or breakup of nearby, optically-thick dust clouds is short relative to the lifetime ofa typical star-forming region.

0909.5154	dust production and mass loss in the galactic globular cluster ngc 362	we investigate dust production and stellar mass loss in the galactic globularcluster ngc 362. due to its close proximity to the small magellanic cloud(smc), ngc 362 was imaged with the irac and mips cameras onboard the spitzerspace telescope as part of the surveying the agents of galaxy evolution(sage-smc) spitzer legacy program. we detect several cluster members near thetip of the red giant branch that exhibit infrared excesses indicative ofcircumstellar dust and find that dust is not present in measurable quantitiesin stars below the tip of the red giant branch. we modeled the spectral energydistribution (sed) of the stars with the strongest ir excess and find a totalcluster dust mass-loss rate of 3.0(+2.0/-1.2) x 10^-9 solar masses per year,corresponding to a gas mass-loss rate of 8.6(+5.6/-3.4) x 10^-6 solar massesper year, assuming [fe/h] = -1.16. this mass loss is in addition to anydust-less mass loss that is certainly occurring within the cluster. the twomost extreme stars, variables v2 and v16, contribute up to 45% of the totalcluster dust-traced mass loss. the seds of the more moderate stars indicate thepresence of silicate dust, as expected for low-mass, low-metallicity stars.surprisingly, the sed shapes of the stars with the strongest mass-loss ratesappear to require the presence of amorphous carbon dust, possibly incombination with silicate dust, despite their oxygen-rich nature. these resultscorroborate our previous findings in omega centauri.

0708.0922	star formation in ngc 5194 (m51a). ii. the spatially-resolved star  formation law	we have studied the relationship between the star formation rate (sfr)surface density and gas surface density in the spiral galaxy m51a (ngc 5194),using multi-wavelength data obtained as part of the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). we introduce a new sfr index based on a linearcombination of h-alpha emission-line and 24 micron continuum luminosities, thatprovides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and sfr densities over awide range of dust attenuations. the combination of these extinction-correctedsfr densities with aperture synthesis hi and co maps has allowed us to probethe form of the spatially-resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5 to 2kpc. we find that the resolved sfr vs gas surface density relation is wellrepresented by a schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion tothe disk-averaged schmidt law. we observe a comparably strong correlation ofthe sfr surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but nosignificant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. thebest-fitting slope of the schmidt law varies from n = 1.37 to 1.56, withzeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale.we tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling andaveraging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. our data can also befitted by an alternative parametrization of the sfr surface density in terms ofthe ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with aconsiderable dispersion.

1106.0044	a population of accreted smc stars in the lmc	we present an analysis of the stellar kinematics of the large magellaniccloud based on ~5900 new and existing velocities of massive red supergiants,oxygen-rich and carbon-rich agb stars, and other giants. after correcting theline-of-sight velocities for the lmc's space motion and accounting forasymmetric drift in the agb population, we derive a rotation curve that isconsistent with all of the tracers used, as well as that of published hi data.the amplitude of the rotation curve is v_0=87+/-5 km s^-1 beyond a radiusr_0=2.4+/-0.1 kpc, and has a position angle of the kinematic line of nodes oftheta=142 degrees +/-5 degrees. by examining the outliers from our fits, weidentify a population of 376 stars, or &gt;~5% of our sample, that haveline-of-sight velocities that apparently oppose the sense of rotation of thelmc disk. we find that these kinematically distinct stars are eithercounter-rotating in a plane closely aligned with the lmc disk, or rotating inthe same sense as the lmc disk, but in a plane that is inclined by 54 degrees+/- 2 degrees to the lmc. their kinematics clearly link them to two known hiarms, which have previously been interpreted as being pulled out from the lmc.we measure metallicities from the ca triplet lines of ~1000 lmc field stars and30 stars in the kinematically distinct population. for the lmc field, we find amedian [fe/h]=-0.56 +/- 0.02 with dispersion of 0.5 dex, while for thekinematically distinct stars the median [fe/h] is -1.25 +/- 0.13 with adispersion of 0.7 dex. the metallicity differences provide strong evidence thatthe kinematically distinct population originated in the smc. thisinterpretation has the consequence that the hi arms kinematically associatedwith the stars are likely falling into the lmc, instead of being pulled out.

1106.2011	young, uv-bright stars dominate dust heating in star forming galaxies	in star forming galaxies, dust plays a significant role in shaping theultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) spectrum. dust attenuates the radiationfrom stars, and re-radiates the energy through equilibrium and non-equilibriumemission. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah), graphite, and silicatescontribute to different features in the spectral energy distribution; however,they are all highly opaque in the same spectral region - the uv. compared toold stellar populations, young populations release a higher fraction of theirtotal luminosity in the uv, making them a good source of the energetic uvphotons that can power dust emission. however, given their relative abundance,the question of whether young or old stellar populations provide most of thesephotons that power the infrared emission is an interesting question. usingthree samples of galaxies observed with the spitzer space telescope and ourdusty radiative transfer model, we find that young stellar populations (on theorder of 100 million years old) dominate the dust heating in star forminggalaxies, and old stellar populations (13 billion years old) generallycontribute less than 20% of the far-ir luminosity.

1106.4022	the emission by dust and stars of nearby galaxies in the herschel  kingfish survey	using new far-infrared imaging from the herschel space observatory withancillary data from ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths, we estimate thetotal emission from dust and stars of 62 nearby galaxies in the kingfish surveyin a way that is as empirical and model-independent as possible. we collect andexploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions(seds) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated bydust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. by including spiredata, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previousanalyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dusttemperatures and masses.  the dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the seds, has arange of nearly three decades. the inclusion of spire data shows that estimatesbased on data not reaching these far-ir wavelengths are biased low. we findthat the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total irluminosity. we also find that dust/stellar flux ratios are related to gas-phasemetallicity, while the dust/stellar mass ratios are less so. the substantialscatter between dust/stellar flux and dust/stellar mass indicates that theformer is a poor proxy of the latter. comparing the dust/stellar flux ratiosand dust temperatures, we show that early-types tend to have slightly warmertemperatures than spiral galaxies, which may be due to more intenseinterstellar radiation fields, or to different dust grain compositions.finally, we show that early-types and early-type spirals have a strongcorrelation between the dust/stellar flux ratio and specific star formationrate, which suggests that the relatively bright far-ir emission of some ofthese galaxies is due to ongoing star formation and the radiation field fromolder stars.

1109.2626	optimal cosmic-ray detection for nondestructive read ramps	cosmic rays are a known problem in astronomy, causing both loss of data anddata inaccuracy. the problem becomes even more extreme when considering datafrom a high-radiation environment, such as in orbit around earth or outside theearth's magnetic field altogether, unprotected, as will be the case for thejames webb space telescope (jwst). for jwst, all the instruments employnondestructive readout schemes. the most common of these will be "up the ramp"sampling, where the detector is read out regularly during the ramp. we studythree methods to correct for cosmic rays in these ramps: a two-point differencemethod, a deviation from the fit method, and a y-intercept method. we applythese methods to simulated nondestructive read ramps with single-sample groupsand varying combinations of flux, number of samples, number of cosmic rays,cosmic-ray location in the exposure, and cosmic-ray strength. we show that they-intercept method is the optimal detection method in the read-noise-dominatedregime, while both the y-intercept method and the two-point difference methodare best in the photon-noise-dominated regime, with the latter requiring fewercomputations.

1403.0618	spitzer view of massive star formation in the tidally stripped  magellanic bridge	the magellanic bridge is the nearest low-metallicity, tidally strippedenvironment, offering a unique high-resolution view of physical conditions inmerging and forming galaxies. in this paper we present analysis of candidatemassive young stellar objects (ysos), i.e., {\it in situ, current} massive starformation (msf) in the bridge using {\it spitzer} mid-ir and complementaryoptical and near-ir photometry. while we definitely find ysos in the bridge,the most massive are $\sim10 m_\odot$, $\ll45 m_\odot$ found in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc). the intensity of msf in the bridge also appearsdecreasing, as the most massive ysos are less massive than those formed in thepast. to investigate environmental effects on msf, we have compared propertiesof massive ysos in the bridge to those in the lmc. first, ysos in the bridgeare apparently less embedded than in the lmc: 81% of bridge ysos show opticalcounterparts, compared to only 56% of lmc sources with the same range of mass,circumstellar dust mass, and line-of-sight extinction. circumstellar envelopesare evidently more porous or clumpy in the bridge's low-metallicityenvironment. second, we have used whole samples of ysos in the lmc and thebridge to estimate the probability of finding ysos at a given \hi\ columndensity, n(hi). we found that the lmc has $\sim3\times$ higher probability thanthe bridge for n(hi) $&gt;10\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, but the trend reverses atlower n(hi). investigating whether this lower efficiency relative to hi is dueto less efficient molecular cloud formation, or less efficient cloud collapse,or both, will require sensitive molecular gas observations.

1406.1707	techniques and review of absolute flux calibration from the ultraviolet  to the mid-infrared	the measurement of precise absolute fluxes for stellar sources has beenpursued with increased vigor since the discovery of the dark energy and therealization that its detailed understanding requires accurate spectral energydistributions (seds) of redshifted ia supernovae in the rest frame. the fluxdistributions of spectrophotometric standard stars were initially derived fromthe comparison of stars to laboratory sources of known flux but are now mostlybased on calculated model atmospheres. for example, pure hydrogen white dwarf(wd) models provide the basis for the hst calspec archive of flux standards.the basic equations for quantitative spectrophotometry and photometry areexplained in detail. several historical lab based flux calibrations arereviewed; and the seds of stars in the major on-line astronomical databases arecompared to the calspec reference standard spectrophotometry. there is goodevidence that relative fluxes from the visible to the near-ir wavelength of~2.5 micron are currently accurate to 1% for the primary reference standards;and new comparisons with lab flux standards show promise for improving thatprecision.

1406.6066	dust and gas in the magellanic clouds from the heritage herschel key  project. i. dust properties and insights into the origin of the submm excess  emission	the dust properties in the large and small magellanic clouds are studiedusing the heritage herschel key project photometric data in five bands from 100to 500 micron. three simple models of dust emission were fit to theobservations: a single temperature blackbody modified by a power- lawemissivity (smbb), a single temperature blackbody modified by a brokenpower-law emissivity (bembb), and two blackbodies with different temperatures,both modified by the same power-law emissivity (ttmbb). using these models weinvestigate the origin of the submm excess; defined as the submillimeter(submm) emission above that expected from smbb models fit to observations &lt; 200micron. we find that the bembb model produces the lowest fit residuals withpixel-averaged 500 micron submm excesses of 27% and 43% for the lmc and smc,respectively. adopting gas masses from previous works, the gas-to-dust ratioscalculated from our the fitting results shows that the ttmbb fits requiresignificantly more dust than are available even if all the metals present inthe interstellar medium (ism) were condensed into dust. this indicates that thesubmm excess is more likely to be due to emissivity variations than a secondpopulation of colder dust. we derive integrated dust masses of (7.3 +/- 1.7) x10^5 and (8.3 +/- 2.1) times 10^4 m(sun) for the lmc and smc, respectively. wefind significant correlations between the submm excess and other dustproperties; further work is needed to determine the relative contributions offitting noise and ism physics to the correlations.

1411.4053	an infrared census of dust in nearby galaxies with spitzer (dustings),  i. overview	nearby resolved dwarf galaxies provide excellent opportunities for studyingthe dust-producing late stages of stellar evolution over a wide range ofmetallicity (-2.7 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -1.0). here, we describe dustings (dust in nearbygalaxies with spitzer): a 3.6 and 4.5 micron post-cryogen spitzer spacetelescope imaging survey of 50 dwarf galaxies within 1.5 mpc that is designedto identify dust-producing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massivestars. the survey includes 37 dwarf spheroidal, 8 dwarf irregular, and 5transition-type galaxies. this near-complete sample allows for the building ofstatistics on these rare phases of stellar evolution over the full metallicityrange. the photometry is &gt;75% complete at the tip of the red giant branch forall targeted galaxies, with the exception of the crowded inner regions of ic10, ngc 185, and ngc 147. this photometric depth ensures that the majority ofthe dust-producing stars, including the thermally-pulsing agb stars, aredetected in each galaxy. the images map each galaxy to at least twice thehalf-light radius to ensure that the entire evolved star population is includedand to facilitate the statistical subtraction of background and foregroundcontamination, which is severe at these wavelengths. in this overview, wedescribe the survey, the data products, and preliminary results. we showevidence for the presence of dust-producing agb stars in 8 of the targetedgalaxies, with metallicities as low as [fe/h] = -1.9, suggesting that dustproduction occurs even at low metallicity.

0804.3223	the behavior of the aromatic features in m101 hii regions: evidence for  dust processing	the aromatic features in m101 were studied spectroscopically andphotometrically using observations from all three instruments on the spitzerspace telescope. the global sed of m101 shows strong aromatic feature (commonlycalled pah feature) emission. the spatially resolved spectral and photometricmeasurements of the aromatic feature emission show strong variations withsignificantly weaker emission at larger radii. we compare these variations withchanges in the ionization index (as measured by [neiii]/[neii] and [siv/siii],which we probe over the ranges 0.03-20 and 0.044-15 respectively) andmetallicity (expressed as log(o/h)+12, which ranges from 8.1 to 8.8). overthese ranges, the spectroscopic equivalent widths of the aromatic features from7 hii regions and the nucleus were found to correlate better with ionizationindex than with metallicity. this implies that the weakening of the aromaticemission in massive star forming regions is due primarily to processing of thedust grains in these environments, not to differences in how they form(although formation could still be important on a secondary basis). thebehavior of the correlation between the aromatic feature equivalent widths andionization index can be described as a constant equivalent width until athreshold in ionization index is reached ([neiii]/[neii] ~ 1), above which theequivalent widths decrease with a power law dependence. this behavior for m101hii regions is also seen for the sample of starburst galaxies presented in thecompanion study of engelbracht et al. (2008) which expands the range of[neiii]/[neii] ratios to 0.03-25 and log(o/h)+12 values to 7.1-8.8. the form ofthe correlation explains seemingly contradictory results present in theliterature.

0705.2240	spitzer observations of a 24 micron shadow: bok globule cb190	we present spitzer observations of the dark globule cb190 (l771). we observea roughly circular 24 micron shadow with a 70 arcsec radius. the extinctionprofile of this shadow matches the profile derived from 2mass photometry at theouter edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of ~32 visual magnitudes atthe center. the corresponding mass of cb190 is ~10 msun. our 12co and 13co j =2-1 data over a 10 arcmin x 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show atemperature ~10 k. the thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature forthe dust. the molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains.we estimate a distance to cb190 of 400 pc using the spectroscopic parallax of astar associated with the globule. bonnor-ebert fits to the density profile, inconjunction with this distance, yield xi_max = 7.2, indicating that cb190 maybe unstable. the high temperature (56 k) of the best fit bonnor-ebert model isin contradiction with the co and thermal continuum data, leading to theconclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fallcollapse. we also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate tosupport it. however, the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field, if thisfield is at the average level for dark globules. since the magnetic field willeventually leak out through ambipolar diffusion, it is likely that cb190 iscollapsing or in a late pre-collapse stage.

astro-ph;0003285	magellanic-cloud-type interstellar dust along low density sightlines in  the galaxy	we have studied the uv extinction properties along 30 galactic sightlinesusing data from the international ultraviolet explorer (iue) archive that havenever been previously examined. these distant (d &gt; 1 kpc) sightlines wereselected to investigate the distribution and physical conditions of gas locatedin low density regions of the galactic disk and halo. the average densitiesalong these sightlines are extremely low. it is likely that they are dominatedby the warm intercloud medium and have little contribution from the cold cloudmedium. we find that a subsample of these sightlines has extinction curves withweak bumps and very steep far-uv extinction reminiscent of the magellanicclouds. these sightlines all lie in the region bounded by 325 &lt; l &lt; 0 and -5 &gt;b &gt; -11. the gas along these sightlines shows forbidden velocities which mayindicate that the dust has been subject to shocks. this type of low densitysightline may mimic the environments found in the magellanic clouds. largevalues of n(ca ii)/n(na i) indicating low depletion are associated with steepfar-uv extinction. a possible correlation exists between decreasing bumpstrength and increasing far-uv steepness for extinction curves in the galaxyand the magellanic clouds.

astro-ph;0301121	the dust in lyman break galaxies	we present our analysis of uv attenuation by internal dust of a large sample(n=906 galaxies) of lyman break galaxies (lbgs). using spectral energydistributions (seds) from the p\'egase galaxy spectral evolution model we applydust attenuation corrections to the g-r colors using the witt &amp; gordon (2000)models for radiative transfer in dusty galactic environments to arrive at theuv attenuation factors. we show that the dust in the lbgs exhibit smc-likecharacteristics rather than mw-like, and that the dust geometry in thesesystems is most likely to be represented by a clumpy shell configuration. weshow that the attenuation factor exhibits a pronounced dependence on theluminosity of the lbg, $a_{1600}\propto (l/l_\sun)^\alpha$, where$0.5\leq\alpha\leq1.5$. the exponent $\alpha$ depends on the initial parametersof the stellar population chosen to model the galaxies and the dust properties.we find that the luminosity weighted average attenuation factor is likely to bein the range from $5.7-18.5$, which is consistent with the upper limits to thestar formation rate at $2&lt;z&lt;4$ set by the fir background. this implies that thecurrent uv/optical surveys do detect the bulk of the star formation during theepoch $2&lt;z&lt;4$, but require substantial correction for internal dustattenuation.

astro-ph;0501413	ultraviolet dust grain properties in starburst galaxies: evidence from  radiative transfer modeling and local group extinction curves	this paper summarizes the evidence of the ultraviolet properties of dustgrains found in starburst galaxies. observations of starburst galaxies clearlyshow that the 2175 a feature is weak or absent. this can be the result ofradiative transfer effects (mixing the dust and stars) or due to dust grainswhich do not have this feature. spherical dirty radiative transfer models implythat it is not radiative transfer effects, but other radiative transfer modelswith disk/bulge geometries have found cases where it could be radiativetransfer effects. recent work on the extinction curves in the magellanic cloudsand milky way has revealed that the traditional explanation of low metallicityfor the absence of the 2175 a feature in the small magellanic cloud is likelyincorrect. the smc has one sightline with a 2175 a feature and the milky wayhas sightlines without this feature. in addition, where the 2175 a feature isfound to be weak or absent in both magellanic clouds and the milky way, thereis evidence for recent star formation. taking the sum of the radiative transfermodeling of starburst galaxies and the behavior of local group extinctioncurves, it is likely that the dust grains in starburst galaxies intrinsicallylack the 2175 a feature.

astro-ph;0501489	measuring extinction curves of lensing galaxies	we critique the method of constructing extinction curves of lensing galaxiesusing multiply imaged qsos. if one of the two qso images is lightly reddened orif the dust along both sightlines has the same properties then the method workswell and produces an extinction curve for the lensing galaxy. these cases arelikely rare and hard to confirm. however, if the dust along each sightline hasdifferent properties then the resulting curve is no longer a measurement ofextinction. instead, it is a measurement of the difference between twoextinction curves. this "lens difference curve'' does contain information aboutthe dust properties, but extracting a meaningful extinction curve is notpossible without additional, currently unknown information. as a quantitativeexample, we show that the combination of two cardelli, clayton, &amp; mathis (ccm)type extinction curves having different values of r(v) will produce a ccmextinction curve with a value of r(v) which is dependent on the individual r(v)values and the ratio of v band extinctions. the resulting lens difference curveis not an average of the dust along the two sightlines. we find that lensdifference curves with any value of r(v), even negative values, can be producedby a combination of two reddened sightlines with different ccm extinctioncurves with r(v) values consistent with milky way dust (2.1 &lt; r(v) &lt; 5.6). thismay explain extreme values of r(v) inferred by this method in previous studies.but lens difference curves with more normal values of r(v) are just as likelyto be composed of two dust extinction curves with r(v) values different thanthat of the lens difference curve. while it is not possible to determine theindividual extinction curves making up a lens difference curve, there isinformation about a galaxy's dust contained in the lens difference curves.

astro-ph;0503198	an extremely large excess of 18o in the hydrogen-deficient carbon star,  hd 137613	we report the discovery of a uniquely large excess of 18o in thehydrogen-deficient carbon (hdc) star, hd 137613, based on a spectrum of thefirst overtone bands of co at 2.3-2.4 micron in which three strong absorptionbands of 12c18o are clearly present. bands of 12c16o also are present but nobands of 13c16o or 12c17o are seen. we estimate an isotopic ratio 16o/18o ~1.the solar value of this ratio is ~500. neither he-core burning nor he-shellflash burning can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed inhd 137613. however, a remarkable similarity exists between the observedabundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad he-shell ofearly-agb stars, soon after the end of he-core burning. it is not known how theouter envelope down to the he-shell could be lost but some mechanism ofenhanced mass loss must be involved. hd 137613 may be a post-early-agb starwith the outer layers of the former he-burning shell as its photosphere.  the unusual elemental abundances of the hdc stars resemble those of the rcoronae borealis (rcb) stars, but hdc stars do not produce clouds of dust thatproduce declines in brightness. none of the other rcb or hdc stars observedshows significant 18o.

astro-ph;0503497	detection of near-ir co absorption bands in r coronae borealis stars	r coronae borealis (rcb) stars are hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich pulsatingpost-agb stars that experience massive irregular declines in brightness causedby circumstellar dust formation. the mechanism of dust formation around rcbstars is not well understood. it has been proposed that co molecules play animportant role in cooling the circumstellar gas so that dust may form. wereport on a survey for co in a sample of rcb stars. we obtained h- and k-bandspectra including the first and second overtone co bands for eight rcb stars,the rcb-like star, dy per and the final-helium-flash star, fg sge. the firstand second overtone co bands were detected in the cooler (t(eff)&lt;6000 k) rcbstars, z umi, es aql, sv sge and dy per. the bands are not present in thewarmer (t(eff)&gt;6000 k) rcb stars, r crb, ry sgr, su tau, xx cam. in addition,first overtone bands are seen in fg sge, a final-helium-flash star that is inan rcb-like phase at present. effective temperatures of the eight rcb starsrange from 4000 to 7250 k. the observed photospheric co absorption bands werecompared to line-blanketed model spectra of rcb stars. as predicted by themodels, the co bands are strongest in the coolest rcb stars and not present inthe warmest. no correlation was found between the presence or strength of theco bands and dust formation activity in the stars.

astro-ph;0505416	fuse measurements of far ultraviolet extinction. ii. magellanic cloud  sight lines	we present an extinction analysis of 9 paths through the lmc and smc based onfuse observations. to date, just two lmc sight lines have probed dust graincomposition and size distributions in the clouds using spectra includingwavelengths as short as 950 a. we supplement these with results from 4 regionsdistinguished by their ir through uv extinction curves and grouped as lmcavg,lmc2, smc bar and smc wing. despite the distinct characters of milky way andmagellanic cloud extinction, our results are generally analogous to those foundfor galactic curves in that the fuse portions of each extinction curve aredescribed reasonably well by fm curves fitted only to longer wavelength dataand lack any dramatic new extinction features, and any deviations from the ccmformalism continue into fuv wavelengths. an mem analysis of these curvessuggests that lmcavg and smc wing sight lines require more silicon and/orcarbon in dust than current abundance measurements would allow, while therequirements for lmc2 and smc bar sight lines do not fully tax the availablereservoirs. an intermediate product of this analysis is the measurement of newh_2 abundances in the magellanic clouds. collectively considering cloud sightlines that possess significant h_2 column densities, e(b-v)/n(hi) ratios arereduced by significant factors relative to the galactic mean, whereas thecorresponding e(b-v)/n(h_2) values more closely resemble their galacticcounterpart. these trends reflect the fact that among these sight linesf(h_2)-values are lower than those common in the milky way for paths withsimilar degrees of reddening.

astro-ph;0507326	blue luminescence and the presence of small pahs in the ism	blue luminescence (bl) was first discovered in a proto-planetary nebula, thered rectangle (rr) surrounding the post-agb star hd 44179. bl has beenattributed to fluorescence by small, 3-4 ringed neutral polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) molecules, and was thought to be unique to the rr environmentwhere such small molecules are actively being produced and shielded from theharsh interstellar radiation by a dense circumstellar disk. in this paper wepresent the bl spectrum detected in several ordinary reflection nebulaeilluminated by stars having temperatures between 10,000 -- 23,000 k. all thesenebulae are known to also exhibit the infrared emission features calledaromatic emission features (aefs) attributed to large pahs. we present thespatial distribution of the bl in these nebulae. in the case of ced~112, the blis spatially correlated with mid-ir emission structures attributed to aefs.these observations provide evidence for grain processing and possibly forin-situ formation of small grains and large molecules from larger aggregates.most importantly, the detection of bl in these ordinary reflection nebulaesuggests that the bl carrier is an ubiquitous component of the ism and is notrestricted to the particular environment of the rr.

astro-ph;0601314	spitzer/mips infrared imaging of m31: further evidence for a spiral/ring  composite structure	new images of m31 at 24, 70, and 160 micron taken with the multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) reveal the morphology of the dust in this galaxy.this morphology is well represented by a composite of two logarithmic spiralarms and a circular ring (radius ~10 kpc) of star formation offset from thenucleus. the two spiral arms appear to start at the ends of a bar in thenuclear region and extend beyond the star forming ring. as has been found inprevious work, the spiral arms are not continuous but composed of spiralsegments. the star forming ring is very circular except for a region near m32where it splits. the lack of well defined spiral arms and the prominence of thenearly circular ring suggests that m31 has been distorted by interactions withits satellite galaxies. using new dynamical simulations of m31 interacting withm32 and ngc 205 we find that, qualitatively, such interactions can produce anoffset, split ring like that seen in the mips images.

astro-ph;0605605	ultraviolet through far-infrared spatially resolved analysis of the  recent star formation in m81 (ngc3031)	the recent star formation (sf) in the early-type spiral galaxy m81 ischaracterized using imaging observations from the far-ultraviolet (uv) to thefar-infrared (ir). we compare these data with models of the stellar, gas, anddust emission for sub-galactic regions. our results suggest the existence of adiffuse dust emission not directly linked to the recent sf. we find a radialdecrease of the dust temperature and dust mass density, and in the attenuationof the stellar light. the ir emission in m81 can be modeled with threecomponents: 1) cold dust with a temperature &lt;t_c&gt;=18+-2 k, concentrated nearthe hii regions but also presenting a diffuse distribution; 2) warm dust witht_w=53+-7 k, directly linked with the hii regions; and 3) aromatic molecules,with diffuse morphology peaking around the hii regions. we derive severalrelationships to obtain total ir luminosities from ir monochromatic fluxes, andwe compare five different star formation rate (sfr) estimators for hii regionsin m81 and m51: the uv, halpha, and three estimators based on spitzer data. wefind that the halpha luminosity absorbed by dust correlates tightly with the 24microns emission. the correlation with the total ir luminosity is not as good.important variations from galaxy to galaxy are found when estimating the totalsfr with the 24 microns or the total ir emission alone. the most reliableestimations of the total sfrs are obtained by combining the halpha emission (orthe uv) and an ir luminosity (especially the 24 microns emission), which probethe unobscured and obscured sf, respectively. for the entire m81 galaxy, about50% of the total sf is obscured by dust. the percentage of obscured sf rangesfrom 60% in the inner regions of the galaxy to 30% in the outer zones.

astro-ph;0607669	the spectral energy distribution of dust emission in the edge-on spiral  galaxy ngc 4631 as seen with spitzer and jcmt	we explore the nature of variations in dust emission within an individualgalaxy using 3.6 - 160 micron spitzer space telescope observations and 450 and850 micron james clerk maxwell telescope observations of the edge-on sd spiralgalaxy ngc 4631 with the goals of understanding the relation between polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pah) and dust emission, studying the variations in thecolors of the dust emission, and searching for possible excess submillimeteremission compared to what is anticipated based on dust models applied to themid- and far-infrared data. pah emission at 8 micron is found to correlate bestwith hot dust emission at 24 micron on kiloparsec scales, although the relationbreaks down on scales equal to hundreds of parsecs, possibly because ofdifferences in the mean free paths between the photons that excite the pahs andheat the dust and possibly because the pahs are destroyed by the hard radiationfields in the centers of some star formation regions. the ratio of 8 micron pahemission to 160 micron cool dust emission appears to be a function of radius.the 70/160 and 160/450 micron flux density ratios are remarkably constant eventhough the surface brightness varies by a factor of 25 in each wave band, whichsuggests that the emission is from dust heated by a nearly-uniform radiationfield. globally, we find an excess of 850 micron emission relative to whatwould be predicted by dust models. the 850 micron excess is highest in regionswith low 160 micron surface brightness, although the strength and statisticalsignificance of this result depends on the model fit to the data. we rule outvariable emissivity functions or ~4 k dust as the possible origins of this 850micron emission, but we do discuss the other possible mechanisms that couldproduce the emission.

astro-ph;9912034	the flux ratio method for determining the dust attenuation of starburst  galaxies	the presence of dust in starburst galaxies complicates the study of theirstellar populations as the dust's effects are similar to those associated withchanges in the galaxies' stellar age and metallicity. this degeneracy can beovercome for starburst galaxies if uv/optical/near-infrared observations arecombined with far-infrared observations. we present the calibration of the fluxratio method for calculating the dust attenuation at a particular wavelength,att(\lambda), based on the measurement of f(ir)/f(\lambda) flux ratio. ourcalibration is based on spectral energy distributions (seds) from the pegasestellar evolutionary synthesis model and the effects of dust (absorption andscattering) as calculated from our monte carlo radiative transfer model. wetested the attenuations predicted from this method for the balmer emissionlines of a sample starburst galaxies against those calculated using radioobservations and found good agreement. the uv attenuation curves for a handfulof starburst galaxies were calculated using the flux ratio method, and theycompare favorably with past work. the relationship between att(\lambda) andf(ir)/f(\lambda) is almost completely independent of the assumed dustproperties (grain type, distribution, and clumpiness). for the uv, therelationship is also independent of the assumed stellar properties (age,metallicity, etc) accept for the case of very old burst populations. however atlonger wavelengths, the relationship is dependent on the assumed stellarproperties.
