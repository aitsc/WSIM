0908.3813	timing observations of rotating radio transients	we present radio timing measurements of six rotating radio transient (rrat)sources discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey. these provide fournew phase-connected timing solutions and two updated ones, making a total ofseven of the original 11 reported rrats now with high-precision rotational andastrometric parameters. three of these seven rrats have magnetic fields greaterthan 10^13 g, with spin-down properties similar to those of the magnetars andx-ray detected isolated neutron stars. another two of these rrats have longperiods and large characteristic ages, and lie near the `death-line' for radiopulsar emission. the remaining two rrats with timing solutions have propertiestypical of the bulk of the pulsar population. the new solutions offer insightsinto what might be responsible for the unusual emission properties. wedemonstrate that the rrats have significantly longer periods and highermagnetic fields than normal radio pulsars, and find no correlation with otherspin-down parameters. these solutions also provide precise positions, whichwill facilitate follow-up studies at high energies, crucial for relating thesesources with other neutron star populations.

0909.3583	searches for gravitational waves from known pulsars with s5 ligo data	we present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond andyoung pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the ligo detectors. forthis search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for allpulsars using radio and x-ray observations. we demonstrate an updated searchmethod that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to beincluded in the search. we report no signal detection from any of the targetsand therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wavesignal strength. the most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. wepresent updated limits on gravitational radiation from the crab pulsar, wherethe measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. thislimits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of theavailable spin-down power. for the x-ray pulsar j0537-6910 we reach thespin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from itstays phase locked to the x-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsarsj1913+1011 and j1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-downlimit. of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limitsare only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. for theseour best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 forj1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is7.0x10^-8 for j2124-3358.

1001.1483	observations and modelling of relativistic spin precession in psr  j1141-6545	observations of the binary pulsar psr j1141-6545 using the parkes radiotelescope over 9.3 years show clear time-variations in pulse width, shape andpolarization. we interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precessionof the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.over the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more thana factor of three. large variations have also been observed in the 1400-mhzmean flux density. the pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 aprilusing digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variationsin both linear and circular polarization. position angle variations, bothacross the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with majordifferences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. modellingof the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of thepulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 degand that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course ofour observations. at the start of our observations, the line-of-sight impactparameter was about 4 deg in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to 0deg around early 2007, consistent with the observed pulse width variations. wehave therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam, showing thatit is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis. the derivedprecessional parameters imply that the pre-supernova star had a mass of about 2msun and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small. with thereversal in the rate of change of the impact parameter, we predict that overthe next decade we will see a reversed "replay" of the variations observed inthe past decade.

1008.3607	measuring the mass of solar system planets using pulsar timing	high-precision pulsar timing relies on a solar-system ephemeris in order toconvert times of arrival (toas) of pulses measured at an observatory to thesolar system barycenter. any error in the conversion to the barycentric toasleads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically,an incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variationhaving a period and phase associated with the planet's orbital motion about thesun. by using an array of pulsars (psrs j0437-4715, j1744-1134, j1857+0943,j1909-3744), the masses of the planetary systems from mercury to saturn havebeen determined. these masses are consistent with the best-known massesdetermined by spacecraft observations, with the mass of the jovian system,9.547921(2)e-4 msun, being significantly more accurate than the mass determinedfrom the pioneer and voyager spacecraft, and consistent with but less accuratethan the value from the galileo spacecraft. while spacecraft are likely toproduce the most accurate measurements for individual solar system bodies, thepulsar technique is sensitive to planetary system masses and has the potentialto provide the most accurate values of these masses for some planets.

1011.5809	on the nature and evolution of the unique binary pulsar j1903+0327	(abridged) psr j1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e = 0.44)95-day orbit with a (~ 1msun) companion poses a challenge to our understandingof stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. here we describeoptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed toexplain formation of this system. radio timing measurements of threepost-keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of amillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidencelimit) (...). optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart showthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore itsbinary companion (...) the optical detection also provides a measurement of thesystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measuredfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in thegalaxy. we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of thegalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre. thus anexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster orthe galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. we suggestthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbitwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion,forming a millisecond pulsar. the former donor star then disappears, either dueto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion ofthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case ofa very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formedmillisecond pulsar.

1201.2637	the double pulsar eclipses i: phenomenology and multi-frequency analysis	the double pulsar psr j0737-3039a/b displays short, 30 s eclipses that arisearound conjunction when the radio waves emitted by pulsar a are absorbed asthey propagate through the magnetosphere of its companion pulsar b. theseeclipses offer a unique opportunity to probe directly the magnetosphericstructure and the plasma properties of pulsar b. we have performed acomprehensive analysis of the eclipse phenomenology using multi-frequency radioobservations obtained with the green bank telescope. we have characterized theperiodic flux modulations previously discovered at 820 mhz by mclaughlin etal., and investigated the radio frequency dependence of the duration and depthof the eclipses. based on their weak radio frequency evolution, we concludethat the plasma in pulsar b's magnetosphere requires a large multiplicityfactor (~ 10^5). we also found that, as expected, flux modulations are presentat all radio frequencies in which eclipses can be detected. their complexbehavior is consistent with the confinement of the absorbing plasma in thedipolar magnetic field of pulsar b as suggested by lyutikov &amp; thompson and sucha geometric connection explains that the observed periodicity is harmonicallyrelated to pulsar b's spin frequency. we observe that the eclipses require asharp transition region beyond which the plasma density drops off abruptly.such a region defines a plasmasphere which would be well inside themagnetospheric boundary of an undisturbed pulsar. it is also two times smallerthan the expected standoff radius calculated using the balance of the windpressure from pulsar a and the nominally estimated magnetic pressure of pulsarb.

1302.1790	discovery of the optical counterparts to four energetic fermi  millisecond pulsars	in the last few years, over 43 millisecond radio pulsars have been discoveredby targeted searches of unidentified gamma-ray sources found by the fermigamma-ray space telescope. a large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are incompact binaries with low-mass companions. these systems often show eclipses ofthe pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks becausethe pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. in this paper, we report onthe optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsarcompanions. all four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity atthe known orbital periods from radio timing. light curve modelling of ourexploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on thecompanion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about10-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed toincrease the companion's dayside temperature. this value compares well with therange observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights aboutthe energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. inaddition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiatedpulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. our analysis alsosuggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are onlypartially filling their roche lobe. some of these sources are relatively brightand represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. these measurementscould enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars inthese systems.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1310.5857	timing of a young mildly recycled pulsar with a massive white dwarf  companion	we report on timing observations of the recently discovered binary pulsar psrj1952+2630 using the arecibo observatory. the mildly recycled 20.7-ms pulsar isin a 9.4-hr orbit with a massive, m_wd &gt; 0.93 m_sun, white dwarf (wd)companion. we present, for the first time, a phase-coherent timing solution,with precise spin, astrometric, and keplerian orbital parameters. this showsthat the characteristic age of psr j1952+2630 is 77 myr, younger by one orderof magnitude than any other recycled pulsar-massive wd system. we derive anupper limit on the true age of the system of 50 myr. we investigate theformation of psr j1952+2630 using detailed modelling of the mass-transferprocess from a naked helium star on to the neutron star following acommon-envelope phase (case bb roche-lobe overflow). from our modelling of theprogenitor system, we constrain the accretion efficiency of the neutron star,which suggests a value between 100 and 300% of the eddington accretion limit.we present numerical models of the chemical structure of a possibleoxygen-neon-magnesium wd companion. furthermore, we calculate the past and thefuture spin evolution of psr j1952+2630, until the system merges in about 3.4gyr due to gravitational wave emission. although we detect no relativisticeffects in our timing analysis we show that several such effects will becomemeasurable with continued observations over the next 10 years; thus psrj1952+2630 has potential as a testbed for gravitational theories.

1401.0535	a millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system	gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds ofyears and are common in our galaxy. they show complex orbital interactions,which can constrain the compositions, masses, and interior structures of thebodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements areavailable. a triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide suchmeasurements, but the only previously known such system, b1620-26 (with amillisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit ofseveral decades), shows only weak interactions. here we report precision timingand multi-wavelength observations of psr j0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in ahierarchical triple system with two other stars. strong gravitationalinteractions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13)msun, where msun is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertaintyin the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)msun and 0.4101(3) msun), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (bothapproximately 39.2 degrees). the unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circularorbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from thoseof known stellar systems. the gravitational field of the outer white dwarfstrongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and thesystem will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strongequivalence principle of general relativity.

1402.4836	a comprehensive study of relativistic gravity using psr b1534+12	we present updated analyses of pulse profiles and their arrival-times frompsr b1534+12, a 37.9-ms radio pulsar in orbit with another neutron star. ahigh-precision timing model is derived from twenty-two years of timing data,and accounts for all astrophysical processes that systematically affect pulsearrival-times. five "post-keplerian" parameters are measured that representrelativistic corrections to the standard keplerian quantities of the pulsar'sbinary orbit. these relativistic parameters are then used to test generalrelativity by comparing the measurements with their predicted values. weconclude that relativity theory is confirmed to within 0.17% of itspredictions. furthermore, we derive the following astrophysical results fromour timing analysis: a distance of $d_{\rm gr} = 1.051 \pm 0.005$ kpc to thepulsar-binary system, by relating the "excess" orbital decay to galacticparameters; evidence for pulse "jitter" in psr b1534+12 due to short-termmagnetospheric activity; and evolution in pulse-dispersion properties. as asecondary study, we also present several analyses on pulse-structure evolutionand its connection to relativistic precession of the pulsar's spin axis. theprecession-rate measurement yields a value of $\omega_1^{\rm spin}$ =$0.59^{+0.12}_{-0.08}$ $^{\circ}$/year (68% confidence) that is consistent withexpectations, and represents an additional test of relativistic gravity.

1404.1120	interstellar scintillation of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039	we report here a series of observations of the interstellar scintillation(iss) of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039 over the course of 18 months. as inearlier work (coles et al., 2005) the basic phenomenon is the variation in theiss caused by the changing transverse velocities of each pulsar, the ionizedinterstellar medium (iism), and the earth. the transverse velocity of thebinary system can be determined both by vlbi and timing observations. theorbital velocity and inclination is almost completely determined from timingobservations, but the direction of the orbital angular momentum is not known.since the earth's velocity is known, and can be compared with the orbitalvelocity by its effect on the timescale of the iss, we can determine theorientation $\omega$ of the pulsar orbit with respect to equatorial coordinates($\omega = 65\pm2$ deg). we also resolve the ambiguity ($i= 88.7$ or $91.3$deg) in the inclination of the orbit deduced from the measured shapiro delay byour estimate $i=88.1\pm0.5$ deg. this relies on analysis of the iss over bothfrequency and time and provides a model for the location, anisotropy,turbulence level and transverse phase gradient of the iism. we find that theiism can be well-modeled during each observation, typically of a few orbitalperiods, but its turbulence level and mean velocity vary significantly over the18 months.

1404.1267	nanograv limits on gravitational waves from individual supermassive  black hole binaries in circular orbits	the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves (nanograv)project currently observes 43 pulsars using the green bank and arecibo radiotelescopes. in this work we use a subset of 17 pulsars timed for a span ofroughly five years (2005--2010). we analyze these data using standard pulsartiming models, with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure andfrequency-variable pulse shape terms. within the timing data, we perform asearch for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive blackhole binaries in circular orbits using robust frequentist and bayesiantechniques. we find that there is no evidence for the presence of a detectablecontinuous gravitational wave; however, we can use these data to place the mostconstraining upper limits to date on the strength of such gravitational waves.using the full 17 pulsar dataset we place a 95% upper limit on the sky-averagedstrain amplitude of $h_0\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{-14}$ at a frequency of 10 nhz.furthermore, we place 95% \emph{all sky} lower limits on the luminositydistance to such gravitational wave sources finding that the $d_l \gtrsim 425$mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nhz and chirp mass $10^{10}{\rmm}_{\odot}$. we find that for gravitational wave sources near our best timedpulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased bya factor of $\sim$4 over the sky-averaged sensitivity. finally we place limitson the coalescence rate of the most massive supermassive black hole binaries.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

0705.3269	age constraints in the double pulsar system j0737-3039	we investigate the age constraints that can be placed on the double pulsarsystem using models for the spin-down of the first-born 22.7-ms pulsar a andthe 2.77-s pulsar b with characteristic ages of 210 and 50 myr respectively.standard models assuming dipolar spin-down of both pulsars suggest that thetime since the formation of b is ~50 myr, i.e. close to b's characteristic age.however, adopting models which account for the impact of a's relativistic windon b's spin-down we find that the formation of b took place either 80 or 180myr ago, depending the interaction mechanism. formation 80 myr ago, closer tob's characteristic age, would result in the contribution from j0737-3039 to theinferred coalescence rates for double neutron star binaries increasing by 40%.the 180 myr age is closer to a's characteristic age and would be consistentwith the most recent estimates of the coalescence rate. the new age constraintsdo not significantly impact recent estimates of the kick velocity, tilt anglebetween pre and post-supernova orbital planes or pre-supernova mass of b'sprogenitor.

astro-ph;0012414	psr j1740-3052 - a pulsar with a massive companion	we report on the discovery of a binary pulsar, psr j1740-3052, during theparkes multibeam survey. timing observations of the 570-ms pulsar at jodrellbank and parkes show that it is young, with a characteristic age of 350 kyr,and is in a 231-day, highly eccentric orbit with a companion whose mass exceeds11 m_sun. an accurate position for the pulsar was obtained using the australiatelescope compact array. near-infrared 2.2-um observations make with thetelescopes at the siding spring observatory reveal a late-type star coincidentwith the pulsar position. however, we do not believe that this star is thepulsar's companion, because a typical star of this spectral type and requiredmass would extend beyond the pulsar's orbit. furthermore, the measured advanceof periastron of the pulsar suggests a more compact companion, for example, amain-sequence star with radius only a few times that of the sun. such acompanion is also more consistent with the small dispersion measure variationsseen near periastron. although we cannot conclusively rule out a black-holecompanion, we believe the companion is probably an early b star, making thesystem similar to the binary psr j0045-7319.

astro-ph;0408458	studies of the relativistic binary pulsar psr b1534+12. ii. origin and  evolution	we have recently measured the angle between the spin and orbital angularmomenta of psr b1534+12 to be either 25+/-4 deg or 155+/-4 deg. thismisalignment was almost certainly caused by an asymmetry in the supernovaexplosion that formed its companion neutron star. here we combine themisalignment measurement with measurements of the pulsar and companion masses,the orbital elements, proper motion, and interstellar scintillation. we showthat the orbit of the binary in the galaxy is inconsistent with a velocity kicklarge enough to produce a nearly antialigned spin axis, so the truemisalignment must be ~25 deg. similar arguments lead to bounds on the mass ofthe companion star immediately before its supernova: 3+/-1 msun. the result isa coherent scenario for the formation of the observed binary. after the firstsupernova explosion, the neutron star that would eventually become the observedpulsar was in a be/x-ray type binary system with a companion of at least 10--12msun. during hydrogen (or possibly helium) shell burning, mass transferoccurred in a common envelope phase, leaving the neutron star in a roughlyhalf-day orbit with a helium star with mass above ~3.3 msun. a second phase ofmass transfer was then initiated by roche lobe overflow during shell heliumburning, further reducing both the helium star mass and orbital period beforethe second supernova. scenarios that avoid roche lobe overflow by the heliumstar require larger helium star masses and predict space velocitiesinconsistent with our measurements. the companion neutron star experienced avelocity kick of 230+/-60 km/s at birth, leading to a systemic kick to thebinary of 180+/-60 km/s.

astro-ph;0511587	transient radio bursts from rotating neutron stars	the `radio sky' is relatively unexplored for transient signals, although thepotential of radio-transient searches is high, as demonstrated recently by thediscovery of a previously unknown type of source which varies on timescales ofminutes to hours. here we report a new large-scale search for radio sourcesvarying on much shorter timescales. this has revealed 11 objects characterizedby single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30 ms. the averagetime intervals between bursts range from 4 minutes to 3 hours, with radioemission typically detectable for &lt; 1 s per day. from an analysis of the burstarrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4 - 7 s for tenof the 11 sources, suggesting a rotating neutron star origin. despite the smallnumber of sources presently detected, their ephemeral nature implies a totalgalactic population which significantly exceeds that of the regularly pulsingradio pulsars. five of the ten sources have periods greater than 4 s, andperiod derivatives have been measured for three of the sources, with one havinga very high inferred magnetic field of 5e13 g, suggesting that this newpopulation is related to other classes of isolated neutron stars observed atx-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths.

astro-ph;0609417	tests of general relativity from timing the double pulsar	the double pulsar system, psr j0737-3039a/b, is unique in that both neutronstars are detectable as radio pulsars. this, combined with significantly highermean orbital velocities and accelerations when compared to other binarypulsars, suggested that the system would become the best available testbed forgeneral relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-fieldregime. here we report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests ofgeneral relativity. use of the theory-independent mass ratio of the two starsmakes these tests uniquely different from earlier studies. by measuringrelativistic corrections to the keplerian description of the orbital motion, wefind that the ``post-keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted byeinstein's theory of general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, themost precise test yet obtained. we also show that the transverse velocity ofthe system's center of mass is extremely small. combined with the system'slocation near the sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitationaltheories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar-systemtests. it also implies that the second-born pulsar may have formed differentlyto the usually assumed core-collapse of a helium star.
