0901.1328	spitzer view of young massive stars in the lmc hii complex n44	the hii complex n44 in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) provides an excellentsite to perform a detailed study of star formation in a mild starburst, as ithosts three regions of star formation at different evolutionary stages and itis not as complicated and confusing as the 30 doradus giant hii region. we haveobtained spitzer space telescope observations and complementary ground-based 4mubvijk observations of n44 to identify candidate massive young stellar objects(ysos). we further classify the ysos into types i, ii, and iii, according totheir spectral energy distributions (seds). in our sample of 60 yso candidates,~65% of them are resolved into multiple components or extended sources inhigh-resolution ground-based images. we have modeled the seds of 36 ysos thatappear single or dominant within a group. we find good fits for types i andi/ii ysos,but types ii and ii/iii ysos show deviations between their observedseds and models that do not include pah emission. we have also found that sometype iii ysos have central holes in their disk components. yso counterparts arefound in four ultracompact hii regions and their stellar masses determined fromsed model fits agree well with those estimated from the ionization requirementsof the hii regions. the distribution of ysos is compared with those of theunderlying stellar population and interstellar gas conditions to illustrate acorrelation between the current formation of o-type stars and previousformation of massive stars. evidence of triggered star formation is alsopresented.

0903.0374	young stellar clusters and star formation throughout the galaxy	most stars are born in rich young stellar clusters (yscs) embedded in giantmolecular clouds. the most massive stars live out their short lives there,profoundly influencing their natal environments by ionizing hii regions,inflating wind-blown bubbles, and soon exploding as supernovae. thousands oflower-mass pre-main sequence stars accompany the massive stars, and theexpanding hii regions paradoxically trigger new star formation as they destroytheir natal clouds. while this schematic picture is established, ourunderstanding of the complex astrophysical processes involved in clustered starformation have only just begun to be elucidated. the technologies arechallenging, requiring both high spatial resolution and wide fields atwavelengths that penetrate obscuring molecular material and removecontaminating galactic field stars. we outline several important projects forthe coming decade: the imfs and structures of yscs; triggered star formationaround ysc; the fate of ob winds; the stellar populations of infrared darkclouds; the most massive star clusters in the galaxy; tracing star formationthroughout the galactic disk; the galactic center region and yscs in themagellanic clouds. programmatic recommendations include: developing a 30m-classadaptive optics infrared telescope; support for high-resolution and wide fieldx-ray telescopes; large-aperture sub-millimeter and far-infrared telescopes;multi-object infrared spectrographs; and both numerical and analytical theory.

0904.1825	the evolution of massive ysos in the lmc: part i. identification and  spectral classification	we present and categorize spitzer irs spectra of 294 objects in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc) to create the largest and most complete catalog ofmassive young stellar object (yso) spectra in the lmc. target sources wereidentified from infrared photometry and multi-wavelength images indicative ofyoung, massive stars highly enshrouded in their natal gas and dust clouds. oursample primarily consists of 277 objects we identify as having spectralfeatures indicative of embedded ysos. the remaining sources are comprised of 7c-rich evolved sources, 8 sources dominated by broad silicate emission, and 1source with multiple broad emission features. those with yso-like spectra showa range of spectral features including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonemission, deep silicate absorption, fine-structure lines, and ice absorptionfeatures. based upon the relative strengths of these features, we haveclassified the yso candidates into several distinct categories using thewidely-used statistical procedure known as principal component analysis. wepropose that these categories represent a spectrum of evolutionary stagesduring massive yso formation. we conclude that massive pre-main sequence starsspend a majority of their massive, embedded lives emitting in the uv. half ofthe sources in our study have features typical of compact hii regions,suggesting that massive ysos can create a detectable compact hii regionhalf-way through the formation time present in our sample. this study alsoprovides a check on commonly used source-selection procedures including the useof photometry to identify ysos. we determine a high success rate (&gt;95%) ofidentifying objects with yso-like spectra can be achieved through careful useof infrared cmds, seds, and image inspections.

0908.0347	high and intermediate-mass young stellar objects in the large magellanic  cloud	(abridged) photometry of archival spitzer observations of the largemagellanic cloud (lmc) are used to search for young stellar objects (ysos).simple mid-infrared selection criteria were used to exclude most normal andevolved stars and background galaxies. we identify a sample of 2,910 sources inthe lmc that could potentially be ysos. we then simultaneously consideredimages and photometry from the optical through mid-ir wavelengths to assess thesource morphology, spectral energy distribution (sed), and the surroundinginterstellar environment to determine the most likely nature of each source.  from this examination of the initial sample, we suggest 1,172 sources aremost likely ysos and 1,075 probable background galaxies, consistent withexpectations based on swire survey data. spitzer irs observations of 269 of thebrightest ysos from our sample have confirmed that ~&gt;95% are indeed ysos.  a comprehensive search for ysos in the lmc has also been carried out by thesage team. there are three major differences between these two searches. (1) inthe common region of color-magnitude space, ~850 of our 1,172 probable ysos aremissed in the sage yso catalog because their conservative point sourceidentification criteria have excluded ysos superposed on complex diffuseemission. (2) about 20-30% of the ysos identified by the sage team are sourceswe classify as background galaxies. (3) the sage yso catalog identifies yso inparts of color-magnitude space that we excluded and thus contains more evolvedor fainter ysos missed by our analysis. finally, the mid-ir luminosityfunctions of our most likely yso candidates in the lmc can be well described byn(l) propto l^-1, which is consistent with the salpeter initial mass functionif a mass-luminosity relation of l propto m^2.4 is adopted.

0910.5901	an hst view of the interstellar environments of young stellar objects in  the large magellanic cloud	we have used archival hst h$\alpha$ images to study the immediateenvironments of massive and intermediate-mass young stellar object (yso)candidates in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the sample of yso candidates,taken from gruendl &amp; chu (2009), was selected based on spitzer irac and mipsobservations of the entire lmc and complementary ground-based optical andnear-infrared observations. we found hst h$\alpha$ images for 99 yso candidatesin the lmc, of which 82 appear to be genuine ysos. more than 95% of the ysosare found to be associated with molecular clouds. ysos are seen in threedifferent kinds of environments in the h$\alpha$ images: in dark clouds, insideor on the tip of bright-rimmed dust pillars, and in small h ii regions.comparisons of spectral energy distributions for ysos in these three differentkinds of environments suggest that ysos in dark clouds are the youngest, ysoswith small h ii regions are the most evolved, and ysos in bright-rimmed dustpillars span a range of intermediate evolutionary stages. this roughevolutionary sequence is substantiated by the presence of silicate absorptionfeatures in the spitzer irs spectra of some ysos in dark clouds and inbright-rimmed dust pillars, but not those of ysos in small h ii regions. wepresent a discussion on triggered star formation for ysos in bright-rimmed dustpillars or in dark clouds adjacent to h ii regions. as many as 50% of the ysosare resolved into multiple sources in high-resolution hst images. thisillustrates the importance of using high-resolution images to probe the truenature and physical properties of ysos in the lmc.

1007.5326	spitzer view of young massive stars in the lmc hii complexes. ii. n159	the hii complex n159 in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is used to studymassive star formation in different environments, as it contains three giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) that have similar sizes and masses but exhibitdifferent intensities of star formation. we identify candidate massive youngstellar objects (ysos) using infrared photometry, and model their seds toconstrain mass and evolutionary state. good fits are obtained for less evolvedtype i, i/ii, and ii sources. our analysis suggests that there are massiveembedded ysos in n159b, a maser source, and several ultracompact hii regions.massive o-type ysos are found in gmcs n159-e and n159-w, which are associatedwith ionized gas, i.e., where massive stars formed a few myr ago. the thirdgmc, n159-s, has neither o-type ysos nor evidence of previous massive starformation. this correlation between current and antecedent formation of massivestars suggests that energy feedback is relevant. we present evidence thatn159-w is forming ysos spontaneously, while collapse in n159-e may betriggered. finally, we compare star formation rates determined from yso countswith those from integrated h-alpha and 24 micron luminosities and expected fromgas surface densities. detailed dissection of extragalactic gmcs like the onepresented here is key to revealing the physics underlying commonly used starformation scaling laws.

0708.3243	large-scale gravitational instability and star formation in the large  magellanic cloud	large-scale star formation in disk galaxies is hypothesized to be driven byglobal gravitational instability. the observed gas surface density is commonlyused to compute the strength of gravitational instability, but according tothis criterion star formation often appears to occur in gravitationally stableregions. one possible reason is that the stellar contribution to theinstability has been neglected. we have examined the gravitational instabilityof the large magellanic cloud (lmc) considering the gas alone, and consideringthe combination of collisional gas and collisionless stars. we compare thegravitationally unstable regions with the on-going star formation revealed byspitzer observations of young stellar objects. although only 62% of the massiveyoung stellar object candidates are in regions where the gas alone is unstable,some 85% lie in regions unstable due to the combination of gas and stars. thecombined stability analysis better describes where star formation occurs. inagreement with other observations and numerical models, a small fraction of thestar formation occurs in regions with gravitational stability parameter q &gt; 1.we further measure the dependence of the star formation timescale on thestrength of gravitational instability, and quantitatively compare it to theexponential dependence expected from numerical simulations.

1101.5137	spitzer 24 um survey for dust disks around hot white dwarfs	two types of dust disks around white dwarfs (wds) have been reported: smalldust disks around cool metal-rich wds consisting of tidally disruptedasteroids, and a large dust disk around the hot central wd of the helixplanetary nebula (pn) possibly produced by collisions among kuiper belt-likeobjects. to search for more dust disks of the latter type, we have conducted aspitzer mips 24 um survey of 71 hot wds or pre-wds, among which 35 are centralstars of pne (cspns). nine of these evolved stars are detected and their 24 umflux densities are at least two orders of magnitude higher than their expectedphotospheric emission. considering the bias against detection of distantobjects, the 24 um detection rate for the sample is &gt;~15%. it is striking thatseven, or ~20%, of the wd and pre-wds in known pne exhibit 24 um excesses,while two, or 5-6%, of the wds not in pne show 24 um excesses and they have thelowest 24 um flux densities. we have obtained follow-up spitzer irs spectra forfive objects. four show clear continuum emission at 24 um, and one isoverwhelmed by a bright neighboring star but still show a hint of continuumemission. in the cases of wd 0950+139 and cspn k1-22, a late-type companion ispresent, making it difficult to determine whether the excess 24 um emission isassociated with the wd or its red companion. high-resolution images in themid-ir are needed to establish unambiguously the stars responsible for the 24um excesses.

1102.4779	an introduction to the chandra carina complex project	the great nebula in carina provides an exceptional view into the violentmassive star formation and feedback that typifies giant hii regions andstarburst galaxies. we have mapped the carina star-forming complex in x-rays,using archival chandra data and a mosaic of 20 new 60ks pointings using thechandra x-ray observatory's advanced ccd imaging spectrometer, as a testbed forunderstanding recent and ongoing star formation and to probe carina's regionsof bright diffuse x-ray emission. this study has yielded a catalog ofproperties of &gt;14,000 x-ray point sources; &gt;9800 of them have multiwavelengthcounterparts. using chandra's unsurpassed x-ray spatial resolution, we haveseparated these point sources from the extensive, spatially-complex diffuseemission that pervades the region; x-ray properties of this diffuse emissionsuggest that it traces feedback from carina's massive stars. in thisintroductory paper, we motivate the survey design, describe the chandraobservations, and present some simple results, providing a foundation for the15 papers that follow in this special issue and that present detailed catalogs,methods, and science results.

1103.1606	the integrated diffuse x-ray emission of the carina nebula compared to  other massive star-forming regions	the chandra carina complex project (cccp) has shown that the carina nebuladisplays bright, spatially-complex soft diffuse x-ray emission. here we `sumup' the cccp diffuse emission work by comparing the global morphology andspectrum of carina's diffuse x-ray emission to other famous sites of massivestar formation with pronounced diffuse x-ray emission: m17, ngc 3576, ngc 3603,and 30 doradus. all spectral models require at least two diffuse thermal plasmacomponents to achieve adequate spectral fits, a softer component with kt =0.2--0.6 kev and a harder component with kt = 0.5--0.9 kev. in several casesthese hot plasmas appear to be in a state of non-equilibrium ionization thatmay indicate recent and current strong shocks. a cavity north of the embeddedgiant hii region ngc 3576 is the only region studied here that exhibits harddiffuse x-ray emission; this emission appears to be nonthermal and is likelydue to a recent cavity supernova, as evidenced by a previously-known pulsar andnewly-discovered pulsar wind nebula also seen in this cavity. all of thesetargets exhibit x-ray emission lines that are not well-modeled byvariable-abundance thermal plasmas and that might be attributed to chargeexchange at the shock between the hot, tenuous, x-ray-emitting plasma and cold,dense molecular material; this is likely evidence for dust destruction at themany hot/cold interfaces that characterize massive star-forming regions.

1107.4207	physical structure of the planetary nebula ngc 3242 from the hot bubble  to the nebular envelope	one key feature of the interacting stellar winds model of the formation ofplanetary nebulae (pne) is the presence of shock-heated stellar wind confinedin the central cavities of pne. this so-called hot bubble should be detectablein x-rays. here we present xmm-newton observations of ngc 3242, amultiple-shell pn whose shell morphology is consistent with the interactingstellar winds model. diffuse x-ray emission is detected within its inner shellwith a plasma temperature ~2.35\times10^6 k and an intrinsic x-ray luminosity~2\times10^30 ergs s^(-1) at the adopted distance of 0.55 kpc. the observedx-ray temperature and luminosity are in agreement with "ad-hoc" predictions ofmodels including heat conduction. however, the chemical abundances of thex-ray-emitting plasma seem to imply little evaporation of cold material intothe hot bubble, whereas the thermal pressure of the hot gas is unlikely todrive the nebular expansion as it is lower than that of the inner shell rim.these inconsistencies are compounded by the apparent large filling factor ofthe hot gas within the central cavity of ngc 3242. subject headings: planetarynebulae: individual (ngc 3242)

0710.1352	ngc 346 in the small magellanic cloud. iv. triggered star formation in  the hii region n66	stellar feedback, expanding hii regions, wind-blown bubbles, and supernovaeare thought to be important triggering mechanisms of star formation. stellarassociations, being hosts of significant numbers of early-type stars, are theloci where these mechanisms act. in this part of our photometric study of thestar-forming region ngc346/n66 in the small magellanic cloud, we presentevidence based on previous and recent detailed studies, that it hosts at leasttwo different events of triggered star formation and we reveal the complexityof its recent star formation history. in our earlier studies of this region(papers i, iii) we find that besides the central part of n66, where the brightob stellar content of the association ngc346 is concentrated, an arc-likenebular feature, north of the association, hosts recent star formation. thisfeature is characterized by a high concentration of emission-line stars andyoung stellar objects, as well as embedded sources seen as ir-emission peaksthat coincide with young compact clusters of low-mass pre-main sequence stars.all these objects indicate that the northern arc of n66 encompasses the mostcurrent star formation event in the region. we present evidence that this starformation is the product of a different mechanism than that in the general areaof the association, and that it is triggered by a wind-driven expanding hiiregion (or bubble) blown by a massive supernova progenitor, and possibly otherbright stars, a few myr ago. we propose a scenario according to which thismechanism triggered star formation away from the bar of n66, while in the barof n66 star formation is introduced by the photo-ionizing ob stars of theassociation itself.

1304.5126	linear relation for wind-blown bubble sizes of main-sequence ob stars in  a molecular environment and implication for supernova progenitors	we find a linear relationship between the size of a massive star'smain-sequence bubble in a molecular environment and the star's initial mass:r_b \approx 1.22m/msun - 9.16 pc, assuming a constant interclump pressure.since stars in the mass range of 8 to 25-30 msun will end their evolution inthe red supergiant phase without launching a wolf-rayet wind, the main-sequencewind-blown bubbles are mainly responsible for the extent of molecular gascavities, while the effect of the photoionization is comparatively small. thislinear relation can thus be used to infer the masses of the massive starprogenitors of supernova remnants (snrs) that are discovered to evolve inmolecular cavities, while few other means are available for inferringproperties of snr progenitors. we have used this method to estimate the initialmasses of the progenitors of eight snrs: kes 69, kes 75, kes 78, 3c 396, 3c397, hc 40, vela, and rx j1713-3946.

1401.0728	spitzer space telescope spectra of post-agb stars in the large  magellanic cloud ---polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at low metallicities	this paper reports variations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)features that were found in spitzer space telescope spectra of carbon-richpost-asymptotic giant branch (post-agb) stars in the large magellanic cloud(lmc). the paper consists of two parts. the first part describes our spitzerspectral observing programme of 24 stars including post-agb candidates. thelatter half of this paper presents the analysis of pah features in 20carbon-rich post-agb stars in the lmc, assembled from the spitzer archive aswell as from our own programme. we found that five post-agb stars showed abroad feature with a peak at 7.7 micron, that had not been classified before.further, the 10--13 micron pah spectra were classified into four classes, oneof which has three broad peaks at 11.3, 12.3 and 13.3 micron rather than twodistinct sharp peaks at 11.3 and 12.7 micron, as commonly found in hii regions.our studies suggest that pahs are gradually processed while the central starsevolve from post-agb phase to pne, changing their composition before pahs areincorporated into the interstellar medium. although some metallicity dependenceof pah spectra exists, the evolutionary state of an object is more significantthan its metallicity in determining the spectral characteristics of pahs forlmc and galactic post-agb stars.

1402.2631	spitzer observations of dust emission from hii regions in the large  magellanic cloud	massive stars can alter physical conditions and properties of their ambientinterstellar dust grains via radiative heating and shocks. the hii regions inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) offer ideal sites to study the stellar energyfeedback effects on dust because stars can be resolved, and the galaxy's nearlyface-on orientation allows us to unambiguously associate hii regions with theirionizing massive stars. the spitzer space telescope survey of the lmc providesmulti-wavelength (3.6 to 160 $\mu$m) photometric data of all hii regions. toinvestigate the evolution of dust properties around massive stars, we haveanalyzed spatially-resolved ir dust emission from two classical hii regions(n63 and n180) and two simple superbubbles (n70 and n144) in the lmc. weproduce photometric spectral energy distributions (seds) of numerous smallsubregions for each region based on its stellar distributions and nebularmorphologies. we use dustem dust emission model fits to characterize the dustproperties. color-color diagrams and model fits are compared with the radiationfield (estimated from photometric and spectroscopic surveys). strong radialvariations of seds can be seen throughout the regions, reflecting the availableradiative heating. emission from very small grains drastically increases atlocations where the radiation field is the highest, while polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs) appear to be destroyed. pah emission is the strongest inthe presence of molecular clouds, provided that the radiation field is low.

1403.5795	dusty disks around central stars of planetary nebulae	only a few percent of cool, old white dwarfs (wds) have infrared excessesinterpreted as originating in small hot disks due to the infall and destructionof single asteroids that come within the star's roche limit. infrared excessesat 24 micron were also found to derive from the immediate vicinity of younger,hot wds, most of which are still central stars of planetary nebulae (cspn). theincidence of cspn with this excess is 18%. the helix cspn, with a 24 micronexcess, has been suggested to have a disk formed from collisions of kuiperbelt-like objects (kbos). in this paper, we have analyzed an additional sampleof cspn to look for similar infrared excesses. these cspn are all members ofthe pg 1159 class and were chosen because their immediate progenitors are knownto often have dusty environments consistent with large dusty disks. we findthat, overall, pg 1159 stars do not present such disks more often than othercspn, although the statistics (5 objects) are poor. we then consider the entiresample of cspn with infrared excesses, and compare it to the infraredproperties of old wds, as well as cooler post-agb stars. we conclude with thesuggestion that the infrared properties of cspn more plausibly derive fromagb-formed disks rather than disks formed via the collision of kbos, althoughthe latter scenario cannot be ruled out. we finally remark that there seems tobe an association between cspn with a 24 micron excess and confirmed orpossible binarity of the central star.

1406.3979	a deep chandra observation of the giant hii region n11 i. x-ray sources  in the field	a very sensitive x-ray investigation of the giant hii region n11 in the lmcwas performed using the chandra x-ray observatory. the 300ks observationreveals x-ray sources with luminosities down to 10^32 erg/s, increasing by morethan a factor of 5 the number of known point sources in the field. amongstthese detections are 13 massive stars (3 compact groups of massive stars, 9o-stars and one early b-star) with log(lx/lbol)~-6.5 to -7, which may suggestthat they are highly magnetic or colliding wind systems. on the other hand, thestacked signal for regions corresponding to undetected o-stars yieldslog(lx/lbol)~-7.3, i.e., an emission level comparable to similar galactic starsdespite the lower metallicity. other point sources coincide with 11 foregroundstars, 6 late-b/a stars in n11, and many background objects. this observationalso uncovers the extent and detailed spatial properties of the soft, diffuseemission regions but the presence of some hotter plasma in their spectrasuggests contamination by the unresolved stellar population.

1407.6718	physical nature of the [s ii]-bright shell nebulae n70 and n185	n70 and n185 are two large ($\ge$100 pc in diameter) shell nebulae in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc). their high [\ion{s}{2}]/h$\alpha$ ratios rivalthose of supernova remnants (snrs), but they are not confirmed as snrs. tostudy their physical nature, we have obtained \emph{xmm-newton} x-rayobservations and high-dispersion long-slit echelle spectroscopic observationsof these two nebulae. the x-ray spectra of both nebulae can be well interpretedwith an optically thin thermal ($\sim$0.2 kev) plasma with the average lmcabundance in a collisional ionization equilibrium. n70 encompasses the obassociation lh114. although n70 has a modest expansion velocity and essentiallythermal radio emission, its diffuse x-ray luminosity ($\sim6.1\times10^{35}$erg s$^{-1}$) is higher than that from a quiescent superbubble with n70'sdensity, size, and expansion velocity; thus, n70 is most likely a superbubblethat is recently energized by an interior snr. n185 does not contain any knownob association, and its x-ray luminosity is an order of magnitude lower thanexpected if it is a quiescent superbubble. n185 has nonthermal radio emissionand has high-velocity material expanding at nearly 200 km s$^{-1}$, similar tomany known snrs in the lmc. its x-ray luminosity ($\sim1.9\times10^{35}$ ergs$^{-1}$) is also consistent with that of an evolved snr. we therefore suggestthat n185 is energized by a recent supernova.

1407.7658	molecular hydrogen emission in the interstellar medium of the large  magellanic cloud	we present the detection and analysis of molecular hydrogen emission towardten interstellar regions in the large magellanic cloud. we examinedlow-resolution infrared spectral maps of twelve regions obtained with thespitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the pure rotational 0--0 transitions ofh$_2$ at 28.2 and 17.1${\,\rm \mu m}$ are detected in the irs spectra for tenregions. the higher level transitions are mostly upper limit measurementsexcept for three regions, where a 3$\sigma$ detection threshold is achieved forlines at 12.2 and 8.6${\,\rm \mu m}$. the excitation diagrams of the detectedh$_2$ transitions are used to determine the warm h$_2$ gas column density andtemperature. the single-temperature fits through the lower transition linesgive temperatures in the range $86-137\,{\rm k}$. the bulk of the excited h$_2$gas is found at these temperatures and contributes $\sim$5-17% to the total gasmass. we find a tight correlation of the h$_2$ surface brightness withpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and total infrared emission, which is a clearindication of photo-electric heating in photodissociation regions. we find theexcitation of h$_2$ by this process is equally efficient in both atomic andmolecular dominated regions. we also present the correlation of the warm h$_2$physical conditions with dust properties. the warm h$_2$ mass fraction andexcitation temperature show positive correlations with the average starlightintensity, again supporting h$_2$ excitation in photodissociation regions.

1410.3872	expansion of hydrogen-poor knots in the born-again planetary nebulae a30  and a78	we analyze the expansion of hydrogen-poor knots and filaments in theborn-again planetary nebulae a30 and a78 based on hubble space telescope (hst)images obtained almost 20 yr apart. the proper motion of these featuresgenerally increases with distance to the central star, but the fractionalexpansion decreases, i.e., the expansion is not homologous. as a result, thereis not a unique expansion age, which is estimated to be 610-950 yr for a30 and600-1140 yr for a78. the knots and filaments have experienced complex dynamicalprocesses: the current fast stellar wind is mass loaded by the material ablatedfrom the inner knots; the ablated material is then swept up until it shocks theinner edges of the outer, hydrogen-rich nebula. the angular expansion of theouter filaments shows a clear dependence on position angle, indicating that theinteraction of the stellar wind with the innermost knots channels the windalong preferred directions. the apparent angular expansion of the innermostknots seems to be dominated by the rocket effect of evaporating gas and by thepropagation of the ionization front inside them. radiation-hydrodynamicalsimulations show that a single ejection of material followed by a rapid onsetof the stellar wind and ionizing flux can reproduce the variety of clumps andfilaments at different distances from the central star found in a30 and a78.

astro-ph;0001404	rosat observations of x-ray emission from planetary nebulae	we have searched the entire rosat archive for useful observations to studyx-ray emission from galactic planetary nebulae (pns). the search yields asample of 63 pns, which we call the rosat pn sample. about 20-25% of thissample show x-ray emission; these include 13 definite detections and threepossible detections (at a 2-sigma level). all x-ray sources in these pns areconcentrated near the central stars. only a 30, bd+30 3639, and ngc 6543 aremarginally resolved by the rosat instruments. three types of x-ray spectra areseen in pns. type 1 consists of only soft x-ray emission (&lt;0.5 kev), peaks at0.1-0.2 kev, and can be fitted by blackbody models at temperatures 1-2 10^5 k.type 2 consists of harder x-ray emission, peaks at &gt;0.5 kev, and can be fittedby thin plasma emission models at temperatures of a few 10^6 k. type 3 is acomposite of a bright type 1 component and a fainter type 2 component.unresolved soft sources with type 1 spectra or the soft component of type 3spectra are most likely photospheric emission from the hot central stars.absorption cross sections are large for these soft-energy photons; therefore,only large, tenuous, evolved pns with hot central stars and small absorptioncolumn densities have been detected. the origin of hard x-ray emission from pnsis uncertain. pns with type 2 spectra are small, dense, young nebulae withrelatively cool (&lt;&lt;10^5 k) central stars, while pns with type 3 x-ray spectraare large, tenuous, evolved nebulae with hot central stars. the hard x-rayluminosities are also different between these two types of pns, indicatingperhaps different origins of their hard x-ray emission. future chandra and xmmobservations with high spatial and spectral resolution will help to understandthe origin of hard x-ray emission from pns.

astro-ph;0009238	a critical examination of hypernova remnant candidates in m101. i. mf83	the snr candidate mf83 in m101 is coincident with a very luminous x-raysource. based on the high x-ray luminosity, it has been suggested that mf83 isa "hypernova remnant" requiring an explosion energy about two orders ofmagnitude higher than normal supernovae. we have analyzed high-qualityground-based and hst observations of mf83, and find that mf83 is a starformation region, consisting of a large ionized gas shell and four hii regionsalong its periphery. continuum images show ob associations in these hii regionsand within the large shell. the shell has an expansion velocity of $\sim$50km/s and a diameter of $\sim$270 pc. the optical properties of this shell inmf83 are similar to those of x-ray-bright superbubbles in the large magellaniccloud. if the x-ray emission is indeed diffuse, the implied thermal energy inmf83 is high, a few $\times10^{52}$ ergs. this amount of thermal energyrequires a large number of concentrated supernova explosions or one powerfulexplosion. future x-ray observations with a high angular resolution are neededto resolve the diffuse emission and point sources in mf83, in order todetermine more accurately the thermal energy in the shell interior and itsrequired explosion energy.

astro-ph;0104269	variable h-alpha line emission from the central star of the helix nebula	the central star of the helix nebula is a hot white dwarf with unexpectedhard x-ray emission. with an effective temperature of ~100,000 k, the star is apowerful source of h-ionizing radiation; the atmosphere of a stellar orplanetary companion, if present, will be ionized and emit recombination lines.to probe the origin of hard x-ray emission from the helix nebula's centralstar, we have obtained multi-epoch high-dispersion spectra of the star, andfound temporal variation in the h-alpha line profile over a time span of oneweek. the observed width and strength of the variable h-alpha emissioncomponent are consistent with the hypothesized dme companion proposed toexplain the hard x-ray emission. a dme companion, however, cannot explain thepossible detection of variable heii and [nii] emission. follow-up spectroscopicmonitoring of the helix nebula central star is needed to better establish theidentification of the spectral lines and their temporal behavior in order todetermine the origin of the optical variability and hard x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0402473	the nature of sn 1961v	the nature of sn 1961v has been uncertain. its peculiar optical light curveand slow expansion velocity are similar to those of super-outbursts of luminousblue variables (lbvs), but its nonthermal radio spectral index and decliningradio luminosity are consistent with decades-old supernovae (sne). we haveobtained hubble space telescope stis images and spectra of the stars in thevicinity of sn 1961v, and find object 7 identified by filippenko et al. to bethe closest to the optical and radio positions of sn 1961v. object 7 is theonly point source detected in our stis spectra and only its h-alpha emission isdetected; it cannot be the sn or its remnant because of the absence offorbidden lines. while the h-alpha line profile of object 7 is remarkablysimilar to that of eta car, the blue color (similar to an a2ib supergiant) andlack of appreciable variability are unlike known post-outburst lbvs. we havealso obtained very long baseline array (vlba) observations of sn 1961v at 18cm. the non-detection of sn 1961v places a lower limit on the size of theradio-emitting region, 7.6 mas or 0.34 pc, which implies an average expansionvelocity in excess of 4,400 km/s, much higher than the optical expansionvelocity measured in 1961. we conclude the following: (1) a sn occurred in thevicinity of sn 1961v a few decades ago. (2) if the sn 1961v light maximumoriginates from a giant eruption of a massive star, object 7 is the mostprobable candidate for the survivor, but its blue color and lack of significantvariability are different from a post-outburst eta car. (3) the radio sn andobject 7 could be physically associated with each other through a binarysystem. (4) object 7 needs to be monitored to determine its nature andrelationship to sn 1961v.

astro-ph;0407030	mz 3, a multipolar nebula in the making	the nebula mz 3 has arguably the most complex bipolar morphology, consistingof three nested pairs of bipolar lobes and an equatorial ellipse. its threepairs of bipolar lobes share the same axis of symmetry, but have very differentopening angles and morphologies: the innermost pair of bipolar lobes showsclosed lobe morphology, while the other two have open lobes with cylindricaland conical shapes, respectively. we have carried out high-dispersionspectroscopic observations of mz 3, and detected distinct kinematic propertiesamong the different morphological components. the expansion characteristics ofthe two outer pairs of lobes suggest that they originated in an explosiveevent, whereas the innermost pair of lobes resulted from the interaction of afast wind with the surrounding material. the equatorial ellipse is associatedwith a fast equatorial outflow which is unique among bipolar nebulae. thedynamical ages of the different structures in mz 3 suggest episodic bipolarejections, and the distinct morphologies and kinematics among these differentstructures reveal fundamental changes in the system between these episodicejections.

astro-ph;0511540	an optical study of stellar and interstellar environments of seven  luminous and ultraluminous x-ray sources	we have studied the stellar and interstellar environments of two luminousx-ray sources and five ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) in order to gaininsight into their nature. archival hubble space telescope images were used toidentify the optical counterparts of the ulxs ho ix x-1 and ngc 1313 x-2, andto make photometric measurements of the local stellar populations of these andthe luminous source ic 10 x-1. we obtained high-dispersion spectroscopicobservations of the nebulae around these seven sources to search for he iilambda-4686 emission and to estimate the expansion velocities and kineticenergies of these nebulae. our observations did not detect nebular he iiemission from any source, with the exception of lmc x-1; this is either becausewe missed the he iii regions or because the nebulae are too diffuse to producehe ii surface brightnesses that lie within our detection limit. we compare theobserved ionization and kinematics of the supershells around the ulxs ho ix x-1and ngc 1313 x-2 with the energy feedback expected from the underlying stellarpopulation to assess whether additional energy contributions from the ulxs areneeded. in both cases, we find insufficient uv fluxes or mechanical energiesfrom the stellar population; thus these ulxs may be partially responsible forthe ionization and energetics of their supershells. all seven sources westudied are in young stellar environments and six of them have opticalcounterparts with masses &gt;~7 m_sun; thus, these sources are most likelyhigh-mass x-ray binaries.

astro-ph;0603119	resolving the nature of the rosette hh1 jet facing strong uv dissipation	the rosette hh1 jet is a collimated flow immersed in the strong uv radiationfield of the rosette nebula. we investigate the physical properties of therosette hh1 jet using high-quality narrow-band images and high-dispersionspectroscopy. the new images show that the axis of the jet is not preciselyaligned with the star near the base of the jet. the high resolution of thespectra allows us to accurately determine the contributions from the \ion{h}{2}region, jet, and star. the appoaching and receding sides of the expanding shellof the rosette nebula are at heliocentric velocities of 13 and 40 km s$^{-1}$,while the jet reaches a maximum velocity offset at a heliocentric velocity of$-$30 km s$^{-1}$. the [\ion{s}{2}] doublet ratios indicate an electron densityof $\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$ in the jet and $\le$100 cm$^{-3}$ in the \ion{h}{2}region. with a careful subtraction of the nebular and jet components, we findthe stellar h$\alpha$ line is dominated by a broad absorption profile withlittle or no emission component, indicating a lack of substantial circumstellarmaterial. the circumstellar material has most likely been photo-evaporated bythe strong uv radiation field in the rosette nebula. the evaporation time scaleis 10$^3$ -- 10$^4$ yr. the rosette hh1 jet source provides evidence for anaccelerated evolution from a ctts to a wtts due to the strong uv radiationfield; therefore, both cttss and wttss can be spatially mixed in regions withmassive star formation.

astro-ph;0603123	chandra acis spectroscopy of n157b -- a young composite supernova  remnant in a superbubble	we present chandra acis observations of n157b, a young supernova remnantlocated in the 30 doradus star-formation region of the lmc. this remnantcontains the most energetic pulsar known (psr j0537-6910), which is surroundedby a bright nonthermal nebula that likely represents a toroidal pulsar windterminal shock observed edge-on. we confirm the non-thermal nature of thecomet-shaped x-ray emission feature and show that the spectral steepening ofthis feature away from the pulsar is quantitatively consistent with synchrotroncooling of shocked pulsar wind particles flowing downstream at a bulk velocityclose to the speed of light. around the cometary nebula we unambiguously detecta thermal component, which accounts for about 1/3 of the total 0.5 - 10 kevflux from the remnant. this thermal component is distributed among variousclumps of metal-enriched plasma embedded in the low surface brightnessx-ray-emitting diffuse gas. the relative metal enrichment pattern suggests thatthe mass of the supernova progenitor is &gt;~ 20m_sun. a comparison of the x-raydata with hst optical images suggests that the explosion site is close to adense cloud, against which a reflection shock is launched. the interactionbetween this reflection shock and the nebula has likely produced both itscometary shape and the surrounding thermal emission enhancement. snr n157b isapparently expanding into the hot low-density interior of a surroundingsuperbubble formed by the young ob association lh99, as revealed by spitzermid-infrared images. this scenario naturally explains the exceptionally largesizes of both the thermal and nonthermal components as well as the lack of anouter shell of the snr. these results provide a rare glimpse into the snrstructure and evolution in a region of recent star-formation.
