0901.2075	sn 2005cs in m51 ii. complete evolution in the optical and the  near-infrared	we present the results of the one year long observational campaign of thetype ii-plateau sn 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). this extensive dataset makes sn 2005cs the best observedlow-luminosity, 56ni-poor type ii-plateau event so far and one of the bestcore-collapse supernovae ever. the optical and near-infrared spectra shownarrow p-cygni lines characteristic of this sn family, which are indicative ofa very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. theoptical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactivetail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. numerous unfilteredobservations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity tomonitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. in addition tooptical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (togetherwith already published uv observations) allow us to construct for the firsttime a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. finally,comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, weinfer for sn 2005cs a 56ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejectedmass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.

0903.1286	sn 2008s: an electron capture sn from a super-agb progenitor?	we present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of thefaint transient sn 2008s discovered in ngc 6946. sn 2008s exhibited slowphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first ninemonths, implying a high density cs medium. the light curve is similar in shapeto that of sn 1998s and sn 1979c, although significantly fainter at maximumlight. our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tailphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}co. we propose that this isevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 m_sun).the large mir flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a lightecho from pre-exisiting dust. the late nir flux excess is plausibly due to acombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust inthe cs environment. we reassess the progenitor object detected previously inspitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the mirspectral energy distribution. this supports the idea of a dusty, opticallythick shell around sn 2008s with an inner radius of nearly 90au and outerradius of 450au, and an inferred heating source of 3000 k and luminosity of l ~10^{4.6} l_sun. the combination of our monitoring data and the evidence fromthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electroncapture supernova explosion in a super-agb progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8m_sun) embedded within a thick cs gaseous envelope. we suggest that all of mainproperties of the electron capture sn phenomenon are observed in sn 2008s andfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.

0904.0119	evidence of asymmetry in sn 2007rt, a type iin supernova	an optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the slowly-evolving typeiin sn2007rt is presented, covering a duration of 481 days after discovery. itsearliest spectrum, taken approximately 100 days after the explosion epoch,indicates the presence of a dense circumstellar medium, with which thesupernova ejecta is interacting. this is supported by the slowly-evolving lightcurve. a notable feature in the spectrum of sn 2007rt is the presence of abroad he i 5875 line, not usually detected in type iin supernovae. this mayimply that the progenitor star has a high he/h ratio, having shed a significantportion of its hydrogen shell via mass-loss. an intermediate resolutionspectrum reveals a narrow halpha p-cygni profile, the absorption component ofwhich has a width of 128 km/s. this slow velocity suggests that the progenitorof sn 2007rt recently underwent mass-loss with wind speeds comparable to thelower limits of those detected in luminous blue variables. asymmetries in theline profiles of h and he at early phases bears some resemblance todouble-peaked features observed in a number of ib/c spectra. these asymmetriesmay be indicative of an asymmetric or bipolar outflow or alternatively dustformation in the fast expanding ejecta. in addition, the late time spectrum, atover 240 days post-explosion, shows clear evidence for the presence of newlyformed dust.

0904.0637	sn 1999ga: a low-luminosity linear type ii supernova?	type ii-linear supernovae are thought to arise from progenitors that havelost most of their h envelope by the time of the explosion, and they are poorlyunderstood because they are only occasionally discovered. it is possible thatthey are intrinsically rare, but selection effects due to their rapidluminosity evolution may also play an important role in limiting the number ofdetections. in this context, the discovery of a subluminous type ii-linearevent is even more interesting. we investigate the physical properties andcharacterise the explosion site of the type ii sn 1999ga, which exploded in thenearby spiral galaxy ngc 2442. spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn1999ga allow us to constrain the energetics of the explosion and to estimatethe mass of the ejected material, shedding light on the nature of theprogenitor star in the final stages of its life. the study of the environmentin the vicinity of the explosion site provides information on a possiblerelation between these unusual supernovae and the properties of the galaxieshosting them. despite the lack of early-time observations, we providereasonable evidence that sn 1999ga was probably a type ii-linear supernova thatejected a few solar masses of material, with a very small amount of radioactiveelements of the order of 0.01 solar masses.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0912.3302	on the nature of the progenitors of three type ii-p supernovae: 2004et,  2006my and 2006ov	the pre-explosion observations of the type ii-p supernovae 2006my, 2006ov and2004et, are re-analysed. in the cases of supernovae 2006my and 2006ov we arguethat the published candidate progenitors are not coincident with theirrespective supernova sites in pre-explosion hubble space telescopeobservations. we therefore derive upper luminosity and mass limits for theunseen progenitors of both these supernovae, assuming they are red supergiants:2006my (log l/lsun = 4.51; mass &lt; 13msun) and 2006ov (log l/lsun = 4.29; mass &lt;10msun). in the case of supernova 2004et we show that the yellow-supergiantprogenitor candidate, originally identified in canada france hawaii telescopeimages, is still visible ~3 years post-explosion in observations from thewilliam herschel telescope. high-resolution hubble space telescope and gemini(north) adaptive optics late-time imagery reveal that this source is not asingle yellow supergiant star, but rather is resolved into at least threedistinct sources. we report the discovery of the unresolved progenitor as anexcess of flux in pre-explosion isaac newton telescope i'-band imaging.accounting for the late-time contribution of the supernova using publishedoptical spectra, we calculate the progenitor photometry as the differencebetween the pre- and post-explosion, ground-based observations. we find theprogenitor was most likely a late k to late m-type supergiant of 8 +5/-1 msun.in all cases we conclude that future, high-resolution observations of thesupernova sites will be required to confirm these results.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1111.2509	the type ii supernovae 2006v and 2006au: two sn 1987a-like events	supernova 1987a revealed that a blue supergiant (bsg) star can end its lifeas a core-collapse supernova (sn). sn 1987a and other similar objects exhibitproperties that distinguish them from ordinary type ii plateau (iip) sne, whoseprogenitors are believed to be red supergiants (rsgs). similarities among1987a-like events include a long rise to maximum, early luminosity fainter thanthat of normal type iip sne, and radioactivity acting as the primary sourcepowering the light curves. we present and analyze two sne monitored by thecarnegie supernova project that are reminiscent of sn 1987a. optical andnear-infrared (nir) light curves, and optical spectroscopy of sne 2006v and2006au are presented. these observations are compared to those of sn 1987a, andare used to estimate properties of their progenitors. both objects exhibit aslow rise to maximum and light curve evolution similar to that of sn 1987a. atthe earliest epochs, sn 2006au also displays an initial dip which we interpretas the signature of the adiabatic cooling phase that ensues shock break- out.sne 2006v and 2006au are both found to be bluer, hotter and brighter than sn1987a. spectra of sne 2006v and 2006au are similar to those of sn 1987a andother normal type ii objects, although both consistently exhibit expansionvelocities higher than sn 1987a. semi-analytic models are fit to the uvoirlight curve of each object from which physical properties of the progenitorsare estimated. this yields ejecta mass estimates of about 20 solar masses,explosion energies of 2 - 3 x 10^51 erg, and progenitor radii of 75 - 100 solarradii for both sne. the progenitors of sne 2006v and 2006au were most likelybsgs with a larger explosion energy as compared to that of sn 1987a.

1112.0247	multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopy of sn2011fe - linking the  progenitor to its environment	this study attempts to establish a link between the reasonably well knownnature of the progenitor of sn2011fe and its surrounding environment. this isdone with the aim of enabling the identification of similar systems in the vastmajority of the cases, when distance and epoch of discovery do not allow adirect approach. to study the circumstellar environment of sn2011fe we haveobtained high-resolution spectroscopy of sn2011fe on 12 epochs, from 8 to 86days after the estimated date of explosion, targeting in particular at the timeevolution of caii and nai. three main absorption systems are identified fromcaii and nai, one associated to the milky way, one probably arising within ahigh-velocity cloud, and one most likely associated to the halo of m101. thegalactic and host galaxy reddening, deduced from the integrated equivalentwidths (ew) of the nai lines are e(b-v)=0.011+/-0.002 and e(b-v)=0.014+/-0.002mag, respectively. the host galaxy absorption is dominated by a componentdetected at the same velocity measured from the 21-cm hi line at the projectedsn position (~180 km/s). during the ~3 months covered by our observations, itsew changed by 15.6+/-6.5 ma. this small variation is shown to be compatiblewith the geometric effects produced by therapid sn photosphere expansioncoupled to the patchy fractal structure of the ism. the observed behavior isfully consistent with ism properties similar to those derived for our owngalaxy, with evidences for structures on scales &lt;100 au. sn2011fe appears to besurrounded by a "clean" environment. the lack of blue-shifted, time-variantabsorption features is fully consistent with the progenitor being a binarysystem with a main-sequence, or even another degenerate star.

0710.3763	supernova rates from the southern intermediate redshift eso supernova  search (stress)	to measure the supernova (sn) rates at intermediate redshift we performed thesouthern intermediate redshift eso supernova search (stress). unlike most ofthe current high redshift sn searches, this survey was specifically designed toestimate the rate for both type ia and core collapse (cc) sne. we counted thesne discovered in a selected galaxy sample measuring sn rate per unit blue bandluminosity. our analysis is based on a sample of ~43000 galaxies and on 25spectroscopically confirmed sne plus 64 selected sn candidates. our approach isaimed at obtaining a direct comparison of the high redshift and local rates andat investigating the dependence of the rates on specific galaxy properties,most notably their colour. the type ia sn rate, at mean redshift z=0.3, amountsto 0.22^{+0.10+0.16}_{-0.08 -0.14} h_{70}^2 snu, while the cc sn rate, atz=0.21, is 0.82^{+0.31 +0.30}_{-0.24 -0.26} h_{70}^2 snu. the quoted errors arethe statistical and systematic uncertainties. with respect to local value, thecc sn rate at z=0.2 is higher by a factor of ~2 already at redshift, whereasthe type ia sn rate remains almost constant. this implies that a significantfraction of sn ia progenitors has a lifetime longer than 2-3 gyr. we alsomeasured the sn rates in the red and blue galaxies and found that the sn iarate seems to be constant in galaxies of different colour, whereas the cc snrate seems to peak in blue galaxies, as in the local universe. sn rates perunit volume were found to be consistent with other measurements showing asteeper evolution with redshift for cc sne with respect to sne ia. finally wehave exploited the link between star formation (sf) and sn rates to predict theevolutionary behaviour of the sn rates and compare it with the path indicatedby observations.

1204.1523	red and dead: the progenitor of sn 2012aw in m95	core-collapse supernovae (sne) are the spectacular finale to massive stellarevolution. in this letter, we identify a progenitor for the nearbycore-collapse sn 2012aw in both ground based near-infrared, and space basedoptical pre-explosion imaging. the sn itself appears to be a normal type iiplateau event, reaching a bolometric luminosity of 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ andphotospheric velocities of $\sim$11,000 \kms\ from the position of the h$\beta$p-cygni minimum in the early sn spectra. we use an adaptive optics image toshow that the sn is coincident to within 27 mas with a faint, red source inpre-explosion hst+wfpc2, vlt+isaac and ntt+sofi images. the source hasmagnitudes $f555w$=26.70$\pm$0.06, $f814w$=23.39$\pm$0.02, $j$=21.1$\pm$0.2,$k$=19.1$\pm$0.4, which when compared to a grid of stellar models best matchesa red supergiant. interestingly, the spectral energy distribution of theprogenitor also implies an extinction of $a_v&gt;$1.2 mag, whereas the sn itselfdoes not appear to be significantly extinguished. we interpret this as evidencefor the destruction of dust in the sn explosion. the progenitor candidate has aluminosity between 5.0 and 5.6 log l/\lsun, corresponding to a zams massbetween 14 and 26 \msun\ (depending on $a_v$), which would make this one of themost massive progenitors found for a core-collapse sn to date.

1205.0353	sn 2009kn - the twin of the type iin supernova 1994w	we present an optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic studyof supernova (sn) 2009kn spanning ~1.5 yr from the discovery. the opticalspectra are dominated by the narrow (full width at half-maximum ~1000 km s^-1)balmer lines distinctive of a type iin sn with p cygni profiles. contrarily,the photometric evolution resembles more that of a type iip sn with a largedrop in luminosity at the end of the plateau phase. these characteristics aresimilar to those of sn 1994w, whose nature has been explained with twodifferent models with different approaches. the well-sampled data set on sn2009kn offers the possibility to test these models, in the case of both sn2009kn and sn 1994w. we associate the narrow p cygni lines with a swept-upshell composed of circumstellar matter and sn ejecta. the broad emission linewings, seen during the plateau phase, arise from internal electron scatteringin this shell. the slope of the light curve after the post-plateau drop isfairly consistent with that expected from the radioactive decay of 56co,suggesting an sn origin for sn 2009kn. assuming radioactivity to be the mainsource powering the light curve of sn 2009kn in the tail phase, we infer anupper limit for 56ni mass of 0.023 m_sun. this is significantly higher thanthat estimated for sn 1994w, which also showed a much steeper decline of thelight curve after the post-plateau drop. we also observe late-timenear-infrared emission which most likely arises from newly formed dust producedby sn 2009kn. as with sn 1994w, no broad lines are observed in the spectra ofsn 2009kn, not even in the late-time tail phase.

1210.1411	moderately luminous type ii supernovae	core-collapse supernovae (cc-sne) descend from progenitors more massive thanabout 8 msun. because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta mayeventually interact with the circumstellar medium (csm) via highly energeticprocesses detectable in the radio, x-ray, ultraviolet (uv) and, sometimes, inthe optical domains. in this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and nearinfrared observations of five type ii sne, namely sne 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,1995ad, and 1996w. together with few other sne they form a group of moderatelyluminous type ii events. we collected photometry and spectroscopy with severaltelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectralevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. both photometry andspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. the lightcurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95&lt;m_{b}&lt;-18.70$). the ejectedmasses of ^56\ni for three sne span a wide range of values($2.8\times10^{-2}$msun$&lt;$m(\ni)$&lt;1.4\times10^{-1}$msun), while for a fourth(sn2010aj) we could determine a stringent upper limit ($7\times10^{-3}$msun).clues of interaction, such as the presence of high velocity (hv) features ofthe balmer lines, are visible in the photospheric spectra of sne 2009dd and1996w. for sn2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type iin to astandard type ii sn. modelling the observations of sne 2009dd, 2010aj and1995ad with radiation hydrodynamics codes, we infer kinetic plus thermalenergies of about 0.2-0.5 foe, initial radii of 2-5$\times10^{13}$ cm andejected masses of $\sim$5.0-9.5 msun. these values suggest moderate-mass,super-asymptotic giant branch (sagb) or red super-giants (rsg) stars as snprecursors, in analogy with other luminous type iip sne 2007od and 2009bw.

1210.3568	interacting supernovae and supernova impostors. sn 2009ip, is this the  end?	we report the results of a 3 year-long dedicated monitoring campaign of arestless luminous blue variable (lbv) in ngc 7259. the object, named sn 2009ip,was observed photometrically and spectroscopically in the optical andnear-infrared domains. we monitored a number of erupting episodes in the pastfew years, and increased the density of our observations during eruptiveepisodes. in this paper we present the full historical data set from 2009-2012with multi-wavelength dense coverage of the two high luminosity events betweenaugust - september 2012. we construct bolometric light curves and measure thetotal luminosities of these eruptive or explosive events. we label them the2012a event (lasting ~50 days) with a peak of 3x10^41 erg/s, and the 2012bevent (14 day rise time, still ongoing) with a peak of 8x10^42 erg/s. thelatter event reached an absolute r-band magnitude of about -18, comparable tothat of a core-collapse supernova (sn). our historical monitoring has detectedhigh-velocity spectral features (~13000 km/s) in september 2011, one yearbefore the current sn-like event. this implies that the detection of such highvelocity outflows cannot, conclusively, point to a core-collapse sn origin. wesuggest that the initial peak in the 2012a event was unlikely to be due to afaint core-collapse sn. we propose that the high intrinsic luminosity of thelatest peak, the variability history of sn 2009ip, and the detection of broadspectral lines indicative of high-velocity ejecta are consistent with apulsational pair-instability event, and that the star may have survived thelast outburst. the question of the survival of the lbv progenitor star and itsfuture fate remain open issues, only to be answered with future monitoring ofthis historically unique explosion.

1302.2983	pessto monitoring of sn 2012hn: further heterogeneity among faint type i  supernovae	we present optical and infrared monitoring data of sn 2012hn collected by thepublic eso spectroscopic survey for transient objects (pessto). we show that sn2012hn has a faint peak magnitude (mr ~ -15.7) and shows no hydrogen and noclear evidence for helium in its spectral evolution. instead, we detectprominent ca ii lines at all epochs, which relates this transient to previouslydescribed 'ca-rich' or 'gap' transients. however, the photospheric spectra(from -3 to +32 d with respect to peak) of sn 2012hn show a series ofabsorption lines which are unique, and a red continuum that is likely intrinsicrather than due to extinction. lines of ti ii and cr ii are visible. this maybe a temperature effect, which could also explain the red photospheric colour.a nebular spectrum at +150d shows prominent caii, oi, ci and possibly mgi lineswhich appear similar in strength to those displayed by core-collapse sne. toadd to the puzzle, sn 2012hn is located at a projected distance of 6 kpc froman e/s0 host and is not close to any obvious starforming region. overall sn2012hn resembles a group of faint h-poor sne that have been discovered recentlyand for which a convincing and consistent physical explanation is stillmissing. they all appear to explode preferentially in remote locations offsetfrom a massive host galaxy with deep limits on any dwarf host galaxies,favouring old progenitor systems. sn 2012hn adds heterogeneity to this sampleof objects. we discuss potential explosion channels including he-shelldetonations and double detonations of white dwarfs as well as peculiarcore-collapse sne.

1305.1851	optical and near-infrared observations of sn 2011dh - the first 100 days	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry and spectroscopy of thetype iib supernova (sn) 2011dh for the first 100 days. we complement ourextensive dataset with swift ultra-violet (uv) and spitzer mid-infrared (mir)data to build a uv to mir bolometric lightcurve using both photometric andspectroscopic data. hydrodynamical modelling of the sn based on this bolometriclightcurve have been presented in bersten (2012). we find that the absorptionminimum for the hydrogen lines is never seen below ~11000 km/s but approachesthis value as the lines get weaker. this suggests that the interface betweenthe helium core and hydrogen rich envelope is located near this velocity inagreement with the bersten et al. (2012) he4r270 ejecta model. spectralmodelling of the hydrogen lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusionand we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar masses to be consistent with theobserved spectral evolution. we estimate that the photosphere reaches thehelium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15days, close to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40days. this suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasingoptical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.we also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the sn sitewhich shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellowsupergiant coincident with sn 2011dh. the b, v and r band decline rates of0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with theremaining flux being emitted by the sn. hence we find that the star was indeedthe progenitor of sn 2011dh as previously suggested by maund et al.

1308.5545	a metallicity study of 1987a-like supernova host galaxies	the origin of the blue supergiant (bsg) progenitor of supernova (sn) 1987ahas long been debated, along with the role that its sub-solar metallicityplayed. we now have a sample of 1987a-like sne that arise from the corecollapse (cc) of bsgs. the metallicity of the explosion sites of the known bsgsne is investigated, as well as their association to star-forming regions. bothindirect and direct metallicity measurements of 13 bsg sn host galaxies arepresented, and compared to those of other cc sn types. indirect measurementsare based on the known luminosity-metallicity relation and on publishedmetallicity gradients of spiral galaxies. to provide direct estimates based onstrong line diagnostics, we obtained spectra of each bsg sn host both at the snexplosion site and at the positions of other hii regions. continuum-subtractedha images allowed us to quantify the association between bsg sne andstar-forming regions. bsg sne explode either in low-luminosity galaxies or atlarge distances from the nuclei of luminous hosts. therefore, their indirectlymeasured metallicities are typically lower than those of sne iip and ibc. thisis confirmed by the direct estimates, which show slightly sub-solar values(12+log(o/h)=8.3-8.4 dex), similar to that of the large magellanic cloud (lmc),where sn 1987a exploded. however, two sne (1998a and 2004em) were found at nearsolar metallicity. sne iib have a metallicity distribution similar to that ofbsg sne. finally, the association to star-forming regions is similar among bsgsne, sne iip and iin. our results suggest that lmc metal abundances play a rolein the formation of some 1987a-like sne. this would naturally fit in a singlestar scenario for the progenitors. however, the existence of two events atnearly solar metallicity suggests that also other channels, e.g. binarity,contribute to produce bsg sne.

1310.1311	the supernova css121015:004244+132827: a clue for understanding  super-luminous supernovae	we present optical photometry and spectra of the super luminous type ii/iinsupernova css121015:004244+132827 (z=0.2868) spanning epochs from -30 days(rest frame) to more than 200 days after maximum. css121015 is one of the moreluminous supernova ever found and one of the best observed. the photometricevolution is characterized by a relatively fast rise to maximum (~40 days inthe sn rest frame), and by a linear post-maximum decline. the light curve showsno sign of a break to an exponential tail. a broad halpha is first detected at~ +40 days (rest-frame). narrow, barely-resolved balmer and [o iii] 5007 alines, with decreasing strength, are visible along the entire spectralevolution. the spectra are very similar to other super luminous supernovae(slsne) with hydrogen in their spectrum, and also to sn 2005gj, sometimesconsidered a type ia interacting with h-rich csm. the spectra are also similarto a subsample of h-deficient slsne. we propose that the properties ofcss121015 are consistent with the interaction of the ejecta with a massive,extended, opaque shell, lost by the progenitor decades before the finalexplosion, although a magnetar powered model cannot be excluded. based on thesimilarity of css121015 with other slsne (with and without h), we suggest thatthe shocked-shell scenario should be seriously considered as a plausible modelfor both types of slsn.

1310.3824	systematic uncertainties associated with the cosmological analysis of  the first pan-starrs1 type ia supernova sample	we probe the systematic uncertainties from 113 type ia supernovae (snia) inthe pan-starrs1 (ps1) sample along with 197 sn ia from a combination oflow-redshift surveys. the companion paper by rest et al. (2013) describes thephotometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the ps1 sample. thelargest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of theps1 and low-z samples. we increase the sample of observed calspec standardsfrom 7 to 10 used to define the ps1 calibration system. the ps1 and sdss-iicalibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag arerecovered. we find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colorsand reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. weestimate masses of host galaxies of ps1 supernovae and detect an insignificantdifference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037\pm0.031 mag forhost galaxies with high and low masses. assuming flatness in our analysis ofonly sne measurements, we find $w = {-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)}^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}}$. with additional constraints from bao,cmb(planck) and h0 measurements, we find $w = -1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ and$\omega_m=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ (statistical and systematic errors added inquadrature). significance of the inconsistency with $w=-1$ depends on whetherwe use planck or wmap measurements of the cmb:$w_{\textrm{bao+h0+sn+wmap}}=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$.

1310.4417	the superluminous supernova ps1-11ap: bridging the gap between low and  high redshift	we present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of thesuperluminous supernova (slsn) ps1-11ap, discovered with the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey at z = 0.524. this intrinsically blue transient rose slowly toreach a peak magnitude of m_u = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 x10^43 ergs^-1 before settling onto a relatively shallow gradient of decline.the observed decline is significantly slower than those of the superluminoustype ic sne which have been the focus of much recent attention. spectroscopicsimilarities with the lower redshift sn2007bi and a decline rate similar to56co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be acandidate for a pair instability supernova (pisn) explosion. overall thetransient appears quite similar to sn2007bi and the lower redshift objectptf12dam. the extensive data set, from 30 days before peak to 230 days after,allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of pisnexplosions. we find that the ps1-11ap data do not match these model explosionparameters well, supporting the recent claim that these sne are not pairinstability explosions. we show that ps1-11ap has many features in common withthe faster declining superluminous ic supernovae and the lightcurve evolutioncan also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin down model. at aredshift of z = 0.524 the observer frame optical coverage providescomprehensive restframe uv data and allows us to compare it with thesuperluminous sne recently found at high redshifts between z = 2-4. while thesehigh-z explosions are still plausible pisn candidates, they match thephotometric evolution of ps1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lowerredshift transient.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

0803.2145	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium iii. sn  2006jc: ir echoes from new and old dust in the progenitor csm	we present near- and mid-infrared (ir) photometric data of the type ibnsupernova (sn) 2006jc obtained with the united kingdom infrared telescope(ukirt), the gemini north telescope, and the spitzer space telescope betweendays 86 and 493 post-explosion. we find that the ir behaviour of sn 2006jc canbe explained as a combination of ir echoes from two manifestations ofcircumstellar material. the bulk of the near-ir emission arises from an ir echofrom newly-condensed dust in a cool dense shell (cds) produced by theinteraction of the ejecta outward shock with a dense shell of circumstellarmaterial ejected by the progenitor in a luminous blue variable (lbv) likeoutburst about two years prior to the sn explosion. the cds dust mass reaches amodest 3.0 x 10^(-4) m(solar) by day 230. while dust condensation within a cdsformed behind the ejecta inward shock has been proposed before for one event(sn 1998s), sn 2006jc is the first one showing evidence for dust condensationin a cds formed behind the ejecta outward shock in the circumstellar material.at later epochs, a substantial and growing contribution to the ir fluxes arisesfrom an ir echo from pre-existing dust in the progenitor wind. the mass of thepre-existing csm dust is at least ~8 x 10^(-3) m(solar). this work thereforeadds to the evidence that mass-loss from the progenitors of core-collapsesupernovae could be a major source of dust in the universe. however, yet again,we see no direct evidence that the explosion of a supernova produces anythingother than a very modest amount of dust.

0705.1439	a spitzer space telescope study of sn 2003gd: still no direct evidence  that core-collapse supernovae are major dust factories	we present a new, detailed analysis of late-time mid-infrared (ir)observations of the type ii-p supernova (sn) 2003gd. at about 16 months afterthe explosion, the mid-ir flux is consistent with emission from 4 x 10^(-5)m(solar) of newly condensed dust in the ejecta. at 22 months emission frompoint-like sources close to the sn position was detected at 8 microns and 24microns. by 42 months the 24 micron flux had faded. considerations ofluminosity and source size rule out the ejecta of sn 2003gd as the main originof the emission at 22 months. a possible alternative explanation for theemission at this later epoch is an ir echo from pre-existing circumstellar orinterstellar dust. we conclude that, contrary to the claim of sugerman et al.(2006, science, 313, 196), the mid-ir emission from sn 2003gd does not supportthe presence of 0.02 m(solar) of newly formed dust in the ejecta. there is, asyet, no direct evidence that core-collapse supernovae are major dust factories.

(2014) steady-state nlte models, and thepreferred 12 solar masses (initial mass) model shows a good overall agreementwith the observed lightcurves. we find an excess in the k and the mir bandsdeveloping between days 100 and 250, during which an increase in the opticaldecline rate is also observed. a local origin of the excess is suggested by thedepth of the hei 2.058 micron absorption. steady-state nlte models with amodest dust opacity in the core, turned on during this period, reproduce theobserved behaviour, but an additional excess in the spitzer 4.5 micron bandremains. co first-overtone band emission is detected at day 206, and possiblyat day 89, and assuming the additional excess to be dominated by co fundamentalband emission, we find fundamental to first-overtone band ratios considerablyhigher than observed in sn 1987a. this paper concludes our extensiveobservational and modelling work on sn 2011dh. the results from hydrodynamicalmodelling, steady-state nlte modelling, and stellar evolutionary progenitoranalysis are all consistent, and suggest an initial mass of 12 solar masses forthe progenitor.

1410.8393	sn 2012ec: mass of the progenitor from pessto follow-up of the  photospheric phase	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaignof sn 2012ec, which exploded in the spiral galaxy ngc 1084, during thephotospheric phase. the photometric light curve exhibits a plateau withluminosity l= 0.9 x 10^{42} erg/s and duration ~90 days, which is somewhatshorter than standard type ii-p supernovae. we estimate the nickel mass as0.040 +/- 0.015 msun from the luminosity at the beginning of the radioactivetail of the light curve. the explosion parameters of sn 2012ec were estimatedfrom the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the observed temperatureand velocity evolution of the ejecta with predictions from hydrodynamicalmodels. we derived an envelope mass of 12.6 msun, an initial progenitor radiusof 1.6 x 10^{13} cm and an explosion energy of 1.2 foe. these estimates agreewith an independent study of the progenitor star identified in pre-explosionimages, for which an initial mass of m=14-22 msun was determined. we haveapplied the same analysis to two other type ii-p supernovae (sne 2012aw and2012a), and carried out a comparison with the properties of sn 2012ec derivedin this paper. we find a reasonable agreement between the masses of theprogenitors obtained from pre-explosion images and masses derived fromhydrodynamical models. we estimate the distance to sn 2012ec with thestandardized candle method (scm) and compare it with other estimates based onother primary and secondary indicators. sne 2012a, 2012aw and 2012ec all followthe standard relations for the scm for the use of type ii-p sne as distanceindicators.

1411.7599	spectroscopy of the type ia supernova 2011fe past 1000 days	in this letter we present an optical spectrum of sn 2011fe taken 1034 d afterthe explosion, several hundred days later than any other spectrum of a type iasupernova (disregarding light-echo spectra and local-group remnants). thespectrum is still dominated by broad emission features, with no trace of alight echo or interaction of the supernova ejecta with surrounding interstellarmaterial. comparing this extremely late spectrum to an earlier one taken 331 dafter the explosion, we find that the most prominent feature at 331 d - [feiii] emission around 4700 a - has entirely faded away, suggesting a significantchange in the ionisation state. instead, [fe ii] lines are probably responsiblefor most of the emission at 1034 d. an emission feature at 6300-6400 a hasnewly developed at 1034 d, which we tentatively identify with fe i{\lambda}6359, [fe i] {\lambda}{\lambda}6231, 6394 or [o i]{\lambda}{\lambda}6300, 6364. interestingly, the features in the 1034-dspectrum seem to be collectively redshifted, a phenomenon that we currentlyhave no convincing explanation for. we discuss the implications of our findingsfor explosion models, but conclude that sophisticated spectral modelling isrequired for any firm statement.

1502.04945	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium. v.  observations of the slow-evolving sn ibn ogle-2012-sn-006	we present optical observations of the peculiar type ibn supernova (sn ibn)ogle-2012-sn-006, discovered and monitored by the ogle-iv survey, andspectroscopically followed by pessto at late phases. stringent pre-discoverylimits constrain the explosion epoch with fair precision to jd = 2456203.8 +-4.0. the rise time to the i-band light curve maximum is about two weeks. theobject reaches the peak absolute magnitude m(i) = -19.65 +- 0.19 on jd =2456218.1 +- 1.8. after maximum, the light curve declines for about 25 dayswith a rate of 4 mag per 100d. the symmetric i-band peak resembles that ofcanonical type ib/c supernovae (sne), whereas sne ibn usually exhibitasymmetric and narrower early-time light curves. since 25 days past maximum,the light curve flattens with a decline rate slower than that of the 56co to56fe decay, although at very late phases it steepens to approach that rate. anearly-time spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum, with only a marginalevidence for the presence of he i lines marking this sn type. this spectrumshows broad absorptions bluewards than 5000a, likely o ii lines, which aresimilar to spectral features observed in super-luminous sne at early epochs.the object has been spectroscopically monitored by pessto from 90 to 180 daysafter peak, and these spectra show the typical features observed in a number ofsn 2006jc-like events, including a blue spectral energy distribution andprominent and narrow (v(fwhm) ~ 1900 km/s) he i emission lines. this suggeststhat the ejecta are interacting with he-rich circumstellar material. thedetection of broad (10000 km/s) o i and ca ii features likely produced in thesn ejecta (including the [o i] 6300a,6364a doublet in the latest spectra) lendssupport to the interpretation of ogle-2012-sn-006 as a core-collapse event.

0805.1914	the type iib sn 2008ax: spectral and light curve evolution	we present spectroscopy and photometry of the he-rich supernova (sn) 2008ax.the early-time spectra show prominent p-cygni h lines, which decrease with timeand disappear completely about two months after the explosion. in the sameperiod he i lines become the most prominent spectral features. sn 2008axdisplays the ordinary spectral evolution of a type iib supernova. a stringentpre-discovery limit constrains the time of the shock breakout of sn 2008ax towithin only a few hours. its light curve, which peaks in the b band about 20days after the explosion, strongly resembles that of other he-richcore-collapse supernovae. the observed evolution of sn 2008ax is consistentwith the explosion of a young wolf-rayet (of wnl type) star, which had retaineda thin, low-mass shell of its original h envelope. the overall characteristicsof sn 2008ax are reminiscent of those of sn 1993j, except for a likely smallerh mass. this may account for the findings that the progenitor of sn 2008ax wasa wnl star and not a k supergiant as in the case of sn 1993j, that a prominentearly-time peak is missing in the light curve of sn 2008ax, and that halpha isobserved at higher velocities in sn 2008ax than in sn 1993j.

(abridged)  we obtained a final sample of 117 sne, most of which are snia (57%) and theremaining core collapse events of which 44% type ii, 22% type iin and 34% typeib/c. in order to link the transients, we built a catalog of ~1.3x10^5 galaxiesin the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 with a limiting magnitude k_ab=23.5 mag. wemeasured the sn rate per unit volume for sn ia and core collapse sne indifferent bin of redshifts. the values are consistent with other measurementsfrom the literature. the dispersion of the rate measurements for sne ia iscomparable with the scatter of the theoretical tracks for single (sd) anddouble degenerate (dd) binary systems models, therefore the data do not allowto disentangle among the two different progenitor scenarios. however, we maynotice that among the three tested models, sd and two flavours of dd, eitherwith a steep (ddc) or a wide (ddw) delay time distribution, the sd gives abetter fit across the whole redshift range whereas the ddc better matches thesteep rise up to redshift ~1.2. the ddw appears instead less favoured. the corecollapse sn rate is fully consistent, unlike recent claims, with the predictionbased on recent estimates of the star formation history, and standardprogenitor mass range.

astro-ph;0309665	supernova 2002bo: inadequacy of the single parameter description	we present optical/near-infrared photometry and spectra of the type ia sn2002bo spanning epochs from -13 days before maximum b-band light to +102 daysafter. the pre-maximum optical coverage is particularly complete. in somerespects, sn 2002bo behaves as a typical "branch normal" type ia supernova (snia) at optical and ir wavelengths. we find a b-band risetime of 17.9+-0.5 days,a dm_{15}(b) of 1.13+-0.05, and a m_b=-19.41+-0.42. however, comparison withother type ia supernovae having similar delta m_{15}(b) values indicates thatin other respects sn 2002bo is unusual. while the optical spectra of sn 2002boare very similar to those of sn 1984a, lower velocities and a generally morestructured appearance are found in sne 1990n, 1994d and 1998bu. for supernovaehaving dm_(15)(b) &gt; 1.2, we confirm the variation of r(siii) (nugent et al.1995) with dm_(15)(b). however, for supernovae such as sn2002bo, with lowervalues of dm_(15)(b) the relation breaks down. moreover, the evolution ofr(siii) for sn 2002bo is strikingly different from that shown by other type iasupernovae. the velocities of sn 2002bo and 1984a derived from sii 5640a, siii6355a and caii h&amp;k lines are either much higher and/or evolve differently fromthose seen in other normal sne ia events. we suggest that the unusually lowtemperature, the presence of high-velocity intermediate-mass elements and thelow abundance of carbon at early times indicates that burning to si penetratedto much higher layers than in more normal type ia supernovae. this may beindicative of a delayed-detonation explosion.

astro-ph;0401273	cepheid calibration of type ia supernovae and the hubble constant	we investigate how a different calibration of the cepheid period-luminosity(pl) relation taking into account the metallicity corrections, affects theabsolute magnitude calibration of supernovae (sne) ia and, in turn, thedetermination of the hubble constant h_0. we exploit sn ia light curves fromliterature and previously unpublished data, to build the m_b -- delta m_{15}(b)relation and we calibrate the zero point by means of 9 type ia sne with cepheidmeasured distances. this relation was then used to build the hubble diagram andin turn to derive h_0. in the attempt to correct for the host galaxyextinction, we found that the data seems to suggest a value for the total toselective absorption ratio, r_b=3.5, which is smaller than the standard valuefor our own galaxy r_b=4.315. depending on different metallicity correctionsfor the cepheids p-l relation, values of r_b and sn sample selection criteria,we found that the values of the hubble constant h_0 is in the range 68--74 kms^{-1} mpc^{-1}, with associated uncertainties of the order of 10%. unpublishedphotometry is also presented for 18 sne of our sample (1991s, 1991t, 1992a,1992k, 1993h, 1993l, 1994d, 1994m, 1994ae, 1995d, 1995ac, 1995bd, 1996bo,1997bp, 1997br, 1999aa, 1999dk, 2000cx), which are the results of a longstanding effort for supernova monitoring at eso - la silla and asiagoobservatories.

astro-ph;0407216	death rate of massive stars at redshift ~0.3	we report the first result of a supernova search program designed to measurethe evolution of the supernova rate with redshift. to make the comparison withlocal rates more significant we copied, as much as possible, the samecomputation recepies as for the measurements of local rates. moreover, weexploited the multicolor images and the photometric redshift technique tocharacterize the galaxy sample and accurately estimate the detectionefficiency.  combining our data with the recently published meaurements of the sn ia rateat different redshifts, we derived the first, direct measurement of the corecollapse supernova rate at z = 0.26 as r_cc = 1.45^{+0.55}{-0.45} h^2 snu[h=h_0/75]. this is a factor three {+/- 50%)} larger than the local estimate.the increase for a look back time of "only" 2.8 gyr is more rapid thanpredicted by most of the published models of the sn rate evolution.core-collapse sn rates measure the death rate of massive star and, because ofthe short time scale of evolution, can be translated in a measurement of theongoing sfr. assuming a salpeter imf and the standard scenario forcore-collapse progenitors we derived to an estimate of the star formation rateat redshift 3.1^{+1.1}{-1.0} 10^-2 h^3 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^{-3} which compare verywell with a recent estimate based on the measurement of the halpha luminositydensity at the same redshift.

astro-ph;0502531	high-velocity features: a ubiquitous property of type ia sne	evidence of high-velocity features such as those seen in the near-maximumspectra of some type ia supernovae (eg sn 2000cx) has been searched for in theavailable snia spectra observed earlier than one week before b maximum. recentobservational efforts have doubled the number of sneia with very early spectra.remarkably, all sneia with early data (7 in our rtn sample and 10 from otherprogrammes) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in caiiir, and some also in siii 6255a line. high-velocity features may be interpretedas abundance or density enhancements. abundance enhancements would imply anouter region dominated by si and ca. density enhancements may result from thesweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity sn ejecta. inthis scenario, the high incidence of hvfs suggests that a thick disc and/or ahigh-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be thecase in single degenerate systems. large-scale angular fluctuations in theradial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this couldoriginate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likelyexplosion mechanism. csm-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. in some sne the hvfs arenarrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burnedmaterial.

astro-ph;0510046	simultaneous xmm-newton and eso vlt observations of sn 1995n: probing  the wind/ejecta interaction	we present the results of the first {\it xmm-newton} observation of theinteracting type iin supernova 1995n, performed in july 2003. we find that the0.2--10.0 kev unabsorbed flux dropped at a value of $\simeq 1.8 \times10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, almost one order of magnitude lower than thatof a previous {\it asca} observation of january 1998. from all the availablex-ray measurements, an interesting scenario emerges where the x-ray lightemission may be produced by a two-phase (clumpy/smooth) circumstellar medium.the x-ray spectral analysis shows statistically significant evidence for thepresence of two distinct components, that can be modeled with emission fromoptically thin, thermal plasmas at different temperatures. the exponent of theejecta density distribution inferred from these temperatures is $n\simeq 6.4$.  from the fluxes of the two spectral components we derive an estimate of themass loss rate of the supernova progenitor, ${\dot m} \sim 2 \times 10^{-4}m_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$, at the upper end of the interval exhibited by redsuper-giants. coordinated optical and infrared observations allow us toreconstruct the simultaneous infrared to x-ray flux distribution of sn 1995n.we find that, at $\sim$ 9 years after explosion, the direct x-ray thermalemission due to the wind/ejecta interaction is $\sim 5$ times larger than thetotal reprocessed ir/optical flux.

astro-ph;0605700	sn 2005cs in m51 i. the first month of evolution of a subluminous sn ii  plateau	early time optical observations of supernova (sn) 2005cs in the whirlpoolgalaxy (m51), are reported. photometric data suggest that sn 2005cs is amoderately under-luminous type ii plateau supernova (sn iip). the sn wasunusually blue at early epochs (u-b ~ -0.9 about three days after explosion)which indicates very high continuum temperatures. the spectra show relativelynarrow p-cygni features, suggesting ejecta velocities lower than observed inmore typical sne iip. the earliest spectra show weak absorption features in theblue wing of the he i 5876a absorption component and, less clearly, of h$\beta$and h$\alpha$. based on spectral modelling, two different interpretations canbe proposed: these features may either be due to high-velocity h and he icomponents, or (more likely) be produced by different ions (n ii, si ii).analogies with the low-luminosity, $^{56}$ni-poor, low-velocity sne iip arealso discussed.  while a more extended spectral coverage is necessary in order to determineaccurately the properties of the progenitor star, published estimates of theprogenitor mass seem not to be consistent with stellar evolution models.

astro-ph;0607078	sn 2004aw: confirming diversity of type ic supernovae	optical and near-infrared observations of the type ic supernova (sn) 2004aware presented, obtained from day -3 to day +413 with respect to the b-bandmaximum. the photometric evolution is characterised by a comparatively slowpost-maximum decline of the light curves. the peaks in redder bands aresignificantly delayed relative to the bluer bands, the i-band maximum occurring8.4 days later than that in b. with an absolute peak magnitude of -18.02 in thev band the sn can be considered fairly bright, but not exceptional. this alsoholds for the u through i bolometric light curve, where sn 2004aw has aposition intermediate between sne 2002ap and 1998bw. spectroscopically sn2004aw provides a link between a normal type ic supernova like sn 1994i and thegroup of broad-lined sne ic. the spectral evolution is rather slow, with aspectrum at day +64 being still predominantly photospheric. the shape of thenebular [o i] 6300,6364 line indicates a highly aspherical explosion. heliumcannot be unambiguously identified in the spectra, even in the near-infrared.using an analytical description of the light curve peak we find that the totalmass of the ejecta in sn 2004aw is 3.5-8.0 m_sun, significantly larger than insn 1994i, although not as large as in sn 1998bw. the same model suggests thatabout 0.3 m_sun of {56}ni has been synthesised in the explosion. no connectionto a grb can be firmly established.

astro-ph;0702565	esc and kait observations of the transitional type ia sn 2004eo	we present optical and infrared observations of the unusual type ia supernova(sn) 2004eo. the light curves and spectra closely resemble those of theprototypical sn 1992a, and the luminosity at maximum (m_b = -19.08) is close tothe average for a sn ia. however, the ejected 56ni mass derived by modellingthe bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limitof the 56ni mass distribution observed in normal sne ia. accordingly, sn 2004eoshows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (delta m_(b) =1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 similar to that of sn 1992a. the physical properties of sn 2004eocause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocitygradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by benetti et al.(2005). similar behaviour is seen in a few other sne ia. thus, there may infact exist a few sne ia with intermediate physical properties.

astro-ph;0703663	a giant outburst two years before the core-collapse of a massive star	the death of massive stars produces a variety of supernovae, which are linkedto the structure of the exploding stars. the detection of several precursorstars of type ii supernovae have been reported, however we do not yet havedirect information on the progenitors of the hydrogen deficient type ib and icsupernovae. here we report that the peculiar type ib supernova sn2006jc isspatially coincident with a bright optical transient that occurred in 2004.spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggestthat the progenitor was a carbon-oxygen wolf-rayet star embedded within ahelium-rich circumstellar medium. there are different possible explanations forthis pre-explosion transient. it appears similar to the giant outbursts ofluminous blue variables (lbv) of 60-100 solar mass stars, however theprogenitor of sn2006jc was helium and hydrogen deficient. an lbv-like outburstof a wolf-rayet star could be invoked, but this would be the firstobservational evidence of such a phenomenon. alternatively a massive binarysystem composed of an lbv which erupted in 2004, and a wolf-rayet starexploding as sn2006jc, could explain the observations.

0810.0635	sn 2006gy: was it really extra-ordinary?	we present an optical photometric and spectroscopic study of the veryluminous type iin sn 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. inphotometry, a broad, bright (m_r~-21.7) peak characterizes all bvri lightcurves. afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slowluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. at late phases (&gt;237 days),because of the large luminosity drop (&gt;3 mag), only upper visibility limits areobtained in the b, r and i bands. in the near-infrared, two k-band detectionson days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or ir echoesscenarios. at all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broadp-cygni profiles and a multicomponent halpha profile, which are the typicalsignatures of type iin sne. after maximum, spectroscopic and photometricsimilarities are found between sn 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated sne(e.g. sn 1997cy, sn 1999e and sn 2002ic). this suggests that ejecta-csminteraction plays a key role in sn 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,sustaining the late-time-light curve. alternatively, the late luminosity may berelated to the radioactive decay of ~3m_sun of 56ni. models of the light curvein the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (r~6-810^(12)cm, m_ej~5-14m_sun), and that the sn ejecta collided with massive(6-10m_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. these clumps do notcompletely obscure the sn photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity isdue both to the decay of 56ni and to interaction with csm. a supermassive staris not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarilylarge explosion energy.

0706.0500	a deeper search for the progenitor of the type ic supernova 2002ap	(abridged) we present a search for the progenitor star of the type icsupernova 2002ap in deep, high quality pre-explosion observations taken withthe canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). aligning high-resolution hubblespace telescope (hst) observations of the supernova itself with the archivalcfht images allowed us to pinpoint the location of the progenitor site on theground based observations. we find that a source visible in the b and r bandpre-explosion images close to the position of the sn is (1) not coincident withthe sn position within the uncertainties of our relative astrometry, and (2) isstill visible ~ 4.7 yrs post-explosion in late-time observations taken with thewilliam herschel telescope. we therefore conclude that it is not the progenitorof sn 2002ap. comparing our luminosity limits with stellar models of singlestars at appropriate metallicity (z=0.008) we conclude that any single starprogenitor must have experienced at least twice the standard mass loss ratesduring pre-wolf-rayet evolution, been initially &gt; 30-40m(sun) and exploded as awolf-rayet star of final mass 10-12m(sun). alternatively an initially lessmassive progenitor may have evolved in an interacting binary system. weconstrain any possible binary companion to a main sequence star of &lt; 20m(sun),a neutron star or a black hole. by combining the pre-explosion limits with theejecta mass estimates and constraints from x-ray and radio observations weconclude that any binary interaction most likely occurred as case b masstransfer, either with or without a subsequent common envelope evolution phase.
