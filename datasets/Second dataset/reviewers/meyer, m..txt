0902.0338	long-wavelength observations of debris discs around sun-like stars	[abridged] we present two deep surveys of circumstellar discs aroundsolar-type stars at different ages carried out at 350 micron with the cso andat 1.2 mm with the iram 30-m telescope. the aim of this study is to understandthe evolution timescale of circumstellar debris discs, and the physicalmechanisms responsible for such evolution around solar-type stars. in addition,we perform a detailed characterisation of the detected debris discs.theoretically, the mass of the disc is expected to decrease with time. in orderto test this hypothesis, we performed the generalised kendall's tau correlationand three different two-sample tests. a characterisation of the detected debrisdiscs has been obtained by computing the collision and poynting-robertsontimescales and by modelling the spectral energy distribution. the kendall's taucorrelation yields a probability of 76% that the mass of debris discs and theirage are correlated. similarly, the three two-sample tests give a probabilitybetween 70 and 83% that younger and older debris systems belong to differentparent populations in terms of dust mass. we detected submillimetre/millimetreemission from six debris discs, enabling a detailed sed modelling. our resultson the correlation and evolution of dust mass as a function of age areconditioned by the sensitivity limit of our survey. deeper millimetreobservations are needed to confirm the evolution of debris material aroundsolar-like stars. in the case of the detected discs, the comparison betweencollision and poynting-robertson timescales supports the hypothesis that thesediscs are collision dominated. all detected debris disc systems show the innerpart evacuated from small micron-sized grains.

0902.0384	evidence for a non-uniform initial mass function in the local universe	many results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial massfunction (imf) is universal. our observations of hi selected galaxies in thelight of h-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (fuv) challenge this notion. the fluxratio h-alpha/fuv from these two star formation tracers shows strongcorrelations with the surface-brightness in h-alpha and the r band: low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightnessgalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models usingcommonly favored imf parameters. weaker but significant correlations ofh-alpha/fuv with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are foundas well as a systematic trend with morphology. the correlated variations ofh-alpha/fuv with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family ofgalaxy scaling relations. the h-alpha/fuv correlations can not be due to dustcorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation historycan not explain the trends with both h-alpha and r surface brightness. lsbgalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photonsconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. the mostplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of theupper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end. we outline ascenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of theformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. ourresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highlysensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. a non-universal imf also callsinto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxiesand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. abridged.

0911.1791	outlying hii regions in hi-selected galaxies	we present results from the first systematic search for outlying hii regions,as part of a sample of 96 emission-line point sources (referred to as eldots -emission-line dots) derived from the noao survey for ionization in neutral gasgalaxies (singg). our automated eldot-finder searches singg narrow-band andcontinuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the opticalradius of the target galaxy (&gt; 2 x r25 in the r-band). follow-up longslitspectroscopy and deep galex images (exposure time &gt; 1000 s) distinguishoutlying hii regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines([oiii], hbeta or [oii]) have been redshifted into the singg bandpass. we findthat these deep galex images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopicfollow-up because outlying hii regions separate cleanly from backgroundgalaxies in color-color space. we identify seven singg systems with outlyingmassive star formation that span a large range in halpha luminositiescorresponding to a few o stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarfsatellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. six of these sevensystems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying hii regions are linked tothe extended-uv disks discovered by galex, representing emission from the mostmassive o stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) starclusters. the overall frequency of outlying hii regions in this sample ofgas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-linegalaxy contamination (~75% of eldots).

0707.4167	gaps in the cloud cover? comparing extinction measures in spiral disks	dust in galaxies can be mapped by either the fir/sub-mm emission, the opticalor infrared reddening of starlight, or the extinction of a known backgroundsource. we compare two dust extinction measurements for a set of fifteensections in thirteen nearby galaxies, to determine the scale of the dusty ismresponsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a knownbackground source. in our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurementsof 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objectsidentified though foreground disks in hst/wfpc2 images. for the 13 galaxiesthat overlap with the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), we nowcompare these results with those obtained from an i-l color map. our goal is todetermine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dustyism, and hence to better understand the nature and geometry of the diskextinction.  we find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sectionsmarked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on thecloud cover of {\it spitzer}-resolved dust structures --mostly the spiralarms--and a diffuse, unresolved underlying disk. we note that our infraredcolor map (e[i-l]) underestimates the overall dust presence in these disksseverely, because it implicitly assumes the presence of a dust screen in frontof the stellar distribution.

(high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1410.1556	sensitivity of the cherenkov telescope array to the detection of  axion-like particles at high gamma-ray opacities	extensions of the standard model of particles commonly predict the existenceof axion(-like) particles (alps) that could be detected through their couplingto photons in external magnetic fields. this coupling could lead tomodifications of $\gamma$-ray spectra from extragalactic sources. above acertain energy, the $\gamma$-ray flux should be exponentially damped due to theinteraction with photons of background radiations fields. alps, on the otherhand, propagate unimpeded over cosmological distances and a reconversion into$\gamma$-rays could lead to an additional component in the spectra. here, wepresent the sensitivity of the proposed cherenkov telescope array (cta) todetect this spectral hardening. using the full instrumental response functionsof cta, a combined likelihood analysis of four $\gamma$-ray sources shows thata significant detection of the alp signal is possible for couplings$g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 2\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{gev}^{-1}$ and alp masses $m_a\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{nev}$. we discuss the dependency of these values ondifferent model assumptions and magnetic-field scenarios and identify the bestobservation strategy to search for an alp induced boost of the $\gamma$-rayflux.

1501.01048	the ska as a doorway to angular momentum	angular momentum is one of the most fundamental physical quantities governinggalactic evolution. differences in the colours, morphologies, star formationrates and gas fractions amongst galaxies of equal stellar/baryon mass m arepotentially widely explained by variations in their specific stellar/baryonangular momentum j. the enormous potential of angular momentum science is onlyjust being realised, thanks to the emergence of the first simulations ofgalaxies with converged spins, paralleled by a dramatic increase in kinematicobservations. such observations are still challenged by the fact that most ofthe stellar/baryon angular momentum resides at large radii. in fact, the radiusthat maximally contributes to the angular momentum of an exponential disk(3re-4re) is twice as large as the radius that maximally contributes to thedisk mass; thus converged measurements of angular momentum require eitherextremely deep ifs data or, alternatively, kinematic measurements of neutralatomic hydrogen (hi), which naturally resides at the large disk radii thatdominate the angular momentum. the ska has a unique opportunity to become theworld-leading facility for angular momentum studies due to its ability tomeasure the resolved and/or global hi kinematics in very large andwell-characterised galaxy samples. these measurements will allow, for example,(1) a very robust determination of the two-dimensional distribution of galaxiesin the (m,j)-plane, (2) the largest, systematic measurement of the relationshipbetween m, j, and tertiary galaxy properties, and (3) the most accuratemeasurement of the large-scale distribution and environmental dependence ofangular momentum vectors, both in terms of norm and orientation. all thesemeasurements will represent exquisite tools to build a next generation ofgalaxy evolution models.

1501.01077	observations of the intergalactic medium and the cosmic web in the ska  era	the interaction of galaxies with their environment, the intergalactic medium(igm), is an important aspect of galaxy formation. one of the most fundamental,but unanswered questions in the evolution of galaxies is how gas circulates inand around galaxies and how it enters the galaxies to support star formation.we have several lines of evidence that the observed evolution of star formationrequires gas accretion from the igm at all times and on all cosmic scales. thisgas remains largely unaccounted for and the outstanding questions are wherethis gas resides and what the physical mechanisms of accretion are. the gas isexpected to be embedded in an extended cosmic web made of sheets and filaments.such large-scale filaments of gas are expected by cosmological numericalsimulations, which have made significant progress in recent years. suchsimulations do not only model the large scale structure of the cosmic web, butalso investigate the neutral gas component. to truly make significant progressin understanding the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the igm, columndensities of nhi=10^18 cm-2 and below have to be probed over large areas on thesky at sub-arcminute resolution. these are the densities of the fainteststructures known today around nearby galaxies, though mostly found with singledish telescopes which do not have the resolution to resolve these structuresand investigate any kinematics. existing interferometers lack the collectingpower or short baselines to achieve brightness sensitivities typically belownhi=10^19 cm-2. reaching lower column densities with current facilities isfeasible, however requires prohibitively long observing times. the ska will forthe first time break these barriers, enabling interferometric observations anorder of magnitude deeper than current interferometers and with an order ofmagnitude better linear resolution than single-dish telescopes.

1501.04450	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of pre-main sequence stellar spectra	this paper describes the analysis of uves and giraffe spectra acquired by thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey in the fields of young clusters whosepopulation includes pre-main sequence (pms) stars. both methods that have beenextensively used in the past and new ones developed in the contest of thegaia-eso survey enterprise are available and used. the internal precision ofthese quantities is estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by suchdifferent methods, while the accuracy is estimated by comparison withindependent external data, like effective temperature and surface gravityderived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars.specific strategies are implemented to deal with fast rotation, accretionsignatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling. the analysis carried out onspectra acquired in young clusters' fields during the first 18 months ofobservations, up to june 2013, is presented in preparation of the first releaseof advanced data products. stellar parameters obtained with the higherresolution and larger wavelength coverage from uves are reproduced withcomparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lowerresolution of the giraffe setup adopted for young stars, which allows us toprovide with confidence stellar parameters for the much larger giraffe sample.precisions are estimated to be $\approx$ 120 k r.m.s. in teff, $\approx$0.3 dexr.m.s. in logg, and $\approx$0.15 dex r.m.s. in [fe/h], for both the uves andgiraffe setups.

1502.04869	local aspects of hydrogen-induced metallization of the  zno(10$\mathbf{\overline{1}}$0) surface	this study combines surface-sensitive photoemission experiments with densityfunctional theory (dft) to give a microscopic description of hadsorption-induced modifications of the zno(10${\overline{1}}$0) surfaceelectronic structure. we find a complex adsorption behavior caused by a strongcoverage dependence of the h adsorption energies: initially, o--h bondformation is energetically favorable and h acting as an electron donor leads tothe formation of a charge accumulation layer and to surface metallization. theincrease of the number of o--h bonds leads to a reversal in adsorption energiessuch that zn--h bonds become favored at sites close to existing o--h bonds,which results in a gradual extenuation of the metallization. the correspondingsurface potential changes are localized within a few nanometers both laterallyand normal to the surface. this localized character is experimentallycorroborated by using sub-surface bound excitons at thezno(10${\overline{1}}$0) surface as a local probe. the pronounced andcomparably localized effect of small amounts of hydrogen at this surfacestrongly suggests metallic character of zno surfaces under technologicallyrelevant conditions and may, thus, be of high importance for energy levelalignment at zno-based junctions in general.

1503.02711	discovery of variable vhe gamma-ray emission from the binary system 1fgl  j1018.6-5856	re-observations with the h.e.s.s. telescope array of the very-high-energy(vhe) source hess j1018-589 a coincident with the fermi-lat $\gamma$-ray binary1fgl j1018.6-5856 have resulted in a source detection significance of more than9$\sigma$, and the detection of variability ($\chi^2$/$\nu$ of 238.3/155) inthe emitted $\gamma$-ray flux. this variability confirms the association ofhess j1018-589 a with the high-energy $\gamma$-ray binary detected byfermi-lat, and also confirms the point-like source as a new very-high-energybinary system. the spectrum of hess j1018-589 a is best fit with a power-lawfunction with photon index $\gamma = 2.20 \pm 0.14_{\rm stat} \pm 0.2_{\rmsys}$. emission is detected up to ~20 tev. the mean differential flux level is$(2.9 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-13}$ tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev,equivalent to ~1% of the flux from the crab nebula at the same energy.variability is clearly detected in the night-by-night lightcurve. when foldedon the orbital period of 16.58 days, the rebinned lightcurve peaks in phasewith the observed x-ray and high-energy phaseograms. the fit of the h.e.s.s.phaseogram to a constant flux provides evidence of periodicity at the level of3$\sigma$. the shape of the vhe phaseogram and measured spectrum suggest a lowinclination, low eccentricity system with a modest impact from vhe $\gamma$-rayabsorption due to pair production ($\tau$ &lt; 1 at 300 gev).

1503.04935	standard model thermodynamics across the electroweak crossover	even though the standard model with a higgs mass mh = 125 gev possesses nobulk phase transition, its thermodynamics still experiences a "soft point" attemperatures around t = 160 gev, with a deviation from ideal gasthermodynamics. such a deviation may have an effect on precision computationsof weakly interacting dark matter relic abundances if their mass is in the fewtev range, or on leptogenesis scenarios operating in this temperature range. bymaking use of results from lattice simulations based on a dimensionally reducedeffective field theory, we estimate the relevant thermodynamic functions acrossthe crossover. the results are tabulated in a numerical form permitting fortheir insertion as a background equation of state into cosmological particleproduction/decoupling codes. we find that higgs dynamics induces a non-trivial"structure" visible e.g. in the heat capacity, but that in general the largestradiative corrections originate from qcd effects, reducing the energy densityby a couple of percent from the free value even at t &gt; 160 gev.

1507.01481	volume product of planar polar convex bodies --- lower estimates with  stability	let $k \subset {\mathbb r}^2$ be an $o$-symmetric convex body, and $k^*$ itspolar body. then we have $|k|\cdot |k^*| \ge 8$, with equality if and only if$k$ is a parallelogram. ($| \cdot |$ denotes volume). if $k \subset {\mathbbr}^2$ is a convex body, with $o \in {\text{int}}\,k$, then $|k|\cdot |k^*| \ge27/4$, with equality if and only if $k$ is a triangle and $o$ is its centroid.if $k \subset {\mathbb r}^2$ is a convex body, then we have $|k| \cdot|[(k-k)/2)]^* | \ge 6$, with equality if and only if $k$ is a triangle. thesetheorems are due to mahler and reisner, mahler and meyer, and to eggleston,respectively. we show an analogous theorem: if $k$ has $n$-fold rotationalsymmetry about $o$, then $|k|\cdot |k^*| \ge n^2 \sin ^2 ( \pi /n)$, withequality if and only if $k$ is a regular $n$-gon of centre $o$. we will alsogive stability variants of these four inequalities, both for the body, and forthe centre of polarity. for this we use the banach-mazur distance (fromparallelograms, or triangles), or its analogue with similar copies rather thanaffine transforms (from regular $n$-gons), respectively. the stability variantsare sharp, up to constant factors. we extend the inequality $|k|\cdot |k^*| \gen^2 \sin ^2 ( \pi /n)$ to bodies with $o \in {\text{int}}\,k$, which contain,and are contained in, two regular $n$-gons, the vertices of the contained$n$-gon being incident to the sides of the containing $n$-gon. our key lemma isa stability estimate for the area product of two sectors of convex bodies polarto each other. to several of our statements we give several proofs; inparticular, we give a new proof for the theorem of mahler-reisner.

0705.3377	the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators	with the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emissiontraces the star formation rate (sfr), we analyze spitzer 8 um and 24 um data ofstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with availablehst/nicmos images in the paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. the galaxiesare drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample, andcover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. publisheddata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and luminous infrared galaxiesare also included in the analysis. both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 umemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-correctedpa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. simple modelsof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproducethe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizingphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the lowmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dustopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. conversely, the trend of the8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not wellreproduced by the same models. the 8 um emission is contributed, in largermeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellarpopulations, in agreement with previous findings. two sfr calibrations, oneusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um andh-alpha luminosities (kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. no calibration ispresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on bothmetallicity and environment. the calibrations presented here should be directlyapplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0302440	the 1000 brightest hipass galaxies: hi mass function and omega_hi	we present a new accurate measurement of the hi mass function of galaxiesfrom the hipass bright galaxy catalog, a sample of 1000 galaxies with thehighest hi peak flux densities in the southern hemisphere (koribalski et al.2003). this sample spans nearly four orders of magnitude in hi mass (from logm_hi/m_sun=6.8 to 10.6, h0=75) and is the largest sample of hi selectedgalaxies to date. we develop a bivariate maximum likelihood technique tomeasure the space density of galaxies, and show that this is a robust method,insensitive to the effects of large scale structure. the resulting hi massfunction can be fitted satisfactorily with a schechter function with faint-endslope alpha=-1.30. this slope is found to be dependent on morphological type,with later type galaxies giving steeper slopes. we extensively test variouseffects that potentially bias the determination of the hi mass function,including peculiar motions of galaxies, large scale structure, selection bias,and inclination effects, and quantify these biases. the large sample ofgalaxies enables an accurate measurement of the cosmological mass density ofneutral gas: omega_hi=(3.8 +/- 0.6) x 10^{-4}. low surface brightness galaxiescontribute only 15% to this value, consistent with previous findings.
