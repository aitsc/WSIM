0706.2280	longitudinal impedance and wake from xfel undulators. impact on  current-enhanced sase schemes	in this article we derive longitudinal impedance and wake function for anundulator setup with arbitrary undulator parameter, taking into account afinite transverse size of the electron bunch. earlier studies considered a linedensity-distribution of electrons instead. we focus our attention on thelong-wavelength asymptote (compared with resonance wavelength), at largedistance of the electron bunch from the undulator entrance compared to theovertaking length, and for large vacuum-chamber size compared to the typicaltransverse size of the field. these restrictions define a parameter region ofinterest for practical applications. we calculate a closed expression forimpedance and wake function that may be evaluated numerically in the mostgeneral case. such expression allows us to derive an analytical solution for agaussian transverse and longitudinal bunch shape. finally, we study thefeasibility of current-enhanced sase schemes (esase) recently proposed forlcls, that fall well-within our approximations. numerical estimations presentedin this paper indicate that impedance-induced energy spread is sufficient toseriously degrade the fel performance. our conclusion is in contrast withresults in literature, where wake calculations for the lcls case are given infree-space, as if the presence of the undulator were negligible.

physics;0205001	transverse self-fields within an electron bunch moving in an arc of a  circle	as a consequence of motions driven by external forces, self-fields (which aredifferent from the static case) originate within an electron bunch. in the caseof magnetic external forces acting on an ultrarelativistic beam, thelongitudinal self-interactions are responsible for csr (coherent synchrotronradiation)-related phenomena, which have been studied extensively. on the otherhand, transverse self-interactions are present too. at the time being, existingtheoretical analysis of transverse self-forces deal with the case of a bunchmoving along a circular orbit only, without considering the situation of abending magnet with a finite length. in this paper we propose anelectrodynamical analysis of transverse self-fields which originate, at theposition of a test particle, from an ultrarelativistic electron bunch moving inan arc of a circle. the problem will be first addressed within a two-particlesystem. we then extend our consideration to a line bunch with a stepped densitydistribution, a situation which can be easily generalized to the case of anarbitrary density distribution. our approach turns out to be also useful inorder to get a better insight in the physics involved in the case of simplecircular motion and in order to address the well known issue of the partialcompensation of transverse self-force.

physics;0502120	paraxial green's functions in synchrotron radiation theory	this work contains a systematic treatment of single particle synchrotronradiation and some application to realistic beams with given cross sectionarea, divergence and energy spread. standard theory relies on severalapproximations whose applicability limits and accuracy are often forgotten. webegin remarking that on the one hand, a paraxial approximation can always beapplied without loss of generality and with ultra relativistic accuracy. on theother hand, dominance of the acceleration field over the velocity part in thelienard-wiechert expressions is not always granted and constitutes a separateassumption, whose applicability is discussed. treating synchrotron radiation inparaxial approximation we derive the equation for the slow varying envelopefunction of the fourier components of the electric field vector. calculationsof synchrotron radiation properties performed by others showed that the phaseof the fourier components of the electric field vector differs from the phaseof a virtual point source. in this paper we present a systematic, analyticaldescription of this phase shift, calculating amplitude and phase of electricfield from bending magnets, short magnets, two bending magnet system separatedby a straight section (edge radiation) and undulator devices. we pay particularattention to region of applicability and accuracy of approximations used.finally, taking advantage of results of analytical calculation presented inreduced form we analyze various features of radiation from a complex insertiondevice (set of two undulators with a focusing triplet in between) accountingfor the influence of energy spread and electron beam emittance.

physics;0506231	understanding transverse coherence properties of x-ray beams in third  generation synchrotron radiation sources	this paper describes a theory of transverse coherence properties of undulatorradiation. our study is of very practical relevance, because it yields specificpredictions of undulator radiation cross-spectral density in various parts ofthe beamline. on the contrary, usual estimations of coherence properties assumethat the undulator source is quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and relyon the application of van cittert-zernike (vcz) theorem, in its original orgeneralized form, for calculating transverse coherence length in the far-fieldapproximation. the vcz theorem is derived in the frame of statistical opticsusing a number of restrictive assumptions: in particular, the quasi-homogeneousassumption is demonstrated to be inaccurate in many practical situationsregarding undulator sources. we propose a technique to calculate thecross-spectral density from undulator sources in the most general case. also,we find the region of applicability of the quasi-homogeneous model and wepresent an analytical expression for the cross-spectral density which is validup to the exit of the undulator. for the case of more general undulatorsources, simple formulas for the transverse coherence length, interpolated fromnumerical calculations and suitable for beamline design applications are found.finally, using a simple vertical slit, we show how transverse coherenceproperties of an x-ray beam can be manipulated to obtain a larger coherentspot-size on a sample. this invention was devised almost entirely on the basisof theoretical ideas developed throughout this paper.

physics;0603269	statistical optics approach to the design of beamlines for synchrotron  radiation	in this paper we analyze the image formation problem for undulator radiationthrough an optical system, accounting for the influence of the electron beamemittance. on the one hand, image formation with synchrotron radiation isgoverned by the laws of statistical optics. on the other hand, the widely usedgaussian-shell model cannot be applied to describe the coherence properties ofx-ray beams from third generation synchrotron radiation sources. as a result, amore rigorous analysis of coherence properties is required. we propose atechnique to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulatorsource, that we subsequently propagate through an optical imaging system. atfirst we focus on the case of an ideal lens with a non-limiting pupil aperture.our theory, which makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, also allowstreatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space,together with their applicability region. particular emphasis is given to theasymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than theradiation wavelength, which is relevant for third generation synchrotronradiation sources. first principle calculations of undulator radiationcharacteristics (i.e. ten-dimensional integrals) are then reduced toone-dimensional convolutions of analytical functions with universal functionsspecific for undulator radiation sources. we also consider the imaging problemfor a non-ideal lens in presence of aberrations and a limiting pupil aperture,which increases the dimension of the convolution from one to three. inparticular we give emphasis to cases when the intensity at the observationplane can be presented as a convolution of an impulse response function and theintensity from an ideal lens.

physics;0608145	fourier optics treatment of classical relativistic electrodynamics	in this paper we couple synchrotron radiation (sr) theory with a branch ofphysical optics, namely laser beam optics. we show that the theory of laserbeams is successful in characterizing radiation fields associated with any srsource. both radiation beam generated by an ultra-relativistic electron in amagnetic device and laser beam are solutions of the wave equation based onparaxial approximation. it follows that they are similar in all aspects. in thespace-frequency domain sr beams appear as laser beams whose transverse extentsare large compared with the wavelength. in practical situations (e.g.undulator, bending magnet sources), radiation beams exhibit a virtual "waist"where the wavefront is often plane. remarkably, the field distribution of a srbeam across the waist turns out to be strictly related with the inverse fouriertransform of the far-field angle distribution. then, we take advantage ofstandard fourier optics techniques and apply the fresnel propagation formula tocharacterize the sr beam. altogether, we show that it is possible toreconstruct the near-field distribution of the sr beam outside the magneticsetup from the knowledge of the far-field pattern. the general theory of sr inthe near-zone developed in this paper is illustrated for the special cases ofundulator radiation, edge radiation and transition undulator radiation. usingknown analytical formulas for the far-field pattern and its inverse fouriertransform we find analytical expressions for near-field distributions in termsof far-field distributions. finally, we compare these expressions withincorrect or incomplete literature.

1003.2548	scheme for generation of highly monochromatic x-rays from a baseline  xfel undulator	one goal of xfel facilities is the production of narrow bandwidth x-rayradiation. the self-seeding scheme was proposed to obtain a bandwidth narrowerthan that achievable with conventional x-ray sase fels. a self-seeded fel iscomposed of two undulators separated by a monochromator and an electron beambypass that must compensate for the path delay of x-rays in the monochromator.this leads to a long bypass, with a length in the order of 40-60 m, whichrequires modifications of the baseline undulator configuration. as an attemptto get around this obstacle, together with a study of the self-seeding schemefor the european xfel, here we propose a novel technique based on a pulsedoubler concept. using a crystal monochromator installed within a shortmagnetic chicane in the baseline undulator, it is possible to decrease thebandwidth of the radiation well beyond the xfel design down to 10^(-5). themagnetic chicane can be installed without any perturbation of the xfel focusingstructure, and does not interfere with the baseline mode of operation. wepresent a feasibility study and we make exemplifications with the parameters ofthe sase2 line of the european xfel.

1012.5154	circular polarization control for the lcls baseline in the soft x-ray  regime	the lcls baseline includes a planar undulator system, producing linearlypolarized light in the range 0.15-1.5 nm. polarization control in the softx-ray region from linear to circular is highly desirable. several schemes usinghelical undulators have been discussed for the lcls. one consists in replacingthree of the last planar undulator segments by apple iii. a second proposal,the 2nd harmonic helical afterburner, uses short, crossed undulators tuned tothe second harmonic. this last scheme is expected to be the better one. itsadvantages are a high and stable degree of circular polarization and a lowcost. its disadvantage is a small output power and a narrow wavelength range.we propose a novel method to generate 10 gw level power at the fundamentalharmonic with 99% degree of circular polarization from the lcls baseline. itsmerits are low cost, simplicity and easy implementation. after the baselineundulator, the electron beam is sent through a 40 m long straight section, andsubsequently passes through a short apple ii radiator. the microbunch structureis easily preserved, and intense coherent radiation is emitted in the helicalradiator. the background radiation from the baseline undulator is suppressed byletting radiation and electrons through horizontal and vertical slits upstreamthe helical radiator, where the radiation spot size is about ten times largerthan the electron bunch transverse size. using thin beryllium foils for theslits the divergence of the electron beam halo increases by coulomb scattering,but the beam will propagate through the setup without electron losses. theapplicability of our method is not restricted to the lcls baseline setup. lclsii or the european xfel may benefit from this work as well, due to availabilityof sufficiently long free space at the end of undulator tunnel.

1106.1776	circular polarization control for the european xfel in the soft x-ray  regime	the possibility of producing highly circularly polarized x-ray radiation,especially in the soft x-ray region, is an important asset at xfels. however,the baseline of the european xfel, including the soft x-ray sase3 line,foresees planar undulators only. the lowest-risk strategy for implementingpolarization control at sase3 involves adding an apple ii-type undulator at theend of the planar undulator, to exploit the microbunching from the baselinefel. 5m-long apple ii undulators are standard devices at synchrotrons. however,the choice of a short helical radiator leads to the problem of backgroundsuppression. the driving idea of our proposal is that the background radiationcan be suppressed by spatial filtering. slits can be inserted behind the appleii radiator, where the linearly-polarized radiation spot size is about 30 timeslarger than the radiation spot size from the helical radiator. the last 7 cellsof the sase3 undulator are left with an open gap in order to provide a total 42m drift section for electron beam and radiation. the linearly-polarizedradiation spot size increases along the drift, and the linearly polarizedbackground radiation can be suppressed by the slits. at the same time, themicrobunch structure is preserved. 100gw level coherent radiation is emitted inthe helical radiator. the filtering setup consists of a pair of water cooledslits for x-ray beam filtering and of a 5m-long magnetic chicane, creating anoffset for slit installation immediately behind the helical radiator. electronsand x-rays are separated before the slits by the chicane, and the electron beamcan pass by the filtering setup without perturbations. based on start-to-endsimulations we present calculations from the sase3 undulator entrance up to theradiator exit including the modulated electron beam transport by the fodofocusing system in the low charge (20pc) mode of operation.

1108.1085	scheme for generating and transporting thz radiation to the x-ray  experimental floor at the lcls baseline	this paper describes a novel scheme for integrating a coherent thz source inthe baseline of the lcls facility. any method relying on the spent electronbeam downstream of the baseline undulator should provide a way of transportingthe radiation up to the experimental floor. here we propose to use the dumparea access maze. in this way the thz output must propagate with limited sizeat least for one hundred meters in a maze, following many turns, to reach thenear experimental hall. the use of a standard, discrete, open beam-waveguideformed by periodic reflectors, that is a mirror guide, would lead tounacceptable size of the system. to avoid these problems, in this paper wepropose an alternative approach based on periodically spaced metallic screenswith holes. this quasi-optical transmission line is referred to as an irisline. we present complete calculations for the iris line using both analyticaland numerical methods, which we find in good agreement. we present a design ofa thz edge radiation source based on the use of an iris line. the proposedsetup takes almost no cost nor time to be implemented at the lcls baseline, andcan be used at other facilities as well. the edge radiation source is limitedin maximally achievable field strength at the sample. an extension based on theuse of an undulator in the presence of the iris line, which is feasible at thelcls energies, is proposed as a possible upgrade of the baseline thz source.

1109.5112	production of transform-limited x-ray pulses through self-seeding at the  european x-ray fel	an important goal for any advanced x-ray fel is an option for providingfourier-limited x-ray pulses. in this way, no monochromator is needed in theexperimental hall. self-seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrowthe sase bandwidth to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. these areimportant for many experiments including 3d diffraction imaging. we discuss theimplementation of a single-crystal self-seeding scheme in the hard x-ray linesof the european xfel. for this facility, transform-limited pulses areparticularly valuable since they naturally support the extraction of more felpower than at saturation by exploiting tapering in the tunable-gap baselineundulators. tapering consists of a stepwise change of the undulator gap fromsegment to segment. based on start-to-end simulations dealing with theup-to-date parameters of the european xfel, we show that the fel power reachesabout 400 gw, or one order of magnitude higher power than the sase saturationlevel (20 gw). this analysis indicates that our self-seeding scheme is notsignificantly affected by non-ideal electron phase-space distribution, andyields about the same performance as in the case for an electron beam withideal parameters. the self-seeding scheme with a single crystal monochromatoris extremely compact (about 5 m long), and cost estimations are low enough toconsider adding it to the european xfel capabilities from the very beginning ofthe operation phase.

1111.1615	analytical studies of constraints on the performance for eehg fel seed  lasers	laser seeding technique have been envisioned to produce nearlytransform-limited pulses at soft x-ray fels. echo-enabled harmonic generation(eehg) is a promising, recent technique for harmonic generation with anexcellent up-conversion to very high harmonics, from the standpoint of electronbeam physics. this paper explores the constraints on seed laser performance forreaching wavelengths of 1 nm. we show that the main challenge in implementingthe eehg scheme at extreme harmonic factors is the requirement for accuratecontrol of temporal and spatial quality of the seed laser pulse. for example,if the phase of the laser pulse is chirped before conversion to an uv seedpulse, the chirp in the electron beam microbunch turns out to be roughlymultiplied by the harmonic factor. in the case of a ti:sa seed laser, suchfactor is about 800. for such large harmonic numbers, generation of nearlytransform-limited soft x-ray pulses results in challenging constraints on theti:sa laser. in fact, the relative discrepancy of the time-bandwidth product ofthe seed-laser pulse from the ideal transform-limited performance should be nomore than one in a million. the generated electron beam microbunching is alsovery sensitive to distortions of the seed laser wavefront, which are alsomultiplied by the harmonic factor. in order to have minimal reduction of thefel input coupling factor, it is desirable that the size-angular bandwidthproduct of the uv seed laser beam be very close to the ideal i.e.diffraction-limited performance in the waist plane at the middle of themodulator undulator.

1111.5766	extension of self-seeding to hard x-rays &gt;10 kev as a way to increase  user access at the european xfel	we propose to use the self-seeding scheme with single crystal monochromatorat the european x-ray fel to produce monochromatic, high-power radiation at 16kev. based on start to end simulations we show that the fel power of thetransform-limited pulses can reach about 100 gw by exploiting tapering in thetunable-gap baseline undulator. the combination of high photon energy, highpeak power, and very narrow bandwidth opens a vast new range of applications,and includes the possibility to considerably increase the user capacity andfully exploit the high repetition rate of the european xfel. in fact, dealingwith monochromatic hard x-ray radiation one may use crystals as deflectors withminimum beam loss. to this end, a photon beam distribution system based on theuse of crystals in the bragg reflection geometry is proposed for future studyand possible extension of the baseline facility. they can be repeated a numberof times to form an almost complete (one meter scale) ring with an angle of 20degrees between two neighboring lines. the reflectivity of crystal deflectorscan be switched fast enough by flipping the crystals with piezo-electricdevices similar to those for x-ray phase retarders at synchrotron radiationfacilities. it is then possible to distribute monochromatic hard x-rays among10 independent instruments, thereby enabling 10 users to work in parallel. theunmatched repetition rate of the european xfel would be therefore fullyexploited.

1112.3511	scheme for generating and transporting thz radiation to the x-ray  experimental hall at the european xfel	the design of a thz edge radiation source for the european xfel is presented.we consider generation of thz radiation from the spent electron beam downstreamof the sase2 undulator in the electron beam dump area. in this way, the thzoutput must propagate at least for 250 meters through the photon beam tunnel tothe experimental hall to reach the sase2 x-ray hutches. we propose to use anopen beam waveguide such as an iris guide as transmission line. in order toefficiently couple radiation into the iris transmission line, generation of thethz radiation pulse can be performed directly within the iris guide. the linetransporting the thz radiation to the sase2 x-ray hutches introduces a pathdelay of about 20 m. since thz pump/x-ray probe experiments should be enabled,we propose to exploit the european xfel baseline multi-bunch mode of operation,with 222 ns electron bunch separation, in order to cope with the delay betweenthz and x-ray pulses. we present start-to-end simulations for 1 nc bunchoperation-parameters, optimized for thz pump/x-ray probe experiments. detailedcharacterization of the thz and sase x-ray radiation pulses is performed.highly focused thz beams will approach the high field limit of 1 v/atomic size.

1202.0691	on quantum effects in spontaneous emission by a relativistic electron  beam in an undulator	robb and bonifacio (2011) claimed that a previously neglected quantum effectresults in noticeable changes in the evolution of the energy distributionassociated with spontaneous emission in long undulators. they revisitedtheoretical models used to describe the emission of radiation by relativisticelectrons as a continuous diffusive process, and claimed that in the asymptoticlimit for a large number of undulator periods the evolution of the electronenergy distribution occurs as discrete energy groups according to poissondistribution. we show that these novel results have no physical sense, becausethey are based on a one-dimensional model of spontaneous emission and assumethat electrons are sheets of charge. however, electrons are point-likeparticles and, as is well-known, the bandwidth of the angular-integratedspectrum of undulator radiation is independent of the number of undulatorperiods. if we determine the evolution of the energy distribution using athree-dimensional theory we find the well-known results consistent with acontinuous diffusive process. the additional pedagogical purpose of this paperis to review how quantum diffusion of electron energy in an undulator withsmall undulator parameter can be simply analyzed using the thomsoncross-section expression, unlike the conventional treatment based on theexpression for the lienard-wiechert fields.

1205.6345	conceptual design of an undulator system for a dedicated bio-imaging  beamline at the european x-ray fel	we describe a future possible upgrade of the european xfel consisting in theconstruction of an undulator beamline dedicated to life science experiments.the availability of free undulator tunnels at the european xfel facility offersa unique opportunity to build a beamline optimized for coherent diffractionimaging of complex molecules, like proteins and other biologically interestingstructures. crucial parameters for such bio-imaging beamline are photon energyrange, peak power, and pulse duration. key component of the setup is theundulator source. the peak power is maximized in the photon energy rangebetween 3 kev and 13 kev by the use of a very efficient combination ofself-seeding, fresh bunch and tapered undulator techniques. the uniquecombination of ultra-high peak power of 1 tw in the entire energy range, andultrashort pulse duration tunable from 2 fs to 10 fs, would allow for singleshot coherent imaging of protein molecules with size larger than 10 nm. also,the new beamline would enable imaging of large biological structures in thewater window, between 0.3 kev and 0.4 kev. in order to make use of standardizedcomponents, at present we favor the use of sase3-type undulator segments. thenumber segments, 40, is determined by the tapered length for the design outputpower of 1 tw. the present plan assumes the use of a nominal electron bunchwith charge of 0.1 nc. experiments will be performed without interference withthe other three undulator beamlines. therefore, the total amount of scheduledbeam time per year is expected to be up to 4000 hours.

1209.5972	optimization of a dedicated bio-imaging beamline at the european x-ray  fel	we recently proposed a basic concept for design and layout of the undulatorsource for a dedicated bio-imaging beamline at the european xfel. the goal ofthe optimized scheme proposed here is to enable experimental simplification andperformance improvement. the core of the scheme is composed by soft and hardx-ray self-seeding setups. based on the use of an improved design for bothmonochromators it is possible to increase the design electron energy up to 17.5gev in photon energy range between 2 kev and 13 kev, which is the mostpreferable for life science experiments. an advantage of operating at such highelectron energy is the increase of the x-ray output peak power. anotheradvantage is that 17.5 gev is the preferred operation energy for sase1 andsase2 beamline users. since it will be necessary to run all the xfel lines atthe same electron energy, this choice will reduce the interference with otherundulator lines and increase the total amount of scheduled beam time. in thiswork we also propose a study of the performance of the self-seeding schemeaccounting for spatiotemporal coupling caused by the use of a single crystalmonochromator. our analysis indicates that this distortion is easily suppressedby the right choice of diamond crystal planes and that the proposed undulatorsource yields about the same performance as in the case for a x-ray seed pulsewith no coupling. simulations show that the fel power reaches 2 tw in the 3 kev- 5 kev photon energy range, which is the most preferable for singlebiomolecule imaging.

0712.1710	a simple method for timing an xfel source to high-power lasers	we propose a technique, to be used for time-resolved pump-probe experiments,for timing an x-ray free electron laser (xfel) to a high-power conventionallaser with femtosecond accuracy. our method takes advantage of the sameelectron bunch to produce both an xfel pulse and an ultrashort optical pulsewith the help of an optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. sinceboth pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectlysynchronized. application of cross-correlation techniques will allow todetermine relative jitter between the optical pulse (and, thus, the xfel pulse)and a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. technicalrealization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer(ors) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of thexfel. the electron bunch is modulated in the ors setup by an external opticallaser. subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces thexfel pulse. finally, a powerful optical pulse of coherent edge radiation isgenerated as the bunch passes through a long straight section and a separationmagnet downstream of the main undulator. our study shows that at a moderate(about 10%) density modulation of the electron bunch at the location of theoptical radiator allows production of high power x-ray and optical pulses.relative synchronization of these pulses is preserved by using the samemechanical support for both x-ray and optical elements transporting radiationdown to the experimental area, where single-shot cross-correlation betweenoptical pulse and pump-laser pulse is performed. we illustrate the potential ofthe proposed timing technique with numerical examples referring to the europeanxfel facility.

1303.1392	grating monochromator for soft x-ray self-seeding the european xfel	self-seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow the sasebandwidth of xfels to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. theimplementation of this method in the soft x-ray wavelength range necessarilyinvolves gratings as dispersive elements. we study a very compact self-seedingscheme with a grating monochromator originally designed at slac, which can bestraightforwardly installed in the sase3 type undulator beamline at theeuropean xfel. the monochromator design is based on a toroidal vls gratingworking at a fixed incidence angle mounting without entrance slit. it coversthe spectral range from 300 ev to 1000 ev. the optical system was studied usingwave optics method (in comparison with ray tracing) to evaluate the performanceof the self-seeding scheme. our wave optics analysis takes into account theactual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent fel source, thirdorder aberrations, and errors from each optical element. wave optics is theonly method available, in combination with fel simulations, for the design of aself-seeding monochromator without exit slit. we show that, without exit slit,the self-seeding scheme is distinguished by the much needed experimentalsimplicity, and can practically give the same resolving power (about 7000) aswith an exit slit. wave optics is also naturally applicable to calculations ofthe self-seeding scheme efficiency, which include the monochromatortransmittance and the effect of the mismatching between seed beam and electronbeam. simulations show that the fel power reaches 1 tw and that the spectraldensity for a tw pulse is about two orders of magnitude higher than that forthe sase pulse at saturation.

1306.4830	extension of sase bandwidth up to 2% as a way to increase the efficiency  of protein structure determination by x-ray nanocrystallography at the  european xfel	femtosecond x-ray nanocrystallography exploiting xfel radiation is anemerging method for protein structure determination using crystals with sizesranging from a few tens to a few hundreds nanometers. crystals are randomly hitby xfel pulses, producing diffraction patterns at unknown orientations. one candetermine these orientations by studying the diffraction patterns themselves,i.e. by indexing the bragg peaks. the number of indexed individual images andthe sase bandwidth are inherently linked, because increasing the number ofbragg peaks per individual image requires increasing the bandwidth of thespectrum. this calls for a few percent sase bandwidth, resulting in an increasein the number of indexed images at the same number of hits. based onstart-to-end simulations for the baseline of the european xfel, we demonstratehere that it is possible to achieve up to a tenfold increase in sase bandwidth,compared with the nominal mode of operation. this provides a route for furtherincreasing the efficiency of protein structure determination at the europeanxfel. we illustrate this concept with simulations of lysozyme nanocrystals.

0801.4523	transverse coherence properties of x-ray beams in third-generation  synchrotron radiation sources	this article describes a complete theory of spatial coherence for undulatorradiation sources. current estimations of coherence properties often assumethat undulator sources are quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely onthe application of the van cittert-zernike theorem for calculating the degreeof transverse coherence. such assumption is not adequate when treating thirdgeneration light sources, because the vertical(geometrical) emittance of theelectron beam is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelengthin a very wide spectral interval that spans over four orders of magnitude (from0.1 angstrom up to 10^3 angstrom). sometimes, the so-called gaussian-schellmodel, that is widely used in statistical optics in the description ofpartially-coherent sources, is applied as an alternative to thequasi-homogeneous model. however, as we will demonstrate, this model fails toproperly describe coherent properties of x-ray beams from non-homogeneousundulator sources. as a result, a more rigorous analysis is required. wepropose a technique, based on statistical optics and fourier optics, toexplicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source in themost general case, at any position after the undulator. our theory, that makesconsistent use of dimensionless analysis, allows relatively easy treatment andphysical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together withtheir region of applicability. particular emphasis is given to the asymptoticsituation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiationwavelength, and the vertical emittance is arbitrary. this case is practicallyrelevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources.

1407.4591	brightness of synchrotron radiation from undulators and bending magnets	we consider the maximum of the wigner distribution (wd) of synchrotronradiation (sr) fields as a possible definition of sr source brightness. suchfigure of merit was originally introduced in the sr community by kim. thebrightness defined in this way is always positive and, in the geometricaloptics limit, can be interpreted as maximum density of photon flux in phasespace. for undulator and bending magnet radiation from a single electron, thewd function can be explicitly calculated. in the case of an electron beam witha finite emittance the brightness is given by the maximum of the convolution ofa single electron wd function and the probability distribution of the electronsin phase space. in the particular case when both electron beam size andelectron beam divergence dominate over the diffraction size and the diffractionangle, one can use a geometrical optics approach. however, there areintermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beamdivergence dominate. in this asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approachis still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back oncemore the maximum photon flux density in phase space. in these intermediateregimes we find a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculationsand the approximation for undulator brightness currently used in literature. weextend the wd formalism to a satisfactory theory for the brightness of abending magnet. we find that in the intermediate regimes the usually acceptedapproximation for bending magnet brightness turns out to be inconsistent evenparametrically.

1412.2648	brightness of synchrotron radiation from wigglers	according to literature, while calculating the brightness of synchrotronradiation from wigglers, one needs to account for the so called`depth-of-field' effects. in fact, the particle beam cross section varies alongthe wiggler. it is usually stated that the effective photon source sizeincreases accordingly, while the brightness is reduced. here we claim that thisis a misconception originating from an analysis of the wiggler source based ongeometrical arguments, regarded as almost self-evident. according toelectrodynamics, depth-of-field effects do not exist: we demonstrate thisstatement both theoretically and numerically, using a well-knownfirst-principle computer code. this fact shows that under the usually acceptedapproximations, the description of the wiggler brightness turns out to beinconsistent even qualitatively. therefore, there is a need for a well-definedprocedure for computing the brightness from a wiggler source. we accomplishthis task based on the use of a wigner function formalism. in the geometricaloptics limit computations can be performed analytically. within this limit, werestrict ourselves to the case of the beam size-dominated regime, which istypical for synchrotron radiation facilities in the x-ray wavelength range. wegive a direct demonstration of the fact that the apparent horizontal sourcesize is broadened in proportion to the beamline opening angle and to the lengthof the wiggler. while this effect is well-understood, a direct proof appearsnot to have been given elsewhere. we consider the problem of the calculation ofthe wiggler source size by means of numerical simulations alone, which play thesame role of an experiment. we report a significant numerical disagreementbetween exact calculations and approximations currently used in literature.

1508.04339	scheme to increase the output average spectral flux of the european xfel  at $14.4$ kev	techniques like inelastic x-ray scattering (ixs) and nuclear resonancescattering (nrs) are currently limited by the photon flux available at x-raysources. at $14.4$ kev, third generation synchrotron radiation sources producea maximum of $10^{10}$ photons per second in a mev bandwidth. in this work wediscuss about the possibility of increasing this flux a thousand-fold byexploiting high repetition rate self-seeded pulses at the european xfel. herewe report on a feasibility study for an optimized configuration of the sase2beamline at the european xfel which combines self-seeding and undulatortapering techniques in order to increase the average spectral flux at $14.4$kev. in particular, we propose to perform monochromatization at $7.2$ kev withthe help of self-seeding, and amplify the seed in the first part of outputundulator. the amplification process can be stopped at a position well beforesaturation, where the electron beam gets considerable bunching at the 2ndharmonic of the coherent radiation. a second part of the output undulatorfollows, tuned to the 2nd harmonic frequency, i.e. at $14.4$ kev and is used toobtain saturation at this energy. one can further prolong the exchange ofenergy between the photon and the electron beam by tapering the last part ofthe output undulator. we performed start-to-end simulations and demonstratethat self-seeding, combined with undulator tapering, allows one to achieve morethan a hundred-fold increase in average spectral flux compared with the nominalsase regime at saturation, resulting in a maximum flux of order $10^{13}$photons per second in a mev bandwidth.

1511.01375	effect of aberration of light in x-ray free electron lasers	we discuss the physics of a microbunched electron beam kicked by the dipolefield of a corrector magnet by describing the kinematics of coherent undulatorradiation after the kick. particle tracking shows that the electron beamdirection changes after the kick, while the orientation of the microbunchingwavefront stays unvaried. therefore, electrons motion and wavefront normal havedifferent directions. coherent radiation emission in a downstream undulator isexpected to be dramatically suppressed as soon as the kick angle becomes largerthan the divergence of the output radiation. in fact, according to conventionaltreatments, coherent radiation is emitted along the normal to the microbunchingwavefront. here we show that kinematics predicts a surprising effect. namely, adescription of coherent undulator radiation in the laboratory frame yields theradical notion that, due light aberration, strong coherent radiation isproduced along the direction of the kick. we hold a recent fel study made atthe lcls as a direct experimental evidence that coherent undulator radiationcan be kicked by an angle of about five times the rms radiation divergencewithout suppression. we put forward our kinematical description of thisexperiment.

1512.01056	modulated electron bunch with amplitude front tilt in an undulator	in a previous paper we discussed the physics of a microbunched electron beamkicked by the dipole field of a corrector magnet by describing the kinematicsof coherent undulator radiation after the kick. we demonstrated that the effectof aberration of light supplies the basis for understanding phenomena like thedeflection of coherent undulator radiation by a dipole magnet. we illustratedthis fact by examining the operation of an xfel under the steady stateassumption, that is a harmonic time dependence. we argued that in thisparticular case the microbunch front tilt has no objective meaning; in otherwords, there is no experiment that can discriminate whether an electron beam isendowed with a microbunch front tilt of not. in this paper we extend ourconsiderations to time-dependent phenomena related with a finite electron bunchduration, or sase mode of operation. we focus our attention on thespatiotemporal distortions of an x-ray pulse. spatiotemporal coupling arisesnaturally in coherent undulator radiation behind the kick, because thedeflection process involves the introduction of a tilt of the bunch profile.this tilt of the bunch profile leads to radiation pulse front tilt, which isequivalent to angular dispersion of the output radiation. we remark that ourexact results can potentially be useful to developers of new generation xfelcodes for cross-checking their results.

0808.1846	theory of edge radiation	we formulate a complete theory of edge radiation based on a novel methodrelying on fourier optics techniques. similar types of radiation liketransition undulator radiation are addressed in the framework of the sameformalism. special attention is payed in discussing the validity ofapproximations upon which the theory is built. our study makes consistent useof both similarity techniques and comparisons with numerical results fromsimulation. we discuss both near and far zone. physical understanding of manyasymptotes is discussed. based on the solution of the field equation with atensor green's function technique, we also discuss an analytical model todescribe the presence of a vacuum chamber. in particular, explicit calculationsfor a circular vacuum chamber are reported. finally, we consider the use ofedge radiation as a tool for electron beam diagnostics. we discuss coherentedge radiation, extraction of edge radiation by a mirror, and other issuesbecoming important at high electron energy and long radiation wavelength. basedon this work we also study the impact of edge radiation on xfel setups and wediscuss recent results.
