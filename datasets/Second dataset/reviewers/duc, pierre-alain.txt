0903.0999	molecular gas in tidal dwarf galaxies: exploring the conditions for star  formation	tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs), produced from material expelled in galacticinteractions, are well--suited to test the laws of star formation (sf) due totheir simple structure, high metallicity -- making co a reliable tracer of themolecular gas content -- and recent sf. here, we study the conditions for theonset of sf and for the rate at which sf proceeds once above a threshold in asmall sample of tdgs. we use data for the gas (atomic and molecular) surfacedensity and sf rate per area to test the laws of sf found for spiral and dwarfgalaxies in this more extreme environment. we find in general a good agreementwith the schmidt law found for the total gas and for the molecular gas but notethat higher resolution co observations are necessary to clarify some possiblediscrepancies. we find, down to a scale of $\sim$1 kpc, in general a goodagreement between the peaks of sf and of the molecular gas, but also find insome objects surprisingly large quantities of molecular gas at places where nosf is occuring. a high column density of molecular gas is therefore not asufficient condition for the onset of sf. we find that the kinematicalproperties of the gas are also relevant: in two objects our observations showedthat sf only occured in regions with a narrow line width.

0707.3991	tidal debris posing as dark galaxies	debris sent into the intergalactic medium during tidal collisions can tell usabout several fundamental properties of galaxies, in particular their missingmass, both in the form of cosmological dark matter and so-called lost baryons.high velocity encounters, which are common in clusters of galaxies, are able toproduce faint tidal debris that may appear as star-less, free floating hiclouds. these may be mistaken for dark galaxies, a putative class of gaseous,dark matter dominated, objects which for some reason never managed to formstars. virgohi21 is by far the most spectacular and most discussed dark galaxycandidate so far detected in hi surveys. we show here that it is most likelymade out of material expelled 750 myr ago from the nearby spiral galaxy ngc4254 during its fly--by at about 1000 km/s by a massive intruder. our numericalmodel of the collision is able to reproduce the main characteristics of thesystem: in particular the absence of stars, and its prominent velocitygradient. originally attributed to the gas being in rotation within a massivedark matter halo, we find it instead to be consistent with a combination ofsimple streaming motion plus projection effects (duc &amp; bournaud, 2007). wediscuss several ways to identify a tidal origin in a dark galaxy candidate andillustrate the method using another hi system in virgo, vcc 2062, which is mostlikely a tidal dwarf galaxy (duc et al., 2007). now, whereas tidal debrisshould not contain any dark matter from the halo of their parent galaxies, itmay exhibit missing mass in the form of dark baryons, unaccounted for byclassical observations, as recently found in the collisional ring of ngc 5291(bournaud et al., 2007) and probably in the tdg vcc 2062. these "lost baryons"must originally have been located in the disks of their parent galaxies.

1005.4208	a collisional origin for the leo ring	extended hi structures around galaxies are of prime importance to probegalaxy formation scenarios. the giant hi ring in the leo group is one of thelargest and most intriguing hi structures in the nearby universe. whether itconsists of primordial gas, as suggested by the apparent absence of any opticalcounterpart and the absence of an obvious physical connection to nearbygalaxies, or of gas expelled from a galaxy in a collision is actively debated.we present deep wide field-of-view optical images of the ring region obtainedwith megacam on the cfht. they reveal optical counterparts to several hi and uvcondensations along the ring, in the g', r', and i' bands, which likelycorrespond to stellar associations formed within the gaseous ring. analyzingthe spectral energy distribution of one of these star-forming regions, we foundit to be typical for a star-forming region in pre-enriched tidal debris. wethen use simulations to test the hypothesis that the leo ring results from ahead-on collision between leo group members ngc 3384 and m96. according to ourmodel which is able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main observationalproperties of the system, the leo ring is consistent with being a collisionalring. it is thus likely another example of extended intergalactic gas made-upof pre-enriched collisional debris.

1006.4782	hydrodynamics of high-redshift galaxy collisions: from gas-rich disks to  dispersion-dominated mergers and compact spheroids	disk galaxies at high redshift (z~2) are characterized by high fractions ofcold gas, strong turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. major mergers ofdisk galaxies at high redshift should then generally involve such turbulentclumpy disks. merger simulations, however, model the ism as a stable,homogeneous, and thermally pressurized medium. we present the first mergersimulations with high fractions of cold, turbulent, and clumpy gas. we discussthe major new features of these models compared to models where the gas isartificially stabilized and warmed. gas turbulence, which is already strong inhigh-redshift disks, is further enhanced in mergers. some phases aredispersion-dominated, with most of the gas kinetic energy in the form ofvelocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger modelsusing a thermally stabilized gas. these mergers can reach very high starformation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent withsubmillimeter galaxies. major mergers with high fractions of cold turbulent gasare also characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to the center ofmass, with the stellar component following in a global contraction. the finalgalaxies are early-type with relatively small radii and high sersic indices,like high-redshift compact spheroids. the mass fraction in a disk componentthat survives or re-forms after a merger is severely reduced compared to modelswith stabilized gas, and the formation of a massive disk component wouldrequire significant accretion of external baryons afterwards. mergers thusappear to destroy extended disks even when the gas fraction is high, and thislends further support to smooth infall as the main formation mechanism formassive disk galaxies.

0709.2733	vcc 2062: an old tidal dwarf galaxy in the virgo cluster?	numerical simulations predict the existence of old tidal dwarf galaxies(tdgs) that would have survived several gyr after the collision lying at theirorigin. such survivors, which would by now have become independent relaxedgalaxies, would be ideal laboratories, if nearby enough, to tackle a number oftopical issues, including the distribution of dark matter in and aroundgalaxies. however finding old dwarf galaxies with a confirmed tidal origin isan observational challenge. a dwarf galaxy in the virgo cluster, vcc 2062,exhibits several unusual properties that are typical of a galaxy made out ofrecycled material. we discuss whether it may indeed be a tdg. we analysedmulti-wavelength observations of vcc 2062, including an iram co map, an opticalspectrum of its hii regions, galex ultraviolet and archival broad-band andnarrow-band optical images as well as a vla hi datacube, originally obtained aspart of the viva project. vcc 2062 appears to be the optical, low surfacebrightness counterpart of a kinematically detached, rotating condensation thatformed within an hi tail apparently physically linked to the disturbed galaxyngc 4694. in contrast to its faint optical luminosity, vcc 2062 ischaracterised by strong co emission and a high oxygen abundance more typical ofspiral disks. its dynamical mass however, is that of a dwarf galaxy. vcc 2062was most likely formed within a pre-enriched gaseous structure expelled from alarger galaxy as a result of a tidal interaction. the natural provider for thegaseous tail is ngc 4694 or rather a former companion which subsequently hasbeen accreted by the massive galaxy. according to that scenario, vcc 2062 hasbeen formed by a past tidal encounter. since its parent galaxies have mostprobably already totally merged, it qualifies as an old tdg.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1105.4076	the atlas3d project - vi. simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the  link with fast rotators, slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies through mergers with a sampleof 70 high-resolution (softening length &lt; 60 pc and 12*10^6 particles)numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies and 16 simulations ofetg remergers. these simulations, designed to accompany observations and modelsconducted within the atlas3d project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. the progenitor discgalaxies are spiral-like with bulge to disc ratios typical of sb and scgalaxies. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the atlas3dcriterion (based on the lambda_r parameter): they preserve the structure of theinput fast rotating spiral progenitors. they have intrinsic ellipticitieslarger than 0.5, cover intrinsic lambda_r values between 0.2 and 0.6, withinthe range of observed fast rotators. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the fast rotators produced inmajor mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities between 0.4 and0.6. most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. besides a handful ofspecific observed systems -- the counter-rotating discs (2-sigma galaxies) --these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators inthe nearby universe. the mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamentalparameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but italso requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (sb) progenitor galaxywith respect to the orbital angular momentum.

1107.0002	the atlas3d project - x. on the origin of the molecular and ionised gas  in early-type galaxies	we make use of interferometric co and hi observations, and opticalintegral-field spectroscopy to probe the origin of the molecular and ionisedinterstellar medium (ism) in local early-type galaxies (etgs). we find that36\pm5% of our sample of fast rotating etgs have their ionised gaskinematically misaligned with respect to the stars, setting a strong lowerlimit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and coldaccretion). slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicatingthat the dominant source of gas is external. the molecular, ionised and atomicgas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even whenthey are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases ofthe ism share a common origin. in addition, we find that the origin of the coldand warm gas in fast-rotating etgs is strongly affected by environment, despitethe molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent ofgroup/cluster membership. galaxies in dense groups and the virgo cluster nearlyalways have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellarkinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin. in the field, however,kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicatethat &gt;46% of local fast-rotating etgs have their gas supplied from externalsources. we discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmentaldichotomy, but find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematicmisalignment difference and the constant detection rate. furthermore, ourresults suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factorassociated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotatinggalaxies in our sample (m_k&lt;-24 mag; stellar mass of &gt;8x10^10 msun) alwayshaving kinematically aligned gas.

1107.1777	characterization of optically-selected star forming knots in (u)lirgs	(abridged)we present a comprehensive characterization of the generalproperties (luminosity functions, mass, size, ages, etc) of optically selectedcompact stellar objects (knots) in a representative sample of 32 low-z(u)lirgs. we use acs images from the hubble space telescope in f435w and f814wbands. the galaxies in the sample represent different interaction phases andcover a wide luminosity range (11.46 \leq log (l_ir (lsun)) \leq 12.54). with amedian size of 32 pc, most of the nearly 3000 knots detected consists ofcomplexes of star clusters. some of the knots (~15%) are so blue that theircolors indicate a young (i.e., &lt; 30 myr) and almost extinction-free population.there is a clear correlation of the mass of these blue knots with their radius,m \propto r^{1.91\pm0.14}, similar to that found in complexes of clusters inm51 and in giant molecular clouds. this suggests that the star formation withinthe knots is proportional to the gas density at any given radius. the starformation of all the knots is characterized by luminosity functions (lfs) ofthe knots with slopes close to 2. though, we see a marginally significantindication that the lf evolves with the interaction process, becoming steeperfrom early to advanced merger phases. due to size-of-sample effects we areprobably sampling knots in ulirgs intrinsically more luminous (x4) than in lessluminous systems. they also have sizes and are likely to have massescharacteristic of clumps in galaxies at z \gtrsim 1. knots in post-mergers areon average larger (x 1.3-2), more luminous (2 mag) in the i-band, and 0.5 magredder than those in systems in earlier phases. two scenarios are brieflydiscussed: (1) the likely presence of relatively high extinction in the mostadvanced mergers; (2) the dissolution of the less massive clusters and/or theircoalescence into more massive, evolved superclusters.

0710.0668	visible and invisible molecular gas in collisional debris of galaxies	molecular gas has been searched for and found in unexpectedly largequantities in some collisional debris of interacting galaxies: hi-rich tidaltails, bridges and collisional rings. it was so far observed through millimeterobservations of the co line and detected towards or near regions ofstar-formation associated to dense condensations of the atomic hydrogen. thediscovery of cool h2 at distances greater than 50 kpc from the parent(colliding) galaxies, whereas the external disk of spirals is generallyconsidered to be co-poor, raised question on its origin and favored thehypothesis of a local production out of collapsed hi clouds. however recentobservations of a diffuse co component along tidal debris have challenged thisidea. another recent puzzle is the measurement in the collisional debris of twointeracting systems and four recycled objects of a missing mass, whereas nodark matter is expected there. one debated interpretation is that this unseencomponent is cold, "invisible" molecular gas initially present in the disk ofspirals.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1111.0987	an observed link between active galactic nuclei and violent disk  instabilities in high-redshift galaxies	we provide evidence for a correlation between the presence of giant clumpsand the occurrence of active galactic nuclei (agn) in disk galaxies. giantclumps of 10^8-9 msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-richgalaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feedsupermassive black holes (bh). we use emission line diagnostics to compare asample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disksat redshift z~0.7. the majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a highprobability of containing agn. their [oiii] emission line is strongly excited,inconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [neiii] excitation isalso higher. stable disks rarely have such properties. stacking ultra sensitivechandra observations (4 ms) reveals an x-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, whichcannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of agn. theclumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical ofgas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the mainsequence of star formation. this suggests that our findings apply to thephysically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z&gt;1. using theobserved [oiii] and x-ray luminosities, we conservatively estimate that agnhosted by clumpy disks have typical bolometric luminosities of the order of afew 10^43 erg/s, bh growth rates ~10^-2 msun/yr, and that these agn aresubstantially obscured in x-rays. this moderate-luminosity mode could besufficient to provide a large fraction of today's bh mass over a couple of gyrgiven that our observations suggest a high duty cycle (&gt;10%), accretion burstswith higher luminosities being possible over shorter phases. the observedevolution of disk instabilities with mass and redshift could explain thesimultaneous downsizing of star formation and of bh growth.

1112.1922	tides in colliding galaxies	long tails and streams of stars are the most noticeable upshots of galaxycollisions. their origin as gravitational, tidal, disturbances has however beenrecognized only less than fifty years ago and more than ten years after theirfirst observations. this review describes how the idea of galactic tidesemerged, in particular thanks to the advances in numerical simulations, fromthe first ones that included tens of particles to the most sophisticated oneswith tens of millions of them and state-of-the-art hydrodynamicalprescriptions. theoretical aspects pertaining to the formation of tidal tailsare then presented. the third part of the review turns to observations andunderlines the need for collecting deep multi-wavelength data to tackle thevariety of physical processes exhibited by collisional debris. tidal tails arenot just stellar structures, but turn out to contain all the components usuallyfound in galactic disks, in particular atomic / molecular gas and dust. theyhost star-forming complexes and are able to form star-clusters or evensecond-generation dwarf galaxies. the final part of the review discusses whattidal tails can tell us (or not) about the structure and content of present-daygalaxies, including their dark components, and explains how tidal tails may beused to probe the past evolution of galaxies and their mass assembly history.on-going deep wide-field surveys disclose many new low-surface brightnessstructures in the nearby universe, offering great opportunities for attemptinggalactic archeology with tidal tails.

0710.3867	tidal debris from high-velocity collisions as fake dark galaxies: a  numerical model of virgohi21	high speed collisions, although current in clusters of galaxies, have longbeen neglected, as they are believed to cause little damages to galaxies,except when they are repeated, a process called harassment. in fact, they areable to produce faint but extended gaseous tails. such low-mass, starless,tidal debris may become detached and appear as free floating clouds in the verydeep hi surveys that are currently being carried out. we show in this paperthat these debris possess the same apparent properties as the so-called "darkgalaxies", objects originally detected in hi, with no optical counterpart, andpresumably dark matter dominated. we present a numerical model of the prototypeof such dark galaxies - virgohi21 -, that is able to reproduce its maincharacteristics: the one-sided tail linking it to the spiral galaxy ngc 4254,the absence of stars, and above all the reversal of the velocity gradient alongthe tail originally attributed to rotation motions caused by a massive darkmatter halo and which we find to be consistent with simple streaming motionsplus projection effects. according to our numerical simulations, this tidaldebris was expelled 750 myr ago during a fly-by at 1100 km/s of ngc 4254 by amassive companion which should now lie at a projected distance of about 400kpc. a candidate for the intruder is discussed. the existence of galaxies thathave never been able to form stars had already been challenged based ontheoretical and observational grounds. tidal collisions, in particular thoseoccurring at high speed, provide a much more simple explanation for the originof such putative dark galaxies.

1202.2862	turbulent molecular gas and star formation in the shocked intergalactic  medium of stephan's quintet	we report on single-dish radio co observations towards the inter-galacticmedium (igm) of the stephan's quintet (sq) group of galaxies. extremely brightmid-ir h2 rotational line emission from warm molecular gas has been detected byspitzer in the kpc-scale shock created by a galaxy collision. we detect in theigm co(1-0), (2-1) and (3-2) line emission with complex profiles, spanning avelocity range of 1000 km/s. the spectra exhibit the pre-shock recessionvelocities of the two colliding gas systems (5700 and 6700 km/s), but alsointermediate velocities. this shows that much of the molecular gas has formedout of diffuse gas accelerated by the galaxy-tidal arm collision. a total h2mass of 5x10^9 msun is detected in the shock. the molecular gas carries a largefraction of the gas kinetic energy involved in the collision, meaning that thisenergy has not been thermalized yet. the turbulent kinetic energy of the h2 gasis at least a factor of 5 greater than the thermal energy of the hot plasmaheated by the collision. the ratio between the warm h2 mass derived fromspitzer irs spectroscopy and the h2 mass derived from co fluxes is ~0.3 in theigm of sq, which is 10-100 times higher than in star-forming galaxies. in theshocked region, the ratio of the pah-to-co surface luminosities, commonly usedto measure the star formation efficiency of the h2 gas, is lower (up to afactor 75) than the observed values in star-forming galaxies. we suggest thatturbulence fed by the galaxy-tidal arm collision maintains a high heating ratewithin the h2 gas. this interpretation implies that the velocity dispersion onthe scale of giant molecular clouds in sq is one order of magnitude larger thanthe galactic value. the high amplitude of turbulence may explain why this gasis not forming stars efficiently.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1207.5799	gemini gmos and wht sauron integral-field spectrograph observations of  the agn driven outflow in ngc 1266	we use the sauron and gmos integral field spectrographs to observe the activegalactic nucleus (agn) powered outflow in ngc 1266. this unusual galaxy isrelatively nearby (d=30 mpc), allowing us to investigate the process of agnfeedback in action. we present maps of the kinematics and line strengths of theionised gas emission lines halpha, hbeta, [oiii], [oi], [nii] and [sii], andreport on the detection of sodium d absorption. we use these tracers to explorethe structure of the source, derive the ionised and atomic gas kinematics andinvestigate the gas excitation and physical conditions. ngc 1266 contains twoionised gas components along most lines of sight, tracing the ongoing outflowand a component closer to the galaxy systemic, the origin of which is unclear.this gas appears to be disturbed by a nascent agn jet. we confirm that theoutflow in ngc 1266 is truly multiphase, containing radio plasma, atomic,molecular and ionised gas and x-ray emitting plasma. the outflow has velocitiesup to \pm900 km/s away from the systemic velocity, and is very likely to beremoving significant amounts of cold gas from the galaxy. the liner-likeline-emission in ngc 1266 is extended, and likely arises from fast shockscaused by the interaction of the radio jet with the ism. these shocks havevelocities of up to 800 km/s, which match well with the observed velocity ofthe outflow. sodium d equivalent width profiles are used to set constraints onthe size and orientation of the outflow. the ionised gas morphology correlateswith the nascent radio jets observed in 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz continuum emission,supporting the suggestion that an agn jet is providing the energy required todrive the outflow.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.4345	probing the star-formation modes in merging galaxies	merging systems at low redshift provide the unique opportunity to study theprocesses related to star formation in a variety of environments thatpresumably resemble those seen at higher redshifts. previous studies of distantstarbursting galaxies suggest that stars are born in turbulent gas, with ahigher efficiency than in mw-like spirals. we have investigated in detail theturbulent-driven regime of star-formation in nearby colliding galaxiescombining high resolution vla b array hi maps and uv galex observations. withthese data, we could check predictions of our state-of-the-art simulations ofmergers, such as the global sharp increase of the fraction of dense gas, astraced by the sfr, with respect to the diffuse gas traced by hi during themerging stage, following the increased velocity dispersion of the gas. wepresent here initial results obtained studying the sfr-hi relation at 4.5 kpcresolution. we determined sfr/hi mass ratios that are higher in the externalregions of mergers than in the outskirts of isolated spirals, though bothenvironments are hi dominated. sfr/hi increases towards the central regionsfollowing the decrease of the atomic gas fraction and possibly the increasedstar-formation efficiency. these results need to be checked with a largersample of systems and on smaller spatial scales. this is the goal of theon-going chaotic things project that ultimately will allow us to determine whystarbursting galaxies deviate from the kennicutt-schmidt relation between sfrdensity and gas surface density.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.1011	the atlas3d project - xiv. the extent and kinematics of molecular gas in  early-type galaxies	we use interferometric co observations to compare the extent, surfacebrightness profiles and kinematics of the molecular gas in co-rich atlas3dearly-type galaxies (etgs) and spiral galaxies. we find that the molecular gasextent is smaller in absolute terms in etgs than in late-type galaxies, butthat the size distributions are similar once scaled by the galaxiesoptical/stellar characteristic scale-lengths. virgo cluster etgs have lessextended molecular gas reservoirs than field counterparts. approximately halfof etgs have molecular gas surface brightness profiles that follow the stellarlight profile. these systems often have relaxed gas out to large radii,suggesting they are unlikely to have had recent merger/accretion events. athird of the sample galaxies show molecular gas surface brightness profilesthat fall off slower than the light, and sometimes show a truncation. wesuggest that ram pressure stripping and/or the presence of hot gas hascompressed/truncated the gas in these systems. the remaining galaxies haverings, or composite profiles, that we argue can be caused by the effects ofbars. we investigated the kinematics of the molecular gas usingposition-velocity diagrams, and compared the observed kinematics with dynamicalmodel predictions, and the observed stellar and ionised gas velocities. weconfirm that the molecular gas reaches beyond the turnover of the circularvelocity curve in ~70% of our co-rich atlas3d etgs. in general we find that inmost galaxies the molecular gas is relaxed and dynamically cold. molecular gasis a better direct tracer of the circular velocity than the ionised gas,justifying its use as a kinematic tracer for tully-fisher and similar analyses.(abridged)

1211.4615	the atlas3d project - xxi. correlations between gradients of local  escape velocity and stellar populations in early-type galaxies	we explore the connection between the local escape velocity, v_esc, and thestellar population properties in the atlas3d survey, a complete, volume-limitedsample of nearby early-type galaxies. we make use of ugriz photometry toconstruct multi-gaussian expansion models of the surface brightnesses of ourgalaxies. we are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profilesfound in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results ofstate-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mags. weutilise these photometric models and sauron integral-field spectroscopy,combined with jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local v_esc derivedfrom the surface brightness. we find that the local v_esc is tightly correlatedwith the mgb and fe5015 linestrengths and optical colours, and anti-correlatedwith the hbeta linestrength. in the case of the mgb and colour - v_escrelations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows theglobal relation between different galaxies. we intentionally ignored anyuncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empiricaldescription of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that isideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. we identify apopulation of galaxies that occur only at low v_esc that exhibit negativegradients in the mgb - and colour -v_esc relations. these galaxies typicallyhave young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts ofmolecular gas and dust. combining these results with n-body simulations ofbinary mergers we use the mgb-v_esc relation to constrain the possible numberof dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - atypical massive etg can have experienced only ~1.5 major mergers beforebecoming a significant outlier in the mgb-v_esc relation.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1212.2630	the atlas 3d project - xvi. physical parameters and spectral line energy  distributions of the molecular gas in gas-rich early-type galaxies	[abridged] we present a detailed study of the physical properties of themolecular gas in a sample of 18 molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies (etgs)from the atlas$ 3d sample. our goal is to better understand the star formationprocesses occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the densestar-forming gas. we use existing integrated $^{12}$co(1-0, 2-1),$^{13}$co(1-0, 2-1), hcn(1-0) and hco$^{+}$(1-0) observations and present new$^{12}$co(3-2) single-dish data. from these, we derive for the first time theaverage kinetic temperature, h$_{2}$ volume density and column density of theemitting gas, this using a non-lte theoretical model. since the co lines tracedifferent physical conditions than of those the hcn and hco$^{+}$ lines, thetwo sets of lines are treated separately. we also compare for the first timethe predicted co spectral line energy distributions (sleds) and gas propertiesof our molecular gas-rich etgs with those of a sample of nearby well-studieddisc galaxies. the gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 etgs appearanalogous to those in the centre of the milky way. such results have never beenobtained before for etgs and open a new window to explore furtherstar-formation processes in the universe. the conclusions drawn shouldnevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number ofobservations and on a simple model. in the near future, with higher cotransition observations, it should be possible to better identify the variousgas components present in etgs, as well as more precisely determine theirassociated physical conditions. to achieve these goals, we show here from ourtheoretical study, that mid-j co lines (such as the $^{12}$co(6-5) line) areparticularly useful.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1307.7136	the long lives of giant clumps and the birth of outflows in gas-rich  galaxies at high redshift	star-forming disk galaxies at high redshift are often subject to violent diskinstability, characterized by giant clumps whose fate is yet to be understood.the main question is whether the clumps disrupt within their dynamicaltimescale (&lt;50myr), like molecular clouds in today's galaxies, or whether theysurvive stellar feedback for more than a disk orbital time (~300myr) in whichcase they can migrate inward and help building the central bulge. we present3.5-7pc resolution amr simulations of high-redshift disks includingphoto-ionization, radiation pressure, and supernovae feedback (renaud et al.2013, and perret et al., this astro-ph issue). our modeling of radiationpressure determines the mass loading and initial velocity of winds from basicphysical principles. we find that the giant clumps produce steady outflow ratescomparable to and sometimes somewhat larger than their star formation rate,with velocities largely sufficient to escape galaxy. the clumps also lose mass,especially old stars, by tidal stripping, and the stellar populations containedin the clumps hence remain relatively young (&lt;=200myr), as observed. the clumpssurvive gaseous outflows and stellar loss, because they are wandering ingas-rich turbulent disks from which they can re-accrete gas at high ratescompensating for outflows and tidal stripping, overall keeping realistic andself-regulated gaseous and stellar masses. our simulations produce gaseousoutflows with velocities, densities and mass loading consistent withobservations, and at the same time suggest that the giant clumps survive forhundreds of myr and complete their migration to the center of high-redshiftgalaxies, without rapid dispersion and reformation of clumps.

1403.0626	identification of old tidal dwarfs near early-type galaxies from deep  imaging and hi observations	it has recently been proposed that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies located inthe local group disks of satellites (doss) may be tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs)born in a major merger at least 5 gyr ago. whether tdgs can live that long isstill poorly constrained by observations. as part of deep optical and hisurveys with the cfht megacam camera and westerbork synthesis radio telescopemade within the atlas3d project, and follow-up spectroscopic observations withthe gemini-north telescope, we have discovered old tdg candidates aroundseveral early-type galaxies. at least one of them has an oxygen abundance closeto solar, as expected for a tidal origin. this confirmed pre-enriched object islocated within the gigantic, but very low surface brightness, tidal tail thatemanates from the elliptical galaxy, ngc 5557. an age of 4 gyr estimated fromits sed fitting makes it the oldest securely identified tdg ever found so far.we investigated the structural and gaseous properties of the tdg and of acompanion located in the same collisional debris, and thus most likely of tidalorigin as well. despite several gyr of evolution close to their parentgalaxies, they kept a large gas reservoir. their central surface brightness islow and their effective radius much larger than that of typical dwarf galaxiesof the same mass. this possibly provides us with criteria to identify tidalobjects which can be more easily checked than the traditional ones requiringdeep spectroscopic observations. in view of the above, we discuss the survivaltime of tdgs and question the tidal origin of the doss.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1403.6832	agn emission line diagnostics and the mass-metallicity relation up to  redshift z~2: the impact of selection effects and evolution	emission line diagnostic diagrams probing the ionization sources in galaxies,such as the baldwin-phillips-terlevich (bpt) diagram, have been usedextensively to distinguish agn from purely star-forming galaxies. yet, theyremain poorly understood at higher redshifts. we shed light on this issue withan empirical approach based on a z~0 reference sample built from ~300,000 sdssgalaxies, from which we mimic selection effects due to typical emission linedetection limits at higher redshift. we combine this low-redshift referencesample with a simple prescription for luminosity evolution of the global galaxypopulation to predict the loci of high-redshift galaxies on the bpt andmass-excitation (mex) diagnostic diagrams. the predicted bivariatedistributions agree remarkably well with direct observations of galaxies out toz~1.5, including the observed stellar mass-metallicity (mz) relation evolution.as a result, we infer that high-redshift star-forming galaxies are consistentwith having "normal" ism properties out to z~1.5, after accounting forselection effects and line luminosity evolution. namely, their optical lineratios and gas-phase metallicities are comparable to that of low-redshiftgalaxies with equivalent emission-line luminosities. in contrast, agnnarrow-line regions may show a shift toward lower metallicities at higherredshift. while a physical evolution of the ism conditions is not ruled out forpurely star-forming galaxies, and may be more important starting at z&gt;2, wefind that reliably quantifying this evolution is hindered by selectionseffects. the recipes provided here may serve as a basis for future studiestoward this goal. code to predict the loci of galaxies on the bpt and mexdiagnostic diagrams, and the mz relation as a function of emission lineluminosity limits, is made publicly available.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1410.2244	the stellar accretion origin of stellar population gradients in massive  galaxies at large radii	we investigate the evolution of stellar population gradients from $z=2$ to$z=0$ in massive galaxies at large radii ($r &gt; 2r_{\mathrm{eff}}$) using tencosmological zoom simulations of halos with $6 \times 10^{12} m_{\odot} &lt;m_{\mathrm{halo}} &lt; 2 \times 10^{13}m_{\odot}$. the simulations follow metalcooling and enrichment from snii, snia and agb winds. we explore thedifferential impact of an empirical model for galactic winds that reproducesthe mass-metallicity relation and its evolution with redshift. at larger radiithe galaxies, for both models, become more dominated by stars accreted fromsatellite galaxies in major and minor mergers. in the wind model, fewer starsare accreted, but they are significantly more metal poor resulting in steepglobal metallicity ($\langle \nabla z_{\mathrm{stars}} \rangle= -0.35$ dex/dex)and color (e.g. $\langle \nabla g-r \rangle = -0.13$ dex/dex) gradients inagreement with observations. in contrast, colour and metallicity gradients ofthe models without winds are inconsistent with observations. age gradients arein general mildly positive at $z=0$ ($\langle \nabla age_{\mathrm{stars}}\rangle= 0.04$ dex/dex) with significant differences between the models athigher redshift. we demonstrate that for the wind model, stellar accretion issteepening existing in-situ metallicity gradients by about 0.2 dex by thepresent day and helps to match observed gradients of massive early-typegalaxies at large radii. colour and metallicity gradients are significantlysteeper for systems which have accreted stars in minor mergers, while galaxieswith major mergers have relatively flat gradients, confirming previous results.this study highlights the importance of stellar accretion for stellarpopulation properties of massive galaxies at large radii, which can provideimportant constraints for formation models.

1410.5754	a parsec-resolution simulation of the antennae galaxies: formation of  star clusters during the merger	we present a hydrodynamical simulation of an antennae-like galaxy merger atparsec resolution, including a multi-component model for stellar feedback andreaching numerical convergence in the global star formation rate for the firsttime. we analyse the properties of the dense stellar objects formed during thedifferent stages of the interaction. each galactic encounter triggers astarburst activity, but the varying physical conditions change the triggeringmechanism of each starburst. during the first two pericenter passages, thestarburst is spatially extended and forms many star clusters. however, thestarburst associated to the third, final passage is more centrallyconcentrated: stars form almost exclusively in the galactic nucleus and no newstar cluster is formed. the maximum mass of stars clusters in this merger ismore than 30 times higher than those in a simulation of an isolated milkyway-like galaxy. antennae-like mergers are therefore a formation channel ofyoung massive clusters possibly leading to globular clusters. monitoring theevolution of a few clusters reveals the diversity of formation scenariosincluding the gathering and merger of gas clumps, the monolithic formation andthe hierarchical formation in sub-structures inside a single cloud. two stellarobjects formed in the simulation yield the same properties as ultra-compactdwarf galaxies. they share the same formation scenario than the most massiveclusters, but have a larger radius either since birth, or get it after aviolent interaction with the galactic center. the diversity of environmentsacross space and time in a galaxy merger can account for the diversity of thestellar objects formed, both in terms of mass and size.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1503.06220	a physical approach to the identification of high-z mergers:  morphological classification in the stellar mass domain	at z&gt;1, the distinction between merging and 'normal' star-forming galaxiesbased on single band morphology is often hampered by the presence of largeclumps which result in a disturbed, merger-like appearance even in rotationallysupported disks. in this paper we discuss how a classification based oncanonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar massmaps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification ofclumpy but not merging galaxies. we calibrate the mass-based selection ofmergers using the mirage hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated andmerging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of$10^{9.8}$-$10^{10.6}m_{sun}$ and merger ratios between 1:1-1:6.3. thesesimulations are processed to reproduce the typical depth and spatial resolutionof observed hudf data. we test our approach on a sample of real z~2 galaxieswith kinematic classification into disks or mergers and on ~100 galaxies in thehudf field with photometric/spectroscopic redshift between 1.5$\leqslant z\leqslant$3 and $m&gt;10^{9.4}m_{sun}$. we find that a combination of theasymmetry $a_{mass}$ and $m_{20, mass}$ indices measured on the stellar massmaps can efficiently identify real (major) mergers with $\lesssim$20%contamination from clumpy disks in the merger sample. this mass-basedclassification cannot be reproduced in star-forming galaxies by $h-$bandmeasurements alone, which instead result in a contamination from clumpygalaxies that can be as high as 50%. moreover, we find that the mass-basedclassification always results in a lower contamination from clumpy galaxiesthan an $h-$band classification, regardless of the depth of the imaging used(e.g., candels vs. hudf).

1505.02981	star formation in the outer regions of the early type galaxy ngc 4203	ngc 4203 is a nearby early-type galaxy surrounded by a very large,low-column-density hi disc. in this paper we study the star formationefficiency in the gas disc of ngc 4203 by using the uv, deep optical imagingand infrared data. we confirm that the hi disc consists of two distinctcomponents: an inner star forming ring with radius from $\sim$ 1 to $\sim$ 3r$_{eff}$, and an outer disc. the outer hi disc is 9 times more massive thanthe inner hi ring. at the location of the inner hi ring we detect spiral-likestructure both in the deep $g'-r'$ image and in the 8 $\mu$m $spitzer$-iracimage, extending in radius up to $\sim$ 3 r$_{eff}$. these two gas componentshave a different star formation efficiency likely due to the differentmetallicity and dust content. the inner component has a star formationefficiency very similar to the inner regions of late-type galaxies. althoughthe outer component has a very low star formation efficiency, it is similar tothat of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and dwarfs. we suggest that thesedifferences can be explained with different gas origins for the two componentssuch as stellar mass loss for the inner hi ring and accretion from the intergalactic medium (igm) for the outer hi disc. the low level star formationefficiency in the outer hi disc is not enough to change the morphology of ngc4203, making the depletion time of the hi gas much too long.

astro-ph;0002177	formation of molecular gas in the debris of violent galaxy interactions	in many gravitational interactions between galaxies, gas and stars that havebeen torn from either or both of the precursor galaxies can collect in 'tidaltails'. star formation begins anew in these regions to produce 'tidal dwarfgalaxies', giving insight into the process of galaxy formation through thewell-defined timescale of the interaction. but tracking the star formationprocess has proved to be difficult: the tidal dwarf galaxies with young starsshowed no evidence of the molecular gas out of which new stars form. here wereport the discovery of molecular gas (carbon monoxide emission) in two tidaldwarf galaxies. in both cases, the molecular gas peaks at the same location asthe maximum in atomic-hydrogen density, unlike most gas-rich galaxies. we inferfrom this that the molecular gas formed from the hi, rather than being torn inmolecular form from the interacting galaxies. star formation in the tidaldwarfs appears to mimic that process in normal spiral galaxies like our own.

astro-ph;0408524	a top-down scenario for the formation of massive tidal dwarf galaxies	among those objects formed out of collisional debris during galaxy mergers,the prominent gaseous accumulations observed near the tip of some long tidaltails are the most likely to survive long enough to form genuine recycledgalaxies. using simple numerical models, bournaud, duc &amp; masset (2003) claimedthat tidal objects as massive as 10^9 msun could only form, in thesesimulations, within extended dark matter (dm) haloes. we present here a new setof simulations of galaxy collisions to further investigate the structure oftidal tails. first of all, we checked that massive objects are still producedin full n-body codes that include feedback and a large number of particles.using a simpler n-body code with rigid haloes, we noticed that dissipation andself-gravity in the tails, although important, are not the key factors.exploiting toy models, we found that, for truncated dm haloes, material isstretched along the tail, while, within extended haloes, the tidal field canefficiently carry away from the disk a large fraction of the gas, whilemaintaining its surface density to a high value. this creates a densityenhancement near the tip of the tail. only later-on, self-gravity takes over;the gas clouds collapse and start forming stars. thus, such objects werefundamentally formed following a kinematical process, according to a top-downscenario, contrary to the less massive super star clusters that are alsopresent around mergers. this conclusion leads us to introduce a restrictivedefinition for tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs) and their progenitors, consideringonly the most massive ones, initially mostly made of gas, that were able topile up in the tidal tails. more simulations will be necessary to preciselydetermine the fate of these proto--tdgs and estimate their number.
