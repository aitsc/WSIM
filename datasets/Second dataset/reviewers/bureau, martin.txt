0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0909.0680	kinematic constraints on the stellar and dark matter content of spiral  and s0 galaxies	(abridged) we present mass models of a sample of 14 spiral and 14 s0 galaxiesthat constrain their stellar and dark matter content. for each galaxy we derivethe stellar mass distribution from near-infrared photometry under theassumptions of axisymmetry and a constant ks-band stellar mass-to-light ratio,(m/l)_ks. to this we add a dark halo assumed to follow a spherically symmetricnfw profile and a correlation between concentration and dark mass within thevirial radius, m_dm. we solve the jeans equations for the correspondingpotential under the assumption of constant anisotropy in the meridional plane,beta_z. by comparing the predicted second velocity moment to observed long-slitstellar kinematics, we determine the three best-fitting parameters of themodel: (m/l)_ks, m_dm and beta_z. these simple axisymmetric jeans models areable to accurately reproduce the wide range of observed stellar kinematics,which typically extend to ~2-3 re or, equivalently, ~0.5-1 r_25. we find amedian stellar mass-to-light ratio at ks-band of 1.09 (solar units) with an rmsscatter of 0.31. we present preliminary comparisons between this large sampleof dynamically determined stellar mass-to-light ratios and the predictions ofstellar population models. the stellar population models predict slightly lowermass-to-light ratios than we measure. the mass models contain a median of 15per cent dark matter by mass within an effective radius re, and 49 per centwithin the optical radius r_25. dark and stellar matter contribute equally tothe mass within a sphere of radius 4.1 re or 1.0 r_25. there is no evidence ofany significant difference in the dark matter content of the spirals and s0s inour sample.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1007.4072	the tully-fisher relations of early-type spiral and s0 galaxies	we demonstrate that the comparison of tully-fisher relations (tfrs) derivedfrom global hi line widths to tfrs derived from the circular velocity profilesof dynamical models (or stellar kinematic observations corrected for asymmetricdrift) is vulnerable to systematic and uncertain biases introduced by thedifferent measures of rotation used. we therefore argue that to constrain therelative locations of the tfrs of spiral and s0 galaxies, the same tracer andmeasure must be used for both samples. using detailed near-infrared imaging andthe circular velocities of axisymmetric jeans models of 14 nearby edge-on sa-sbspirals and 14 nearby edge-on s0s drawn from a range of environments, we findthat s0s lie on a tfr with the same slope as the spirals, but are on average0.53+/-0.15 mag fainter at ks-band at a given rotational velocity. this is asignificantly smaller offset than that measured in earlier studies of the s0tfr, which we attribute to our elimination of the bias associated with usingdifferent rotation measures and our use of earlier type spirals as a reference.since our measurement of the offset avoids systematic biases, it should bepreferred to previous estimates. a spiral stellar population in which starformation is truncated would take ~1 gyr to fade by 0.53 mag at ks-band. if s0sare the products of a simple truncation of star formation in spirals, then thisfinding is difficult to reconcile with the observed evolution of the spiral/s0fraction with redshift. recent star formation could explain the observed lackof fading in s0s, but the offset of the s0 tfr persists as a function of bothstellar and dynamical mass. we show that the offset of the s0 tfr couldtherefore be explained by a systematic difference between the total massdistributions of s0s and spirals, in the sense that s0s need to be smaller ormore concentrated than spirals.

1007.4147	molecular gas and star formation in early-type galaxies	we present new mm interferometric and optical integral-field unit (ifu)observations and construct a sample of 12 e and s0 galaxies with molecular gaswhich have both co and optical maps. the galaxies contain 2 x 10^7 to 5 x 10^9m\odot of molecular gas distributed primarily in central discs or rings (radii0.5 to 4 kpc). the molecular gas distributions are always coincident withdistributions of optically-obscuring dust that reveal tightly-wound spiralstructures in many cases. the ionised gas always approximately corotates withthe molecular gas, evidencing a link between these two gas components, yet starformation is not always the domi- nant ionisation source. the galaxies withless molecular gas tend to have [o iii]/h{\beta} emission-line ratios at highvalues not expected for star formation. most e/s0s with molecular gas haveyoung or intermediate age stellar populations based on optical colours,ultraviolet colours and absorption linestrengths. the few that appear purelyold lie close to the limit where such populations would be undetectable basedon the mass fractions of expected young to observed old stars. the 8{\mu}mpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) and 24{\mu}m emission yield similar starformation rate estimates of e/s0s, but the total infrared overpredicts the ratedue to a contribution to dust heating from older stars. the radio-far infraredrelation also has much more scatter than for other star-forming galaxies.however, despite these biases and additional scatter, the derived starformation rates locate the e/s0 galaxies within the large range of theschmidt-kennicutt and constant efficiency star formation laws. thus the starformation process in e/s0s is not overwhelmingly different than in otherstar-forming galaxies, although one of the more reliable tracers (24{\mu}m)points to a possible lower star-formation efficiency at a given gas surfacedensity.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.2438	the stellar kinematics and populations of boxy bulges: cylindrical  rotation and vertical gradients	boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are seen in about half of edge-on discgalaxies. comparisons of the photometry and major-axis gas and stellarkinematics of these bulges to simulations of bar formation and evolutionindicate that they are bars viewed in projection. if the properties of boxybulges can be entirely explained by assuming they are bars, then this may implythat their hosts are pure disc galaxies with no classical bulge. a handful ofthese bulges, including that of the milky way, have been observed to rotatecylindrically, i.e. with a mean stellar velocity independent of height abovethe disc. in order to assess whether such behaviour is ubiquitous in boxybulges, and whether a pure disc interpretation is consistent with their stellarpopulations, we have analysed the stellar kinematics and populations of theboxy or peanut-shaped bulges in a sample of five edge-on galaxies. we placedslits along the major axis of each galaxy and at three offset but parallelpositions to build up spatial coverage. the boxy bulge of ngc3390 rotatesperfectly cylindrically within the spatial extent and uncertainties of thedata. this is consistent with the metallicity and alpha-element enhancement ofthe bulge, which are the same as in the disk. this galaxy is thus a pure discgalaxy. the boxy bulge of eso311-g012 also rotates very close to cylindrically.the boxy bulge of ngc1381 is neither clearly cylindrically nornon-cylindrically rotating, but it has a negative vertical metallicity gradientand is alpha-enhanced with respect to its disc, suggesting a composite bulgecomprised of a classical bulge and bar (and possibly a discy pseudobulge)[abridged] even this relatively small sample is sufficient to demonstrate thatboxy bulges display a range of rotational and population properties, indicatingthat they do not form a homogeneous class of object.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1105.4076	the atlas3d project - vi. simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the  link with fast rotators, slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies through mergers with a sampleof 70 high-resolution (softening length &lt; 60 pc and 12*10^6 particles)numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies and 16 simulations ofetg remergers. these simulations, designed to accompany observations and modelsconducted within the atlas3d project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. the progenitor discgalaxies are spiral-like with bulge to disc ratios typical of sb and scgalaxies. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the atlas3dcriterion (based on the lambda_r parameter): they preserve the structure of theinput fast rotating spiral progenitors. they have intrinsic ellipticitieslarger than 0.5, cover intrinsic lambda_r values between 0.2 and 0.6, withinthe range of observed fast rotators. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the fast rotators produced inmajor mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities between 0.4 and0.6. most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. besides a handful ofspecific observed systems -- the counter-rotating discs (2-sigma galaxies) --these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators inthe nearby universe. the mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamentalparameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but italso requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (sb) progenitor galaxywith respect to the orbital angular momentum.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1202.4790	the hi environment of counter-rotating gas hosts: gas accretion from  cold gas blobs	we probe the hi properties and the gas environments of three early-typebarred galaxies harbouring counter-rotating ionized gas, ngc 128, ngc 3203 andngc 7332. each system has one or more optically-identified galaxy, at a similaror as yet unknown redshift within a 50 kpc projected radius. using hi synthesisimaging data, we investigate the hypothesis that the counter-rotating gas inthese galaxies has been accreted from their neighbours. in ngc 128 and ngc3203, we find 9.6e7 and 2.3e8 msun of hi, respectively, covering almost theentire stellar bodies of dwarf companions that appear physically connected.both the hi morphology and kinematics are suggestive of tidal interactions. inngc 7332, we do not find any directly-associated hi. instead, ngc 7339, aneighbour of a comparable size at about 10 kpc, is found with 8.9e8 msun of higas. more recently in a single dish observation, however, another groupdiscovered a large hi structure which seems to be an extension of ngc 7339's hidisc and also covers ngc 7332. all these observations thus suggest that hi gasis being accreted in these three galaxies from their companions, which islikely responsible for the kinematically-decoupled gas component present intheir central region. considering the incompleteness of existing studies of thefaint dwarf galaxy population both in the optical and in hi, accretion fromcold gas blobs, presumably gas-rich dwarfs, is expected to occur even morefrequently than what is inferred from such cases that have been observed todate.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.1011	the atlas3d project - xiv. the extent and kinematics of molecular gas in  early-type galaxies	we use interferometric co observations to compare the extent, surfacebrightness profiles and kinematics of the molecular gas in co-rich atlas3dearly-type galaxies (etgs) and spiral galaxies. we find that the molecular gasextent is smaller in absolute terms in etgs than in late-type galaxies, butthat the size distributions are similar once scaled by the galaxiesoptical/stellar characteristic scale-lengths. virgo cluster etgs have lessextended molecular gas reservoirs than field counterparts. approximately halfof etgs have molecular gas surface brightness profiles that follow the stellarlight profile. these systems often have relaxed gas out to large radii,suggesting they are unlikely to have had recent merger/accretion events. athird of the sample galaxies show molecular gas surface brightness profilesthat fall off slower than the light, and sometimes show a truncation. wesuggest that ram pressure stripping and/or the presence of hot gas hascompressed/truncated the gas in these systems. the remaining galaxies haverings, or composite profiles, that we argue can be caused by the effects ofbars. we investigated the kinematics of the molecular gas usingposition-velocity diagrams, and compared the observed kinematics with dynamicalmodel predictions, and the observed stellar and ionised gas velocities. weconfirm that the molecular gas reaches beyond the turnover of the circularvelocity curve in ~70% of our co-rich atlas3d etgs. in general we find that inmost galaxies the molecular gas is relaxed and dynamically cold. molecular gasis a better direct tracer of the circular velocity than the ionised gas,justifying its use as a kinematic tracer for tully-fisher and similar analyses.(abridged)

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.0631	the egnog survey: gas excitation in normal galaxies at z~0.3	as observations of molecular gas in galaxies are pushed to lower starformation rate galaxies at higher redshifts, it is becoming increasinglyimportant to understand the conditions of the gas in these systems to properlyinfer their molecular gas content. the rotational transitions of the carbonmonoxide (co) molecule provide an excellent probe of the gas excitationconditions in these galaxies. in this paper we present the results from the gasexcitation sample of the evolution of molecular gas in normal galaxies (egnog)survey at the combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma).this subset of the full egnog sample consists of four galaxies at z~0.3 withstar formation rates of 40-65 m_sun yr^-1 and stellar masses of ~2x10^11 m_sun.using the 3 mm and 1 mm bands at carma, we observe both the co(1-0) and co(3-2)transitions in these four galaxies in order to probe the excitation of themolecular gas. we report robust detections of both lines in three galaxies (andan upper limit on the fourth), with an average line ratio, r_31 = l'_co(3-2) /l'_co(1-0), of 0.46 \pm 0.07 (with systematic errors \lesssim 40%), whichimplies sub-thermal excitation of the co(3-2) line. we conclude that theexcitation of the gas in these massive, highly star-forming galaxies isconsistent with normal star-forming galaxies such as local spirals, notstarbursting systems like local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. since theegnog gas excitation sample galaxies are selected from the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, we suggest that this result is applicable to studies ofmain sequence galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts, supporting theassumptions made in studies that find molecular gas fractions in star forminggalaxies at z~1-2 to be an order of magnitude larger than what is observedlocally.

1301.7184	a black-hole mass measurement from molecular gas kinematics in ngc4526	the masses of the supermassive black-holes found in galaxy bulges arecorrelated with a multitude of galaxy properties, leading to suggestions thatgalaxies and black-holes may evolve together. the number of reliably measuredblack-hole masses is small, and the number of methods for measuring them islimited, holding back attempts to understand this co-evolution. directlymeasuring black-hole masses is currently possible with stellar kinematics (inearly-type galaxies), ionised-gas kinematics (in some spiral and early-typegalaxies) and in rare objects which have central maser emission. here we reportthat by modelling the effect of a black-hole on the kinematics of molecular gasit is possible to fit interferometric observations of co emission and therebyaccurately estimate black hole masses. we study the dynamics of the gas in theearly-type galaxy ngc4526, and obtain a best fit which requires the presence ofa central dark-object of 4.5(+4.2-3.0)x10^8 msun (3 sigma confidence limit).with next generation mm-interferometers (e.g. alma) these observations could bereproduced in galaxies out to 75 megaparsecs in less the 5 hours of observingtime. the use of molecular gas as a kinematic tracer should thus allow one toestimate black-hole masses in hundreds of galaxies in the local universe, manymore than accessible with current techniques.

1305.2328	ism chemistry in metal rich environments: molecular tracers of  metallicity	in this paper we use observations of molecular tracers in metal rich andalpha-enhanced galaxies to study the effect of abundance changes on molecularchemistry. we selected a sample of metal rich spiral and star bursting objectsfrom the literature, and present here new data for a sample of early-typegalaxies (etgs). we conducted the first survey of cs and methanol emission inetgs, detecting 7 objects in cs, and 5 in methanol emission. we find evidenceto support the hypothesis that cs is a better tracer of dense star-forming gasthan hcn. we suggest that the methanol emission in these sources is driven bydust mantle destruction due to ionisation from high mass star formation, butcannot rule out shocks dominating in some sources. the derived source averagedcs/methanol column densities and rotation temperatures are similar to thosefound in normal spiral and starburst galaxies, suggesting dense clouds arelittle affected by the differences between galaxy types. finally we used thetotal column density ratios for our galaxy samples to show for the first timethat some molecular tracers do seem to show systematic variations that appearto correlate with metallicity, and that these variations roughly match thosepredicted by chemical models. using this fact, the chemical models of bayet etal. (2012b), and assumptions about the optical depth we are able to roughlypredict the metallicity of our spiral and etg sample, with a scatter of ~0.3dex. we provide the community with linear approximations to the relationshipbetween the hcn and cs column density ratio and metallicity. further study willclearly be required to determine if this, or any, molecular tracer can be usedto robustly determine gas-phase metallically, but that a relationship exists atall suggests that in the future it may be possible to calibrate a metallicityindicator for the molecular interstellar medium (abridged).

1311.6469	ngc1266 as a local candidate for rapid cessation of star formation	we present new spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae(sauron) integral-field spectroscopy and swift ultraviolet optical telescope(uvot) observations of molecular outflow host galaxy ngc 1266 that indicate ngc1266 has experienced a rapid cessation of star formation. both the sauron mapsof stellar population age and the swift uvot observations demonstrate thepresence of young ($&lt; 1$ gyr) stellar populations within the central 1 kpc,while existing combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma)co(1--0) maps indicate that the sites of current star formation are constrainedto the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy only. the optical spectrum ofngc 1266 from moustakas &amp; kennicutt (2006) reveal a characteristicpost-starburst (k+a) stellar population and davis et al. (2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1401.3180	the atlas3d project - xxvi. hi discs in real and simulated fast and slow  rotators	one quarter of all nearby early-type galaxies (etgs) outside virgo host adisc/ring of hi with size from a few to tens of kpc and mass up to ~1e+9 solarmasses. here we investigate whether this hi is related to the presence of astellar disc within the host making use of the classification of etgs in fastand slow rotators (fr/sr). we find a large diversity of hi masses andmorphologies within both families. surprisingly, srs are detected as often,host as much hi and have a similar rate of hi discs/rings as frs. accretion ofhi is therefore not always linked to the growth of an inner stellar disc. theweak relation between hi and stellar disc is confirmed by their frequentkinematical misalignment in frs, including cases of polar and counterrotatinggas. in srs the hi is usually polar. this complex picture highlights adiversity of etg formation histories which may be lost in the relativesimplicity of their inner structure and emerges when studying their outerregions.  we find that lcdm hydrodynamical simulations have difficulties reproducingthe hi properties of etgs. the gas discs formed in simulations are either toomassive or too small depending on the star formation feedback implementation.kinematical misalignments match the observations only qualitatively. the mainpoint of conflict is that nearly all simulated frs and a large fraction of allsimulated srs host corotating hi. this establishes the hi properties of etgs asa novel challenge to simulations.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1410.0981	the atlas3d project -- xxix. the new look of early-type galaxies and  surrounding fields disclosed by extremely deep optical images	galactic archeology based on star counts is instrumental to reconstruct thepast mass assembly of local group galaxies. the development of new observingtechniques and data-reduction, coupled with the use of sensitive large field ofview cameras, now allows us to pursue this technique in more distant galaxiesexploiting their diffuse low surface brightness (lsb) light. as part of theatlas3d project, we have obtained with the megacam camera at the canada-francehawaii telescope extremely deep, multi--band, images of nearby early-typegalaxies. we present here a catalog of 92 galaxies from the atlas3d sample,that are located in low to medium density environments. the observing strategyand data reduction pipeline, that achieve a gain of several magnitudes in thelimiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, arepresented. the size and depth of the survey is compared to other recent deepimaging projects. the paper highlights the capability of lsb--optimized surveysat detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology ofgalaxies. the intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are alsodiscussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar halos of galaxies byextended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from galactic dust. thedetection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present andpast mass assembly of etgs is one of the prime goals of the project. we providespecific examples of each type of observed structures -- tidal tails, stellarstreams and shells --, and explain how they were identified and classified. wegive an overview of the initial results. the detailed statistical analysis willbe presented in future papers.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1502.01017	giant molecular clouds in the early-type galaxy ngc4526	we present a high spatial resolution ($\approx 20$ pc) of $^{12}$co($2-1$)observations of the lenticular galaxy ngc4526. we identify 103 resolved giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) and measure their properties: size $r$, velocitydispersion $\sigma_v$, and luminosity $l$. this is the first gmc catalog of anearly-type galaxy. we find that the gmc population in ngc4526 isgravitationally bound, with a virial parameter $\alpha \sim 1$. the massdistribution, $dn/dm \propto m^{-2.39 \pm 0.03}$, is steeper than that for gmcsin the inner milky way, but comparable to that found in some late-typegalaxies. we find no size-linewidth correlation for the ngc4526 clouds, incontradiction to the expectation from larson's relation. in general, the gmcsin ngc4526 are more luminous, denser, and have a higher velocity dispersionthan equal size gmcs in the milky way and other galaxies in the local group.these may be due to higher interstellar radiation field than in the milky waydisk and weaker external pressure than in the galactic center. in addition, akinematic measurement of cloud rotation shows that the rotation is driven bythe galactic shear. for the vast majority of the clouds, the rotational energyis less than the turbulent and gravitational energy, while the four innermostclouds are unbound and will likely be torn apart by the strong shear at thegalactic center. we combine our data with the archival data of other galaxiesto show that the surface density $\sigma$ of gmcs is not approximately constantas previously believed, but varies by $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude. we alsoshow that the size and velocity dispersion of gmc population across galaxiesare related to the surface density, as expected from the gravitational andpressure equilibrium, i.e. $\sigma_v r^{-1/2} \propto \sigma^{1/2}$.

1512.05661	on the depletion and accretion timescales of cold gas in local  early-type galaxies	we consider what can be learnt about the processes of gas accretion anddepletion from the kinematic misalignment between the cold/warm gas and starsin local early-type galaxies. using simple analytic arguments and a toy modelof the processes involved, we show that the lack of objects withcounter-rotating gas reservoirs strongly constrains the relaxation, depletionand accretion timescales of gas in early-type galaxies. standard values of theaccretion rate, star formation efficiency and relaxation rate are notsimultaneously consistent with the observed distribution of kinematicmisalignments. to reproduce that distribution, both fast gas depletion ($t_{\rmdep} &lt;10^8$ yr; e.g. more efficient star formation) and fast gas destruction(e.g. by active galactic nucleus feedback) can be invoked, but both alsorequire a high rate of gas-rich mergers ($&gt;1$ gyr$^{-1}$). alternatively, therelaxation of misaligned material could happen over very long timescales($\simeq100$ dynamical times or $\approx1$-$5$ gyr). we explore the variousphysical processes that could lead to fast gas depletion and/or slow gasrelaxation, and discuss the prospects of using kinematic misalignments to probegas-rich accretion processes in the era of large integral-field spectroscopicsurveys.

astro-ph;0204129	two-dimensional kinematics and stellar populations of early-type  galaxies: first results from the sauron survey	we present the sauron project, which is aimed at studying the morphology,two-dimensional kinematics and stellar populations of a representative sampleof elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges. sauron, a dedicated integral-fieldspectrograph that is optimized for wide-field observations and has highthroughput, was built in lyon and is now operated at the wht 4.2m telescope. atpresent, we have observed approximately two thirds of the seventy-two samplegalaxies with sauron. a comparison with published long-slit measurementsdemonstrates that the sauron-data is of equal or better quality, and providesfull two-dimensional coverage. the velocity and velocity dispersion fieldsexhibit a large variety of morphologies: from simple rotating systems tocylindrical, disky and triaxial velocity fields, bars and decoupled cores. mostof these kinematical signatures do not have counterparts in the lightdistribution. while some galaxies are consistent with axisymmetry, most aremore complex systems than assumed previously. this suggests that thekinematical properties of nearby e/s0 galaxies do not agree with the oftenassumed simplistic two-family model, in which the giant non-rotating triaxialellipticals are opposed to the fast-rotating axisymmetric faint ellipticals ands0s.

astro-ph;0608212	star formation and figure rotation in the early-type galaxy ngc2974	we present galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far (fuv) and near (nuv)ultraviolet imaging of the nearby early-type galaxy ngc2974, along withcomplementary ground-based optical imaging. in the ultraviolet, the galaxyreveals a central spheroid-like component and a newly discovered complete outerring of radius 6.2kpc, with suggestions of another partial ring at an evenlarger radius. blue fuv-nuv and uv-optical colours are observed in the centreof the galaxy and from the outer ring outward, suggesting young stellarpopulations (&lt; 1gyr) and recent star formation in both locations. this issupported by a simple stellar population model which assumes two bursts of starformation, allowing us to constrain the age, mass fraction and surface massdensity of the young component pixel by pixel. overall, the mass fraction ofthe young component appears to be just under 1per cent (lower limit,uncorrected for dust extinction). the additional presence of a nuclear and aninner ring (radii 1.4 and 2.9kpc, respectively), as traced by [oiii] emission,suggests ring formation through resonances. all three rings are consistent witha single pattern speed of $78\pm6$ km/s/kpc, typical of s0 galaxies and onlymarginally slower than expected for a fast bar if traced by a small observedsurface brightness plateau. this thus suggests that star formation andmorphological evolution in ngc2974 at the present epoch are primarily driven bya rotating asymmetry (probably a large-scale bar), despite the standardclassification of ngc2974 as an e4 elliptical.

0812.1743	axisymmetric mass models of s0 and spiral galaxies with boxy bulges:  mass-to-light ratios, dark matter and bars	we examine a sample of 30 edge-on spiral and s0 galaxies that have boxy andpeanut-shaped bulges. we compute model stellar kinematics by solving the jeansequations for axisymmetric mass distributions derived from k-band images. thesesimple models have only one free parameter: the dynamical mass-to-light ratio,which we assume is independent of radius. given the simplicity of the modellingprocedure, the model second velocity moments are strikingly good fits to theobserved stellar kinematics within the extent of our kinematic data, whichtypically reach ~ 0.5-1 r25 (where r25 is the optical radius), or equivalently2-3 re (where re is the effective or half-light radius). we therefore find noevidence for a dominant dark matter component within the optical disk of spiralgalaxies. this is equally true of the s0s in our sample, which significantlyextends previous observational constraints on dark matter in these galaxies.the predicted kinematics do deviate slightly but systematically from theobservations in the bulge region of most galaxies, but we argue that this isconsistent with the claim that boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are bars viewededge-on.
