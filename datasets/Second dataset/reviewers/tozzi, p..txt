0902.2930	the vla survey of the chandra deep field south iii: x-ray spectral  properties of radio sources	we discuss the x-ray properties of the radio sources detected in a deep 1.4and 5 ghz vla radio survey of the extended chandra deep field south (e-cdfs).among the 266 radio sources detected, we find 89 sources (1/3 of the total)with x-ray counterparts in the catalog of the 1ms exposure of the central 0.08deg^2 (giacconi et al. 2002; alexander et al. 2003) or in the catalog of the250 ks exposure of the 0.3 deg^2 e-cdfs field (lehmer et al. 2005). for 76(85%) of these sources we have spectroscopic or photometric redshifts, andtherefore we are able to derive their intrinsic properties from x-ray spectralanalysis, namely intrinsic absorption and total x-ray luminosities. we findthat the population of submillijansky radio sources with x-ray counterparts iscomposed of a mix of roughly 1/3 star forming galaxies and 2/3 agn. thedistribution of intrinsic absorption among x-ray detected radio sources isdifferent from that of the x-ray selected sample. namely, the fraction of lowabsorption sources is at least two times larger than that of x-ray selectedsources in the cdfs. this is mostly due to the larger fraction of star forminggalaxies present among the x-ray detected radio sources. if we investigate thedistribution of intrinsic absorption among sources with l_x&gt;10^42 erg s^-1 inthe hard 2-10 kev band (therefore in the agn luminosity regime), we findagreement between the x-ray population with and without radio emission. ingeneral, radio detected x-ray agn are not more heavily obscured than the nonradio detected agn. this argues against the use of radio surveys as anefficient way to search for the missing population of strongly absorbed agn.

(b) what is the history of metalenrichment of the igm? (c) what physical mechanisms determine the presence ofcool cores in galaxy clusters? (d) how is the appearance of proto-clusters atz~2 related to the peak of star formation activity and bh accretion? we showthat a highly efficient observational strategy to address these questions is tocarry out a large-area x-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to thatof deep chandra and xmm pointings, but extending over several thousands ofsquare degrees. a similar survey can only be carried out with a wide-fieldx-ray telescope (wfxt), which combines a high survey speed with a sharp psfacross the entire fov. we emphasize the important synergies that wfxt will havewith a number of future ground-based and space telescopes, covering from theradio to the x-ray bands. finally, we discuss the immense legacy value thatsuch a mission will have for extragalactic astronomy at large.

0904.2740	the cluster gas mass fraction as a cosmological probe: a revised study	(abriged) we present the analysis of the baryonic content of 52 x-rayluminous galaxy clusters observed with chandra in the redshift range 0.3-1.273.we use the deprojected x-ray surface brightness profiles and the measuredvalues of the gas temperature to recover the gas and total mass profiles. byassuming that galaxy clusters are representative of the cosmic baryon budget,the distribution of the cluster baryon fraction in the hottest (t&gt; 4 kev)systems as a function of redshift is used to constrain the cosmologicalparameters. we discuss how our constraints are affected by several systematics,namely the isothermality, the assumed baryon fraction in stars, the depletionparameter and the sample selection. by using only the cluster baryon fractionas a proxy for the cosmological parameters, we obtain that omega is very wellconstrained at the value of 0.35 with a relative statistical uncertainty of 11%(1 sigma level; w=-1) and a further systematic error of about (-6,+7)%. on theother hand, constraints on lambda (without the prior of flat geometry) and w(using the prior of flat geometry) are definitely weaker due to the presence oflarger statistical and systematic uncertainties (of the order of 40 per cent onlambda and larger than 50 per cent on w). if the wmap 5-year best-fit resultsare assumed to fix the cosmological parameters, we limit the contributionsexpected from non-thermal pressure support and icm clumpiness to be lower thanabout 10 per cent, leaving also room to accommodate baryons not accounted foreither in the x-ray emitting plasma or in stars of the order of 18 per cent ofthe total cluster baryon budget.

1001.2232	three candidate clusters of galaxies at redshift ~1.8: the "missing  link" between protoclusters and local clusters?	we present three candidate clusters of galaxies at redshifts most likelybetween 1.7 and 2.0, which corresponds to a fundamentally unexplored epoch ofclusters evolution. the candidates were found by studying the environmentaround our newly selected sample of "beacons" low-luminosity (fri) radiogalaxies in the cosmos field. in this way we intend to use the fact that fri atlow z are almost invariably located in clusters of galaxies. we use the mostaccurate photometric redshifts available to date, derived by the cosmoscollaboration using photometry with a set of 30 filters, to look forthree-dimensional space over-densities around our objects. three out of thefive fris in our sample which possess reliable photometric redshifts betweenz_phot = 1.7 and 2.0 display overdensities that together are statisticallysignificant at the 4-sigma level, compared to field counts, arguing for thepresence of rich clusters of galaxies in their mpc environment. these firstresults show that the new method for finding high-z clusters we recentlyproposed, which makes use of low power fri radio galaxies instead of the morepowerful frii sources often used in the literature to date, is returning verypromising candidates.

1006.3255	apparent high metallicity in 3-4 kev galaxy clusters: the inverse  iron-bias in action in the case of the merging cluster abell 2028	recent work based on a global measurement of the icm properties find evidencefor an increase of the iron abundance in galaxy clusters with temperaturearound 2-4 kev up to a value about 3 times larger than that typical of very hotclusters. we have started a study of the metal distribution in these objectsfrom the sample of baumgartner et al. (2005), aiming at resolving spatially themetal content of the icm. we report here on a 42ks xmm observation of the firstobject of the sample, the cluster abell 2028. the xmm observation reveals acomplex structure of the cluster over scale of 300 kpc, showing an interactionbetween two sub-clusters in cometary-like configurations. at the leading edgesof the two substructures cold fronts have been detected. the core of the mainsubcluster is likely hosting a cool corona. we show that a one-component fitfor this region returns a biased high metallicity. this inverse iron bias isdue to the behavior of the fitting code in shaping the fe-l complex. inpresence of a multi-temperature structure of the icm, the best-fit metallicityis artificially higher when the projected spectrum is modeled with a singletemperature component and it is not related to the presence of both fe-l andfe-k emission lines in the spectrum. after accounting for the bias, the overallabundance of the cluster is consistent with the one typical of hotter, moremassive clusters. we caution the interpretation of high abundances inferredwhen fitting a single thermal component to spectra derived from relativelylarge apertures in 3-4 kev clusters, because the inverse iron bias can bepresent. most of the inferences trying to relate high abundances in 3-4 kevclusters to fundamental physical processes will likely have to be revised.

1009.1140	the great observatories origins deep survey: constraints on the lyman  continuum escape fraction distribution of lyman--break galaxies at 3.4&lt;z&lt;4.5	we use ultra-deep ultraviolet vlt/vimos intermediate-band and vlt/fors1narrow-band imaging in the goods southern field to derive limits on thedistribution of the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing radiation for l &gt;~l*(z=3) lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at redshift 3.4--4.5. only one lbg, atredshift z=3.795, is detected in its lyman continuum (lyc; s/n~5.5), thehighest redshift galaxy currently known with a direct detection. itsultraviolet morphology is quite compact (r_eff=0.8, kpc physical). three out ofseven agn are also detected in their lyc, including one at redshift z=3.951 andz850 = 26.1. from stacked data (lbgs) we set an upper limit to the averagef_esc in the range 5%--20%, depending on the how the data are selected (e.g.,by magnitude and/or redshift). we undertake extensive monte carlo simulationsthat take into account intergalactic attenuation, stellar population synthesismodels, dust extinction and photometric noise in order to explore the momentsof the distribution of the escaping radiation. various distributions(exponential, log-normal and gaussian) are explored. we find that the medianf_esc is lower than ~6% with an 84% percentile limit not larger than 20%. ifthis result remains valid for fainter lbgs down to current observationallimits, then the lbg population might be not sufficient to account for theentire photoionization budget at the redshifts considered here, with the exactdetails dependent upon the assumed ionizing background and qso contributionthereto. it is possible that f_esc depends on the uv luminosity of thegalaxies, with fainter galaxies having higher f_esc, and estimates of f_escfrom a sample of faint lbg from the hudf (i775&lt;28.5) are in broad quantitativeagreement with such a scenario.

1010.6208	simulating the wfxt sky	we investigate the scientific impact of the wide field x-ray telescopemission. we present simulated images and spectra of x-ray sources as observedfrom the three surveys planned for the nominal 5-year wfxt lifetime. the goalof these simulations is to provide wfxt images of the extragalactic sky indifferent energy bands based on accurate description of agn populations, normaland star forming galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies. the images arerealized using a detailed psf model, instrumental and physicalbackgrounds/foregrounds, accurate model of the effective area and the relatedvignetting effect. thanks to this comprehensive modelization of the wfxtproperties, the simulated images can be used to evaluate the flux limits fordetection of point and extended sources, the effect of source confusion at veryfaint fluxes, and in general the efficiency of detection algorithms. we alsosimulate the spectra of the detected sources, in order to address specificscience topics which are unique to wfxt. among them, we focus on thecharacterization of the intra cluster medium (icm) of high-z clusters, and inparticular on the measurement of the redshift from the icm spectrum in order tobuild a cosmological sample of galaxy clusters. the end-to-end simulationprocedure presented here, is a valuable tool in optimizing the mission design.therefore, these simulations can be used to reliably characterize the wfxtdiscovery space and to verify the connection between mission requirements andscientific goals. thanks to this effort, we can conclude on firm basis that anx-ray mission optimized for surveys like wfxt is necessary to bring x-rayastronomy at the level of the optical, ir, submm and radio wavebands asforeseen in the coming decade.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

1102.4714	a compton-thick agn at z~5 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south	we report the discovery of a compton-thick active galactic nucleus (agn) atz=4.76 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south. this object was selected as av-band dropout in hst/acs images and previously recognized as an agn fromoptical spectroscopy. the 4 ms chandra observations show a significant(~4.2sigma) x-ray detection at the v-band dropout position. the x-ray sourcedisplays a hardness ratio of hr=0.23+-0.24, which, for a source at z~5, ishighly suggestive of compton-thick absorption. the source x-ray spectrum isseen above the background level in the energy range of ~0.9-4 kev, i.e., in therest-frame energy range of ~5-23 kev. when fixing the photon index togamma=1.8, the measured column density is n_h=1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5} x 10^{24}cm^{-2}, which is compton-thick. to our knowledge, this is the most distantheavily obscured agn, confirmed by x-ray spectral analysis, discovered so far.the intrinsic (de-absorbed), rest-frame luminosity in the 2-10 kev band is ~2.5x 10^{44} erg s^{-1}, which places this object among type-2 quasars. thespectral energy distribution shows that massive star formation is associatedwith obscured black hole accretion. this system may have then been caughtduring a major co-eval episode of black hole and stellar mass assembly at earlytimes. the measure of the number density of heavily obscured agn at highredshifts will be crucial to reconstruct the bh/galaxy evolution history fromthe beginning.

1111.3285	the radio - x-ray relation as a star formation indicator: results from  the vla--e-cdfs survey	in order to trace the instantaneous star formation rate at high redshift, andhence help understanding the relation between the different emission mechanismsrelated to star formation, we combine the recent 4 ms chandra x-ray data andthe deep vla radio data in the extended chandra deep field south region. wefind 268 sources detected both in the x-ray and radio band. the availability ofredshifts for $\sim 95$ of the sources in our sample allows us to derivereliable luminosity estimates and the intrinsic properties from x-ray analysisfor the majority of the objects. with the aim of selecting sources powered bystar formation in both bands, we adopt classification criteria based on x-rayand radio data, exploiting the x-ray spectral features and time variability,taking advantage of observations scattered across more than ten years. weidentify 43 objects consistent with being powered by star formation. we alsoadd another 111 and 70 star forming candidates detected only in the radio orx-ray band, respectively. we find a clear linear correlation between radio andx-ray luminosity in star forming galaxies over three orders of magnitude and upto $z \sim 1.5$. we also measure a significant scatter of the order of 0.4 dex,higher than that observed at low redshift, implying an intrinsic scattercomponent. the correlation is consistent with that measured locally, and noevolution with redshift is observed. using a locally calibrated relationbetween the sfr and the radio luminosity, we investigate the l_x(2-10kev)-sfrrelation at high redshift. the comparison of the star formation rate measuredin our sample with some theoretical models for the milky way and m31, twotypical spiral galaxies, indicates that, with current data, we can tracetypical spirals only at z&lt;0.2, and strong starburst galaxies withstar-formation rates as high as $\sim 100 m_\odot yr^{-1}$, up to $z\sim 1.5$.

1204.1977	the 4 ms chandra deep field-south number counts apportioned by source  class: pervasive active galactic nuclei and the ascent of normal galaxies	we present 0.5-2 kev, 2-8 kev, 4-8 kev, and 0.5-8 kev cumulative anddifferential number counts (logn-logs) measurements for the recently completed~4 ms chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) survey, the deepest x-ray survey todate. we implement a new bayesian approach, which allows reliable calculationof number counts down to flux limits that are factors of ~1.9-4.3 times fainterthan the previously deepest number-counts investigations. in the soft band, themost sensitive bandpass in our analysis, the ~4 ms cdf-s reaches a maximumsource density of ~27,800 deg-2. by virtue of the exquisite x-ray andmultiwavelength data available in the cdf-s, we are able to measure the numbercounts from a variety of source populations (active galactic nuclei [agns],normal galaxies, and galactic stars) and subpopulations (as a function ofredshift, agn absorption, luminosity, and galaxy morphology), and test modelsthat describe their evolution. we find that agns still dominate the x-raynumber counts down to the faintest flux levels for all bands and reach alimiting soft-band source density of ~14,900 deg-2, the highest reliable agnsource density measured at any wavelength. we find that the normal-galaxycounts rise rapidly near the flux limits, and at the limiting soft-band flux,reach source densities of ~12,700 deg-2 and make up 46+/-5% of the total numbercounts. the rapid rise of the galaxy counts toward faint fluxes, andsignificant normal-galaxy contributions to the overall number counts, indicatethat normal galaxies will overtake agns just below the ~4 ms soft-band fluxlimit and will provide a numerically significant new x-ray source population infuture surveys that reach below the ~4 ms sensitivity limit. we show that afuture ~10 ms cdf-s would allow for a significant increase in x-ray detectedsources, with many of the new sources being cosmologically distant (z &gt; 0.6)normal galaxies.

(2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band hst photometry acquired aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). obtainedas part of the clash-vlt survey, the vimos medium-resolution spectra of thissource show a very faint continuum between ~8700a and ~9300a and a prominentemission line at 8643a, which can be readily identified with lyman-alpha atz=6.110. the emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a morepronounced red wing. the rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ew=79+-10a.after correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (sfr) estimatedfrom the lya line is sfr(lya)=11 m_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the uv datais sfr(uv)=3 m_{sol}/yr. we estimate that the effective radius of the source isr_e&lt;~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density sigma_{sfr}&gt;6m_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the kennicutt-schmidt relation, a gas surface massdensity sigma_{gas}&gt;10^3 m_{sol}/pc^2. our results support the idea that thismagnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 l^* at z=6,with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. future follow-up observationswith alma will provide valuable insight into the sfr and molecular gas contentof this source. in the spirit of the frontier fields initiative, we alsopublish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other backgroundobjects which will help improving the strong lensing model of this galaxycluster.

1403.4979	intra cluster light properties in the clash-vlt cluster macs  j1206.2-0847	we aim at constraining the assembly history of clusters by studying the intracluster light (icl) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction ofbaryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias usingdifferent icl detection techniques. we developed an automated method, galtoicl,based on the software galapagos to obtain a refined version of typical bcg+iclmaps. we applied this method to our test case macs j1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the clash sample. using deepmulti-band subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (sb) profile ofthe bcg+icl and we studied the icl morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to r500. we repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theicl, sblimit method, i.e. a sb cut-off level, to compare the results. the mostpeculiar feature of the icl in macs1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the se direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a post starburst galaxy. this suggests an interactionbetween the bcg and this galaxy that dates back to t &lt;= 1.5 gyr. the bcg+iclstellar content is 8% of m_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. thesblimit method provides systematically higher icl fractions and this effect islarger at lower sb limits. this is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the icl. though more time consuming, thegaltoicl method provides safer icl detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. this is one of the few icl study at redshift z &gt; 0.3. atcompletion, the clash/vlt program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6.

1501.03506	ultra-deep catalog of x-ray groups in the extended chandra deep field  south	ultra-deep observations of ecdf-s with chandra and xmm-newton enable a searchfor extended x-ray emission down to an unprecedented flux of $2\times10^{-16}$ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. we present the search for the extended emission onspatial scales of 32$^{\prime\prime}$ in both chandra and xmm data, covering0.3 square degrees and model the extended emission on scales of arcminutes. wepresent a catalog of 46 spectroscopically identified groups, reaching aredshift of 1.6. we show that the statistical properties of ecdf-s, such aslogn-logs and x-ray luminosity function are broadly consistent with lcdm, withthe exception that dn/dz/d$\omega$ test reveals that a redshift range of$0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5$ in ecdf-s is sparsely populated. the lack of nearby structure,however, makes studies of high-redshift groups particularly easier both inx-rays and lensing, due to a lower level of clustered foreground. we presentone and two point statistics of the galaxy groups as well as weak-lensinganalysis to show that the detected low-luminosity systems are indeed low-masssystems. we verify the applicability of the scaling relations between the x-rayluminosity and the total mass of the group, derived for the cosmos survey tolower masses and higher redshifts probed by ecdf-s by means of stacked weaklensing and clustering analysis, constraining any possible departures to bewithin 30% in mass. abridged.

1503.05607	clash-vlt: substructure in the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847 from  kinematics of galaxy populations	in the effort to understand the link between the structure of galaxy clustersand their galaxy populations, we focus on macsj1206.2-0847 at z~0.44 and probeits substructure in the projected phase space through the spectrophotometricproperties of a large number of galaxies from the clash-vlt survey. ouranalysis is mainly based on an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 445 membergalaxies, mostly acquired with vimos@vlt as part of our eso large programme,sampling the cluster out to a radius ~2r200 (4 mpc). we classify 412 galaxiesas passive, with strong hdelta absorption (red and blue galaxies, and withemission lines from weak to very strong. a number of tests for substructuredetection are applied to analyze the galaxy distribution in the velocity space,in 2d space, and in 3d projected phase-space. studied in its entirety, thecluster appears as a large-scale relaxed system with a few secondary, minoroverdensities in 2d distribution. we detect no velocity gradients or evidenceof deviations in local mean velocities. the main feature is the wnw-eseelongation. the analysis of galaxy populations per spectral class highlights amore complex scenario. the passive galaxies and red strong hdelta galaxiestrace the cluster center and the wnw-ese elongated structure. the red stronghdelta galaxies also mark a secondary, dense peak ~2 mpc at ese. the emissionline galaxies cluster in several loose structures, mostly outside r200. theobservational scenario agrees with macs j1206.2-0847 having wnw-ese as thedirection of the main cluster accretion, traced by passive galaxies and redstrong hdelta galaxies. the red strong hdelta galaxies, interpreted aspoststarburst galaxies, date a likely important event 1-2 gyr before the epochof observation. the emission line galaxies trace a secondary, ongoing infallwhere groups are accreted along several directions.

1504.02107	the evolution of the spatially-resolved metal abundance in galaxy  clusters up to z=1.4	we present the combined analysis of the metal content of 83 objects in theredshift range 0.09-1.39, and spatially-resolved in the 3 bins (0-0.15,0.15-0.4, &gt;0.4) r500, as obtained with similar analysis using xmm-newton datain leccardi &amp; molendi (2008) and baldi et al. (2012). we use the pseudo-entropyratio to separate the cool-core (cc) cluster population, where the central gasdensity tends to be relatively higher, cooler and more metal rich, from thenon-cool-core systems. the average, redshift-independent, metal abundancemeasured in the 3 radial bins decrease moving outwards, with a mean metallicityin the core that is even 3 (two) times higher than the value of 0.16 times thesolar abundance in anders &amp; grevesse (1989) estimated at r&gt;0.4 r500 in cc (ncc)objects. we find that the values of the emission-weighted metallicity arewell-fitted by the relation $z(z) = z_0 (1+z)^{-\gamma}$ at given radius. asignificant scatter, intrinsic to the observed distribution and of the order of0.05-0.15, is observed below 0.4 r500. the nominal best-fit value of $\gamma$is significantly different from zero in the inner cluster regions ($\gamma =1.6 \pm 0.2$) and in cc clusters only. these results are confirmed also with abootstrap analysis, which provides a still significant negative evolution inthe core of cc systems (p&gt;99.9 per cent). no redshift-evolution is observedwhen regions above the core (r &gt; 0.15 r500) are considered. a reasonable goodfit of both the radial and redshift dependence is provided from the functionalform $z(r,z)=z_0 (1+(r/0.15 r500)^2)^{-\beta} (1+z)^{-\gamma}$, with $(z_0,\beta, \gamma) = (0.83 \pm 0.13, 0.55 \pm 0.07, 1.7 \pm 0.6)$ in cc clustersand $(0.39 \pm 0.04, 0.37 \pm 0.15, 0.5 \pm 0.5)$ for ncc systems. our resultsrepresent the most extensive study of the spatially-resolved metal distributionin the cluster plasma as function of redshift.

1512.04555	clash-vlt: a highly precise strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster  rxc j2248.7-4431 (abell s1063) and prospects for cosmography	we perform a comprehensive study of the total mass distribution of the galaxycluster rxcj2248 ($z=0.348$) with a set of high-precision strong lensingmodels, which take advantage of extensive spectroscopic information on manymultiply lensed systems. in the effort to understand and quantify inherentsystematics in parametric strong lensing modelling, we explore a collection of22 models where we use different samples of multiple image families,parametrizations of the mass distribution and cosmological parameters. as inputinformation for the strong lensing models, we use the clash hst imaging dataand spectroscopic follow-up observations, carried out with the vimos and musespectrographs, to identify bona-fide multiple images. a total of 16 backgroundsources, over the redshift range $1.0-6.1$, are multiply lensed into 47 images,24 of which are spectroscopically confirmed and belong to 10 individualsources. the cluster total mass distribution and underlying cosmology in themodels are optimized by matching the observed positions of the multiple imageson the lens plane. we show that with a careful selection of a sample ofspectroscopically confirmed multiple images, the best-fit model reproducestheir observed positions with a rms of $0.3$ in a fixed flat $\lambda$cdmcosmology, whereas the lack of spectroscopic information lead to biases in thevalues of the model parameters. allowing cosmological parameters to varytogether with the cluster parameters, we find (at $68\%$ confidence level)$\omega_m=0.25^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$ and $w=-1.07^{+0.16}_{-0.42}$ for a flat$\lambda$cdm model, and $\omega_m=0.31^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and$\omega_\lambda=0.38^{+0.38}_{-0.27}$ for a universe with $w=-1$ and freecurvature. using toy models mimicking the overall configuration of rxcj2248, weestimate the impact of the line of sight mass structure on the positional rmsto be $0.3\pm 0.1$.(abridged)

astro-ph;0112184	chandra deep field south: the 1msec catalog	in this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposureof the chandra deep field south (cdfs), using acis-i on the chandra x-rayobservatory. catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two differentmethods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the sextractoralgorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for chandraobservations. the detection threshold has been set in order to have less than10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. we subdivided thecatalog into four sections. the primary list consists of objects common to thetwo detection methods. two secondary lists contain sources which were detectedby: 1) the sextractor algorithm alone and 2) the wavelet technique alone. thefourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. the flux limitsat the aimpoint for the soft (0.5--2 kev) and hard (2--10 kev) bands are5.5e-17 erg/s/cm^2 and 4.5e-16 erg/s/cm^2 respectively. the total number ofsources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5--2 kev band, and 251in the 2--10 kev band.  we also present optical identifications for the catalogued sources. ourprimary optical data is r band imaging to a depth of r~26.5 (vega). we foundthat the r-band/chandra offsets are small, ~1 arcsec. coordinatecross-correlation finds 85% of the chandra sources covered in r to havecounterparts within the 3-sigma error box (&gt;~1.5 arcsec depending on off-axisangle and signal-to-noise). the unidentified fraction of sources, approximately~10--15 %, is close to the limit expected from the observed x-ray flux tor-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.

astro-ph;0205471	the effect of non--gravitational gas heating in groups and clusters of  galaxies	we present a set of gas-dynamical simulations of galaxy groups and clustersaimed at exploring the effect of non-gravitational heating. we use gasoline, aparallel tree+sph code, to simulate the formation of four cosmic halos withtemperature 0.5&lt;t&lt;8 kev. non-gravitational heating is implemented in twodifferent ways: (1) by imposing a minimum entropy floor at a given redshift,1&lt;z&lt;5; (2) by gradually heating gas, proportionally to the sn rate expectedfrom semi-analytical modeling of galaxy formation. our main results are thefollowing. (a) an extra heating energy of about 1 kev per gas particle isrequired to reproduce the observed lx-t relation, independent of whether it isprovided so as to create an entropy floor of 50-100 kev cm^2, or is modulatedin redshift; our sn feedback recipe provides only 1/3 kev/part. (b) the m-trelation is almost unaffected by non-gravitational heating and follows the mt^{3/2} scaling, with a normalization ~40% higher than observed, independent ofthe heating scheme. the inclusion of cooling in a run of a small group has theeffects of increasing t_ew by ~30%, possibly reconciling simulated and observedm-t relations, and of decreasing lx by ~40%. in spite of the inclusion of snfeedback energy, almost 40% of the gas becomes cold, in excess of currentobservational estimates.

astro-ph;0409041	a new photometric technique for the joint selection of star-forming and  passive galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5	a simple two color selection based on b-, z-, and k- band photometry isproposed for culling galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 in k-selected samples andclassifying them as star-forming or passive systems. the method is calibratedon the highly complete spectroscopic redshift database of the k20 survey,verified with simulations and tested on other datasets. requiringbzk=(z-k)-(b-z)&gt;-0.2 (ab) allows to select actively star-forming galaxies atz&gt;1.4, independently on their dust reddening. instead, objects with bzk&lt;-0.2and (z-k)&gt;2.5 (ab) colors include passively evolving galaxies at z&gt;1.4, oftenwith spheroidal morphologies. simple recipes to estimate the reddening, sfrsand masses of bzk-selected galaxies are derived, and calibrated on k&lt;20galaxies. based on their uv (reddening-corrected), x-ray and radioluminosities, the bzk-selected star-forming galaxies with k&lt;20 turn out to haveaverage sfr ~ 200 msun yr^-1, and median reddening e(b-v)~0.4. besides missingthe passively evolving galaxies, the uv selection appears to miss some relevantfraction of the z~2 star-forming galaxies with k&lt;20, and hence of the(obscured) star-formation rate density at this redshift. the high sfrs andmasses add to other existing evidence that these z=2 star-forming galaxies maybe among the precursors of z=0 early-type galaxies. theoretical models cannotreproduce simultaneously the space density of both passively evolving andhighly star-forming galaxies at z=2. in view of spitzer space telescopeobservations, an analogous technique based on the rjl photometry is proposed tocomplement the bzk selection and to identify massive galaxies at 2.5&lt;z&lt;4.0.these color criteria should help in completing the census of the stellar massand of the star-formation rate density at high redshift (abridged).

astro-ph;0409707	simulating the soft x-ray excess in clusters of galaxies	the detection of excess of soft x-ray or extreme ultraviolet (euv) radiation,above the thermal contribution from the hot intracluster medium (icm), has beena controversial subject ever since the initial discovery of this phenomenon. weuse a large--scale hydrodynamical simulation of a concordance $\lambda$cdmmodel, to investigate the possible thermal origin for such an excess in a setof 20 simulated clusters having temperatures in the range 1--7 kev. simulatedclusters are analysed by mimicking the observational procedure applied torosat--pspc data, which for the first time showed evidences for the soft x-rayexcess. for cluster--centric distances $0.4&lt; r/r_{\rm vir}&lt; 0.7$ we detect asignificant excess in most of the simulated clusters, whose relative amountchanges from cluster to cluster and, for the same cluster, by changing theprojection direction. in about 30 per cent of the cases, the soft x-ray flux ismeasured to be at least 50 per cent larger than predicted by theone--temperature plasma model. we find that this excess is generated in mostcases within the cluster virialized regions. it is mainly contributed bylow--entropy and high--density gas associated with merging sub--halos, ratherthan to diffuse warm gas. only in a few cases the excess arises fromfore/background groups observed in projection, while no evidence is found for asignificant contribution from gas lying within large--scale filaments. wecompute the distribution of the relative soft excess, as a function of thecluster--centric distance, and compare it with the observational result bybonamente et al. (2003) for the coma cluster. similar to observations, we findthat the relative excess increases with the distance from the cluster center,with no significant excess detected for $r&lt;0.4r_{\rm vir}$.

astro-ph;0502542	the chandra deep field south/goods survey. optically faint x-ray sources	we provide important new constraints on the nature and redshift distributionof optically faint (r&gt;25) x-ray sources in the chandra deep field south survey.we show that we can derive accurate photometric redshifts for thespectroscopically unidentified sources thus maximizing the redshiftcompleteness for the whole x-ray sample. our new redshift distribution for thex-ray source population is in better agreement with that predicted by x-raybackground synthesis models; however, we still find an overdensity of lowredshift (z&lt;1) sources. the optically faint sources are mainly x-ray absorbedagn, as determined from direct x-ray spectral analysis and other diagnostics.many of these optically faint sources have high (&gt;10) x-ray-to-optical fluxratios. we also find that ~71% of them are well fitted with the sed of anearly-type galaxy with &lt;z_phot&gt;~1.9 and the remaining 29% with irregular orstarburst galaxies mainly at z_phot&gt;3. we estimate that 23% of the opticallyfaint sources are x-ray absorbed qsos. the overall population of x-ray absorbedqsos contributes a ~15% fraction of the [2-10] kev x-ray background (xrb)whereas current xrb synthesis models predict a ~38% contribution.

astro-ph;0503164	the assembly history of field spheroidals: evolution of mass-to-light  ratios and signatures of recent star formation	we present a comprehensive catalog of high signal-to-noise spectra obtainedwith the deimos spectrograph on the keck ii telescope for a sample off850lp&lt;22.43 (ab) field spheroidal (e+s0s; 163) and bulge dominated disk (61)galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2. we examine the zero point, tilt andscatter of the fundamental plane (fp) as a function of redshift andmorphological properties, carefully accounting for luminosity-dependent biasesvia montecarlo simulations. the evolution of the overall fp can be representedby a mean change in effective mass-to-light ratio given by &lt;d \log (m/l_{\rmb})/dz&gt;=-0.72^{+0.07}_{-0.05}\pm0.04. however, this evolution dependssignificantly on the dynamical mass, being slower for larger masses as reportedin a previous letter. in addition, we separately show the intrinsic scatter ofthe fp increases with redshift as d(rms(m/l_{\rm b}))/dz=0.040\pm0.015.although these trends are consistent with single burst populations which formedat $z_f&gt;2$ for high mass spheroidals and z_{f}~1.2 for lower mass systems, amore realistic picture is that most of the stellar mass formed in all systemsat z&gt;2 with subsequent activity continuing to lower redshifts (z&lt;1.2). thefraction of stellar mass formed at recent times depend strongly on galacticmass, ranging from &lt;1% for masses above 10^{11.5} m_{\odot} to 20-40% below10^{11} m_{\odot}. independent support for recent activity is provided byspectroscopic ([\ion{o}{2}] emission, h\delta) and photometric (blue cores andbroad-band colors) diagnostics. via the analysis of a large sample with manyindependent diagnostics, we are able to reconcile previously disparateinterpretations of the assembly history of field spheroidals.

astro-ph;0504265	entropy amplification from energy feedback in simulated galaxy groups  and clusters	we use hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups to study theeffect of pre-heating on the entropy structure of the icm. our simulationsaccount for non-gravitational heating of the gas either by imposing a minimumentropy floor at redshift z=3, or by considering feedback by galactic windspowered by supernova (sn) energy. in the adiabatic simulations we find that theentropy is increased out to the external regions as a consequence of thetransition from clumpy to smooth accretion induced by extra heating. thisresult is in line with the predictions of the semi-analytical model by voit etal. however, the introduction of radiative cooling substantially reduces thisentropy amplification effect. while galactic winds of increasing strength areeffective in regulating star formation, they have a negligible effect on theentropy profile of cluster-sized halos. only in models where the action of thewinds is complemented with diffuse heating corresponding to a pre-collapseentropy do we find a sizable entropy amplification out to the virial radius ofthe groups. observational evidence for entropy amplification in the outskirtsof galaxy clusters and groups therefore favours a scenario for feedback thatdistributes heating energy in a more diffuse way than predicted by the modelfor galactic winds from sn explosions explored here.

astro-ph;0507643	properties of the diffuse x-ray background in a high-resolution  hydrodynamical simulation	we study the properties of the diffuse x-ray background by using the resultsof a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the concordance lambdacdm model.the simulation follows gravitational and gas dynamics and includes a treatmentof physical processes like radiative cooling, star formation and supernovafeedback. from the simulation outputs, we produce a set of two-dimensional mapsof the intergalactic medium x-ray emission integrated over redshift. we findthat the signal in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band is lognormally distributed with amean intensity of about 4 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2; approximately 40 percent of the emission originates from warm-hot gas (defined as baryons with10^5&lt;t&lt;10^7 k), and 90 per cent comes from structures at z&lt;0.9. since thespectrum is soft, being mostly provided by the intergalactic medium at lowtemperature, the total mean intensity in the hard (2-10 kev) x-ray band issmaller by a factor of about 4. in order to constrain the physical processesincluded in our simulation, we compare our results with the observed upperlimit (1.2 +/- 0.3) 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2 of the soft x-ray emission dueto diffuse gas. to this purpose, we remove the contributions of observableextended objects (groups and clusters of galaxies) from the simulated maps byadopting different detectability criteria which are calibrated on theproperties of systems at intermediate redshifts observed by chandra. we showthat the simulated diffuse soft x-ray emission is consistent with the presentobserved upper limit. however, if future measurements will decrease the levelof the unresolved x-ray background by a factor of two, a more efficientfeedback mechanism should be required to suppress the soft emission of the gasresiding within filaments and group-size haloes.

astro-ph;9802185	diffuse baryons in groups and clusters of galaxies	to predict the x-ray observables associated to the diffuse baryons inclusters of galaxies, we develop a new physical approach to model such a hotintra-cluster plasma. such approach is based on punctuated equilibria. andcomprises the following blocks: monte carlo ``merging histories'' of darkmatter potential wells; the central hydrostatic disposition for the icp, resetto a new equilibrium after each merging episode; conditions of shock, or ofclosely adiabatic compression at the boundary with the external gas, preheatedby stellar energy feedbacks. we predict the l-t relation, consistent with thedata as for shape and scatter. this we combine with the mass distributionprovided by the hierarchical clustering for different cobe-normalized cdmmodels, to predict the z-resolved luminosity functions, the source counts, theredshift distributions and contribution of the unresolved groups and clustersto the soft x-ray background. when compared with the recent rosat surveys, ourresults confirm that the critical cosmology with standard cdm is ruled out byits overproduction of local clusters. on account of underproduction, instead,we rule out open cosmologies except for a narrow range around \omega_o=0.5;even there, we find the consistency with the full data base to be hardlymarginal. for \omega_o=0.3 in flat geometry, we obtain acceptable fits. for thetilted cdm perturbation spectrum with high baryonic content in the criticaluniverse, we obtain marginal consistency. finally, we discuss the effectivelimitations of x-ray clusters and groups as cosmological signposts, and theirbrighter prospects toward the astrophysics of the icp and the cosmogony oflarge, high-contrast structures.

astro-ph;9810189	properties of galaxy clusters: mass and correlation functions	we analyse parallel n-body simulations of three cold dark matter (cdm)universes to study the abundance and clustering of galaxy clusters. thesimulations cover a volume comparable to the forthcoming sdss. we are able tomake robust measurements of cluster properties to a redshift larger than unity.we extract halos using two independent, public domain group finders (fof &amp; hop)and find consistent results. the correlation function of clusters is in verygood agreement with a simple analytic prescription based upon a lagrangianbiasing scheme developed by mo &amp; white (1996) and the press-schechter (ps)formalism for the mass function. the r_0--d_c relation for the open cdm modelis in good agreement with the results from the apm cluster survey. the scdmuniverse shows a robust deviation in the shape and evolution of the massfunction when compared with that predicted by the ps formalism. critical modelswith a low sigma_8 normalization or small shape parameter gamma show an excessof massive clusters compared with the ps prediction. when cluster normalized,the scdm universe at z =1 contains 10 times more clusters with temperaturesgreater than 7kev, compared with the ps prediction. the agreement between theanalytic and n-body mass functions of scdm can be improved if the value of thedelta_c (the extrapolated linear theory threshold for collapse) is revised tobe $ delta_c(z) = 1.685[(0.7/sigma_8)(1+z)]^{-0.125}. our best estimate for theamplitude of fluctuations inferred from the local cluster abundance for scdm issigma_{8} = 0.5 \pm 0.04. however, the discrepancy between the temperaturefunction predicted in a critical density universe and that observed at z=0.33(henry et al. 1998) remains.

astro-ph;9810498	hot gas in clusters of galaxies: the punctuated equilibria model	we develop a model to describe the evolution of the intra-cluster x-rayemitting baryons, as they are included in the dark matter potential wells ofgalaxy clusters evolving through subsequent merging events in the framework ofhierarchical clustering. the gas is assumed to re-adjusts to a new hydrostaticequilibrium after each merging event. before merging it is gravitationallyheated at the local virial temperature when bound in subclusters; at early $z$the gas is preheated by supernova activity following star formation. in detail,we compute analytically the following steps: the dynamic histories of darkmatter halos with their merging events; the associated infall of gas into ahalo, with compressions and shocks estabilishing the conditions at the clusterboundary; the updated disposition of the gas in the potential well matchingsuch conditions; the statistical convolution of the key quantities over themerging histories. the model predicts the density and surface brightnessprofiles with no free parameters; the so-called $\beta$ parameter is itself anoutcome of the model, and the polytropic index $\gamma$ is internallyconstrained to a narrow range. we obtain declining temperature profiles, andprofiles for the density and for the surface brightness shallower in groupscompared with clusters. our model groups also contain a lower baryonic fractionon average, but with a scatter considerably larger than at cluster scales.various statistics are obtained analytically upon averaging over the merginghistories. in particular, we predict in different cosmologies the statisticalcorrelation $l-t$ of luminosity with temperature; similarly we derivethecorrelation $r_x-t$ for the size of the x-ray emitting region. the intrinsicscatter in both correlations is also predicted.

astro-ph;9901017	cosmological constraints from the rosat deep cluster survey	the rosat deep cluster survey (rdcs) has provided a new large deep sample ofx-ray selected galaxy clusters. observables such as the flux number countsn(s), the redshift distribution n(z) and the x-ray luminosity function (xlf)over a large redshift baseline (z\lesssim 0.8) are used here in order toconstrain cosmological models. our analysis is based on the press-schechterapproach, whose reliability is tested against n-body simulations. following aphenomenological approach, no assumption is made a priori on the relationbetween cluster masses and observed x-ray luminosities. as a first step, we usethe local xlf from rdcs, along with the high-luminosity extension provided bythe xlf from the bcs, in order to constrain the amplitude of the powerspectrum, \sigma_8, and the shape of the local luminosity-temperature relation.we obtain \sigma_8=0.58 +/- 0.06 for omega_0=1 for open models at 90%confidence level, almost independent of the l-t shape. the density parameter\omega_0 and the evolution of the l-t relation are constrained by the rdcs xlfat z&gt;0 and the emss xlf at z=0.33, and by the rdcs n(s) and n(z) distributions.by modelling the evolution for the amplitude of the l-t relation as (1+z)^a, an\omega_0=1 model can be accommodated for the evolution of the xlf with 1&lt;a&lt;3 at90% confidence level, while \omega_0=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2} and \omega_0&lt;0.6 areimplied by a non--evolving l-t for open and flat models, respectively.

0812.2997	the vla survey of the chandra deep field south. iv. source population	we present a detailed analysis of 256 radio sources from our deep (fluxdensity limit of 42 microjy at the field centre at 1.4 ghz) chandra deep fieldsouth 1.4 and 5 ghz vla survey. the radio population is studied by using awealth of multi-wavelength information in the radio, optical, and x-ray bands.the availability of redshifts for ~ 80% of the sources in our complete sampleallows us to derive reliable luminosity estimates for the majority of theobjects. x-ray data, including upper limits, for all our sources turn out to bea key factor in establishing the nature of faint radio sources. due to thefaint optical levels probed by this study, we have uncovered a population ofdistant active galactic nuclei (agn) systematically missing from many previousstudies of sub-millijansky radio source identifications. we find that, whilethe well-known flattening of the radio number counts below 1 mjy is mostly dueto star forming galaxies, these sources and agn make up an approximately equalfraction of the sub-millijansky sky, contrary to some previous results. the agninclude radio galaxies, mostly of the low-power, fanaroff-riley i type, and asignificant radio-quiet component, which amounts to approximately one fifth ofthe total sample. the ratio of radio to optical luminosity depends more onradio luminosity, rather than being due to optical absorption.
