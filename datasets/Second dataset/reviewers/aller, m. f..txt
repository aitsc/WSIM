0812.3947	mojave: monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments. v. multi-epoch  vlba images	we present images from a long term program (mojave: monitoring of jets in agnwith vlba experiments) to survey the structure and evolution of parsec-scalejet phenomena associated with bright radio-loud active galaxies in the northernsky. the observations consist of 2424 15 ghz vlba images of a completeflux-density limited sample of 135 agn above declination -20 degrees, spanningthe period 1994 august to 2007 september. these data were acquired as part ofthe mojave and 2 cm survey programs, and from the vlba archive. the sampleselection criteria are based on multi-epoch parsec-scale (vlba) flux density,and heavily favor highly variable and compact blazars. the sample includesnearly all the most prominent blazars in the northern sky, and is well-suitedfor statistical analysis and comparison with studies at other wavelengths. ourmulti-epoch and stacked-epoch images show 94% of the sample to have apparentone-sided jet morphologies, most likely due to the effects of relativisticbeaming. of the remaining sources, five have two-sided parsec-scale jets, andthree are effectively unresolved by the vlba at 15 ghz, with essentially all ofthe flux density contained within a few tenths of a milliarcsecond.

0902.0810	full polarization spectra of 3c 279	we report the results of parsec-scale, multi-frequency vlba observations ofthe core region of 3c 279 in stokes i, linear polarization, and circularpolarization. these full polarization spectra are modeled by radiative transfersimulations to constrain the magnetic field and particle properties of theparsec-scale jet in 3c 279. the polarization properties of the core region,including the amount of linear polarization, the amount and sign of faradayrotation, and the amount and sign of circular polarization can be explained bya consistent physical picture. the base of the jet is modeled as aninhomogeneous blandford-konigl style conical jet dominated by a vector-orderedpoloidal magnetic field along the jet axis, and we estimate its net magneticflux. this poloidal field is responsible for the linear and circularpolarization from this inhomogeneous component. farther down the jet themagnetic field in two homogeneous features is dominated by local shocks and asmaller fraction of vector-ordered poloidal field remains along the jet axis.in this picture, we find the jet to be kinetically dominated by protons withthe radiating particles being dominated by electrons at an approximate fractionof &gt;~ 75%. based on the amounts of faraday conversion deduced for thehomogeneous components, we find a plausible range for the lower cutoff in therelativistic particle energy spectrum to be 5 &lt;~ gamma_l &lt;~ 35. the physicalpicture described here is not unique if the observed faraday rotation anddepolarization occur in screens external to the jet; however, we find the jointexplanation of linear and circular polarization observations from a single setof magnetic fields and particle properties internal to the jet to be compellingevidence for this picture.

0902.2085	on the relation between agn gamma-ray emission and parsec-scale radio  jets	we have compared the radio emission from a sample of parsec-scale agn jets asmeasured by the vlba at 15 ghz, with their associated gamma-ray properties thatare reported in the fermi lat 3-month bright source list. we find in ourradio-selected sample that the gamma-ray photon flux correlates well with thequasi-simultaneously measured compact radio flux density. the lat-detected jetsin our radio-selected complete sample generally have higher compact radio fluxdensities, and their parsec-scale cores are brighter (i.e., have higherbrightness temperature) than the jets in the lat non-detected objects. thissuggests that the jets of bright gamma-ray agn have preferentially higherdoppler-boosting factors. in addition, agn jets tend to be found in a moreactive radio state within several months from lat-detection of their stronggamma-ray emission. this result becomes more pronounced for confirmed gamma-rayflaring sources. we identify the parsec-scale radio core as a likely locationfor both the gamma-ray and radio flares, which appear within typical timescalesof up to a few months of each other.

0905.1616	the correlated optical and radio variability of bl lacertae. webt data  analysis 1994-2005	since 1997, bl lacertae has undergone a phase of high optical activity, withthe occurrence of several prominent outbursts. starting from 1999, the wholeearth blazar telescope (webt) consortium has organized various multifrequencycampaigns on this blazar, collecting tens of thousands of data points. one ofthe main issues in the study of this huge dataset has been the search forcorrelations between the optical and radio flux variations, and for possibleperiodicities in the light curves. the analysis of the data assembled duringthe first four campaigns (comprising also archival data to cover the period1968-2003) revealed a fair optical-radio correlation in 1994-2003, with a delayof the hard radio events of ~100 days. moreover, various statistical methodssuggested the existence of a radio periodicity of ~8 years. in 2004 the webtstarted a new campaign to extend the dataset to the most recent observingseasons, in order to possibly confirm and better understand the previousresults. in this campaign we have collected and assembled about 11000 newoptical observations from twenty telescopes, plus near-ir and radio data atvarious frequencies. here, we perform a correlation analysis on the long-termr-band and radio light curves. in general, we confirm the ~100-day delay of thehard radio events with respect to the optical ones, even if longer (~200-300days) time lags are also found in particular periods. the radioquasi-periodicity is confirmed too, but the "period" seems to progressivelylengthen from 7.4 to 9.3 years in the last three cycles. the optical and radiobehaviour in the last forty years suggests a scenario where geometric effectsplay a major role. in particular, the alternation of enhanced and suppressedoptical activity (accompanied by hard and soft radio events, respectively) can

1105.5024	catching the radio flare in cta 102 i. light curve analysis	context: the blazar cta 102 (z=1.037) underwent a historical radio outburstin april 2006. this event offered a unique chance to study the physicalproperties of the jet. aims: we used multifrequency radio and mm observationsto analyze the evolution of the spectral parameters during the flare as a testof the shock-in-jet model under these extreme conditions. methods: for theanalysis of the flare we took into account that the flaring spectrum issuperimposed on a quiescent spectrum. we reconstructed the latter from archivaldata and fitted a synchrotron self-absorbed distribution of emission. theuncertainties of the derived spectral parameters were calculated using montecarlo simulations. the spectral evolution is modeled by the shock-in-jet model,and the derived results are discussed in the context of a geometrical model(varying viewing angle) and shock-shock interaction. results: the evolution ofthe flare in the turnover frequency-turnover flux density plane shows a doublepeak structure. the nature of this evolution is dicussed in the frame ofshock-in-jet models. we discard the generation of the double peak structure inthe turnover frequency-turnover flux density plane purely based on geometricalchanges (variation of the doppler factor). the detailed modeling of thespectral evolution favors a shock-shock interaction as a possible physicalmechanism behind the deviations from the standard shock-in-jet model.

1106.5162	the brightest gamma-ray flaring blazar in the sky: agile and  multi-wavelength observations of 3c 454.3 during november 2010	since 2005, the blazar 3c 454.3 has shown remarkable flaring activity at allfrequencies, and during the last four years it has exhibited more than onegamma-ray flare per year, becoming the most active gamma-ray blazar in the sky.we present for the first time the multi-wavelength agile, swift, integral, andgasp-webt data collected in order to explain the extraordinary gamma-ray flareof 3c 454.3 which occurred in november 2010. on 2010 november 20 (mjd 55520),3c 454.3 reached a peak flux (e&gt;100 mev) of f_gamma(p) = (6.8+-1.0)e-5 ph/cm2/son a time scale of about 12 hours, more than a factor of 6 higher than the fluxof the brightest steady gamma-ray source, the vela pulsar, and more than afactor of 3 brighter than its previous super-flare on 2009 december 2-3. themulti-wavelength data make a thorough study of the present event possible: thecomparison with the previous outbursts indicates a close similarity to the onethat occurred in 2009. by comparing the broadband emission before, during, andafter the gamma-ray flare, we find that the radio, optical and x-ray emissionvaries within a factor 2-3, whereas the gamma-ray flux by a factor of 10. thisremarkable behavior is modeled by an external compton component driven by asubstantial local enhancement of soft seed photons.

1107.1093	the long-lasting activity of 3c 454.3. gasp-webt and satellite  observations in 2008-2010	we present multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 from april 2008 to march2010. the radio to optical data are mostly from the gasp-webt, uv and x-raydata from swift, and gamma-ray data from the agile and fermi satellites. weimproved the calibration of optical-uv data from the uvot and om instrumentsand estimated the lyalpha flux to disentangle the contributions from differentcomponents in this spectral region. the observations reveal prominentvariability above 8 ghz. in the optical-uv band, the variability amplitudedecreases with increasing frequency due to a steadier radiation from both abroad line region and an accretion disc. the optical flux reaches nearly thesame levels in the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 observing seasons; the mm one showssimilar behaviour, whereas the gamma and x-ray flux levels rise in the secondperiod. two prominent gamma-ray flares in mid 2008 and late 2009 show adouble-peaked structure, with a variable gamma/optical flux ratio. the x-rayflux variations seem to follow the gamma-ray and optical ones by about 0.5 and1 d, respectively. we interpret the multifrequency behaviour in terms of aninhomogeneous curved jet, where synchrotron radiation of increasing wavelengthis produced in progressively outer and wider jet regions, which can changetheir orientation in time. in particular, we assume that the long-termvariability is due to this geometrical effect. by combining the optical and mmlight curves to fit the gamma and x-ray ones, we find that the gamma (x-ray)emission may be explained by inverse-comptonisation of synchrotron optical (ir)photons by their parent relativistic electrons (ssc process). a slight,variable misalignment between the synchrotron and comptonisation zones wouldexplain the increased gamma and x-ray flux levels in 2009-2010, as well as thechange in the gamma/optical flux ratio during the outbursts peaks.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1205.0490	faraday rotation in the mojave blazars: connection with gamma-ray  studies	we have conducted a survey of faraday rotation in a sample of 191 compactradio-loud agns as part of the mojave (monitoring of jets in active galacticnuclei with vlba experiments) project. the observations were carried out withthe vlba at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1 and 15.3 ghz over 12 epochs in 2006. we detectsufficiently strong linear polarization in 159 out of 211 observations tocalculate the rotation measure values, resulting in a large enough sample forstatistical analysis of the faraday rotation in blazars. these faraday rotationmeasures can be used to study the intrinsic magnetic field order andorientation in parsec-scale blazar jets. our sample includes 119 sources listedin the 1fgl or 2fgl catalogs and we detect rotation measure values in 111 outof 131 maps. of the 72 sources that are not in the gamma-ray catalogs we detectrm in 48 out of 80 maps. the median rm values of the lat-detected sources donot differ significantly from the non-lat-detected sources. nine of the sourcesin our sample have resolved enough jets to study the transverse faradayrotation structure, and we detect significant transverse rotation measuregradients in four sources. in two of these (3c~273 and 3c~454.3) there isadditional evidence to support helical magnetic field in the parsec-scale jets.the two others (0923+392 and 2230+114) require further observations to identifythe nature of the gradient. it is interesting that three of the four sourceswith significant rotation measure gradients are sources that have shown largegamma-ray flares.

1205.6746	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. viii. faraday rotation in parsec-scale agn jets	we report observations of faraday rotation measures (rms) for a sample of 191extragalactic radio jets observed within the mojave program. multifrequencyvlba observations were carried out over twelve epochs in 2006 at fourfrequencies between 8 and 15 ghz. we detect parsec-scale faraday rms in 149sources and find the quasars to have larger rms on average than bl lac objects.the median core rms are significantly higher than in the jet components. thisis especially true for quasars where we detect a significant negativecorrelation between the magnitude of the rm and the de-projected distance fromthe core. we perform detailed simulations of the observational errors of totalintensity, polarization and faraday rotation, and concentrate on the errors oftransverse faraday rm gradients in unresolved jets. our simulations show thatthe finite image restoring beam size has a significant effect on the observedrm gradients, and spurious gradients can occur due to noise in the data if thejet is less than two beams wide in polarization. we detect significanttransverse rm gradients in four sources (0923+392, 1226+023, 2230+114 and2251+158). in 1226+023 the rm is for the first time seen to change sign frompositive to negative over the transverse cuts, which supports the presence of ahelical magnetic field in the jet. in this source we also detect variations inthe jet rm over a time scale of three months, which are difficult to explainwith external faraday screens and suggest internal faraday rotation. bycomparing fractional polarization changes in jet components between the fourfrequency bands to depolarization models we find that an external purely randomfaraday screen viewed through only a few lines of sight can explain most of ourpolarization observations but in some sources, such as 1226+023 and 2251+158,internal faraday rotation is needed.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

0801.0617	the trails of superluminal jet components in 3c111	in 1996, a major radio flux-density outburst occured in the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c111. it was followed by a particularly bright plasma ejectionassociated with a superluminal jet component, which has shaped the parsec-scalestructure of 3c111 for almost a decade. here, we present results from 18 epochsof very long baseline array (vlba) observations conducted since 1995 as part ofthe vlba 2 cm survey and mojave monitoring programs. this major event allows usto study a variety of processes associated with outbursts of radio-loud agn inmuch greater detail than has been possible in other cases: the primaryperturbation gives rise to the formation of a leading and a followingcomponent, which are interpreted as a forward and a backward-shock. bothcomponents evolve in characteristically different ways and allow us to drawconclusions about the work flow of jet-production events; the expansion,acceleration and recollimation of the ejected jet plasma in an environment withsteep pressure and density gradients are revealed; trailing components areformed in the wake of the primary perturbation possibly as a result of couplingto kelvin-helmholtz instability pinching modes from the interaction of the jetwith the external medium. the interaction of the jet with its ambient medium isfurther described by the linear-polarization signature of jet componentstraveling along the jet and passing a region of steep pressure/densitygradients.

1305.6005	vlba observations of a rare multiple quasar imaging event caused by  refraction in the interstellar medium	we report on the first detection of the theoretically-predicted rarephenomenon of multiple parsec-scale imaging of an active galactic nucleusinduced by refractive effects due to localized foreground electron densityenhancements, e.g., in an au-scale plasma lens(es) in the ionized component ofthe galactic interstellar medium. we detected multiple imaging in the lowgalactic latitude (b=-2 deg) quasar 2023+335 from the 15.4 ghz mojaveobservations when the source was undergoing an ese. while the parsec-scale jetof the source normally extends along pa -20 deg, in the 28 may 2009 and 23 july2009 images a highly significant multi-component pattern of secondary images isstretched out nearly along the constant galactic latitude line with a local pa40 deg, indicating that the direction of relative motion of the plasma lens isclose to orbital. weaker but still detectable imaging patterns at similarposition angles are sporadically manifest at several other epochs. modeling theese that occurred in early 2009 and lasted ~0.14 yr, we determined that theforeground screen has a double-lens structure, with proper motion (~6.8mas/yr), and angular size (~0.27 mas). we also found that the angularseparation between the two brightest sub-images roughly follows awavelength-squared dependence expected from plasma scattering. furthermore, byanalyzing archival non-simultaneous vlba observations covering a wide frequencyrange from 1.4 to 86 ghz, we found that the scattered angular size of the vlbicore follows a $\nu^{-1.89}$ dependence, implying the presence of a turbulent,refractive dominated scattering screen that has a confined structure or istruncated transverse to the line of sight toward 2023+335.

0801.1236	radio-to-uv monitoring of ao 0235+164 by the webt and swift during the  2006--2007 outburst	the blazar ao 0235+164 was claimed to show a quasi-periodic behaviour in theradio and optical bands. moreover, an extra emission component contributing tothe uv and soft x-ray flux was detected, whose nature is not yet clear. apredicted optical outburst was observed in late 2006/early 2007. we herepresent the radio-to-optical webt light curves during the outburst, togetherwith uv data acquired by swift in the same period. we found the opticaloutburst to be as strong as the big outbursts of the past: starting from lateseptember 2006, a brightness increase of 5 mag led to the outburst peak infebruary 19-21, 2007. we also observed an outburst at mm and then at cmwavelengths, with an increasing time delay going toward lower frequenciesduring the rising phase. cross-correlation analysis indicates that the 1 mm and37 ghz flux variations lagged behind the r-band ones by about 3 weeks and 2months, respectively. these short time delays suggest that the correspondingjet emitting regions are only slightly separated and/or misaligned. incontrast, during the outburst decreasing phase the flux faded contemporaneouslyat all cm wavelengths. this abrupt change in the emission behaviour may suggestthe presence of some shutdown mechanism of intrinsic or geometric nature. thebehaviour of the uv flux closely follows the optical and near-ir one. byseparating the synchrotron and extra component contributions to the uv flux, wefound that they correlate, which suggests that the two emissions have a commonorigin.

1404.0014	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. xi. spectral distributions	we have obtained milliarcsecond-scale spectral index distributions for asample of 190 extragalactic radio jets through the mojave project. the sourceswere observed in 2006 at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1, and 15.4 ghz, and we study thefour-frequency spectrum in individual jet features. we performed detailedsimulations to study the effects of image alignment and (u,v)-plane coverage onthe spectral index maps to verify our results. the core spectral indices are onaverage flat, while the jet spectrum is in general steep with a mean index of-1.04. a simple power-law fit is often inadequate for the core regions, asexpected if the cores are partially self-absorbed. the overall jet spectrumsteepens at a rate of about -0.001 to -0.004 per deprojected parsec when movingfurther out from the core with flat spectrum radio quasars having significantlysteeper spectra than the bl lac objects. the spectrum in both types of objectsflattens at the locations of the jet components indicating particleacceleration or density enhancements along the jet. the mean spectral index atthe component locations of -0.81 corresponds to a power-law index of ~2.6 forthe electron energy distribution. we find a significant trend that jetcomponents with linear polarization parallel to the jet (magnetic fieldperpendicular to the jet) have flatter spectra, as expected for transverseshocks. compared to quasars, bl lacs have more jet components withperpendicular magnetic field alignment, which may explain their generallyflatter spectra. the overall steepening of the spectra with distance can beexplained with radiative losses if the jets are collimating or with theevolution of the high-energy cutoff in the electron spectrum if the jets areconical. this interpretation is supported by a significant correlation with theage of the component and the spectral index, with older components havingsteeper spectra.

1407.2194	constraining the physical conditions in the jets of gamma-ray flaring  blazars using centimeter-band polarimetry and radiative transfer simulations.  i. data and models for 0420-014, oj 287, and 1156+295	to investigate parsec-scale jet flow conditions during gev gamma-ray flaresdetected by the fermi large angle telescope, we obtained centimeter-band totalflux density and linear polarization monitoring observations from 2009.5through 2012.5 with the 26-meter michigan radio telescope for a sample ofcore-dominated blazars. we use these data to constrain radiative transfersimulations incorporating propagating shocks oriented at an arbitrary angle tothe flow direction in order to set limits on the jet flow and shock parametersduring flares temporally associated with gamma-ray flares in 0420-014, oj 287,and 1156+295; these agn exhibited the expected signature of shocks in thelinear polarization data. both the number of shocks comprising an individualradio outburst (3-4) and the range of the compression ratios of the individualshocks (0.5-0.8) are similar in all three sources; the shocks are found to beforward-moving with respect to the flow. while simulations incorporatingtransverse shocks provide good fits for 0420-014 and 1156+295, oblique shocksare required for modeling the oj~287 outburst, and an unusually-low value ofthe low energy cutoff of the radiating particles' energy distribution is alsoidentified. our derived viewing angles and shock speeds are consistent withindependent vlba results. while a random component dominates the jet magneticfield, as evidenced by the low fractional linear polarization, to reproduce theobserved spectral character requires that a significant fraction of themagnetic field energy is in an ordered axial component. both straight and lowpitch angle helical field lines are viable scenarios.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02019	the extreme gamma-ray blazar s5 0716+714: jet conditions from radio-band  variability and radiative transfer modeling	as part of a program to identify the physical conditions in the jets ofgamma-ray-flaring blazars detected by fermi, including the role of shocks inthe production of high-energy flaring, we obtained 4 years of 3-frequency,centimeter-band total flux density and linear polarization monitoringobservations of the radio-bright blazar s5 0716+714 with the university ofmichigan 26-m paraboloid. light curves constructed from these data exhibit aseries of rapid, high-amplitude, centimeter-band total flux density outbursts,and changes in the linear polarization consistent with the passage of shocksduring the gamma-ray flaring. the observed spectral evolution of the radio-bandflares, in combination with radiative transfer simulations incorporatingpropagating shocks, was used to constrain the shock and jet flow conditions inthe parsec-scale regions of the jet. eight forward-moving, transverse shockswith unusually-strong shock compression factors, a very fast lorentz factor ofthe shocks of 77, a bulk lorentz factor of the flow of 20, a viewing angle of12 degrees, and an intrinsic opening angle of the radio jet of 5.2 degrees wereidentified.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

0805.1283	long-term radio variability of agn: flare characteristics	we have studied the flare characteristics of 55 agn at 8 different frequencybands between 4.8 and 230 ghz. our extensive database enables us to study thevarious observational properties of flares in these sources and compare ourresults with theoretical models. we visually extracted 159 individual flaresfrom the flux density curves and calculated different parameters, such as thepeak flux density and duration, in all the frequency bands. the selection offlares is based on the 22 and 37 ghz data from mets\"ahovi radio observatoryand 90 and 230 ghz data from the sest telescope. additional lower frequency4.8, 8, and 14.5 ghz data are from the university of michigan radioobservatory. we also calculated variability indices and compared them withearlier studies. the observations seem to adhere well to the shock model, butthere is still large scatter in the data. especially the time delays betweendifferent frequency bands are difficult to study due to the incomplete samplingof the higher frequencies. the average duration of the flares is 2.5 years at22 and 37 ghz, which shows that long-term monitoring is essential forunderstanding the typical behaviour in these sources. it also seems that theenergy release in a flare is independent of the duration of the flare.

1506.07137	frequency dependent core shifts and parameter estimation for the blazar  3c 454.3	we study the core shift effect in the parsec scale jet of the blazar 3c 454.3using the 4.8 ghz - 36.8 ghz radio light curves obtained from three decades ofcontinuous monitoring. from a piecewise gaussian fit to each flare, time lags$\delta t$ between the observation frequencies $\nu$ and spectral indices$\alpha$ based on peak amplitudes $a$ are determined. from the fit $\delta t\propto \nu^{1/k_r}$, $k_r = 1.10 \pm 0.18$ indicating equipartition betweenthe magnetic field energy density and the particle energy density. from the fit$a \propto \nu^\alpha$, $\alpha$ is in the range $-0.24$ to $1.52$. a meanmagnetic field strength at 1 pc, $b_1 = 0.5 \pm 0.2$ g, and at the core,$b_{\rm core} = 46 \pm 16$ mg, are inferred, consistent with previousestimates. the measure of core position offset is $\omega_{r\nu} = 6.4 \pm 2.8$pc ghz$^{1/k_r}$ when averaged over all frequency pairs. based on thestatistical trend shown by the measured core radius $r_{\rm core}$ as afunction of $\nu$, we infer that the synchrotron opacity model may not be validfor all cases. a fourier periodogram analysis yields power law slopes in therange $-1.6$ to $-3.5$ describing the power spectral density shape and givesbend timescales in the range $0.52 - 0.66~$yr. this result, and both positiveand negative $\alpha$, indicate that the flares originate from multiple shocksin a small region. important objectives met in our study include: thedemonstration of the computational efficiency and statistical basis of thepiecewise gaussian fit; consistency with previously reported results; evidencefor the core shift dependence on observation frequency and its utility in jetdiagnostics in the region close to the resolving limit of very long baselineinterferometry observations.

1507.03022	high radio frequency properties and variability of brightest cluster  galaxies	we consider the high radio frequency (15 ghz - 353 ghz) properties andvariability of 35 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). these are the mostcore-dominated sources drawn from a parent sample of more than 700 x-rayselected clusters, thus allowing us to relate our results to the generalpopulation. we find that &gt;6.0% of our parent sample (&gt;15.1% if only cool-coreclusters are considered) contain a radio-source at 150 ghz of at least 3mjy(~1x10^23 w/hz at our median redshift of z~0.13). furthermore, &gt;3.4% of thebcgs in our parent sample contain a peaked component (gigahertz peakedspectrum, gps) in their spectra that peaks above 2 ghz, increasing to &gt;8.5% ifonly cool-core clusters are considered. we see little evidence for strongvariability at 15 ghz on short (week-month) time-scales although we seevariations greater than 20% at 150 ghz over 6-month times-frames for 4 of the23 sources with multi-epoch observations. much more prevalent is long-term(year-decade time-scale) variability, with average annual amplitude variationsgreater than 1% at 15 ghz being commonplace. there is a weak trend towardshigher variability as the peak of the gps-like component occurs at higherfrequency. we demonstrate the complexity that is seen in the radio spectra ofbcgs and discuss the potentially significant implications of these high-peakingcomponents for sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster searches.

0805.3411	the multiwavelength variability of 3c 273	we present an update of 3c 273's database hosted by the isdc, completed withdata from radio to gamma-ray observations over the last 10 years. we use thislarge data set to study the multiwavelength properties of thisquasar,especially focussing on its variability behaviour. we study theamplitude of the variations and the maximum variability time scales across thebroad-band spectrum and correlate the light curves in different bands,specifically with the x-rays, to search for possible connections between theemission at different energies. 3c 273 shows variability at all frequencies,with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being thesignatures of the different emission mechanisms. the variability properties ofthe x-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly aseyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timingproperties to account for the x-ray emission below and above ~20 kev. thedominant hard x-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons acceleratedby the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with theflaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescalevariations in the optical. this optical component is consistent with beingoptically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hardx-rays would be produced through inverse compton processes (ssc and/or ec) bythe same electron population. we show evidence that this synchrotron componentextends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended byemission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-yearfrom the ultraviolet source.

1508.00959	optical and radio variability of bl lacertae	we observed the prototype blazar, bl lacertae, extensively in optical andradio bands during an active phase in the period 2010--2013 when the sourceshowed several prominent outbursts. we searched for possible correlations andtime lags between the optical and radio band flux variations usingmultifrequency data to learn about the mechanisms producing variability. duringan active phase of bl lacertae, we searched for possible correlations and timelags between multifrequency light curves of several optical and radio bands. wetried to estimate any possible variability timescales and inter-band lags inthese bands. we performed optical observations in b, v, r and i bands fromseven telescopes in bulgaria, georgia, greece and india and obtained radio dataat 36.8, 22.2, 14.5, 8 and 4.8 ghz frequencies from three telescopes inukraine, finland and usa. significant cross-correlations between optical andradio bands are found in our observations with a delay of cm-fluxes withrespect to optical ones of ~250 days. the optical and radio light curves do notshow any significant timescales of variability. bl lacertae showed many optical'mini-flares' on short time-scales. variations on longer term timescales aremildly chromatic with superposition of many strong optical outbursts. in radiobands, the amplitude of variability is frequency dependent. flux variations athigher radio frequencies lead the lower frequencies by days or weeks.  the optical variations are consistent with being dominated by a geometricscenario where a region of emitting plasma moves along a helical path in arelativistic jet. the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudesupports an origin of the observed variations intrinsic to the source.

0705.3293	statistical analyses of long-term variability of agn at high radio  frequencies	we present a study of variability time scales in a large sample of activegalactic nuclei at several frequencies between 4.8 and 230 ghz. we investigatethe differences of various agn types and frequencies and correlate the measuredtime scales with physical parameters such as the luminosity and the lorentzfactor. our sample consists of both high and low polarization quasars, bllacertae objects and radio galaxies. the basis of this work is the 22 ghz, 37ghz and 87 ghz monitoring data from the metsahovi radio observatory spanningover 25 years. in addition,we used higher 90 ghz and 230 ghz frequency dataobtained with the sest-telescope between 1987 and 2003. further lower frequencydata at 4.8 ghz, 8 ghz and 14.5 ghz from the university of michigan monitoringprogramme have been used. we have applied three different statistical methodsto study the time scales: the structure function, the discrete correlationfunction and the lomb-scargle periodogram. we discuss also the differences andrelative merits of these three methods. our study reveals that smaller fluxdensity variations occur in these sources on short time scales of 1-2 years,but larger outbursts happen quite rarely, on the average only once in every 6years. we do not find any significant differences in the time scales betweenthe source classes. the time scales are also only weakly related to theluminosity suggesting that the shock formation is caused by jet instabilitiesrather than the central black hole.

astro-ph;0009301	parsec-scale blazar monitoring: proper motions	we present proper motions obtained from a dual frequency, six-epoch, vlbapolarization experiment monitoring a sample of 12 blazars. the observationswere made at 15 ghz and 22 ghz at bi-monthly intervals over 1996. ten of theeleven sources for which proper motion could be reliably determined aresuperluminal. only j2005+77 has no superluminal components. three sources(oj287, j1224+21, and j1512-09) show motion faster than 10h^{-1}c, requiring$\gamma_{pattern}$ of at least 10h^{-1}c (h_0 = 100h km/s/mpc). we compare ourresults to those in the literature and find motions outside the previouslyobserved range for four sources. while some jet components exhibit significantnon-radial motion, most motion is radial. in at least two sources there arecomponents moving radially at significantly different structural positionangles. in five of six sources (3c120, j1224+21, 3c273, 3c279, j1512-09, andj1927+73) that have multiple components with measurable proper motion, theinnermost component is significantly slower than the others, suggesting thatacceleration occurs in the jet. in the motions of individual components weobserve at least one decelerating motion and two ``bending'' accelerationswhich tend to align their motions with larger scale structure. we also discussin detail our procedures for obtaining robust kinematical results frommulti-frequency vlbi data spanning several epochs.

astro-ph;0009468	iii zw 2: superluminal expansion and compact lobe expansion in a seyfert  galaxy	so far, all relativistically boosted jets with superluminal motion have onlybeen detected in typical radio galaxies with early type host galaxies. we havenow discovered superluminal motion in the seyfert i galaxy iii zw 2, classifiedas a spiral. the lower limit for the apparent expansion speed is 1.25 c.spectral and spatial evolution are closely linked. before and after this rapidexpansion we have seen a period of virtually no expansion with an expansionspeed less than 0.04 c. however, at 15 ghz the picture is completely different.iii zw 2 shows slow expansion ($\sim 0.6 c$) during the time of no expansion at43 ghz and no expansion during the rapid expansion at 43 ghz. the differencebetween the two frequencies is qualitatively explained by optical-depth effectsin an 'inflating- balloon model', describing the evolution of radio lobes on anultra-compact scale. the stop-and-go behavior could be explained by a jetinteracting with a molecular cloud or the molecular torus. since iii zw 2 isalso part of a sample of so- called radio-intermediate quasars (riq), itconfirms earlier predictions of superluminal motion for this source, based onthe argument that riqs could be relativistically boosted jets in radio-weakquasars and seyfert galaxies.

astro-ph;0203379	broadband spectra and variability of bl lacertae in 2000	we have organized an extensive multiwavelength campaign on bl lacertae in thesecond half of 2000. simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations were takenat radio frequencies, in the optical - carried out by the webt collaboration -,in x-rays - using bepposax and rxte -, and at vhe gamma-rays with the cat andhegra cherenkov telescope facilities. in this paper, we are presenting firstresults from this campaign. the webt optical campaign achieved an unprecedentedtime coverage, virtually continuous over several 10 - 20 hour segments, andrevealed intraday variability on time scales of ~ 1.5 hours. the x-rayobservations of nov. 1 - 2, 2000, revealed significant variability on similartime scales, and provided evidence for the synchrotron spectrum extending outto ~ 10 kev during that time. at higher energies, the onset of the hardpower-law commonly observed in radio-loud quasars and radio-selected bl lacobjects is seen. from the energy-resolved x-ray variability patterns, we findevidence that electron cooling might not be dominated by one single radiationmechanism; rather, a combination of synchrotron and compton cooling seems to berequired.

0808.2194	correlated multi-waveband variability in the blazar 3c~279 from 1996 to  2007	we present the results of extensive multi-waveband monitoring of the blazar3c~279 between 1996 and 2007 at x-ray energies (2-10 kev), optical r band, and14.5 ghz, as well as imaging with the very long baseline array (vlba) at 43ghz. in all bands the power spectral density corresponds to "red noise" thatcan be fit by a single power law over the sampled time scales. variations influx at all three wavebands are significantly correlated. the time delaybetween high and low frequency bands changes substantially on time scales ofyears. a major multi-frequency flare in 2001 coincided with a swing of the jettoward a more southerly direction, and in general the x-ray flux is modulatedby changes in the position angle of the jet near the core. the flux density inthe core at 43 ghz--increases in which indicate the appearance of newsuperluminal knots--is significantly correlated with the x-ray flux.  we decompose the x-ray and optical light curves into individual flares,finding that x-ray leads optical variations (xo) in 6 flares, the reverseoccurs in 3 flares (ox), and there is essentially zero lag in 4 flares. uponcomparing theoretical expectations with the data, we conclude that (1) xoflares can be explained by gradual acceleration of radiating electrons to thehighest energies; (2) ox flares can result from either light-travel delays ofthe seed photons (synchrotron self-compton scattering) or gradients in maximumelectron energy behind shock fronts; and (3) events with similar x-ray andoptical radiative energy output originate well upstream of the 43 ghz core,while those in which the optical radiative output dominates occur at ordownstream of the core.

astro-ph;0210636	oblique polarization structures in agn and qso radio jets	we interpret the linear polarization structures observed in extragalacticradio sources, even those oriented at oblique angles to the jet flows, to bedue to oblique, relativistic shock fronts in the emitting regions. many sourcesexhibit indications of such oblique structures, and the goal of thisinvestigation is to test this hypothesis quantitatively. a selected group often highly-variable extragalactic sources were observed with the vlba at 15 and43 ghz, on nine epochs spanning a 30-month period; five of these objects werealso observed at 8.0 and 22 ghz. the integrated total flux densities and linearpolarizations of the selected objects were also observed several times a monthat 4.8, 8.0 and 14.5 ghz with the university of michigan 26-meter telescope.all objects exhibited variability with several exhibiting more than oneindependent outburst during the period. we show the evolution of the polarizedcomponents with time and discuss the relativistic shock parameters required tomatch the observed polarization structures. even cases where the magnetic fieldis apparently oriented along the jet flow can be fit by oblique shock modelswhen relativistic aberration effects are included.

astro-ph;0211265	pearson-readhead survey sources ii: the longterm centimeter-band total  flux and linear polarization properties of a complete radio sample	using umrao centimeter-band total flux density and linear polarizationmonitoring observations of the complete pearson-readhead extragalactic sourcesample obtained between august 1984 and march 2001, we identify the range ofvariability in extragalactic objects as functions of optical and radiomorphological classification, and relate total flux density variations tostructural changes in published coeval vlbi maps in selected objects. we haveidentified preferred orientations of the electric vector of the polarizedemission at 14.5 and 4.8 ghz in roughly half of the objects, and compared thesewith orientations of the flow direction indicated by vlbi morphology. whencomparing the distributions of the orientation offsets for the bl lacs and forthe qsos, we find differences in both range and mean value, in support ofintrinsic class differences. in the shock-in-jet scenario, we attribute this tothe allowed range of obliquities of shocks developing in the flow relative tothe flow direction. the fact that we find longterm stability in evpa over manyevents implies that a dominant magnetic field orientation persists; in thecore-dominated objects, with small contribution from the underlying quiescentjet, this plausibly suggests that the magnetic field has a longterm memory,with subsequent shock events exhibiting similar evpa orientation, or,alternatively, the presence of a standing shock in the core. we have looked forsystematic, monotonic changes in evpa which might be expected in the emissionfrom a precessing jet, a model currently invoked for some agns; none wereidentified. further, we carried out a scargle periodogram analysis of the totalflux density observations, but found no strong evidence for periodicity in anyof the sample sources.

astro-ph;0302518	optical and radio behaviour of the bl lacertae object 0716+714	eight optical and four radio observatories have been intensively monitoringthe bl lac object 0716+714 in the last years: 4854 data points have beencollected in the ubvri bands since 1994, while radio light curves extend backto 1978. many of these data are presented here for the first time. thelong-term trend shown by the optical light curves seems to vary with acharacteristic time scale of about 3.3 years, while a longer period of 5.5-6years seems to characterize the radio long-term variations. in general, opticalcolour indices are only weakly correlated with brightness. the radio fluxbehaviour at different frequencies is similar, but the flux variation amplitudedecreases with increasing wavelength. the radio spectral index varies withbrightness (harder when brighter), but the radio fluxes seem to be the sum oftwo different-spectrum contributions: a steady base level and a harder-spectrumvariable component. once the base level is removed, the radio variations appearas essentially achromatic, similarly to the optical behaviour. flux variationsat the higher radio frequencies lead the lower-frequency ones with week-monthtime scales. the behaviour of the optical and radio light curves is quitedifferent, the broad radio outbursts not corresponding in time to the fasteroptical ones and the cross-correlation analysis indicating only weakcorrelation with long time lags. however, minor radio flux enhancementssimultaneous with the major optical flares can be recognized, which may implythat the mechanism producing the strong flux increases in the optical band alsomarginally affects the radio one.

astro-ph;0401501	a multifrequency analysis of radio variability of blazars	we have carried out a multifrequency analysis of the radio variability ofblazars, exploiting the data obtained during the extensive monitoring programscarried out at the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory (umrao,at 4.8, 8, and 14.5 ghz) and at the metsahovi radio observatory (22 and 37ghz). two different techniques detect, in the metsahovi light curves, evidencesof periodicity at both frequencies for 5 sources (0224+671, 0945+408, 1226+023,2200+420, and 2251+158). for the last three sources consistent periods arefound also at the three umrao frequencies and the scargle (1982) method yieldsan extremely low false-alarm probability. on the other hand, the 22 and 37 ghzperiodicities of 0224+671 and 0945+408 (which were less extensively monitoredat metsahovi and for which we get a significant false-alarm probability) arenot confirmed by the umrao database, where some indications of ill-definedperiods about a factor of two longer are retrieved. we have also investigatedthe variability index, the structure function, and the distribution ofintensity variations of the most extensively monitored sources. we find astatistically significant difference in the distribution of the variabilityindex for bl lac objects compared to flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), inthe sense that the former objects are more variable. for both populations thevariability index steadily increases with increasing frequency. thedistribution of intensity variations also broadens with increasing frequency,and approaches a log-normal shape at the highest frequencies. we find thatvariability enhances by 20-30% the high frequency counts of extragalacticradio-sources at bright flux densities, such as those of the wmap and plancksurveys.

astro-ph;0505536	sub-milliarcsecond imaging of quasars and active galactic nuclei. iv.  fine scale structure	we have used vlba fringe visibility data obtained at 15 ghz to examine thecompact structure in 250 extragalactic radio sources. for 171 sources in oursample, more than half of the total flux density seen by the vlba remainsunresolved on the longest baselines. there are 163 sources in our list with amedian correlated flux density at 15 ghz in excess of 0.5 jy on the longestbaselines. for about 60% of the sources, we have at least one observation inwhich the core component appears unresolved (generally smaller than 0.05 mas)in one direction, usually transverse to the direction into which the jetextends. bl lacs are on average more compact than quasars, while activegalaxies are on average less compact. also, in an active galaxy thesub-milliarcsecond core component tends to be less dominant. idv sourcestypically have a more compact, more core-dominated structure onsub-milliarcsecond scales than non-idv sources, and sources with a greateramplitude of intra-day variations tend to have a greater unresolved vlba fluxdensity. the objects known to be gev gamma-ray loud appear to have a morecompact vlba structure than the other sources in our sample. this suggests thatthe mechanisms for the production of gamma-ray emission and for the generationof compact radio synchrotron emitting features are related. the brightnesstemperature estimates and lower limits for the cores in our sample typicallyrange between 10^11 and 10^13 k, but they extend up to 5x10^13 k, apparently inexcess of the equipartition brightness temperature, or the inverse comptonlimit for stationary synchrotron sources. the largest component speeds areobserved in radio sources with high observed brightness temperatures, as wouldbe expected from relativistic beaming (abridged).

astro-ph;0606050	structure and flux variability in the vlbi jet of bl lacertae during the  webt campaigns (1995--2004)	bl lacertae has been the target of several observing campaigns by the wholeearth blazar telescope (webt) collaboration and is one of the best studiedblazars at all accessible wavelengths. a recent analysis of the optical andradio variability indicates that part of the radio variability is correlatedwith the optical light curve. here we present an analysis of a huge vlbi dataset including 108 images at 15, 22, and 43 ghz obtained between 1995 and 2004.the aim of this study is to identify the different components contributing tothe single-dish radio light curves. we obtain separate radio light curves forthe vlbi core and jet and show that the radio spectral index of single-dishobservations can be used to trace the core variability. cross-correlation ofthe radio spectral index with the optical light curve indicates that theoptical variations lead the radio by about 100 days at 15 ghz. by fitting theradio time lags vs. frequency, we find that the power law is steeper thanexpected for a freely expanding conical jet in equipartition with energydensity decreasing as the square of the distance down the jet as in thek\"onigl model. there is a section of the compact radio jet where the emissionis weak such that flares propagating down the jet are bright first in the coreregion with a secondary increase in flux about 1.0 mas from the core. thisillustrates the importance of direct imaging to the interpretation ofmulti-wavelength light curves that can be affected by several distinctcomponents at any given time. we discuss how the complex behaviour of the lightcurves and correlations can be understood within the framework of a precessinghelical jet model.

astro-ph;0609494	frequency-dependent time delays for strong outbursts in four blazars  from the metsahovi and umrao monitoring databases	the combined data of the university of michigan radio astronomy observatoryand metsahovi radio observatory provide us with radio light curves for activegalactic nuclei monitored by both observatories from 4.8 to 37 ghz coveringtime intervals up to ~25 years. we consider here such composite light curvesfor four gamma-ray blazars that have been nearly continuously monitored at bothobservatories: 0458-020, 0528+134, 1730-130 and 2230+114. we have decomposedthe most prominent outbursts in the light curves of these four blazars intoindividual components using gaussian model fitting, and estimated the epochs,amplitudes, and half-widths of these components as functions of frequency. weattempt to distinguish "core outbursts", which show frequency-dependent timedelays and are associated with brightening of the core, from "jet outbursts",which appear nearly synchronously at all frequencies and are accompanied by theemergence of new jet components and their subsequent evolution. available 43ghz vlba images allow us to identify only one pure core outburst (in 2230+114)and one pure jet outburst (0458-020). most of the outbursts analyzed are mixed,in the sense that they display frequency-dependent time delays (i.e., they areoptically thick) and are associated with the eventual emergence of new jetcomponents. the maxima of the jet and mixed outbursts probably correspond toepochs when newly ejected components become fully optically thin. these epochsare also marked by a significant increase in the angular velocities of theejected components. there is evidence that the outbursts in 2230+114 repeatevery 8.0+-0.3 years, with the positions of individual sub-outbursts beingpreserved from one quasi-periodic eight-year cycle to another, even thoughtheir amplitudes vary by more than a factor of two.

astro-ph;0701299	the radio delay of the exceptional 3c 454.3 outburst. follow-up webt  observations in 2005-2006	in spring 2005 the blazar 3c 454.3 was observed in an unprecedented brightstate from the near-ir to the hard x-ray frequencies. a mm outburst peaked injune-july 2005, and it was followed by a flux increase at high radiofrequencies. in this paper we report on multifrequency monitoring by the webtaimed at following the further evolution of the outburst in detail. inparticular, we investigate the expected correlation and time delays between theoptical and radio emissions in order to derive information on the variabilitymechanisms and jet structure. a comparison among the light curves at differentfrequencies is performed by means of visual inspection and discrete correlationfunction, and the results are interpreted with a simple model taking intoaccount doppler factor variations of geometric origin. the high-frequency radiolight curves show a huge outburst starting during the dimming phase of theoptical one and lasting more than 1 year. the first phase is characterized by aslow flux increase, while in early 2006 a major flare is observed. thelower-frequency radio light curves show a progressively delayed and fainterevent, which disappears below 8 ghz. we suggest that the radio major peak isnot physically connected with the spring 2005 optical one, but it is actuallycorrelated with a minor optical flare observed in october-november 2005. thisinterpretation involves both an intrinsic and a geometric mechanism. the formeris represented by disturbances travelling down the emitting jet, the latterbeing due to the curved-jet motion, with the consequent differential changes ofviewing angles of the different emitting regions.

0810.1676	agile detection of intense gamma-ray emission from the blazar pks  1510-089	we report the detection by the agile (astro-rivelatore gamma a immaginileggero) satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the source aglj1511-0909, associated with the powerful quasar pks 1510-089, during ten daysof observations from 23 august to 1 september 2007. during the observationperiod, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitoredby the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt). the simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us tostudy the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on thesynchrotron and inverse compton (ic) emission mechanisms. agile observed thesource with its two co-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector and thehard x-ray imager super-agile sensitive in the 30 mev - 50 gev and 18 - 60 kevbands, respectively. between 23 and 27 august 2007, agile detected gamma-rayemission from pks 1510-089 when this source was located about 50 degreesoff-axis, with an average flux of (270 +/- 65) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}for photon energy above 100 mev. in the following period, 28 august - 1september, after a satellite re-pointing, agile detected the source at about 35degrees off-axis, with an average flux (e &gt; 100 mev) of (195 +/- 30) x 10^{-8}photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no emission was detected by super-agile, with a 3-sigmaupper limit of 45 mcrab in 200 ksec. the spectral energy distribution ismodelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton (ssc) emissionplus contributions by external photons: the ssc emission contributes primarilyto the x-ray band, whereas the contribution of the ic from the external discand the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.
