0812.4391	temporal and spatial dependence of quantum entanglement from a field  theory perspective	we consider the entanglement dynamics between two unruh-dewitt detectors atrest separated at a distance $d$. this simple model when analyzed properly inquantum field theory shows many interesting facets and helps to dispel somemisunderstandings of entanglement dynamics. we find that there is spatialdependence of quantum entanglement in the stable regime due to the phasedifference of vacuum fluctuations the two detectors experience, together withthe interference of the mutual influences from the backreaction of one detectoron the other. when two initially entangled detectors are still outside eachother's light cone, the entanglement oscillates in time with an amplitudedependent on spatial separation $d$. when the two detectors begin to havecausal contact, an interference pattern of the relative degree of entanglement(compared to those at spatial infinity) develops a parametric dependence on$d$. the detectors separated at those $d$ with a stronger relative degree ofentanglement enjoy longer disentanglement times. in the cases with weakcoupling and large separation, the detectors always disentangle at late times.for sufficiently small $d$, the two detectors can have residual entanglementeven if they initially were in a separable state, while for $d$ a littlelarger, there could be transient entanglement created by mutual influences.however, we see no evidence of entanglement creation outside the light cone forinitially separable states.

hep-ph;9706207	nonequilibrium inflaton dynamics and reheating: back reaction of  parametric particle creation and curved spacetime effects	we present a detailed and systematic analysis of the nonperturbative,nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum field in the reheating phase ofinflatonary cosmology, including full back reactions of the quantum field onthe curved spacetime, as well as the fluctuations on the mean field. we use theo(n) field theory with unbroken symmetry in a spatially flat frw universe tostudy the dynamics of the inflaton in the post-inflaton, preheating stage.oscillations of the inflaton's zero mode induce parametric amplification ofquantum fluctuations, resulting in a rapid transfer of energy to theinhomogeneous modes of the inflaton field. we adopt the coupled nonperturbativeequations for the mean field and variance derived in a preceding paper[gr-qc/9706001] by means of a two-particle-irreducible (2pi), closed-time-path(ctp) effective action for curved spacetime while specialized to leading orderin the 1/n expansion. adiabatic regularization is employed. the renormalizeddynamical equations are evolved numerically from initial data which are genericto the end state of slow roll in many inflatonary cosmological scenarios. theinitial conditions consist of a large-amplitude, quasiclassical, oscillatingmean field, and a variance given by the de sitter-invariant vacuum. we findthat for sufficiently large initial mean-field amplitudes in this model, theparametric resonance effect alone (in a collisionless approximation) is not anefficient means to "preheat" the quantum field. for small initial mean-fieldamplitude, damping of the mean field via parametric amplification of quantumfluctuations is seen to occur. our results indicate that the self-consistentdynamics of spacetime plays an important role in determining the physics of thepost-inflatonary universe.

hep-ph;9805485	non-equilibrium dynamics of a thermal plasma in a gravitational field	we introduce functional methods to study the non-equilibrium dynamics of aquantum massless scalar field at finite temperature in a gravitational field.we calculate the close time path (ctp) effective action and, using its formalequivalence with the influence functional, derive the noise and dissipationkernels of the quantum open system in terms of quantities in thermodynamicalequilibrium. using this fact, we formally prove the existence of afluctuation-dissipation relation (fdr) at all temperatures between the quantumfluctuations of the plasma in thermal equilibrium and the energy dissipated bythe external gravitational field. what is new is the identification of astochastic source (noise) term arising from the quantum and thermalfluctuations in the plasma field, and the derivation of a langevin-typeequation which describes the non-equilibrium dynamics of the gravitationalfield influenced by the plasma. the back reaction of the plasma on thegravitational field is embodied in the fdr. from the ctp effective action thecontribution of the quantum scalar field to the thermal graviton polarizationtensor can also be derived and it is shown to agree with other techniques, mostnotably, linear response theory (lrt). we show the connection between the lrt,which is applicable for near-equilibrium conditions and the functional methodsused in this work which are useful for fully non-equilibrium conditions.

quant-ph;0203001	decoherence of two-level systems can be very different from brownian  particles	in quantum computation, it is of paramount importance to locate the parameterspace where maximal coherence can be preserved in the qubit system. in recentyears environment-induced decoherence based the quantum brownian motion (qbm)models have been applied to two level systems (2ls) interacting with anelectromagnetic field, leading to the general belief that 2ls are easilydecohered. in a recent paper c. anastopoulos and b. l. hu [phys. rev. a62,(2000) 033821] derived a new exact non-markovian master equation at zerotemperature, from which they showed that this belief is actually misplaced. fora two-level atom (2la)- electromagnetic field (emf) system the decoherence timeis rather long, comparable to the relaxation time. theoretically this isbecause the dominant interaction is the $\hat \sigma_{\pm}$ type of couplingbetween the two levels (what constitutes the qubit) and the field, not the$\hat \sigma_z$ type, which shows the qbm behavior. depending on the couplingthe field can act as a resonator (in an atom cavity) or as a bath (in qbm) andproduce very different decoherent behavior in the system. this is not new tocavity qed experimentalists: the 2la-emf system maintaining its coherence insufficiently long duration is the reason why they can manipulate them so wellto show interesting quantum coherence effects.

1105.5308	stress-energy tensor correlators of a quantum field in euclidean $r^n$  and $ads^n$ spaces via the generalized zeta-function method	in this paper we calculate the vacuum expectation values of the stress-energybitensor of a massive quantum scalar field with general coupling ton-dimensional euclidean spaces and hyperbolic spaces which are euclideansections of the anti-de sitter (ads) spaces. these correlators, also known asthe noise kernel, act as sources in the einstein-langevin equations ofstochastic gravity [1,2] which govern the induced metric fluctuations beyondthe mean-field dynamics described by the semiclassical einstein equations ofsemiclassical gravity. because these spaces are maximally symmetric theeigenmodes have analytic expressions which facilitate the computation of thezeta-function [3,4]. upon taking the second functional variation of thegeneralized zeta function introduced in [5] we obtain the correlators of thestress tensor for these two classes of spacetimes. both the short and the largegeodesic distance limits of the correlators are presented for dimensions up to11. we mention current research problems in early universe cosmology, blackhole physics and gravity-fluid duality where these results can be usefullyapplied to.

1106.1886	nonequilibrium dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic  field: causal and stable dynamics from 1/c expansion of qed	we derive from a microscopic hamiltonian a set of stochastic equations ofmotion for a system of spinless charged particles in an electromagnetic (em)field based on a consistent application of a dimensionful 1/c expansion ofquantum electrodynamics (qed). all relativistic corrections up to order 1/c^3are captured by the dynamics, which includes electrostatic interactions(coulomb), magnetostatic backreaction (biot-savart), dissipative backreaction(abraham-lorentz) and quantum field fluctuations at zero and finitetemperatures. with self-consistent backreaction of the em field included weshow that this approach yields causal and runaway-free equations of motion,provides new insights into charged particle backreaction, and naturally leadsto equations consistent with the (classical) darwin hamiltonian and has quantumoperator ordering consistent with the breit hamiltonian. to order 1/c^3 theapproach leads to a nonstandard mass renormalization which is associated withmagnetostatic self-interactions, and no cutoff is required to prevent runaways.our new results also show that the pathologies of the standard abraham-lorentzequations can be seen as a consequence of applying an inconsistent (i.e.incomplete, mixed-order) expansion in 1/c, if, from the start, the analysis isviewed as generating a low-energy effective theory rather than an exactsolution. finally, we show that the 1/c expansion within a hamiltonianframework yields well-behaved noise and dissipation, in addition to themultiple-particle interactions.

0710.0435	entanglement, recoherence and information flow in an accelerated  detector - quantum field system: implications for black hole information  issue	we study an exactly solvable model where an uniformly accelerated detector islinearly coupled to a massless scalar field initially in the minkowski vacuum.using the exact correlation functions we show that as soon as the coupling isswitched on one can see information flowing from the detector to the field andpropagating with the radiation into null infinity. by expressing the reduceddensity matrix of the detector in terms of the two-point functions, wecalculate the purity function in the detector and study the evolution ofquantum entanglement between the detector and the field. only in the ultraweakcoupling regime could some degree of recoherence in the detector appear at latetimes, but never in full restoration. we explicitly show that under the mostgeneral conditions the detector never recovers its quantum coherence and theentanglement between the detector and the field remains large at late times. tothe extent this model can be used as an analog to the system of a black holeinteracting with a quantum field, our result seems to suggest in the prevalentnon-markovian regime, assuming unitarity for the combined system, that blackhole information is not lost but transferred to the quantum field degrees offreedom. our combined system will evolve into a highly entangled state betweena remnant of large area (in bekenstein's black hole atom analog) without anyinformation of its initial state, and the quantum field, now imbued withcomplex information content not-so-easily retrievable by a local observer.

1204.1525	quantum teleportation between moving detectors in a quantum field	we consider the quantum teleportation of continuous variables modeled byunruh-dewitt detectors coupled to a common quantum field initially in theminkowski vacuum. an unknown coherent state of an unruh-dewitt detector isteleported from one inertial agent (alice) to an almost uniformly acceleratedagent (rob, for relativistic motion), using a detector pair initially entangledand shared by these two agents. the averaged physical fidelity of quantumteleportation, which is independent of the observer's frame, always drops belowthe best fidelity value from classical teleportation before the detector pairbecomes disentangled with the measure of entanglement evaluated around thefuture lightcone of the joint measurement event by alice. the distortion of thequantum state of the entangled detector pair from the initial state cansuppress the fidelity significantly even when the detectors are still stronglyentangled around the lightcone. we point out that the dynamics of entanglementof the detector pair observed in minkowski frame or in quasi-rindler frame arenot directly related to the physical fidelity of quantum teleportation in oursetup. these results are useful as a guide to making judicious choices ofstates and parameter ranges and estimation of the efficiency of quantumteleportation in relativistic quantum systems under environmental influences.

1206.2707	the equilibrium states of open quantum systems in the strong coupling  regime	in this work we investigate the late-time stationary states of open quantumsystems coupled to a thermal reservoir in the strong coupling regime. ingeneral such systems do not necessarily relax to a boltzmann distribution ifthe coupling to the thermal reservoir is non-vanishing or equivalently if therelaxation timescales are finite. using a variety of non-equilibrium formalismsvalid for non-markovian processes, we show that starting from a product stateof the closed system = system + environment, with the environment in itsthermal state, the open system which results from coarse graining theenvironment will evolve towards an equilibrium state at late-times. this statecan be expressed as the reduced state of the closed system thermal state at thetemperature of the environment. for a linear (harmonic) system and environment,which is exactly solvable, we are able to show in a rigorous way that allmulti-time correlations of the open system evolve towards those of the closedsystem thermal state. multi-time correlations are especially relevant in thenon-markovian regime, since they cannot be generated by the dynamics of thesingle-time correlations. for more general systems, which cannot be exactlysolved, we are able to provide a general proof that all single-timecorrelations of the open system evolve to those of the closed system thermalstate, to first order in the relaxation rates. for the special case of azero-temperature reservoir, we are able to explicitly construct the reducedclosed system thermal state in terms of the environmental correlations.

1304.7839	pathways toward understanding macroscopic quantum phenomena	macroscopic quantum phenomena refer to quantum features in objects of `large'sizes, systems with many components or degrees of freedom, organized in wayswhere they can be identified as macroscopic objects. this emerging field isushered in by several categories of definitive experiments insuperconductivity, electromechanical systems, bose-einstein condensates andothers. yet this new field which is rich in open issues at the foundation ofquantum and statistical physics remains little explored theoretically [1]. thistalk summarizes our thoughts on attempting a systematic investigation into itsfoundation, with the goal of ultimately revealing or building a viabletheoretical framework. three major themes discussed in three intended essaysare the large n expansion [2], the correlation hierarchy [3] and quantumentanglement [4]. we give a sketch of the first two themes and then discussseveral key issues in the consideration of macro and quantum, namely, a)recognition that in a composite body there exist many 'levels of structure'characterized by collective variables. the quantum features of a macroscopicobject can be captured by understanding how these collective variablesfunction; b) 'quantum entanglement', an exclusively quantum feature [5], isknown to persist to high temperatures [6] and large scales [7] under certainconditions, and may actually decrease with increased connectivity in a quantumnetwork [8]. here we use entanglement as a measure of quantumness and pick outthese somewhat counter-intuitive examples to show that there are blind spotsworthy of our attention and issues which we need to analyze closer. our purposeis to try to remove the stigma that quantum only pertains to micro, in order tomake way for deeper probes into the conditions whereby quantum features ofmacroscopic systems manifest.

0801.0900	self-force on extreme mass ratio inspirals via curved spacetime  effective field theory	in this series we construct an effective field theory (eft) in curvedspacetime to study gravitational radiation and backreaction effects. we beginin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving inthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. the eft approachutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are thesize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the backgroundspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as aneffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. ultravioletdivergences are regularized using hadamard's {\it partie finie} to isolate thenon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. the latter isconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retardedpropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which onlylogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of thetheory. as a first important application of this framework we explicitly derivethe first order self-force given by mino, sasaki, tanaka, quinn and wald. goingbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of theobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of acompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $o(\epsilon^4)$, inthe form of an effacement principle. the relatively large radius-to-mass ratioof a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the whitedwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $o(\epsilon^2)$ process, orplunges into the supermassive black hole. this work provides a new foundationfor further exploration of higher order self force corrections, gravitationalradiation and spinning compact objects.

1307.4360	unruh effect under non-equilibrium conditions: oscillatory motion of an  unruh-dewitt detector	the unruh effect refers to the thermal fluctuations a detector experienceswhile undergoing linear motion with uniform acceleration in a minkowski vacuum.this thermality can be demonstrated by tracing the vacuum state of the fieldover the modes beyond the accelerated detector's event horizon. however, theevent horizon is well-defined only if the detector moves with eternal uniformlinear acceleration. this idealized condition cannot be fulfilled in realisticsituations when the motion unavoidably involves periods of non-uniformacceleration. many experimental proposals to test the unruh effect are of thisnature. often circular or oscillatory motion, which lacks an obvious geometricdescription, is considered in such proposals. the proper perspective fortheoretically going beyond, or experimentally testing, the unruh-hawking effectin these more general conditions has to be offered by concepts and techniquesin non-equilibrium quantum field theory. in this paper we provide a detailedanalysis of how an unruh-dewitt detector undergoing oscillatory motion respondsto the fluctuations of a quantum field. numerical results for the late-timetemperatures of the oscillating detector are presented. we comment on thedigressions of these results from what one would obtain from a naiveapplication of unruh's result.

1403.4921	problems with the newton-schr\"odinger equations	we examine the origin of the newton-schr\"odinger equations (nses) that playan important role in alternative quantum theories (aqt), macroscopic quantummechanics and gravity-induced decoherence. we show that nses for individualparticles do not follow from general relativity (gr) plus quantum field theory(qft). contrary to what is commonly assumed, the nses are not the weak-field(wf), non-relativistic (nr) limit of the semi-classical einstein equation (sce)(this nomenclature is preferred over the `m\/oller-rosenfeld equation') basedon gr+qft. the wave-function in the nses makes sense only as that for a meanfield describing a system of $n$ particles as $n \rightarrow \infty$, not thatof a single or finite many particles. from gr+qft the gravitationalself-interaction leads to mass renormalization, not to a non-linear term in theevolution equations of some aqts. the wf-nr limit of the gravitationalinteraction in gr+qft involves no dynamics. to see the contrast, we give aderivation of the equation (i) governing the many-body wave function fromgr+qft and (ii) for the non-relativistic limit of quantum electrodynamics(qed). they have the same structure, being linear, and very different fromnses. adding to this our earlier consideration that for gravitationaldecoherence the master equations based on gr+qft lead to decoherence in theenergy basis and not in the position basis, despite some aqts desiring it forthe `collapse of the wave function', we conclude that the origins andconsequences of nses are very different, and should be clearly demarcated fromthose of the sce equation, the only legitimate representative of semiclassicalgravity, based on gr+qft.

1405.7642	nonequilibrium steady state in open quantum systems: influence action,  stochastic equation and power balance	the existence and uniqueness of a steady state for nonequilibrium systems(ness) is a fundamental subject and a main theme of research in statisticalmechanics for decades. for gaussian systems, such as a chain of harmonicoscillators connected at each end to a heat bath, and for anharmonicoscillators under specified conditions, definitive answers exist in the form ofproven theorems. answering this question for quantum many-body systems poses achallenge for the present. in this work we address this issue by deriving thestochastic equations for the reduced system with self-consistent backactionfrom the two baths, calculating the energy flow from one bath to the chain tothe other bath, and exhibiting a power balance relation in the total (chain +baths) system which testifies to the existence of a ness in this system at latetimes. its insensitivity to the initial conditions of the chain corroborates toits uniqueness. the functional method we adopt here entails the use of theinfluence functional, the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions, fromwhich one can derive the stochastic equations and calculate the average valuesof physical variables in open quantum systems. this involves both taking theexpectation values of quantum operators of the system and the distributionalaverages of stochastic variables stemming from the coarse-grained environment.this method though formal in appearance is compact and complete. it can alsoeasily accommodate perturbative techniques and diagrammatic methods from fieldtheory. taken all together it provides a solid platform for carrying outsystematic investigations into the nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantumsystems and quantum thermodynamics.

1502.03539	quantum teleportation between moving detectors	it is commonly believed that the fidelity of quantum teleportation usinglocalized quantum objects with one party or both accelerated in vacuum would bedegraded due to the heat-up by the unruh effect. in this paper we point outthat the unruh effect is not the whole story in accounting for all therelativistic effects in quantum teleportation. first, there could bedegradation of fidelity by a common field environment even when both quantumobjects are in inertial motion. second, relativistic effects entering thedescription of the dynamics such as frame dependence, time dilation, anddoppler shift, already existent in inertial motion, can compete with or evenoverwhelm the effect due to uniform acceleration in a quantum field. we show itis not true that larger acceleration of an object would necessarily lead to afaster degradation of fidelity. these claims are based on four cases of quantumteleportation we studied using two unruh-dewitt detectors coupled via a commonquantum field initially in the minkowski vacuum. we find the quantumentanglement evaluated around the light cone, rather than the conventional onesevaluated on the minkowski time-slices, is the necessary condition for theaveraged fidelity of quantum teleportation beating the classical one. theseresults are useful as a guide to making judicious choices of states andparameter ranges and estimation of the efficiency of quantum teleportation inrelativistic quantum systems under environmental influences.

1506.02941	"hot entanglement"? -- a nonequilibrium quantum field theory scrutiny	the possibility of maintaining entanglement in a quantum system at finite,even high, temperatures -- the so-called `hot entanglement' -- has obviouspractical interest, but also requires closer theoretical scrutiny. sincequantum entanglement in a system evolves in time and is continuously subjectedto environmental degradation, a nonequilibrium description by way of openquantum systems is called for. to identify the key issues and the contributingfactors that may permit `hot entanglement' to exist, or the lack thereof, wecarry out a model study of two spatially-separated, coupled oscillators in ashared bath depicted by a finite-temperature scalar field. from the langevinequations we derived for the normal modes and the entanglement measureconstructed from the covariance matrix we examine the interplay between directcoupling, field-induced interaction and finite separation on the structure oflate-time entanglement. we show that the coupling between oscillators plays acrucial role in sustaining entanglement at intermediate temperatures and overfinite separations. in contrast, the field-induced interaction between theoscillators which is a non-markovian effect, becomes very ineffective at hightemperature. we determine the critical temperature above which entanglementdisappears to be bounded in the leading order by the inverse frequency of thecenter-of-mass mode of the reduced oscillator system, a result not unexpected,which rules out hot entanglement in such settings.

gr-qc;9312035	quantum brownian motion in a bath of parametric oscillators: a model for  system-field interactions	the quantum brownian motion paradigm provides a unified framework where onecan see the interconnection of some basic quantum statistical processes likedecoherence, dissipation, particle creation, noise and fluctuation. we treatthe case where the brownian particle is coupled linearly to a bath of timedependent quadratic oscillators. while the bath mimics a scalar field, themotion of the brownian particle modeled by a single oscillator could be used todepict the behavior of a particle detector, a quantum field mode or the scalefactor of the universe. an important result of this paper is the derivation ofthe influence functional encompassing the noise and dissipation kernels interms of the bogolubov coefficients. this method enables one to trace thesource of statistical processes like decoherence and dissipation to vacuumfluctuations and particle creation, and in turn impart a statistical mechanicalinterpretation of quantum field processes. with this result we discuss thestatistical mechanical origin of quantum noise and thermal radiance from blackholes and from uniformly- accelerated observers in minkowski space as well asfrom the de sitter universe discovered by hawking, unruh and gibbons-hawking.we also derive the exact evolution operator and master equation for the reduceddensity matrix of the system interacting with a parametric oscillator bath inan initial squeezed thermal state. these results are useful for decoherence andbackreaction studies for systems and processes of interest in semiclassicalcosmology and gravity. our model and results are also expected to be useful forrelated problems in quantum optics. %\pacs{05.40.+j,03.65.sq,98.80.cq,97.60.lf}

gr-qc;9403054	a fluctuation-dissipation relation for semiclassical cosmology	using the concept of open systems where the classical geometry is treated asthe system and the quantum matter field as the environment, we derive afluctuation-dissipation theorem for semiclassical cosmology. this theorem whichexists under very general conditions for dissipations in the dynamics of thesystem, and the noise and fluctuations in the environment, can be traced to theformal mathematical relation between the dissipation and noise kernels of theinfluence functional depicting the open system, and is ultimately a consequenceof the unitarity of the closed system. in particular, for semiclassicalgravity, it embodies the backreaction effect of matter fields on the dynamicsof spacetime. the backreaction equation derivable from the influence action isin the form of a einstein-langevin equation. it contains a dissipative term inthe equation of motion for the dynamics of spacetime and a noise term relatedto the fluctuations of particle creation in the matter field. using thewell-studied model of a quantum scalar field in a bianchi type-i universe weillustrate how this langevin equation and the noise term are derived and showhow the creation of particles and the dissipation of anisotropy during theexpansion of the universe can be understood as a manifestation of thisfluctuation-dissipation relation.

gr-qc;9505046	quantum fluctuations, decoherence of the mean field, and structure  formation in the early universe	we examine from first principles one of the basic assumptions of modernquantum theories of structure formation in the early universe, i.e., theconditions upon which fluctuations of a quantum field may transmute intoclassical stochastic perturbations, which grew into galaxies. our earlier workshave discussed the quantum origin of noise in stochastic inflation and quantumfluctuations as measured by particle creation in semiclassical gravity. here wefocus on decoherence and the relation of quantum and classical fluctuations.instead of using the rather ad hoc splitting of a quantum field into long andshort wavelength parts, the latter providing the noise which decoheres theformer, we treat a nonlinear theory and examine the decoherence of a quantummean field by its own quantum fluctuations, or that of other fields itinteracts with. this is an example of `dynamical decoherence' where aneffective open quantum system decoheres through its own dynamics. the model weuse to discuss fluctuation generation has the inflation field coupled to thegraviton field. we show that when the quantum to classical transition isproperly treated, with due consideration of the relation of decoherence, noise,fluctuation and dissipation, the amplitude of density contrast predicted fallsin the acceptable range without requiring a fine tuning of the couplingconstant of the inflation field ($\lambda$). the conventional treatment whichrequires an unnaturally small $\lambda \approx 10^{-12}$ stems from a basicflaw in naively identifying classical perturbations with quantum fluctuations.

gr-qc;9511077	semiclassical gravity and mesoscopic physics	developments in theoretical cosmology in the recent decades show a closeconnection with particle physics, quantum gravity and unified theories. answersor hints to many fundamental questions in cosmology like the homogeneity andisotropy of the universe, the sources of structure formation and entropygeneration, and the initial state of the universe can be traced back to theactivities of quantum fields and the dynamics of spacetime from the grandunification time to the planck time at $10^{-43} sec$. a closer depiction ofthis primordial state of the universe requires at least a semiclassical theoryof gravity and the consideration of non-equilibrium statistical processesinvolving quantum fields. this critical state is intermediate between thewell-known classical epoch successfully described by einstein's theory ofgeneral relativity and the completely unknown realm of quantum gravity. manyissues special to this stage such as the transition from quantum to classicalspacetime via decoherence, cross-over behavior at the planck scale, tunnelingand particle creation, or growth of density contrast from vacuum fluctuationsshare some basic concerns of mesoscopic physics for condensed matter, atoms ornuclei, in the quantum/classical and the micro/macro interfaces, or thediscrete/continuum and the stochastic/ deterministic transitions. we point outthat underlying these issues are three main factors: quantum coherence,fluctuations and correlation. we discuss how a deeper understanding of theseaspects of fields and spacetimes can help one to address some basic problems,such as planck scale metric fluctuations, cosmological phase transition andstructure formation, and the black hole entropy, end-state and informationparadox.

gr-qc;9606074	near-thermal radiation in detectors, mirrors and black holes: a  stochastic approach	in analyzing the nature of thermal radiance experienced by an acceleratedobserver (unruh effect), an eternal black hole (hawking effect) and in certaintypes of cosmological expansion, one of us proposed a unifying viewpoint thatthese can be understood as arising from the vacuum fluctuations of the quantumfield being subjected to an exponential scale transformation. this viewpoint,together with our recently developed stochastic theory of particle-fieldinteraction understood as quantum open systems described by the influencefunctional formalism, can be used to address situations where the spacetimepossesses an event horizon only asymptotically, or none at all. examplesstudied here include detectors moving at uniform acceleration onlyasymptotically or for a finite time, a moving mirror, and a collapsing mass. weshow that in such systems radiance indeed is observed, albeit not in a preciseplanckian spectrum. the deviation therefrom is determined by a parameter whichmeasures the departure from uniform acceleration or from exact exponentialexpansion. these results are expected to be useful for the investigation ofnon-equilibrium black hole thermodynamics and the linear response regime ofbackreaction problems in semiclassical gravity.

gr-qc;9607070	general relativity as geometro-hydrodynamics	in the spirit of sakharov's `metric elasticity' proposal, we draw a looseanalogy between general relativity and the hydrodynamic state of a quantum gas.in the `top-down' approach, we examine the various conditions which underliethe transition from some candidate theory of quantum gravity to generalrelativity. our emphasis here is more on the `bottom-up' approach, where onestarts with the semiclassical theory of gravity and examines how it is modifiedby graviton and quantum field excitations near and above the planck scale. wemention three aspects based on our recent findings: 1) emergence of stochasticbehavior of spacetime and matter fields depicted by an einstein-langevinequation. the backreaction of quantum fields on the classical backgroundspacetime manifests as a fluctuation-dissipation relation. 2) manifestation ofstochastic behavior in effective theories below the threshold arising fromexcitations above. the implication for general relativity is that suchplanckian effects, though exponentially suppressed, is in principle detectableat sub-planckian energies. 3) decoherence of correlation histories and quantumto classical transition. from gell-mann and hartle's observation that thehydrodynamic variables which obey conservation laws are most readily decohered,one can, in the spirit of wheeler, view the conserved bianchi identity obeyedby the einstein tensor as an indication that general relativity is ahydrodynamic theory of geometry. many outstanding issues surrounding thetransition to general relativity are of a nature similar to hydrodynamics andmesoscopic physics.
