0901.4337	recovering stellar population properties and redshifts from broad-band  photometry of simulated galaxies: lessons for sed modeling	we present a detailed analysis of our ability to determine stellar masses,ages, reddening and extinction values, and star formation rates ofhigh-redshift galaxies by modeling broad-band seds with stellar populationsynthesis. in order to do so, we computed synthetic optical-to-nir seds formodel galaxies taken from hydrodynamical merger simulations placed at redshifts1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3. viewed under different angles and during different evolutionaryphases, the simulations represent a wide variety of galaxy types (disks,mergers, spheroids). we show that simulated galaxies span a wide range in sedsand color, comparable to these of observed galaxies. in all star-formingphases, dust attenuation has a large effect on colors, seds, and fluxes. thebroad-band seds were then fed to a standard sed modeling procedure andresulting stellar population parameters were compared to their true values.disk galaxies generally show a decent median correspondence between the trueand estimated mass and age, but suffer from large uncertainties. during themerger itself, we find larger offsets (e.g., log m_recovered - log m_true =-0.13^{+0.10}_{-0.14}). e(b-v) values are generally recovered well, but theestimated total visual absorption av is consistently too low, increasingly sofor larger optical depths. since the largest optical depths occur during thephases of most intense star formation, it is for the highest sfrs that we findthe largest underestimates. the masses, ages, e(b-v), av, and sfr of mergerremnants (spheroids) are very well reproduced. we discuss possible biases insed modeling results caused by mismatch between the true and template starformation history, dust distribution, metallicity variations and agncontribution.

0903.3051	a public, k-selected, optical-to-near-infrared catalog of the extended  chandra deep field south (ecdfs) from the multiwavelength survey by  yale-chile (musyc)	we present a new k-selected, optical-to-near-infrared photometric catalog ofthe extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs), making it publicly available tothe astronomical community. the dataset is founded on publicly availableimaging, supplemented by original zjk imaging data obtained as part of themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc). the final photometric catalogconsists of photometry derived from nine band u-k imaging covering the full0.5x0.5 sq. deg. of the ecdfs, plus h band data for approximately 80% of thefield. the 5sigma flux limit for point-sources is k = 22.0 (ab). this is alsothe nominal completeness and reliability limit of the catalog: the empiricalcompleteness for 21.75 &lt; k &lt; 22.00 is 85+%. we have verified the quality of thecatalog through both internal consistency checks, and comparisons to otherexisting and publicly available catalogs. as well as the photometric catalog,we also present catalogs of photometric redshifts and restframe photometryderived from the ten band photometry. we have collected robust spectroscopicredshift determinations from published sources for 1966 galaxies in thecatalog. based on these sources, we have achieved a (1sigma) photometricredshift accuracy of dz/(1+z) = 0.036, with an outlier fraction of 7.8%. mostof these outliers are x-ray sources. finally, we describe and release a utilityfor interpolating restframe photometry from observed seds, dubbed interrest.particularly in concert with the wealth of already publicly available data inthe ecdfs, this new musyc catalog provides an excellent resource for studyingthe changing properties of the massive galaxy population at z &lt; 2.

0905.2411	color distributions, number and mass densities of massive galaxies at  1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3: comparing observations with merger simulations	we present a comparison between the observed color distribution, number andmass density of massive galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 and a model by hopkins et al.that relates the quasar and galaxy population on the basis of gas-rich mergers.in order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after agas-rich merger involving quasar activity, we confront photometry of massive (m&gt; 4x10^10 msun) galaxies extracted from the fires, goods-south, and musycsurveys, together spanning an area of 496 arcmin^2, with synthetic photometryfrom hydrodynamical merger simulations. as in the hopkins et al. (2006b) model,we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. wefind that the synthetic u-v and v-j colors of galaxies that had a quasar phasein their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterizedby a quiescent stellar population. at z ~ 2.6, the observed number and massdensity of quiescent red galaxies with m &gt; 4x10^10 msun is consistent with themodel in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in thepast. at z ~ 1.9, 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predictedby the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars. the merger model alsopredicts a large number of galaxies undergoing merger-driven star formation. wefind that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30-50% of theobserved massive star-forming galaxies. however, their colors do not matchthose of observed star-forming galaxies. in particular, the colors of dusty redgalaxies are not reproduced by the simulations. several possible origins ofthis discrepancy are discussed. the observational constraints on the validityof the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties instellar population synthesis and radiative transfer.

0908.1377	star formation in the cdfs: observations confront simulations	we investigate the star formation history of the universe using fireworks, amultiwavelength survey of the cdfs. we study the evolution of the specific starformation rate (ssfr) with redshift in different mass bins from z = 0 to z ~ 3.we find that the ssfr increases with redshift for all masses. the logarithmicincrease of the ssfr with redshift is nearly independent of mass, but thiscannot yet be verified at the lowest-mass bins at z &gt; 0.8, due toincompleteness. we convert the ssfrs to a dimensionless growth rate tofacilitate a comparison with a semi-analytic galaxy formation model that wasimplemented on the millennium simulation. the model predicts that the growthrates and ssfrs increase similarly with redshift for all masses, consistentwith the observations. however, we find that for all masses, the inferredobserved growth rates increase more rapidly with redshift than the modelpredictions. we discuss several possible causes for this discrepancy, rangingfrom field-to-field variance, conversions to sfr, and shape of the imf. we findthat none of these can solve the discrepancy completely. we conclude that themodels need to be adapted to produce the steep increase in growth rate betweenredshift z=0 and z=1.

0909.2039	discriminating between the physical processes that drive spheroid size  evolution	massive galaxies at high-z have smaller effective radii than those today, butsimilar central densities. their size growth therefore relates primarily to theevolving abundance of low-density material. various models have been proposedto explain this evolution, which have different implications for galaxy, star,and bh formation. we compile observations of spheroid properties as a functionof redshift and use them to test proposed models. evolution in progenitorgas-richness with redshift gives rise to initial formation of smaller spheroidsat high-z. these systems can then evolve in apparent or physical size viaseveral channels: (1) equal-density 'dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor'dry' mergers with less-dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, (4) evolutionin stellar populations &amp; mass-to-light-ratio gradients, (5) age-dependent biasin stellar mass estimators, (6) observational fitting/selection effects. if anyone of these is tuned to explain observed size evolution, they make distinctpredictions for evolution in other galaxy properties. only model (2) isconsistent with observations as a dominant effect. it is the only model whichallows for an increase in m_bh/m_bulge with redshift. still, the amount ofmerging needed is larger than that observed or predicted. we therefore comparecosmologically motivated simulations, in which all these effects occur, &amp; showthey are consistent with all the observational constraints. effect (2), whichbuilds up an extended low-density envelope, does dominate the evolution, buteffects 1,3,4, &amp; 6 each contribute ~20% to the size evolution (a net factor~2). this naturally also predicts evolution in m_bh-sigma similar to thatobserved.

0910.1836	optical spectroscopy of distant red galaxies	we present optical spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of distant redgalaxies (drgs) with k &lt; 22.5 (vega), selected by j-k &gt; 2.3, in the hubble deepfield south, the ms 1054-03 field, and the chandra deep field south.spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 15 drgs. only 2 out of 15 drgs arelocated at z &lt; 2, suggesting a high efficiency to select high-redshift sources.  from other spectroscopic surveys in the cdfs targeting intermediate to highredshift populations selected with different criteria, we find spectroscopicredshifts for a further 30 drgs. we use the sample of spectroscopicallyconfirmed drgs to establish the high quality (scatter in \delta z/(1+z) of ~0.05) of their photometric redshifts in the considered deep fields, as derivedwith eazy (brammer et al. 2008). combining the spectroscopic and photometricredshifts, we find that 74% of drgs with k &lt; 22.5 lie at z &gt; 2. the combinedspectroscopic and photometric sample is used to analyze the distinct intrinsicand observed properties of drgs at z &lt; 2 and z &gt; 2. in our photometric sampleto k &lt; 22.5, low-redshift drgs are brighter in k than high-redshift drgs by 0.7mag, and more extincted by 1.2 mag in av. our analysis shows that the drgcriterion selects galaxies with different properties at different redshifts.such biases can be largely avoided by selecting galaxies based on theirrest-frame properties, which requires very good multi-band photometry and highquality photometric redshifts.

1008.4127	on sizes, kinematics, m/l gradients, and light profiles of massive  compact galaxies at z~2	we present a detailed analysis of the structure and resolved stellarpopulations of simulated merger remnants, and compare them to observations ofcompact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2. we find that major merging is a viablemechanism to produce systems of ~ 10^11 msun and ~ 1 kpc size, provided the gasfraction at the time of final coalescence is high (~ 40%), and provided thatthe progenitors are compact star-forming galaxies, as expected at highredshift. their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocitydispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position inthe (v_{maj}/sigma, ellipticity) diagram traces the upper envelope of thedistribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. the simulated mergerremnants show time- and sightline-dependent m/l ratio gradients that resultfrom a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity,and extinction. the median ratio of effective radius in rest-frame v-band lightto that in mass surface density is ~ 2 during the quiescent remnant phase. thisis typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which weexpect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. finally, thesimulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profileshape. the simulated remnants are typically best fit by high (n &gt;&gt; 4) sersicindices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy(median n ~ 2.3). limiting early star formation in the progenitors may berequired to prevent the simulated merger remnants from having extended wings.

1101.2423	the majority of compact massive galaxies at z~2 are disk dominated	we investigate the stellar structure of massive, quiescent galaxies at z~2,based on hubble space telescope/wfc3 imaging from the early release scienceprogram. our sample of 14 galaxies has stellar masses of m* &gt; 10^{10.8} msoland photometric redshifts of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. in agreement with previous work,their half-light radii are &lt;2 kpc, much smaller than equally massive galaxiesin the present-day universe. a significant subset of the sample appears highlyflattened in projection, which implies, considering viewing angle statistics,that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our sample have pronounceddisks. this is corroborated by two-dimensional surface brightness profile fits.we estimate that 65% +/- 15% of the population of massive, quiescent z~2galaxies are disk-dominated. the median disk scale length is 1.5 kpc,substantially smaller than the disks of equally massive galaxies in thepresent-day universe. our results provide strong observational evidence thatthe much-discussed ultra-dense high-redshift galaxies should generally bethought of as disk-like stellar systems with the majority of stars formed fromgas that had time to settle into a disk.

1106.5502	on star formation rates and star formation histories of galaxies out to  z ~ 3	we compare multi-wavelength sfr indicators out to z~3 in goods-south. ouranalysis uniquely combines u-to-8um photometry from fireworks, mips 24um andpacs 70, 100, and 160um photometry from the pep survey, and ha spectroscopyfrom the sins survey. we describe a set of conversions that lead to acontinuity across sfr indicators. a luminosity-independent conversion from 24umto total infrared luminosity yields estimates of lir that are in the medianconsistent with the lir derived from pacs photometry, albeit with significantscatter. dust correction methods perform well at low to intermediate levels ofstar formation. they fail to recover the total amount of star formation insystems with large sfr_ir/sfr_uv ratios, typically occuring at the highest sfrs(sfr_uv+ir \gtrsim 100 msun/yr) and redshifts (z \gtrsim 2.5) probed. finally,we confirm that ha-based sfrs at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 are consistent with sfr_sed andsfr_uv+ir provided extra attenuation towards hii regions is taken into account(av,neb = av,continuum / 0.44). with the cross-calibrated sfr indicators inhand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferredfrom sed modeling. we compare the observed sfr-m relations and mass functionsat a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lowerredshift galaxies backwards in time. we find evidence for underestimatedstellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied. wedemonstrate how resolved sed modeling, or alternatively deep uv data, may helpto overcome this bias. the age bias is most severe for galaxies with youngstellar populations, and reduces towards older systems. finally, our analysissuggests that sfhs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several100 myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.

1107.0317	galaxy structure and mode of star formation in the sfr-mass plane from z  ~ 2.5 to z ~ 0.1	we analyze the dependence of galaxy structure (size and sersic index) andmode of star formation (\sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv) on the position ofgalaxies in the sfr versus mass diagram. our sample comprises roughly 640000galaxies at z~0.1, 130000 galaxies at z~1, and 36000 galaxies at z~2.structural measurements for all but the z~0.1 galaxies were based on hstimaging, and sfrs are derived using a herschel-calibrated ladder of sfrindicators. we find that a correlation between the structure and stellarpopulation of galaxies (i.e., a 'hubble sequence') is already in place since atleast z~2.5. at all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequenceare well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescentgalaxies are better described by de vaucouleurs profiles. in the upper envelopeof the main sequence, the relation between the sfr and sersic index reverses,suggesting a rapid build-up of the central mass concentration in thesestarbursting outliers. we observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-formingsystems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. at eachmass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. therate of size growth correlates with specific sfr, and so does \sigma_sfr ateach redshift. a simple model using an empirically determined sf law andmetallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and starsis able to relate the observed \sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv, provided a morepatchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1110.3786	what turns galaxies off? the different morphologies of star-forming and  quiescent galaxies since z~2 from candels	we use hst/wfc3 imaging from the candels multicycle treasury survey, inconjunction with the sloan digital sky survey, to explore the evolution ofgalactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses &gt;3e10m_sun from z=2.2 tothe present epoch, a time span of 10gyr. we explore the relationship betweenrest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity and galaxystructure. we confirm the dramatic increase from z=2.2 to the present day inthe number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3e10m_sun reported byothers. we further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems haveconcentrated light profiles, as parametrized by the sersic index, and thepopulation of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. we examine thejoint distribution of star formation activity, sersic index, stellar mass,inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. quiescencecorrelates poorly with stellar mass at all z&lt;2.2. quiescence correlates wellwith sersic index at all redshifts. quiescence correlates well with `velocitydispersion' and stellar surface density at z&gt;1.3, and somewhat less well atlower redshifts. yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence andgalaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominentbulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominatedgalaxies have significant star formation. noting the rarity of quiescentgalaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (andperhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important conditionfor quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10gyr, inqualitative agreement with the agn feedback paradigm.

1204.4727	shocked superwinds from the z~2 clumpy star-forming galaxy, zc406690	we have obtained high-resolution data of the z 2 ring-like, clumpystar-forming galaxy (sfg) zc406690 using the vlt/sinfoni with ao (in k-band)and in seeing-limited mode (in h- and j-band). our data includes all of themain strong optical emission lines: [oii], [oiii], ha, hb, [nii] and [sii]. wefind broad, blueshifted ha and [oiii] emission line wings in the spectra of thegalaxy's massive, star-forming clumps (sigma \sim 85 km s^-1) and even broaderwings (up to 70% of the total ha flux, with sigma \sim 290 km s^-1) in regionsspatially offset from the clumps by \sim 2 kpc. the broad emission likelyoriginates from large-scale outflows with mass outflow rates from individualclumps that are 1-8x the sfr of the clumps. based on emission line ratiodiagnostics ([nii]/ha and [sii]/ha) and photoionization and shock models, wefind that the emission from the clumps is due to a combination ofphotoionization from the star-forming regions and shocks generated in theoutflowing component, with 5-30% of the emission deriving from shocks. in termsof the ionization parameter (6x10^7-10^8 cm/s, based on both the sfr and theo32 ratio), density (local electron densities of 300-1800 cm^-3 in and aroundthe clumps, and ionized gas column densities of 1200-8000 msol/pc^2), and sfr(10-40 msol/yr), these clumps more closely resemble nuclear starburst regionsof local ulirgs and dwarf irregulars than hii regions in local galaxies.however, the star-forming clumps are not located in the nucleus as in localstarburst galaxies but instead are situated in a ring several kpc from thecenter of their high-redshift host galaxy, and have an overall disk-likemorphology. the two brightest clumps are quite different in terms of theirinternal properties, energetics and relative ages, and thus we are given aglimpse at two different stages in the formation and evolution of rapidlystar-forming giant clumps at high-z.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1207.5897	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: outflow properties	based on sinfoni ha, [nii] and [sii] ao data of 30 z \sim 2 star-forminggalaxies (sfgs) from the sins and zcsinf surveys, we find a strong correlationof the ha broad flux fraction with the star formation surface density of thegalaxy, with an apparent threshold for strong outflows occurring at 1 msunyr^-1 kpc^-2. above this threshold, we find that sfgs with logm_\ast&gt;10 havesimilar or perhaps greater wind mass loading factors (eta = mdotout/sfr) andfaster outflow velocities than lower mass sfgs. this trend suggests that themajority of outflowing gas at z \sim 2 may derive from high-mass sfgs, and thatthe z \sim 2 mass-metallicity relation is driven more by dilution of enrichedgas in the galaxy gas reservoir than by the efficiency of outflows. the massloading factor is also correlated with the sfr and inclination, such that morestar-forming and face-on galaxies launch more powerful outflows. for galaxiesthat have evidence for strong outflows, we find that the broad emission isspatially extended to at least the half-light radius (\sim a few kpc). wepropose that the observed threshold for strong outflows and the observed massloading of these winds can be explained by a simple model wherein break-out ofwinds is governed by pressure balance in the disk. using the ratio of the [sii]doublet in a broad and narrow component, we find that outflowing gas has adensity of \sim10-100 cm^-3, significantly less than that of the star forminggas (600 cm^-3).

1211.2113	shape evolution of massive early-type galaxies: confirmation of  increased disk prevalence at z&gt;1	we use high-resolution k-band vlt/hawk-i imaging over 0.25 square degrees tostudy the structural evolution of massive early-type galaxies since z~1.mass-selected samples, complete down to log(m/m_sun)~10.7 such that `typical'l* galaxies are included at all redshifts, are drawn from pre-existingphotometric redshift surveys. we then separated the samples into differentredshift slices and classify them as late- or early-type galaxies on the basisof their specific star-formation rate. axis-ratio measurements for the ~400early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.8 are accurate to 0.1 orbetter. the projected axis-ratio distributions are then compared with lowerredshift samples. we find strong evidence for evolution of the populationproperties: early-type galaxies at z&gt;1 are, on average, flatter than at z&lt;1 andthe median projected axis ratio at a fixed mass decreases with redshift.however, we also find that at all epochs z&lt;~2 the very most massive early-typegalaxies (log(m/m_sun)&gt;11.3) are the roundest, with a pronounced lack amongthem of galaxies that are flat in projection. merging is a plausible mechanismthat can explain both results: at all epochs merging is required for early-typegalaxies to grow beyond log(m/m_sun)~11.3, and all early types over timegradually and partially loose their disk-like characteristics.

1211.6160	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: the nature of  dispersion dominated galaxies	we analyze the spectra, spatial distributions and kinematics of ha, [nii] and[sii] emission in a sample of 42, z~2.2 uv/optically selected star forminggalaxies (sfgs) from the sins &amp; zc-sinf surveys, 35 of which were observed inthe adaptive optics mode of sinfoni. this is supplemented by kinematic datafrom 48 z~1-2.5 galaxies from the literature. we find that the kinematicclassification of the high-z sfgs as `dispersion dominated' or `rotationdominated' correlates most strongly with their intrinsic sizes. smallergalaxies are more likely `dispersion-dominated' for two main reasons: 1) therotation velocity scales linearly with galaxy size but intrinsic velocitydispersion does not depend on size, and as such, their ratio is systematicallylower for smaller galaxies, and 2) beam smearing strongly decreases large-scalevelocity gradients and increases observed dispersion much more for galaxieswith sizes at or below the resolution. dispersion dominated sfgs may thus haveintrinsic properties similar to `rotation dominated' sfgs, but are primarilymore compact, lower mass, less metal enriched and may have higher gasfractions, plausibly because they represent an earlier evolutionary state.

1301.0320	the radial distribution of star formation in galaxies at z~1 from the  3d-hst survey	the assembly of galaxies can be described by the distribution of their starformation as a function of cosmic time. thanks to the wfc3 grism on hst it isnow possible to measure this beyond the local universe. here we present thespatial distribution of halpha emission for a sample of 54 stronglystar-forming galaxies at z~1 in the 3d-hst treasury survey. by stacking thehalpha emission we find that star formation occurred in approximatelyexponential distributions at z~1, with median sersic index of n=1.0+-0.2. thestacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a=0.58+-0.09 in halpha,consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. keckspectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence forrotation, with inclination-corrected velocities of 90 to 330 km/s. the moststraightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation instrongly star-forming galaxies at z~1 generally occurred in disks. the disksappear to be "scaled-up" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they haveew(halpha)~100 angstroms out to the solar orbit and they have star formationsurface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.

1301.5025	on the evolution of the bi-modal distribution of galaxies in the plane  of specific star formation rate versus stellar mass	we have compared the observed distribution of galaxies in the plane ofspecific star formation rate versus stellar mass with the predictions of thegarching semi-analytic model at redshifts 0, 1 and 2. the goal is to testwhether the implementation of radio mode agn feedback, which is responsible forterminating the formation of stars in high mass galaxies, provides an adequatematch to current high-redshift observations. the fraction of quenched galaxiesas a function of stellar mass in the models is in good agreement with data atz=0 and z=1. by z=2, there are too few quenched galaxies with low stellarmasses in the models. at z=2, the population of galaxies with no ongoing starformation is clearly separated from the `main sequence' of star-forminggalaxies in the data. this is not found in the models, because z=2 galaxieswith stellar masses less than 10^11 solar masses are predicted to host blackholes with relatively low masses (less than 10^8 solar masses). the currentimplementation of radio mode feedback from such black holes reduces the coolingrates from the surrounding halo, but does not generate sufficient energy tostop star formation entirely. we suggest that the models may be brought intobetter agreement with the data if black hole growth is triggered by discinstabilities in addition to major mergers, and if feedback mechanismsassociated with the formation of galactic bulges act to quench star formationin galaxies.

1304.2391	the assembly of milky way-like galaxies since z~2.5	galaxies with the mass of the milky way dominate the stellar mass density ofthe universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. here westudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3d-hstand candels treasury surveys. we find that galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of log(m)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with mostof the star formation occurring before z=1. in marked contrast to the assemblyhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to largeradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. we therefore rule out simple models in whichbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed aroundthem. instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. we find that afterz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continuedto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1305.6931	structural evolution of early-type galaxies to z=2.5 in candels	projected axis ratio measurements of 880 early-type galaxies at redshifts1&lt;z&lt;2.5 selected from candels are used to reconstruct and model their intrinsicshapes. the sample is selected on the basis of multiple rest-frame colors toreflect low star-formation activity. we demonstrate that these galaxies as anensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth lightprofiles, similar to visually classified early-type galaxies. similar to theirpresent-day counterparts, the z&gt;1 early-type galaxies show a variety ofintrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributionscannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with verysimilar intrinsic shapes. however, a two-population model for the intrinsicshapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat(c/a~0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratiodistributions of both present-day and z&gt;1 early-type galaxies. we find that theproportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies'stellar mass, and - at a given mass - on redshift. for present-day and z&lt;1early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. at z&gt;1this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here(10^10&lt;m*/m_sun&lt;10^11), because the oblate fraction among massive (m*~10^11m_sun) was much higher in the past: 0.59+-0.10 at z&gt;1, compared to 0.20+-0.02at z~0.1. in contrast, the oblate fraction among low-mass early-type galaxies(log(m*/m_sun)&lt;10.5) increased toward the present, from 0.38+-0.11 at z&gt;1 to0.72+-0.06 at z=0.

1307.0833	the lack of star formation gradients in galaxy groups up to z~1.6	in the local universe, galaxy properties show a strong dependence onenvironment. in cluster cores, early type galaxies dominate, whereasstar-forming galaxies are more and more common in the outskirts. at higherredshifts and in somewhat less dense environments (e.g. galaxy groups), thesituation is less clear. one open issue is that of whether and how the starformation rate (sfr) of galaxies in groups depends on the distance from thecentre of mass. to shed light on this topic, we have built a sample of x-rayselected galaxy groups at 0&lt;z&lt;1.6 in various blank fields (ecdfs, cosmos,goods). we use a sample of spectroscopically confirmed group members withstellar mass m &gt;10^10.3 m_sun in order to have a high spectroscopiccompleteness. as we use only spectroscopic redshifts, our results are notaffected by uncertainties due to projection effects. we use several sfrindicators to link the star formation (sf) activity to the galaxy environment.taking advantage of the extremely deep mid-infrared spitzer mips andfar-infrared herschel pacs observations, we have an accurate, broad-bandmeasure of the sfr for the bulk of the star-forming galaxies. we usemulti-wavelength sed fitting techniques to estimate the stellar masses of allobjects and the sfr of the mips and pacs undetected galaxies. we analyse thedependence of the sf activity, stellar mass and specific sfr on thegroup-centric distance, up to z~1.6, for the first time. we do not find anycorrelation between the mean sfr and group-centric distance at any redshift. wedo not observe any strong mass segregation either, in agreement withpredictions from simulations. our results suggest that either groups have amuch smaller spread in accretion times with respect to the clusters and thatthe relaxation time is longer than the group crossing time.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1309.3281	validation of the equilibrium model for galaxy evolution to z~3 through  molecular gas and dust observations of lensed star-forming galaxies	we combine iram plateau de bure interferometer and herschel pacs and spiremeasurements to study the dust and gas contents of high-redshift star forminggalaxies. we present new observations for a sample of 17 lensed galaxies atz=1.4-3.1, which allow us to directly probe the cold ism of normal star-forminggalaxies with stellar masses of ~10^10msun, a regime otherwise not (yet)accessible by individual detections in herschel and molecular gas studies. thelensed galaxies are combined with reference samples of sub-millimeter andnormal z~1-2 star-forming galaxies with similar far-infrared photometry tostudy the gas and dust properties of galaxies in the sfr-m*-redshift parameterspace. the mean gas depletion timescale of main sequence galaxies at z&gt;2 ismeasured to be only ~450myr, a factor of ~1.5 (~5) shorter than at z=1 (z=0),in agreement with a (1+z)^-1 scaling. the mean gas mass fraction at z=2.8 is40+/-15% (44% after incompleteness correction), suggesting a flattening or evena reversal of the trend of increasing gas fractions with redshift recentlyobserved up to z~2. the depletion timescale and gas fractions of the z&gt;2 normalstar-forming galaxies can be explained under the "equilibrium model" for galaxyevolution, in which the gas reservoir of galaxies is the primary driver of theredshift evolution of specific star formation rates. due to their high starformation efficiencies and low metallicities, the z&gt;2 lensed galaxies have warmdust despite being located on the star formation main sequence. at fixedmetallicity, they also have a gas-to-dust ratio 1.7 times larger than observedlocally when using the same standard techniques, suggesting that applying thelocal calibration of the relation between gas-to-dust ratio and metallicity toinfer the molecular gas mass of high redshift galaxies may lead to systematicdifferences with co-based estimates.

1310.3819	the progenitors of the compact early-type galaxies at high-redshift	we use goods and candels images to identify progenitors of massive (log m &gt;10 msun) compact "early-type" galaxies (etgs) at z~1.6. since merging andaccretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if theprogenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compactthemselves. we select candidate progenitors among compact lyman-break galaxiesat z~3 based on their mass, sfr and central stellar density and find that theseaccount for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact etgs at z~1.6. wefind that the average far-uv sed of the candidates is redder than that of thenon-candidates, but the optical and mid-ir sed are the same, implying that theredder uv of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration, andconsistent with more evolved (aging) star-formation. this is in line with otherevidence that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity amonghigh-redshift massive galaxies. we also find that the light distribution ofboth the compact etgs and their candidate progenitors does not show anyextended "halos" surrounding the compact "core", both in individual images andin stacks. we argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology ofmerger remnants, even if gas-rich, as predicted by n-body simulations. thissuggests that the compact etgs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseousaccretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected inthe hst images, with their stellar mass assembling in-situ, and that they havenot experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z~1.6.

1310.4177	direct measurements of dust attenuation in z~1.5 star-forming galaxies  from 3d-hst: implications for dust geometry and star formation rates	the nature of dust in distant galaxies is not well understood, and untilrecently few direct dust measurements have been possible. we investigate dustin distant star-forming galaxies using near-infrared grism spectra of the3d-hst survey combined with archival multi-wavelength photometry. these dataallow us to make a direct comparison between dust around star-forming regions($a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$) and the integrated dust content ($a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$).we select a sample of 163 galaxies between $1.36\le{}z\le1.5$ with h$\alpha$signal-to-noise ratio $\ge5$ and measure balmer decrements from stacked spectrato calculate $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$. first, we stack spectra in bins of$a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, and find that$a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}=1.86\,a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, with a significance of$\sigma=1.7$. our result is consistent with the two-component dust model, inwhich galaxies contain both diffuse and stellar birth cloud dust. next, westack spectra in bins of specific star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{ssfr}$),star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{sfr}$), and stellar mass ($\log{}m_*$). wefind that on average $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$ increases with sfr and mass, butdecreases with increasing ssfr. interestingly, the data hint that the amount ofextra attenuation decreases with increasing ssfr. this trend is expected fromthe two-component model, as the extra attenuation will increase once olderstars outside the star-forming regions become more dominant in the galaxyspectrum. finally, using balmer decrements we derive dust-corrected h$\alpha$sfrs, and find that stellar population modeling produces incorrect sfrs ifrapidly declining star formation histories are included in the exploredparameter space.

1310.5702	a candels - 3d-hst synergy: resolved star formation patterns at 0.7 &lt; z  &lt; 1.5	we analyze the resolved stellar populations of 473 massive star-forminggalaxies at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, with multi-wavelength broad-band imaging fromcandels and halpha surface brightness profiles at the same kiloparsecresolution from 3d-hst. together, this unique data set sheds light on how theassembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars arebeing formed. we find the halpha morphologies to resemble more closely thoseobserved in the acs i band than in the wfc3 h band, especially for the largersystems. we next derive a novel prescription for halpha dust corrections, whichaccounts for extra extinction towards hii regions. the prescription leads toconsistent sfr estimates and reproduces the observed relation between thehalpha/uv luminosity ratio and visual extinction, both on a pixel-by-pixel andon a galaxy-integrated level. we find the surface density of star formation tocorrelate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatiallyresolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called 'main sequence of starformation' established on a galaxy-integrated level. deviations from thisrelation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions ofgalaxies. clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated withenhanced halpha equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific starformation rates compared to the underlying disk. their halpha/uv luminosityratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting the acs clumpselection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formationactivity that are the least obscured by dust. our analysis emphasizes thatmonochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited bymass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous starformation histories.

1401.2455	candels visual classifications: scheme, data release, and first results	we have undertaken an ambitious program to visually classify all galaxies inthe five candels fields down to h&lt;24.5 involving the dedicated efforts of 65individual classifiers. once completed, we expect to have detailedmorphological classifications for over 50,000 galaxies up to z&lt;4 over all thefields. here, we present our detailed visual classification scheme, which wasdesigned to cover a wide range of candels science goals. this scheme includesthe basic hubble sequence types, but also includes a detailed look at mergersand interactions, the clumpiness of galaxies, $k$-corrections, and a variety ofother structural properties. in this paper, we focus on the first field to becompleted -- goods-s. the wide area coverage spanning the full field includes7634 galaxies that have been classified by at least three different people. inthe deep area of the field, 2534 galaxies have been classified by at least fivedifferent people at three different depths. with this paper, we release to thepublic all of the visual classifications in goods-s along with the gui that wedeveloped to classify galaxies. we find that the level of agreement amongclassifiers is good and depends on both the galaxy magnitude and the galaxytype, with disks showing the highest level of agreement and irregulars thelowest. a comparison of our classifications with the sersic index andrest-frame colors shows a clear separation between disk and spheroidpopulations. finally, we explore morphological k-corrections between the v-bandand h-band observations and find that a small fraction (84 galaxies in total)are classified as being very different between these two bands. these galaxiestypically have very clumpy and extended morphology or are very faint in thev-band.

1402.0006	the total infrared luminosity may significantly overestimate the star  formation rate of recently quenched galaxies	the total infrared (ir) luminosity is very useful for estimating the starformation rate (sfr) of galaxies, but converting the ir luminosity into an sfrrelies on assumptions that do not hold for all galaxies. we test theeffectiveness of the ir luminosity as an sfr indicator by applying it tosynthetic spectral energy distributions generated from three-dimensionalhydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies and galaxy mergers. ingeneral, the sfr inferred from the ir luminosity agrees well with the trueinstantaneous sfr of the simulated galaxies. however, for the major mergers inwhich a strong starburst is induced, the sfr inferred from the ir luminositycan overestimate the instantaneous sfr during the post-starburst phase bygreater than two orders of magnitude. even though the instantaneous sfrdecreases rapidly after the starburst, the stars that were formed in thestarburst remain dust-obscured and thus produce significant ir luminosity.consequently, use of the ir luminosity as an sfr indicator may cause one toconclude that post-starburst galaxies are still star-forming, whereas inreality, star formation was recently quenched.

1402.0866	bulge growth and quenching since z = 2.5 in candels/3d-hst	exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all 5 candels fields, andaccurate redshift information provided by 3d-hst, we investigate the relationbetween structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764galaxies above 10^10 msun, spanning the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. for thefirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single sersic fit andtwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the h-band lightdistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolvedstellar population modeling. we confirm that the increased bulge prominenceamong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-opticalobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellarmass. moreover, we observe an increase of the typical sersic index andbulge-to-total ratio (with median b/t reaching 40-50%) among star-forminggalaxies above 10^11 msun. given that quenching for these most massive systemsis likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growthprecedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. we demonstrate thatthe bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a morereliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy thanthe total stellar mass. the same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-artsemi-analytic model by somerville et al. in the latter, bulges and black holesgrow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and agn-feedbackshuts off star formation. further observations will be required to pin downstar formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply they must beinternal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.

1403.3689	3d-hst wfc3-selected photometric catalogs in the five candels/3d-hst  fields: photometry, photometric redshifts and stellar masses	the 3d-hst and candels programs have provided wfc3 and acs spectroscopy andphotometry over ~900 square arcminutes in five fields: aegis, cosmos,goods-north, goods-south, and the ukidss uds field. all these fields have awealth of publicly available imaging datasets in addition to the hst data,which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (seds)of objects over a wide wavelength range. in this paper we describe aphotometric analysis of the candels and 3d-hst hst imaging and the ancillaryimaging data at wavelengths 0.3um to 8um. objects were selected in the wfc3near-ir bands, and their seds were determined by carefully taking the effectsof the point spread function in each observation into account. a total of 147distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis. the photometry is madeavailable in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a mastercatalog containing all objects in the entire survey. we also provide deriveddata products: photometric redshifts, determined with the eazy code, andstellar population parameters determined with the fast code. we make all theimaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductionsof the wfc3 imaging in all five fields. 3d-hst is a spectroscopic survey withthe wfc3 and acs grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitutea necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. all the datapresented in this paper are available through the 3d-hst website.

1404.4874	dense cores in galaxies out to z=2.5 in sdss, ultravista, and the five  3d-hst/candels fields	the dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguingenvironments in the universe. in this paper we ask when these dense cores wereformed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. we selectgalaxies that have a stellar mass &gt;3x10^10 msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,using the 3d-hst survey and data at low redshift. remarkably, the numberdensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 tothe present. this decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and theresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. we inferthat dense cores were mostly formed at z&gt;2.5, consistent with their largelyquiescent stellar populations. while the cores appear to form early, thegalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total massesincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radiiincrease by a factor of 5-6. as a result, the contribution of dense cores tothe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% atz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. because of their early formation, the contribution ofdense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strongfunction of redshift. the stars in cores with m_1kpc&gt;3x10^10 msun make up ~0.1%of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, dependingon their imf. the formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11msun of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant starformation at larger radii.

1406.3350	a massive galaxy in its core formation phase three billion years after  the big bang	most massive galaxies are thought to have formed their dense stellar cores atearly cosmic epochs. however, cores in their formation phase have not yet beenobserved. previous studies have found galaxies with high gas velocitydispersions or small apparent sizes but so far no objects have been identifiedwith both the stellar structure and the gas dynamics of a forming core. here wepresent a candidate core in formation 11 billion years ago, at z=2.3.goods-n-774 has a stellar mass of 1.0x10^11 msun, a half-light radius of 1.0kpc, and a star formation rate of 90[+45-20]msun/yr. the star forming gas has avelocity dispersion 317+-30 km/s, amongst the highest ever measured. it issimilar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants ofgoods-n-774, compact quiescent galaxies at z~2 and giant elliptical galaxies inthe nearby universe. galaxies such as goods-n-774 appear to be rare; however,from the star formation rate and size of the galaxy we infer that many starforming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical andnear-infrared surveys.

1409.1214	galaxy zoo: candels barred disks and bar fractions	the formation of bars in disk galaxies is a tracer of the dynamical maturityof the population. previous studies have found that the incidence of bars indisks decreases from the local universe to z ~ 1, and by z &gt; 1 simulationspredict that bar features in dynamically mature disks should be extremely rare.here we report the discovery of strong barred structures in massive diskgalaxies at z ~ 1.5 in deep rest-frame optical images from candels. from withina sample of 876 disk galaxies identified by visual classification in galaxyzoo, we identify 123 barred galaxies. selecting a sub-sample within the sameregion of the evolving galaxy luminosity function (brighter than l*), we findthat the bar fraction across the redshift range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 2 (f_bar = 10.7 +6.3-3.5% after correcting for incompleteness) does not significantly evolve. wediscuss the implications of this discovery in the context of existingsimulations and our current understanding of the way disk galaxies have evolvedover the last 11 billion years.

1501.06840	quenching and morphological transformation in semi-analytic models and  candels	we examine the spheroid growth and star formation quenching experienced bygalaxies from z~3 to the present by studying the evolution with redshift of thequiescent and spheroid-dominated fractions of galaxies from the candels andgama surveys. we compare the observed fractions with predictions from asemi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and agnfeedback due to mergers and disk instabilities. we facilitate directmorphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar massratios to sersic indices. we then subdivide our population into the fourquadrants of the ssfr-sersic index plane and study the buildup of each of thesesubpopulations. we find that the fraction of star forming disks declinessteadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time.the fractions of star forming spheroids and quiescent disks are bothnon-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied, atabout 10% and 15-20% respectively. our model is qualitatively successful atreproducing the evolution of the two "main" populations (star formingdisk-dominated galaxies and quiescent spheroid-dominated galaxies), andapproximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predictsa stronger decline in star forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent disks,than seen in the observations. a model with an additional channel for bulgegrowth via disk instabilities agrees better overall with the observations thana model in which bulges may grow only through mergers. we study evolutionarytracks of some individual galaxies as they experience morphologicaltransformation and quenching, and examine the importance of different physicaldrivers of this transformation (major and minor mergers and diskinstabilities). we find that complex histories with multiple transformativeevents are the norm.

1502.02659	a wfc3 grism emission line redshift catalog in the goods-south field	we combine hst/wfc3 imaging and g141 grism observations from the candels and3d-hst surveys to produce a catalog of grism spectroscopic redshifts forgalaxies in the candels/goods-south field. the wfc3/g141 grism spectra cover awavelength range of 1.1&lt;lambda&lt;1.7 microns with a resolving power of r~130 forpoint sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out toz~3.5. the catalog is selected in the h-band (f160w) and includes both galaxieswith and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. grism spectraare extracted for all h-band detected galaxies with h&lt;24 and a candelsphotometric redshift z_phot &gt; 0.6. the resulting spectra are visually inspectedto identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlationwith empirical spectral templates. to establish the accuracy of our redshifts,we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from theliterature. using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields aprecision of sigma_nmad=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which isconsistent with the accuracy reported by the 3d-hst team. our final catalogcovers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies ingoods-s. roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with nopreviously published spectroscopic redshift. these new redshifts span a rangeof 0.677 &lt; z &lt; 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. the catalogcontains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z&gt;1.5. in addition, wepresent 20 galaxy pair candidates identified for the first time using the grismredshifts in our catalog, including four new galaxy pairs at z~2, nearlydoubling the number of such pairs previously identified.

1503.08831	first results from the virial survey: the stellar content of  $uvj$-selected quiescent galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2$ from kmos	we investigate the stellar populations of 25 massive, galaxies($\log[m_\ast/m_\odot] \geq 10.9$) at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2$ using data obtained withthe k-band multi-object spectrograph (kmos) on the eso vlt. targets wereselected to be quiescent based on their broadband colors and redshifts usingdata from the 3d-hst grism survey. the mean redshift of our sample is $\bar{z}= 1.75$, where kmos yj-band data probe age- and metallicity-sensitiveabsorption features in the rest-frame optical, including the $g$ band, fe i,and high-order balmer lines. fitting simple stellar population models to astack of our kmos spectra, we derive a mean age of $1.03^{+0.13}_{-0.08}$ gyr.we confirm previous results suggesting a correlation between color and age forquiescent galaxies, finding mean ages of $1.22^{+0.56}_{-0.19}$ gyr and$0.85^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ gyr for the reddest and bluest galaxies in our sample.combining our kmos measurements with those obtained from previous studies at$0.2 &lt; z &lt; 2$ we find evidence for a $2-3$ gyr spread in the formation epoch ofmassive galaxies. at $z &lt; 1$ the measured stellar ages are consistent withpassive evolution, while at $1 &lt; z \lesssim2$ they appear to saturate at$\sim$1 gyr, which likely reflects changing demographics of the (mean)progenitor population. by comparing to star-formation histories inferred for"normal" star-forming galaxies, we show that the timescales required to formmassive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 1.5$ are consistent with the enhanced$\alpha$-element abundances found in massive local early-type galaxies.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1506.03085	forming compact massive galaxies	in this paper we study a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies: thetransition of star forming galaxies into massive (m_stars~10^11 msun), compact(r_e~1 kpc) quiescent galaxies, which takes place from z~3 to z~1.5. we use hstgrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3d-hst/candels fields,more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine thesedata with keck mosfire and nirspec spectroscopy. we first confirm that apopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, usingk-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5. they have a mediannii/halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with sfr(tot)/sfr(halpha)~10, andhave a large range of observed line widths. we infer from the kinematics andspatial distribution of halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionizedgas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. bycombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics areconsistent with a nearly keplerian fall-off from v_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc tov_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius isdominated by the dense stellar component. next, we study the size and massevolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. even thoughindividual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compactionand mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed asimple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r_e) ~ 0.3 d(logm_stars). this mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within afixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density orvelocity dispersion threshold. as shown in other studies, the mode of growthchanges after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steeptrack in the size-mass plane.

1507.03999	where stars form: inside-out growth and coherent star formation from hst  halpha maps of 2676 galaxies across the main sequence at z~1	we present ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies atz~1, made possible by the wfc3 grism on hst. employing this capability over allfive 3d-hst/candels fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. by creating deepstacked halpha (ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of1x10^-18\erg\s\cm^2\arcsec^2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionizedgas out to &gt;10kpc for typical l* galaxies at this epoch. we find that thespatial extent of the ha distribution increases with stellar mass asr(ha)[kpc]=1.5(mstars/10^10msun)^0.23. furthermore, the ha emission is moreextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-outassembly of galactic disks. this effect, however, is mass dependent withr(ha)/r(stars)=1.1(m/10^10msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(ha)~r(stars).we map the ha distribution as a function of sfr(ir+uv) and find evidence for`coherent star formation' across the sfr-m plane: above the main sequence, hais enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, ha is depressed at allradii. this suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving theenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks ofgalaxies. it also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequenceis real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. athigh masses (10^10.5&lt;m/msun&lt;10^11), above the main sequence, ha is particularlyenhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive blackholes. below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and astrong central dip in the ew(ha), and the inferred specific star formationrate, appears. importantly though, across the entirety of the sfr-m plane, theabsolute star formation rate as traced by ha is always centrally peaked, evenin galaxies below the main sequence.

1508.04771	galaxy structure as a driver of the star formation sequence slope and  scatter	it is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relationbetween their star formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass (m$_{\star}$), the"star-formation sequence", and (2) the sfrs of galaxies correlate with theirstructure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescentgalaxies at fixed mass. here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of thestar-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the sersicindices, $n$, of galaxies across the sfr-m$_{\star}$ plane. we use amass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ selected from the 3d-hstphotometric catalogs. galaxy light profiles parameterized by $n$ are based onhubble space telescope candels near-infrared imaging. we use a single sfrindicator empirically-calibrated from stacks of spitzer/mips 24$\mu$m imaging,adding the unobscured and obscured star formation. we find that the scatter ofthe star-formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatterdue to variations in $n$ at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from0.14$\pm$0.02 dex at $z\sim2$ to 0.30$\pm$0.04 dex at $z&lt;1$. while the slope ofthe log(sfr)-log(m$_{\star}$) relation is of order unity for disk-likegalaxies, galaxies with $n&gt;2$ (implying more dominant bulges) havesignificantly lower sfr/m$_{\star}$ than the main ridgeline of thestar-formation sequence. these results suggest that bulges in massive $z\sim2$galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentrationare relatively young. at $z&lt;1$, the presence of older bulges withinstar-forming galaxies lowers global sfr/m$_{\star}$, decreasing the slope andcontributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.

0807.2868	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: iv. evolution in the  scaling relations of spheroids	we develop a model for the origins and redshift evolution of spheroid scalingrelations. we consider spheroid sizes, velocity dispersions, masses, profileshapes (sersic indices), and black hole (bh) masses, and their relatedscalings. our approach combines advantages of observational constraints in halooccupation models and hydrodynamic merger simulations. this allows us toseparate the relative roles of dissipation, dry mergers, formation time, andprogenitor evolution, and identify their effects on scalings at each redshift.dissipation is the most important factor determining spheroid sizes andfundamental plane (fp) scalings, and can account for the fp tilt anddifferences between disk and spheroid scalings. because disks at high-z havehigher gas fractions, mergers are more gas-rich, yielding more compactspheroids. this predicts mass-dependent evolution in spheroid sizes, inagreement with observations. this relates to subtle evolution in the fp,important to studies that assume a fixed intrinsic fp. this also predicts mildevolution in bh-host correlations, towards larger bhs at higher z. dry mergersare significant, but only for massive systems which form early: they formcompact, but undergo dry mergers (consistent with observations) such that theirsizes at later times are similar to spheroids of similar mass formed morerecently. we model descendants of observed compact high-z spheroids: most willbecome cores of bcgs, with sizes, velocity dispersions, and bh massesconsistent with observations, but we identify a fraction that might survive toz=0 intact.

0808.2642	structure and star formation in galaxies out to z=3: evidence for  surface density dependent evolution and upsizing	we present an analysis of galaxies in the cdf-south. we find a tight relationto z=3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small,and blue galaxies being large. we show that the relation is driven by stellarsurface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surfacedensity are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies withlow surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates.surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated withspecific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. hence stellar mass byitself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. ingeneral, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific starformation rates at higher redshift. specifically, galaxies with a surfacedensity of 1-3 10^9 msun/kpc^2 are "red and dead" at low redshift,approximately 50% are forming stars at z=1, and almost all are forming stars byz=2. this provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution ofgalaxies onto the red sequence. the sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolvelike 1/(1+z)^(0.59 +- 0.10). hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing intheir history. the size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies, andquiescent galaxies. the persistence of the structural relations from z=0 toz=2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to thehubble sequence exists out to z=2.5, and possibly beyond. the star forminggalaxies at z &gt;= 1.5 are quite different from star forming galaxies at z=0, asthey have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation time scalescomparable to the orbital time.

astro-ph;0312236	the detailed fundamental plane of two high redshift clusters: ms 2053-04  at z=0.58 and ms 1054-03 at z=0.83	we study the fundamental plane relation in high redshift clusters using asample of 26 galaxies in ms 2053-04 (z=0.583) and 22 galaxies in ms 1054-03(z=0.83). the zeropoint and scatter are compared to results for lower redshiftclusters in order to trace evolutionary effects. furthermore, our large sampleenables us to investigate correlations between residuals from the fundamentalplane and other characteristics of the galaxies, such as color, $h\beta$linestrength, spatial distribution, and mass. the observed scatter of theearly-type galaxies with sigma &gt; 100 km/s around the fundamental plane is 0.134and 0.106 in log r_e for ms 2053-04 and ms 1054-03 respectively. the residualsfrom the fundamental plane of ms 2053-04 are correlated with residuals from the$h\beta - \sigma$ relation, suggesting that stellar populations are playing arole in shaping the fundamental plane. the measured evolution in log m/l isinfluenced by selection effects, as galaxies with lower m/l in the johnsonb-band enter a magnitude-limited sample more easily. when we select high massearly-type galaxies to avoid this bias, we find $\log m/l_b \sim -0.47 z$ and aformation redshift $z_{form} \sim 2.95$, similar to earlier results.

astro-ph;0404471	stellar populations and kinematics of red galaxies at z&gt;2: implications  for the formation of massive galaxies	we recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z&gt;2 with redrest-frame optical colors. these distant red galaxies (drgs) are efficientlyselected by the simple observed color criterion j-k&gt;2.3. in this paper wepresent nir spectroscopy with keck/nirspec of six drgs at 2.4&lt;z&lt;3.2. we detectcontinuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. equivalentwidths of h alpha are 20-30 ang, smaller than measured for lbgs and nearbylirgs, and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. the modest equivalent widthsimply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate, or thatthey are very dusty. fitting both the photometry and the h alpha lines, we findcontinuum extinction a_v=1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 gyr, star formation rates 200-400solar masses/yr, and stellar masses 1-5x10^11 solar masses for models withconstant star formation rates. from [nii]/h alpha ratios we infer that themetallicities are high, 1-1.5 x solar. for four galaxies we can determine linewidths from the optical emission lines. the widths are high, ranging from130-240 km/s, and by combining data for lbgs and drgs we find significantcorrelations between linewidth and restframe u-v color, and between linewidthand stellar mass. the latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the``baryonic tully-fisher relation'' for nearby galaxies. the median dynamicalmass is ~2x10^11 solar masses, supporting the high stellar masses inferred fromthe photometry. we find that the median m/l_v ~ 0.8, a factor of ~5 higher thanmeasured for lbgs. we infer from our small sample that drgs are dustier, moremetal rich, more massive, and have higher ages than z=3 lbgs of the samerest-frame v-band luminosity. their high m/l ratios imply that they contributesignificantly to the stellar mass density at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0603063	direct measurements of the stellar continua and balmer/4000 angstrom  breaks of red z&gt;2 galaxies: redshifts and improved constraints on stellar  populations	we use near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy obtained with gnirs on gemini,nirspec on keck, and isaac on the vlt to study the rest-frame optical continuaof three `distant red galaxies' (having js - ks &gt; 2.3) at z&gt;2. all three galaxyspectra show the balmer/4000 angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. thespectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum withan estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. these redshifts agree well withthe emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with halpha emission. thistechnique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in therest-frame uv, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selectedin optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. furthermore, weuse the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of halpha together withevolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,dust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. inclusionof the nir spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range ofpossible solutions for stellar population properties. we find that the stellarpopulations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dustystarburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxywith a strong break and no detected line emission. the dusty starburst galaxyhas an age of 0.3 gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11 msun. the spectra of thetwo most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3-1.4 gyr and stellar masses of4*10^11 msun. the large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthensour previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry. largersamples are required to determine the relative frequency of dusty starburstsand (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0606536	measuring the average evolution of luminous galaxies at z&lt;3: the  rest-frame optical luminosity density, spectral energy distribution, and  stellar mass density	(abridged) we present the evolution of the volume averaged properties of therest-frame optically luminous galaxy population to z~3, determined from fourdisjoint deep fields with optical to near-infrared wavelength coverage. weselect galaxies above a rest-frame v-band luminosity of 3x10^10 lsol andcharacterize their rest-frame uv through optical properties via the meanspectral energy distribution (sed). to measure evolution we apply the sameselection criteria to a sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky surveyand combo-17. the mean rest-frame 2200ang through v-band sed becomes steadilybluer with increasing redshift but at z&lt;3 the mean sed falls within the rangedefined by ``normal'' galaxies in the nearby universe. we measure stellarmass-to-light ratios (mstar/l) by fitting models to the rest-frame uv-opticalseds and derive the stellar mass density. the stellar mass density in luminousgalaxies has increased by a factor of 3.5-7.9 from z=3 to z=0.1, includingfield-to-field variance uncertainties. after correcting to total, the measuredmass densities at z&lt;2 lie below the integral of the star formation rate (sfr)density as a function of redshift as derived from uv selected samples. this mayindicate a systematic error in the mass densities or sfr(z) estimates. we findlarge discrepancies between recent model predictions for the evolution of themass density and our results, even when our observational selection is appliedto the models. finally we determine that distant red galaxies (selected to havej_s - k_s&gt;2.3) in our lv selected samples contribute 30% and 64% of the stellarmass budget at z~2 and z~ 2.8 respectively. these galaxies are largely absentfrom uv surveys and this result highlights the need for mass selection of highredshift galaxies.

astro-ph;0607649	comparing dynamical and photometric mass estimates of low- and  high-redshift galaxies: random and systematic uncertainties	we determine the importance of redshift-dependent systematic effects in thedetermination of stellar masses from broad band spectral energy distributions(seds), using high quality kinematic and photometric data of early-typegalaxies at z~1 and z~0. we find that photometric masses of z~1 galaxies can besystematically different, by up to a factor of 2, from photometric masses ofz~0 galaxies with the same dynamical mass. the magnitude of this bias dependson the choice of stellar population synthesis model and the rest-framewavelength range used in the fits. the best result, i.e., without significantbias, is obtained when rest-frame optical seds are fitted with models frombruzual&amp;charlot (2003). when the seds are extended to the rest-frame near-ir, abias is introduced: photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies increase by a factorof 2 relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies. when we use themaraston (2005) models, the photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies are lowrelative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies by a factor of ~1.8.this offset occurs both for fits based on rest-frame optical seds, and fitsbased on rest-frame optical+near-ir seds. the results indicate that modeluncertainties produce uncertainties as high as a factor of 2.5 in massestimates from rest-frame near-ir photometry, independent of uncertainties dueto unknown star formation histories.

astro-ph;0608446	spectroscopic identification of massive galaxies at z~2.3 with strongly  suppressed star formation	we present first results of a spectroscopic survey targeting k-selectedgalaxies at z=2.0-2.7 using the gnirs instrument on gemini-south. we obtainednear-infrared spectra with a wavelength coverage of 1.0-2.5 micron for 26k-bright galaxies (k&lt;19.7) selected from the musyc survey using photometricredshifts. we successfully derived spectroscopic redshifts for all 26 galaxiesusing rest-frame optical emission lines or the redshifted balmer/4000 angstrombreak. twenty galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7, forwhich bright emission lines like halpha and [oiii] fall in atmospheric windows.surprisingly, we detected no emission lines for nine of these 20 galaxies. themedian 2 sigma upper limit on the rest-frame equivalent width of halpha forthese nine galaxies is ~10 angstrom. the stellar continuum emission of thesesame nine galaxies is best fitted by evolved stellar population models. thebest-fit star formation rate (sfr) is zero for five out of nine galaxies, andconsistent with zero within 1 sigma for the remaining four. thus, both thehalpha measurements and the independent stellar continuum modeling imply that45% of our k-selected galaxies are not forming stars intensely. this highfraction of galaxies without detected line emission and low sfrs may imply thatthe suppression of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at higher redshiftthan is predicted by current cdm galaxy formation models. however, obscuredstar formation may have been missed, and deep mid-infrared imaging is needed toclarify this situation.

astro-ph;0609548	what do we learn from irac observations of galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5?	we analyze very deep hst, vlt and spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5in the hubble deep field south. the sample is selected from the deepest publick-band imaging currently available. we show that the rest-frame u-v vs v-jcolor-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations ofdistant galaxies. galaxies with red rest-frame u-v colors are generally red inrest-frame v-j as well. however, at a given u-v color a range in v-j colorsexists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxiesfrom old, passively evolving galaxies. we quantify the effects of iracphotometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z&gt;2 galaxies.the estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantlywhen adding irac data to the ubvijhk photometry. however, for individualgalaxies the addition of irac can improve the constraints on the stellarpopulations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar massdecrease by a factor of 2.7 for red (u-v &gt; 1) galaxies, but only by a factor of1.3 for blue (u-v &lt; 1) galaxies. we find a similar color-dependence of theimprovement for estimates of age and dust extinction. in addition, theimprovement from adding irac depends on the availability of full near-infraredjhk coverage; if only k-band were available, the mass uncertainties of bluegalaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor 1.9. finally, we find thata trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z&gt;2. the mostmassive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame u-v colors compared tolower mass galaxies even when allowing for complex star formation histories.

0810.3459	the rise of massive red galaxies: the color-magnitude and color-stellar  mass diagrams for z &lt; ~2 from the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile  (musyc)	we present the color-magnitude and color-stellar mass diagrams for galaxieswith z_phot &lt; ~2, based on a k &lt; 22 (ab) catalog of the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs) from the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc). ourmain sample of 7840 galaxies contains 1297 m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies in therange 0.2 &lt; z_phot &lt; 1.8. we show empirically that this catalog isapproximately complete for m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies for z_phot &lt; 1.8. forthis mass-limited sample, we show that the locus of the red sequencecolor-stellar mass relation evolves as del(u-r) ~ (-0.44+/-0.02) z_phot forz_phot &lt; ~1.2. for z_phot &gt; ~1.3, however, we are no longer able to reliablydistinguish red and blue subpopulations from the observed color distribution;we show that this would require much deeper near infrared data. at 1.5 &lt; z_phot&lt;1.8, the comoving number density of m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies is ~50% of thelocal value, with a red fraction of ~33%. making a parametric fit to theobserved evolution, we find n_tot(z) ~ (1+z_phot)^(-0.52+/-0.12(+/-0.20)). wefind stronger evolution in the red fraction: f_red(z) ~(1+z_phot)^(-1.17+/-0.18(+/-0.21)). through a series of sensitivity analyses,we show that the most important sources of systematic error are: 1. systematicdifferences in the analysis of the z~0 and z&gt;&gt;0 samples; 2. systematic effectsassociated with details of the photometric redshift calculation; and 3.uncertainties in the photometric calibration. with this in mind, we show thatour results based on photometric redshifts are consistent with a completelyindependent analysis which does not require redshift information for individualgalaxies. our results suggest that, at most, 1/5 of local red sequence galaxieswith m_* &gt;10^11 m_sol were already in place at z ~ 2.

0811.1773	the evolution of the stellar mass function of galaxies from z=4.0 and  the first comprehensive analysis of its uncertainties: evidence for  mass-dependent evolution	[abridged] we present the evolution of the stellar mass function (smf) ofgalaxies from z=4.0 to z=1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deepnir musyc, the fires, and the goods-cdfs surveys, all having very high-qualityoptical to mid-infrared data. this sample, unique in that it combines data fromsurveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way,allowed us to 1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance andempirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; 2)simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to ~0.05times the characteristic stellar mass) of the smf with good statistics; and 3)empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass.we provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random andsystematic uncertainties affecting the derived smfs. we find that the massdensity evolves by a factor of ~17(+7,-10) since z=4.0, mostly driven by achange in the normalization phi*. if only random errors are taken into account,we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolvingmore rapidly than the high-mass end. however, we show that this result is nolonger robust when systematic uncertainties due to the sed-modeling assumptionsare taken into account. taking our results at face value, we find that they arein conflict with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. the models predictsmfs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too fewhigh-mass galaxies. the discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible touncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-massend may be more difficult to explain.
