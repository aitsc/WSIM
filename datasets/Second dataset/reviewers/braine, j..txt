0901.2770	ram pressure stripping of the multiphase ism in the virgo cluster spiral  galaxy ngc 4438	ram pressure stripping of the multiphase ism is studied in the perturbedvirgo cluster spiral galaxy ngc 4438. this galaxy underwent a tidal interaction~100 myr ago and is now strongly affected by ram pressure stripping. deep vlaradio continuum observations at 6 and 20 cm are presented. we detect prominentextraplanar emission to the west of the galactic center, which extends twice asfar as the other tracers of extraplanar material. the spectral index of theextraplanar emission does not steepen with increasing distance from the galaxy.this implies in situ re-acceleration of relativistic electrons. the comparisonwith multiwavelength observations shows that the magnetic field and the warmionized interstellar medium traced by halpha emission are closely linked. thekinematics of the northern extraplanar halpha emission, which is ascribed tostar formation, follow those of the extraplanar co emission. in the western andsouthern extraplanar regions, the halpha measured velocities are greater thanthose of the co lines. we suggest that the ionized gas of this region isexcited by ram pressure. the spatial and velocity offsets are consistent with ascenario where the diffuse ionized gas is more efficiently pushed by rampressure stripping than the neutral gas. we suggest that the recently foundradio-deficient regions compared to 24 mum emission are due to this differencein stripping efficiency.

0903.3403	collisional debris as laboratories to study star formation	in this paper we address the question whether star formation is driven bylocal processes or the large scale environment. to do so, we investigate starformation in collisional debris where the gravitational potential well andvelocity gradients are shallower and compare our results with previous work onstar formation in non-interacting spiral and dwarf galaxies. we have performedmultiwavelength spectroscopic and imaging observations (from thefar-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared) of 6 interacting systems, identifying atotal of 60 star-forming regions in their collision debris.  our analysis indicates that in these regions a) the emission of the dust isat the expected level for their luminosity and metallicity, b) the usualtracers of star formation rate display the typical trend and scatter found inclassical star forming regions, and c) the extinction and metallicity are notthe main parameters governing the scatter in the properties of intergalacticstar forming regions; age effects and variations in the number of stellarpopulations, seem to play an important role. our work suggests that localproperties such as column density and dust content, rather than the large scaleenvironment seem to drive star formation. this means that intergalactic starforming regions can be used as a reliable tool to study star formation.

0707.2345	particularly efficient star formation in m33	the star formation (sf) rate in galaxies is an important parameter at allredshifts and evolutionary stages of galaxies. in order to understand theincreased sf rates in intermediate redshift galaxies one possibility is tostudy star formation in local galaxies with properties frequently found at thisearlier epoch like low metallicity and small size. we present sensitiveobservations of the molecular gas in m 33, a small local group spiral at adistance of 840 kpc which shares many of the characteristics of theintermediate redshift galaxies. the observations were carried out in theco(2--1) line with the hera heterodyne array on the iram 30 m telescope. a11\arcmin$\times$22\arcmin region in the northern part of m 33 was observed,reaching a detection threshold of a few 10$^{3}$ \msol. the correlation in thisfield between the co emission and tracers of sf (8\mum, 24\mum, \ha, fuv) isexcellent and co is detected very far north, showing that molecular gas formsfar out in the disk even in a small spiral with a subsolar metallicity. onemajor molecular cloud was discovered in an interarm region with no hi peak andlittle if any signs of sf -- without a complete survey this cloud would neverhave been found. the radial dependence of the co emission has a scale lengthsimilar to the dust emission, less extended than the \ha or fuv. if, however,the $\ratioo$ ratio varies inversely with metallicity, then the scale length ofthe h$_2$ becomes similar to that of the \ha or fuv. comparing the sf rate tothe h$_2$ mass shows that m 33, like the intermediate redshift galaxies itresembles, has a significantly higher sf efficiency than large local universespirals.

1001.5405	the molecular interstellar medium of the local group dwarf ngc6822	do molecular clouds collapse to form stars at the same rate in allenvironments? in large spiral galaxies, the rate of transformation of h2 intostars (hereafter sfe) varies little. however, the sfe in distant objects (z~1)is much higher than in the large spiral disks that dominate the local universe.some small local group galaxies share at least some of the characteristics ofintermediate-redshift objects, such as size or color. recent work has suggestedthat the star formation efficiency (sfe, defined as the sfrate per unit h2) inlocal dwarf galaxies may be as high as in the distant objects. a fundamentaldifficulty in these studies is the independent measure of the h2 mass inmetal-deficient environments. at 490 kpc, ngc6822 is an excellent choice forthis study; it has been mapped in the co(2-1) line using the multibeam receiverhera on the 30 meter iram telescope, yielding the largest sample of giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) in this galaxy. despite the much lower metallicity, wefind no clear difference in the properties of the gmcs in ngc 6822 and those inthe milky way except lower co luminosities for a given mass. severalindependent methods indicate that the total h2 mass in ngc 6822 is about 5 x10^6 msun in the area we mapped and less than 10^7 msun in the whole galaxy.this corresponds to a nh2/ico ~ 4 x 10^{21} cm^-2 /(kkm/s) over large scales,such as would be observed in distant objects, and half that in individual gmcs.no evidence was found for h2 without co emission. our simulations of theradiative transfer in clouds are entirely compatible with these nh2/ico values.the sfe implied is a factor 5 - 10 higher than what is observed in large localuniverse spirals.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1010.2201	star formation in collision debris: insights from the modeling of their  spectral energy distribution	during galaxy-galaxy interactions, massive gas clouds can be injected intothe intergalactic medium which in turn become gravitationally bound, collapseand form stars, star clusters or even dwarf galaxies. the objects resultingfrom this process are both "pristine", as they are forming their firstgeneration of stars, and chemically evolved because the metallicity inheritedfrom their parent galaxies is high. such characteristics make them particularlyinteresting laboratories to study star formation. after having investigatedtheir star-forming properties, we use photospheric, nebular and dust modelingto analyze here their spectral energy distribution (sed) from thefar-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared regime for a sample of 7 star-formingregions. our analysis confirms that the intergalactic star forming regions instephan's quintet, around arp 105, and ngc 5291, appear devoid of stellarpopulations older than 10^9 years. we also find an excess of light in thenear-infrared regime (from 2 to 4.5 microns) which cannot be attributed tostellar photospheric or nebular contributions. this excess is correlated withthe star formation rate intensity suggesting that it is probably due toemission by very small grains fluctuating in temperature as well as thepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) line at 3.3 micron. comparing theattenuation via the balmer decrement to the mid-infrared emission allows us tocheck the reliability of the attenuation estimate. it suggests the presence ofembedded star forming regions in ngc 5291 and ngc 7252. overall the sed ofstar-forming regions in collision debris (and tidal dwarf galaxies) resemblemore that of dusty star-forming regions in galactic disks than to that oftypical star-forming dwarf galaxies.

1105.5219	star formation in m33 (herm33es)	within the key project "herschel m33 extended survey" (herm33es), we arestudying the physical and chemical processes driving star formation andgalactic evolution in the nearby galaxy m33, combining the study of localconditions affecting individual star formation with properties only becomingapparent on global scales. here, we present recent results obtained by theherm33es team. combining spitzer and herschel data ranging from 3.6um to 500um,along with hi, halpha, and galex uv data, we have studied the dust at highspatial resolutions of 150pc, providing estimators of the total infrared (tir)brightness and of the star formation rate. while the temperature of the warmdust at high brightness is driven by young massive stars, evolved stellarpopulations appear to drive the temperature of the cold dust. plane-parallelmodels of photon dominated regions (pdrs) fail to reproduce fully the [cii],[oi], and co maps obtained in a first spectroscopic study of one 2'x2'subregion of m33, located on the inner, northern spiral arm and encompassingthe hii region bclmp302.

1111.4320	giant molecular clouds in the local group galaxy m33	we present an analysis of the systematic co(2-1) survey at 12" resolutioncovering most of the local group spiral m 33 which, at a distance of 840 kpc,is close enough that individual giant molecular clouds (gmcs) can beidentified. the goal of this work is to study the properties of the gmcs inthis subsolar metallicity galaxy. the cprops (cloud properties) algorithm(rosolowsky &amp; leroy 2006) was used to identify 337 gmcs in m 33, the largestsample to date in an external galaxy. the sample is used to study the gmcluminosity function, or mass spectrum under the assumption of a constantn(h2)/ico ratio. we find that n(l)dl = k*l^(-2.0\pm0.1) for the entire sample.however, when the sample is divided into inner and outer disk samples, theexponent changes from 1.6 \pm 0.2 for the centre 2 kpc to 2.3 \pm 0.2 forgalactocentric distances larger than 2 kpc. based on the emission in the fuv,halpha, 8mu, and 24mu bands, each cloud was classified in terms of its starforming activity - no star formation, embedded, or exposed star formation(visible in fuv and halpha). at least one sixth of the clouds had no (massive)star formation, suggesting that the average time required for star formation tostart is about one sixth of the total time for which the object is identifiableas a gmc. the clouds without star formation have significantly lower columinosities than those with star formation, whether embedded or exposed,presumably related to the lack of heating sources. taking the cloud sample as awhole, the main non-trivial correlation was the decrease in cloud co brightness(or luminosity) with galactocentric radius. the complete cloud catalog,including co and hi spectra and the co contours on the fuv, halpha, 8mu, and24mu images is presented in the appendix.

1111.5236	ram pressure stripping of the multiphase ism and star formation in the  virgo spiral galaxy ngc 4330	it has been shown that the virgo spiral galaxy ngc 4330 shows signs ofongoing ram pressure stripping in multiple wavelengths: at the leading edge ofthe interaction, the halpha and dust extinction curve sharply out of the disk;on the trailing side, a long halpha/uv tail has been found which is locatedupwind of a long hi tail. we complete the multiwavelength study with iram 30mhera co(2-1) and vla 6 cm radio continuum observations of ngc 4330. the dataare interpreted with the help of a dynamical model including ram pressure and,for the first time, star formation. our best-fit model reproduces qualitativelythe observed projected position, radial velocity of the galaxy, the molecularand atomic gas distribution and velocity field, and the uv distribution in theregion where a gas tail is present. however, the observed red uv color on thewindward side is currently not reproduced by the model. based on our model, thegalaxy moves to the north and still approaches the cluster center with theclosest approach occurring in ~100 myr. in contrast to other virgo spiralgalaxies affected by ram pressure stripping, ngc 4330 does not show anasymmetric ridge of polarized radio continuum emission. we suggest that this isdue to the relatively slow compression of the ism and the particular projectionof ngc 4330. the observed offset between the hi and uv tails is well reproducedby our model. since collapsing and starforming gas clouds decouple from the rampressure wind, the uv-emitting young stars have the angular momentum of the gasat the time of their creation. on the other hand, the gas is constantly pushedby ram pressure. the reaction (phase change, star formation) of the multiphaseism (molecular, atomic, ionized) to ram pressure is discussed in the frameworkof our dynamical model.

1201.2558	dust and gas power-spectrum in m33 (herm33es)	power spectra of de-projected images of late-type galaxies in gas and/or dustemission are very useful diagnostics of the dynamics and stability of theirinterstellar medium. previous studies have shown that the power spectra can beapproximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500pc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the twocorresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. we present athorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at severalwavelengths in the nearby galaxy m33. in particular, we use the recentlyobtained images at five wavelengths by pacs and spire onboard herschel. thelarge dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determineclearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations withwavelength. the break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24and 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in athicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined tothe plane. the slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. numericalsimulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,like m33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.varying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain arange of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicelybracket the data. the small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3dbehaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes thestructures, by increasing the gas turbulence. m33 appears to correspond to afiducial model with an sfr of $\sim$ 0.7 mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energycoupled to the gas kinematics.

1202.1763	survival of molecular gas in virgo's hot intracluster medium: co near  m86	we carried out co(1-0) and co(2-1) observations of 21 different regions inthe vicinity of m86, ngc4438, and along the 120 kpc-long, ha-emittingfilamentary trail that connects them, aiming to test whether molecular gas cansurvive to be transferred from a spiral to an elliptical galaxy in virgo's10^7k intracluster medium (icm). we targeted ha-emitting regions that could beassociated with the interface between cold molecular clouds and the hot ionizedicm. the data, obtained with the 30m telescope of the institut deradioastronomie millimetrique, led to the detection of molecular gas close tom86. co gas with a recession velocity that is similar to that of the stars,-265 km/s, and with a corresponding h2 mass of 2*10^7 m_sun, was detected ~10kpc southeast of the nucleus of m86, near the peak of its hi emission. we arguethat it is possible for this molecular gas either to have formed in situ fromhi, or to have been stripped from ngc4438 directly in molecular form. in situformation is nonetheless negligible for the 7*10^6 m_sun of gas detected at12:26:15.9+12:58:49, at ~10 kpc northeast of m86, where no (strong) hi emissionis present. this detection provides evidence for the survival of molecular gasin filaments for timescales of ~100 myr. an amount equivalent to 5*10^7 m_sunof h2 gas that could be lost to the icm or to neighboring galaxies was alsodiscovered in the tidal tail northwest of ngc4438. a scenario of gas beingalternatively brought to m86 from ngc4388 on its south was also examined but itwas considered unlikely due to the non detection of co below or at the histream velocities, 2000-2700 km/s.

1204.0397	the massive protostar w43-mm1 as seen by herschel-hifi water spectra:  high turbulence and accretion luminosity	we present herschel/hifi observations of fourteen water lines in w43-mm1, amassive protostellar object in the luminous star cluster-forming region w43. weanalyze the gas dynamics from the line profiles using herschel-hifiobservations (wish-kp) of fourteen far-ir water lines (h2o, h217o, h218o),cs(11-10), and c18o(9-8) lines, and using our modeling of the continuumspectral energy distribution. as for lower mass protostellar objects, themolecular line profiles are a mix of emission and absorption, and can bedecomposed into 'medium', and 'broad' velocity components. the broad componentis the outflow associated with protostars of all masses. our modeling showsthat the remainder of the water profiles can be well fitted by an infalling andpassively heated envelope, with highly supersonic turbulence varying from 2.2km/s in the inner region to 3.5 km/s in the outer envelope. also, w43-mm1 has ahigh accretion rate, between 4.0 x 10^{-4} and 4.0 x 10^{-2} \msun /yr, derivedfrom the fast (0.4-2.9 km/s) infall observed. we estimate a lower mass limit ofgaseous water of 0.11 \msun and total water luminosity of 1.5 \lsun (in the 14lines presented here). the central hot core is detected with a water abundanceof 1.4 x 10^{-4} while the water abundance for the outer envelope is 8x10^{-8}. the latter value is higher than in other sources, most likely relatedto the high turbulence and the micro-shocks created by its dissipation.examining water lines of various energies, we find that the turbulent velocityincreases with the distance to the center. while not in clear disagreement withthe competitive accretion scenario, this behavior is predicted by the turbulentcore model. moreover, the estimated accretion rate is high enough to overcomethe expected radiation pressure.

1204.0430	the influence of the cluster environment on the star formation  efficiency of 12 virgo spiral galaxies	the influence of the environment on gas surface density and star formationefficiency of cluster spiral galaxies is investigated. we extend previous workon radial profiles by a pixel-to pixel analysis looking for asymmetries due toenvironmental interactions. the star formation rate is derived from galex uvand spitzer total infrared data. as in field galaxies, the star formation ratefor most virgo galaxies is approximately proportional to the molecular gasmass. except for ngc 4438, the cluster environment does not affect the starformation efficiency with respect to the molecular gas. gas truncation is notassociated with major changes in the total gas surface density distribution ofthe inner disk of virgo spiral galaxies. in three galaxies, possible increasesin the molecular fraction and the star formation efficiency with respect to thetotal gas, of factors of 1.5 to 2, are observed on the windward side of thegalactic disk. a significant increase of the star formation efficiency withrespect to the molecular gas content on the windward side of rampressure-stripped galaxies is not observed. the ram-pressure strippedextraplanar gas of 3 highly inclined spiral galaxies shows a depressed starformation efficiency with respect to the total gas, and one of them (ngc 4438)shows a depressed rate even with respect to the molecular gas. theinterpretation is that stripped gas loses the gravitational confinement andassociated pressure of the galactic disk, and the gas flow is diverging, so thegas density decreases and the star formation rate drops. however, the strippedextraplanar gas in one highly inclined galaxy (ngc 4569) shows a normal starformation efficiency with respect to the total gas. we propose this galaxy isdifferent because it is observed long after peak pressure, and its extraplanargas is now in a converging flow as it resettles back into the disk.

1207.1684	tidal interaction vs. ram pressure stripping effects as seen in x-rays.  hot gas in group and cluster galaxies	the hot intracluster/intragroup medium (icm/igm) and a high galaxy densitycan lead to perturbations of the galactic interstellar medium (ism) due to rampressure and/or tidal interaction effects. in radio polarimetry observations,both phenomena may manifest similar features. x-ray data can help to determinethe real origin of the perturbation. we analyse the distribution and physicalproperties of the hot gas in the virgo cluster spiral galaxies ngc 4254 and ngc4569, which indicate that the cluster environment has had a significantinfluence on their properties. by performing both spatial and spectral analysesof x-ray data, we try to distinguish between two major phenomena: tidal and rampressure interactions. we compare our findings with the case of ngc 2276, inwhich a shock was reported, by analysing xmm-newton x-ray data for this galaxy.we use archival xmm-newton observations of ngc 4254, ngc 4569, and ngc 2276.maps of the soft diffuse emission in the energy band 0.2 - 1 kev are obtained.for the three galaxies, especially at the position of magnetic fieldenhancements we perform a spectral analysis to derive gas temperatures and thusto look for shock signatures. a shock is a signature of ram pressure resultingfrom supersonic velocities; weak tidal interactions are not expected toinfluence the temperature of the ionized gas. in ngc 4254, we do not observeany temperature increase. this suggests tidal interactions rather than rampressure stripping. in ngc 4569 the radio polarized ridge shows a highertemperature, which may indicate ram-pressure effects. for ngc 2276, we do notfind clear indications of a shock. the main driver of the observed distortionsis most likely tidal interaction. determining gas temperatures via sensitivex-ray observations seems to be a good method for distinguishing between rampressure and tidal interaction effects acting upon a galaxy.

1207.3243	spectrally resolved cii emission in m~33 ({\tt herm33es}): physical  conditions and kinematics around bclmp 691	this work presents high spectral resolution observations of the \cii\ line at158 \micron, one of the major cooling lines of the interstellar medium, takenwith the hifi heterodyne spectrometer on the herschel satellite. in bclmp 691,an \hii\ region far north (3.3 kpc) in the disk of m 33, the \cii\ and co lineprofiles show similar velocities within $0.5 \kms$, while the \hi\ linevelocities are systematically shifted towards lower rotation velocities by$\sim 5\kms$. observed at the same $12"$ angular resolution, the \cii\ linesare broader than those of co by about 50% but narrower than the \hi\ lines. the\cii\ line to far-infrared continuum ratio suggests a photoelectric heatingefficiency of 1.1%. the data, together with published models indicate a uvfield $g_0 \sim 100$ in units of the solar neighborhood value, a gas density$n_h \sim 1000 \cc$, and a gas temperature $t\sim 200$ k. adopting thesevalues, we estimate the c$^+$ column density to be $n_{c^+} \approx 1.3 \times10^{17} \cmt$. the \cii\ emission comes predominantly from the warm neutralregion between the \hii\ region and the cool molecular cloud behind it. frompublished abundances, the inferred c$^+$ column corresponds to a hydrogencolumn density of $n_h \sim 2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$. the co observations suggestthat $n_h = 2 n_{h_2} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ and 21cm measurements, alsoat $12"$ resolution, yield $n_\hi \approx 1.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ within the\cii\ velocity range. thus, some h$_2$ not detected in co must be present, inagreement with earlier findings based on the spire 250 -- 500 $\mu$m emission.

1209.3665	gas fraction and star formation efficiency at z &lt; 1.0	after new observations of 39 galaxies at z = 0.6-1.0 obtained at the iram 30mtelescope, we present our full co line survey covering the redshift range 0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1. our aim is to determine the driving factors accounting for the steepdecline in the star formation rate during this epoch. we study both the gasfraction, defined as mgas/(mgas+mstar), and the star formation efficiency (sfe)defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass(lfir/m(h2), i.e. a measure for the inverse of the gas depletion time. thesources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), with lfirgreater than 10^12 lo and experiencing starbursts. when we adopt a standardulirg co-to-h2 conversion factor, their molecular gas depletion time is lessthan 100 myr. our full survey has now filled the gap of co observations in the0.2&lt;z&lt;1 range covering almost half of cosmic history. the detection rate in the0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 interval is 38% (15 galaxies out of 39), compared to 60% for the0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 interval. the average co luminosity is l'co = 1.8 10^10 k km/s pc^2,corresponding to an average h2 mass of 1.45 10^10 mo. from observation of 7galaxies in both co(2-1) and co(4-3), a high gas excitation has been derived;together with the dust mass estimation, this supports the choice of our lowulirg conversion factor between co luminosity and h2, for our sample sources.we find that both the gas fraction and the sfe significantly increase withredshift, by factors of 3 +-1 from z=0 to 1, and therefore both quantities playan important role and complement each other in cosmic star formation evolution.

1209.5523	star formation efficiency at intermediate redshift	star formation is evolving very fast in the second half of the universe, andit is yet unclear whether this is due to evolving gas content, or evolving starformation efficiency (sfe). we have carried out a survey of ultra-luminousgalaxies (ulirg) between z=0.2 and 1, to check the gas fraction in this domainof redshift which is still poorly known.  our survey with the iram-30m detected 33 galaxies out of 69, and we derive asignificant evolution of both the gas fraction and sfe of ulirgs over the wholeperiod, and in particular a turning point around z=0.35.  the result is sensitive to the co-to-h2, conversion factor adopted, and bothgas fraction and sfe have comparable evolution, when we adopt the low starburstconversion factor of \alpha =0.8 mo/(k km/s pc^2). adopting a higher \alphawill increase the role of the gas fraction.  using \alpha =0.8, the sfe and the gas fraction for z=0.2-1.0 ulirgs arefound to be significantly higher, by a factor 3, than for local ulirgs, and arecomparable to high redshift ones. we compare this evolution to the expectedcosmic h2 abundance and the cosmic star formation history.

1209.6052	a dynamical model for the taffy galaxies ugc 12914/5	the spectacular head-on collision of the two gas-rich galaxies of the taffysystem, ugc 12914/15, gives us a unique opportunity to study the consequencesof a direct ism-ism collision. to interpret existing multi-wavelengthobservations, we made dynamical simulations of the taffy system including asticky particle component. to compare simulation snapshots to hi and coobservations, we assume that the molecular fraction of the gas depends on thesquare root of the gas volume density. for the comparison of our simulationswith observations of polarized radio continuum emission, we calculated theevolution of the 3d large-scale magnetic field for our simulations. theinduction equations including the time-dependent gas-velocity fields from thedynamical model were solved for this purpose. our simulations reproduce thestellar distribution of the primary galaxy, ugc 12914, the prominent hi and cogas bridge, the offset between the co and hi emission in the bridge, the bridgeisovelocity vectors parallel to the bridge, the hi double-line profiles in thebridge region, the large line-widths (~200 km/s) in the bridge region, the highfield strength of the bridge large-scale regular magnetic field, the projectedmagnetic field vectors parallel to the bridge and the strong total power radiocontinuum emission from the bridge. the stellar distribution of the secondarymodel galaxy is more perturbed than observed. the observed distortion of the hienvelope of the taffy system is not reproduced by our simulations which useinitially symmetric gas disks. the model allows us to define the bridge regionin three dimensions. we estimate the total bridge gas mass (hi, warm and coldh2) to be 5 to 6 10^9 m_sun, with a molecular fraction m_h2/m_hi of about unity(abrigded).

1210.3263	dense gas in m33 (herm33es)	we aim to better understand the emission of molecular tracers of the diffuseand dense gas in giant molecular clouds and the influence that metallicity,optical extinction, density, far-uv field, and star formation rate have onthese tracers. using the iram 30m telescope, we detected hcn, hco+, 12co, and13co in six gmcs along the major axis of m33 at a resolution of ~ 114pc and outto a radial distance of 3.4kpc. optical, far-infrared, and submillimeter datafrom herschel and other observatories complement these observations. tointerpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of modelsof photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for m33-type subsolarmetallicity. the observed hco+/hcn line ratios range between 1.1 and 2.5.similarly high ratios have been observed in the large magellanic cloud. thehcn/co ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of m33. the 12co/13coline ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffusegas and the centers of gmcs of the milky way. stacking of all spectra allowedhnc and c2h to be detected. the resulting hco+/hnc and hcn/hnc ratios of ~ 8and 6, respectively, lie at the high end of ratios observed in a large set of(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. hcn abundances are lower in the subsolarmetallicity pdr models, while hco+ abundances are enhanced. for hcn this effectis more pronounced at low optical extinctions. the observed hco+/hcn and hcn/coline ratios are naturally explained by subsolar pdr models of low opticalextinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -3x10^4 cm^-3, while the fuv field strength only has a small effect on themodeled line ratios. the line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by thesolar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play aminor role in influencing these line ratios.

1210.6470	a detailed view of a molecular cloud in the far outer disk of m33	the amount of h$_2$ present in spiral galaxies remains uncertain,particularly in the dim outer regions and in low-metallicity environments. wepresent high-resolution co(1--0) observations with the plateau de bureinterferometer of the most distant molecular cloud in the local group galaxy m33. the cloud is a single entity rather than a set of smaller clouds within thebroad beam of the original single-dish observations. the interferometer andsingle-dish fluxes are very similar and the line widths are indistinguishable,despite the difference in beamsize. at a spatial resolution of 10 pc, beyondthe optical radius of the m 33, the co brightness temperature reaches 2.4kelvins. a virial mass estimate for the cloud yields a mass of $4.3 \times10^4$ \msun and a ratio $\ratio \simeq 3.5 \times 10^{20} \xunit$. while novelocity gradient is seen where the emission is strong, the velocity isredshifted to the extreme sw and blue-shifted to the far ne. if the orientationof the cloud is along the plane of the disk (i.e. not perpendicular), thenthese velocities correspond to slow infall or accretion. the rather modestinfall rate would be about $2 \times 10^{-4}$\moyr.

1301.4658	herschel-hifi observations of high-j co and isotopologues in  star-forming regions: from low- to high-mass	context; our understanding of the star formation process has traditionallybeen confined to certain mass or luminosity boundaries because most studiesfocus only on low-, intermediate- or high-mass star-forming regions. as part ofthe "water in star-forming regions with herschel" (wish) key program, water andother important molecules, such as co and oh, have been observed in 51 embeddedyoung stellar objects (ysos). the studied sample covers a range of luminositiesfrom &lt;1 to &gt;10^5 l_sol. aims; we analyse the co line emission towards a largesample of protostars in terms of both line intensities and profiles. methods;herschel-hifi spectra of the 12co 10-9, 13co 10-9 and c18o 5-4, 9-8 and 10-9lines are analysed for a sample of 51 ysos. in addition, jcmt spectra of 12co3-2 and c18o 3-2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. results; allobserved co and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation betweenthe logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders ofmagnitude on both axes. this suggests that the high-j co lines primarily tracethe amount of dense gas associated with ysos. this relation can be extended tolarger (extragalactic) scales. the majority of the detected 12co line profilescan be decomposed into a broad and a narrow gaussian component, while the c18ospectra are mainly fitted with a single gaussian. a broadening of the lineprofile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, whichis due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). the widths of thebroad 12co 3-2 and 10-9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrowc18o 9-8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelopemotions are related independent of the mass of the protostar. these resultsindicate that physical processes in protostellar envelopes have similarcharacteristics across the studied luminosity range.

1301.5917	spectral energy distributions of hii regions in m33 (herm33es)	within the framework of the herschel m 33 extended survey herm33es we studythe spectral energy distribution (sed) of a set of hii regions in m 33 as afunction of the morphology. we present a catalogue of 119 hii regionsmorphologically classified: 9 filled, 47 mixed, 36 shell, and 27 clear shellhii regions. for each object we extract the photometry at twelve availablewavelength bands (from fuv-1516a to ir-250mi) and obtain the sed. we alsoobtain emission line profiles across the regions to study the location of thestellar, ionised gas, and dust components. we find trends for the seds relatedto the morphology, showing that the star and gas-dust configuration affects theratios of the emission in different bands. the mixed and filled regions showhigher emission at 24mi than the shells and clear shells, which could be due tothe proximity of the dust to the stellar clusters in the case of mixed andfilled regions. the fir peak for shells and clear shells seems to be locatedtowards longer wavelengths, indicating that the dust is colder for this type ofobjects.the logarithmic 100/70mi ratio for filled and mixed regions remainsconstant over one order of magnitude in halpha and fuv surface brightness,while the shells and clear shells exhibit a wider range of values of almost twoorders of magnitude. we derive dust masses and temperatures fitting theindividual seds with dust models proposed in the literature. the derived dustmass range is between 10^2-10^4 msun and the cold dust temperature spanst(cold)~12-27 k. the spherical geometrical model proposed for the halpha clearshells is confirmed by the emission profile obtained from the observations andis used to infer the electron density within the envelope: the typical electrondensity is 0.7+-0.3 cm^-3, while filled regions can reach values two to fivetimes higher.

1304.0199	gas and dust cooling along the major axis of m33 (herm33es): iso/lws cii  observations	we aim to better understand the heating of the gas by observing the prominentgas cooling line [cii] at 158um in the low-metallicity environment of the localgroup spiral galaxy m33 at scales of 280pc. in particular, we aim at describingthe variation of the photoelectric heating efficiency with galacticenvironment. in this unbiased study, we used iso/lws [cii] observations alongthe major axis of m33, in combination with herschel pacs and spire continuummaps, iram 30m co 2-1 and vla hi data to study the variation of velocityintegrated intensities. the ratio of [cii] emission over the far-infraredcontinuum is used as a proxy for the heating efficiency, and models ofphoton-dominated regions are used to study the local physical densities, fuvradiation fields, and average column densities of the molecular clouds. theheating efficiency stays constant at 0.8% in the inner 4.5kpc radius of thegalaxy where it starts to increase to reach values of ~3% in the outskirts atabout 6kpc radial distance. the rise of efficiency is explained in theframework of pdr models by lowered volume densities and fuv fields, for opticalextinctions of only a few magnitudes at constant metallicity. in view of thesignificant fraction of hi emission stemming from pdrs, and for typicalpressures found in the galactic cold neutral medium (cnm) traced by hiemission, the cnm contributes ~15% to the observed [cii] emission in the inner2kpc radius of m33. the cnm contribution remains largely undetermined in thesouth, while positions between 2 and 7.3kpc radial distance in the north of m33show a contribution of ~40%+-20%.

1310.4155	variation in the dust emissivity index across m33 with herschel and  spitzer (herm33es)	we study the wavelength dependence of the dust emission as a function ofposition and environment across the disk of m33 at a linear resolution of 160pc using spitzer and herschel photometric data. expressing the emissivity ofthe dust as a power law, the power-law exponent (beta) is estimated from twoindependent approaches designed to properly treat the degeneracy between betaand the dust temperature. both beta and the dust temperature are higher in theinner disk than in the outer disk, contrary to reported beta-tanti-correlations found in other sources. in the cold + warm dust model, thewarm component and the ionized gas (halpha) have a very similar distributionacross the galaxy, demonstrating that the model separates the components in anappropriate fashion. the flocculent spiral arms and the dust lanes are evidentin the map of the cold component. both cold and warm dust column densities arehigh in star forming regions and reach their maxima toward the giant starforming complexes ngc604 and ngc595. beta declines from close to 2 in thecenter to about 1.3 in the outer disk. beta is positively correlated with starformation and with molecular gas column, as traced by halpha and co emission.the lower dust emissivity index in the outer parts of m33 is likely related tothe reduced metallicity (different grain composition) and possibly differentsize distribution. it is not due to the decrease in stellar radiation field ortemperature in a simple way because the fir-bright regions in the outer diskalso have a low beta. like most spirals, m33 has a (decreasing) radial gradientin star formation and molecular-to-atomic gas ratio such that the regionsbright in halpha or co tend to trace the inner disk, making it difficult todistinguish between their effects on the dust.

1311.6644	far-infrared molecular lines from low- to high-mass star forming regions  observed with herschel	(abridged) we study the response of the gas to energetic processes associatedwith high-mass star formation and compare it with studies on low- andintermediate-mass young stellar objects (ysos) using the same methods. thefar-ir line emission and absorption of co, h$_2$o, oh, and [oi] reveals theexcitation and the relative contribution of different species to the gascooling budget. herschel-pacs spectra covering 55-190 um are analyzed for tenhigh-mass star forming regions of various luminosities and evolutionary stagesat spatial scales of ~10^4 au. radiative transfer models are used to determinethe contribution of the envelope to the far-ir co emission.  the close environments of high-mass ysos show strong far-ir emission frommolecules, atoms, and ions. water is detected in all 10 objects even up to highexcitation lines. co lines from j=14-13 up to typically 29-28 show a singletemperature component, trot~300 k. typical h$_2$o temperatures are trot~250 k,while oh has trot~80 k. far-ir line cooling is dominated by co (~75 %) and to asmaller extent by oi (~20 %), which increases for the most evolved sources.h$_2$o is less important as a coolant for high-mass sources because many linesare in absorption. emission from the envelope is responsible for ~45-85 % ofthe total co luminosity in high-mass sources compared with only ~10 % forlow-mass ysos. the highest-j lines originate most likely from shocks, based onthe strong correlation of co and h$_2$o with physical parameters of the sourcesfrom low- to high-masses. excitation of warm co is very similar for all massregimes, whereas h$_2$o temperatures are ~100 k higher for high-mass sourcesthan the low-mass ysos. molecular cooling is ~4 times more important thancooling by [oi]. the total far-ir line luminosity is about 10$^{-3}$ and10$^{-5}$ times lower than the dust luminosity for the low- and high-mass ysos.

1402.4668	the heating of mid-infrared dust in the nearby galaxy m33: a testbed for  tracing galaxy evolution	because the 8 {\mu}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission has beenfound to correlate with other well-known star formation tracers, it has widelybeen used as a star formation rate (sfr) tracer. there are, however, studiesthat challenge the accuracy and reliability of the 8 {\mu}m emission as a sfrtracer. our study, part of the herschel m33 extended survey (herm33es) opentime key program, aims at addressing this issue by analyzing the infraredemission from the nearby spiral galaxy m33 at the high spatial scale of 75 pc.combining data from the herschel space observatory and the spitzer spacetelescope we find that the 8 {\mu}m emission is better correlated with the 250{\mu}m emission, which traces cold interstellar gas, than with the 24 {\mu}memission. the l(8)/l(24) ratio is highly depressed in 24 {\mu}m luminousregions, which correlate with known hii regions. we also compare our resultswith the dust emission models by draine &amp; li (2007). we confirm that thedepression of 8 {\mu}m pah emission near star-forming regions is higher thanwhat is predicted by models; this is possibly an effect of increased stellarradiation from young stars destroying the dust grains responsible for the 8{\mu}m emission as already suggested by other authors. we find that themajority of the 8 {\mu}m emission is fully consistent with heating by thediffuse interstellar medium, similar to what recently determined for the dustemission in m31 by draine at al.

1509.05404	gas dynamics in tidal dwarf galaxies: disc formation at z=0	tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs) are recycled objects that form within thecollisional debris of interacting/merging galaxies. they are expected to bedevoid of non-baryonic dark matter, since they can form only from dissipativematerial ejected from the discs of the progenitor galaxies. we investigate thegas dynamics in a sample of six bona-fide tdgs around three interacting andpost-interacting systems: ngc 4694, ngc 5291, and ngc 7252 ("atoms for peace").for ngc 4694 and ngc 5291 we analyse existing hi data from the very large array(vla), while for ngc 7252 we present new hi observations from the jansky vlatogether with long-slit and integral-field optical spectroscopy. for all sixtdgs, the hi emission can be described by rotating disc models. these hi discs,however, have undergone less than a full rotation since the time of theinteraction/merger event, raising the question of whether they are in dynamicalequilibrium. assuming that these discs are in equilibrium, the inferreddynamical masses are consistent with the observed baryonic masses, implyingthat tdgs are devoid of dark matter. this puts constraints on putative "darkdiscs" (either baryonic or non-baryonic) in the progenitor galaxies. moreover,tdgs seem to systematically deviate from the baryonic tully-fisher relation.these results provide a challenging test for alternative theories like mond.

1511.00357	linking low- to high-mass ysos with herschel-hifi observations of water	water probes the dynamics in young stellar objects (ysos) effectively,especially shocks in molecular outflows. it is a key molecule for exploringwhether the physical properties of low-mass protostars can be extrapolated tomassive ysos. as part of the wish key programme, we investigate the dynamicsand the excitation conditions of shocks along the outflow cavity wall asfunction of source luminosity. velocity-resolved herschel-hifi spectra of theh2o 988, 752, 1097 ghz and 12co j=10-9, 16-15 lines were analysed for 52 ysoswith bolometric luminosities (l_bol) ranging from &lt;1 to &gt;10^5 l_sun. theprofiles of the h2o lines are similar, indicating that they probe the same gas.we see two main gaussian emission components in all ysos: a broad componentassociated with non-dissociative shocks in the outflow cavity wall (cavityshocks) and a narrow component associated with quiescent envelope material.more than 60% of the total integrated intensity of the h2o lines (l_h2o) comesfrom the cavity shock component. the h2o line widths are similar for all ysos,whereas those of 12co 10-9 increase slightly with l_bol. the excitationanalysis of the cavity shock component, performed with the non-lte radiativetransfer code radex, shows stronger 752 ghz emission for high-mass ysos, likelydue to pumping by an infrared radiation field. as previously found for co, astrong correlation with slope unity is measured between log(l_h2o) andlog(l_bol), which can be extrapolated to extragalactic sources. we concludethat the broad component of h2o and high-j co lines originate in shocks in theoutflow cavity walls for all ysos, whereas lower-j co transitions mostly traceentrained outflow gas. the higher uv field and turbulent motions in high-massobjects compared to their low-mass counterparts may explain the slightlydifferent kinematical properties of 12co 10-9 and h2o lines from low- tohigh-mass ysos.

astro-ph;0703002	polychromatic view of intergalactic star formation in ngc 5291	star formation (sf) takes place in unusual places such as way out in theintergalactic medium out of material expelled from parent galaxies. we wish toanswer whether sf proceeds in this specific environment in a similar way thanin galactic disks. we have carried out a multiwavelength analysis of theinteracting system ngc 5291, which is remarkable for its extended hi ringhosting numerous intergalactic hii regions. we combined new ultraviolet (galex)observations with archival halpha, 8 mu m (spitzer space telescope) and hi (vlab-array) images of the system. we have found that the morphology of the starforming regions, as traced by the ultraviolet, halpha, and 8 mu m emission issimilar. there is a clear excess of ultraviolet emission compared to individualhii regions in spirals, i.e. the [8.0]/[nuv] and [halpha]/[nuv] sfr ratios areon average low although there are some large variations from one region toanother, which cannot be explained by variations of the metallicity or the dustextinction along the hi structure. comparing the observed sfr with a model ofthe evolution of [halpha]/[nuv] with time favours young, quasi-instantaneousthough already fading starbursts. the total star formation rate measured in theintergalactic medium (which accounts for 80% of the total) surrounding ngc 5291is up to 1.3 msun/yr, a value typical for spirals, assuming the standard sfrcalibrations are valid. the sfr drops by a factor of 2 to 4 in case the starformation is indeed quasi-instantaneous.

0809.5178	ram-pressure stripped molecular gas in the virgo spiral galaxy ngc 4522	iram 30m 12co(1-0) and 12co(2-1) hera observations are presented for theram-pressure stripped virgo spiral galaxy ngc 4522. the co emission is detectedin the galactic disk and the extraplanar gas. the extraplanar co emissionfollows the morphology of the atomic gas closely but is less extended. the comaxima do not appear to correspond to regions where there is peak massive starformation as probed by halpha emission. the presence of molecular gas is anecessary but not sufficient condition for star formation. compared to the diskgas, the molecular fraction of the extraplanar gas is 30% lower and the starformation efficiency of the extraplanar gas is about 3 times lower. thecomparison with an existing dynamical model extended by a recipe fordistinguishing between atomic and molecular gas shows that a significant partof the gas is stripped in the form of overdense arm-like structures. it isargued that the molecular fraction depends on the square root of the totallarge-scale density. based on the combination of the co/halpha and ananalytical model, the total gas density is estimated to be about 4 times lowerthan that of the galactic disk. molecules and stars form within this dense gasaccording to the same laws as in the galactic disk, i.e. they mainly depend onthe total large-scale gas density. star formation proceeds where the locallarge-scale gas density is highest. given the complex 3d morphology this doesnot correspond to the peaks in the surface density. in the absence of aconfining gravitational potential, the stripped gas arms will most probablydisperse; i.e. the density of the gas will decrease and star formation willcease.
