0907.2254	emission-line galaxies from the hst pears grism survey i: the south  fields	we present results of a search for emission-line galaxies in the southernfields of the hubble space telescope pears (probing evolution and reionizationspectroscopically) grism survey. the pears south fields consist of five acspointings (including the hubble ultra deep field) with the g800l grism for atotal of 120 orbits, revealing thousands of faint object spectra in thegoods-south region of the sky. emission-line galaxies (elgs) are one subset ofobjects that are prevalent among the grism spectra. using a 2-dimensionaldetection and extraction procedure, we find 320 emission lines orginating from226 galaxy "knots'' within 192 individual galaxies. line identification resultsin 118 new grism-spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in the goods-south field.we measure emission line fluxes using standard gaussian fitting techniques. atthe resolution of the grism data, the h-beta and [oiii] doublet are blended.however, by fitting two gaussian components to the h-beta and [oiii] features,we find that many of the pears elgs have high [oiii]/h-beta ratios compared toother galaxy samples of comparable luminosities. the star-formation rates(sfrs) of the elgs are presented, as well as a sample of distinct giantstar-forming regions at z~0.1-0.5 across individual galaxies. we find that theradial distances of these hii regions in general reside near the galaxies'optical continuum half-light radii, similar to those of giant hii regions inlocal galaxies.

0708.1138	progressive star formation in the young smc cluster ngc 602	ngc 602 is a young stellar cluster located in a peripheral region of thesmall magellanic cloud known as the wing. far from the main body of the galaxyand abutting the magellanic bridge, the smc's wing is characterized by low gasand stellar content. with deep optical imaging from the advanced camera forsurveys (acs) aboard the hubble space telescope (hst), we have discovered anextensive pre-main sequence (pms) population, with stellar masses in the range0.6-3 solar masses. these low mass pms stars formed coevally with the centralcluster about 4 myr ago. spitzer space telescope (spitzer) images of the sameregion from the infrared array camera (irac) also reveal a population of youngstellar objects (ysos), some of which are still embedded in nebular materialand most of which likely formed even more recently than the young starsdetected with hst/acs imaging. we infer that star formation started in thisregion about 4 myr ago with the formation of the central cluster and graduallypropagated towards the outskirts where star formation is presently ongoing.

1007.4917	ppak wide-field integral field spectroscopy of ngc 628: i. the largest  spectroscopic mosaic on a single galaxy	we present a wide-field ifs survey on the nearby face-on sbc galaxy ngc 628,comprising 11094 individual spectra, covering a nearly circular field-of-viewof ~6 arcmin in diameter, with a sampling of ~2.7 arcsec per spectrum in theoptical wavelength range (3700--7000 aa). this galaxy is part of the ppak ifsnearby galaxies survey, (pings, rosales-ortega et al. 2009). to our knowledge,this is the widest spectroscopic survey ever made in a single nearby galaxy. adetailed flux calibration was applied, granting a spectrophotometric accuracyof $\sim$\,0.2 mag.  the age of the stellar populations shows a negative gradient from the inner(older) to the outer (younger) regions. we found an inversion of this gradientin the central ~1 kpc region, where a somewhat younger stellar population ispresent within a ring at this radius. this structure is associated with acircumnuclear star-forming region at ~ 500 pc, also found in similar spiralgalaxies. from the study of the integrated and spatially resolved ionized gaswe found a moderate sfr of ~ 2.4 msun yr$^{-1}$. the oxygen abundance shows a aclear gradient of higher metallicity values from the inner part to the outerpart of the galaxy, with a mean value of 12~+~log(o/h) ~ 8.7. at some specificregions of the galaxy, the spatially resolved distribution of the physicalproperties show some level of structure, suggesting real point-to-pointvariations within an individual \hh region. our results are consistent with aninside-out growth scheme, with stronger star formation at the outer regions,and with evolved stellar populations in the inner ones.

1009.1145	black hole mass estimates based on civ are consistent with those based  on the balmer lines	using a sample of high-redshift lensed quasars from the castles project withobserved-frame ultraviolet or optical and near-infrared spectra, we havesearched for possible biases between supermassive black hole (bh) massestimates based on the civ, halpha and hbeta broad emission lines. our sampleis based upon that of greene, peng &amp; ludwig, expanded with new near-irspectroscopic observations, consistently analyzed high s/n optical spectra, andconsistent continuum luminosity estimates at 5100a. we find that bh massestimates based on the fwhm of civ show a systematic offset with respect tothose obtained from the line dispersion, sigma_l, of the same emission line,but not with those obtained from the fwhm of halpha and hbeta. the magnitude ofthe offset depends on the treatment of the heii and feii emission blended withciv, but there is little scatter for any fixed measurement prescription. whilewe otherwise find no systematic offsets between civ and balmer line massestimates, we do find that the residuals between them are strongly correlatedwith the ratio of the uv and optical continuum luminosities. removing thisdependency reduces the scatter between the uv- and optical-based bh massestimates by a factor of approximately 2, from roughly 0.35 to 0.18 dex. thedispersion is smallest when comparing the civ sigma_l mass estimate, afterremoving the offset from the fwhm estimates, and either balmer line massestimate. the correlation with the continuum slope is likely due to acombination of reddening, host contamination and object-dependent sed shapes.when we add additional heterogeneous measurements from the literature, theresults are unchanged.

1012.3406	a panchromatic view of ngc 602: time-resolved star formation with the  hubble and spitzer space telescopes	we present the photometric catalogs for the star-forming cluster ngc 602 inthe wing of the small magellanic cloud covering a range of wavelengths fromoptical hst/acs (f555w, f814w) and smarts/andicam (v, i) to infrared(spitzer/irac 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 micron and mips 24 micron). combining thiswith irsf (infrared survey facility) near-infrared photometry (j, h, ks), wecompare the young main sequence (ms) and pre-main sequence (pms) populationsprominent in the optical with the current young stellar object (yso)populations revealed by the infrared (ir). we analyze the ms and pms populationwith isochrones in color-magnitude diagrams to derive ages and masses. theoptical data reveal ~565 pms candidates, low mass stage iii ysos. wecharacterize ~40 ysos by fitting their spectral energy distributions (seds) toa grid of models (robitaille et al. 2007) to derive luminosities, masses andevolutionary phase (stage i-iii). the higher resolution hst images reveal that~70% of the yso candidates are either multiples or protoclusters. for ysos andpms sources found in common, we find a consistency in the masses derived. weuse the yso mass function to derive a present-day star-formation rate of~0.2-1.0 msun/yr/kpc^2, similar to the rate derived from the optical starformation history suggesting a constant star formation rate for this region. wedemonstrate a progression of star formation from the optical star clustercenter to the edge of the star forming dust cloud. we derive lifetimes of a few10^5 years for the yso stages i and ii.

1101.3221	infrared narrow-band tomography of the local starburst ngc 1569 with  lbt/lucifer	we used the near-ir imager/spectrograph lucifer mounted on the largebinocular telescope (lbt) to image, with sub-arcsec seeing, the local dwarfstarburst ngc 1569 in the jhk bands and hei 1.08 micron, [feii] 1.64 micron andbrgamma narrow-band filters. we obtained high-quality spatial maps of hei,[feii] and brgamma emission across the galaxy, and used them together withhst/acs images of ngc 1569 in the halpha filter to derive the two-dimensionalspatial map of the dust extinction and surface star formation rate density. weshow that dust extinction is rather patchy and, on average, higher in thenorth-west (nw) portion of the galaxy [e_g(b-v) = 0.71 mag] than in thesouth-east [e_g(b-v) = 0.57 mag]. similarly, the surface density of starformation rate peaks in the nw region of ngc 1569, reaching a value of about 4x 10^-6 m_sun yr^-1 pc^-2. the total star formation rate as estimated from theintegrated, dereddened halpha luminosity is about 0.4 m_sun yr^-1, and thetotal supernova rate from the integrated, dereddened [feii] luminosity is about0.005 yr^-1 (assuming a distance of 3.36 mpc). the azimuthally averaged[feii]/brgamma flux ratio is larger at the edges of the central, gas-deficientcavities (encompassing the super star clusters a and b) and in the galaxyoutskirts. if we interpret this line ratio as the ratio between the averagepast star formation (as traced by supernovae) and on-going activity(represented by ob stars able to ionize the interstellar medium), it would thenindicate that star formation has been quenched within the central cavities andlately triggered in a ring around them. the number of ionizing hydrogen andhelium photons as computed from the integrated, dereddened halpha and heiluminosities suggests that the latest burst of star formation occurred about 4myr ago and produced new stars with a total mass of ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun.[abridged]

0710.0558	the stellar mass distribution in the giant star forming region ngc 346	deep f555w and f814w hubble space telescope acs images are the basis for astudy of the present day mass function (pdmf) of ngc346, the largest activestar forming region in the small magellanic cloud (smc). we find a pdmf slopeof gamma=-1.43+/-0.18 in the mass range 0.8-60 mo, in excellent agreement withthe salpeter initial mass function (imf) in the solar neighborhood. caveats onthe conversion of the pdmf to the imf are discussed. the pdmf slope changes, asa function of the radial distance from the center of the ngc 346 star cluster,indicating a segregation of the most massive stars. this segregation is likelyprimordial considering the young age (~3 myr) of ngc346, and its clumpystructure which suggests that the cluster has likely not had sufficient time torelax. comparing our results for ngc346 with those derived for other starclusters in the smc and the milky way (mw), we conclude that, while the starformation process might depend on the local cloud conditions, the imf does notseem to be affected by general environmental effects such as galaxy type,metallicity, and dust content.

1208.0587	spider vii - revealing the stellar population content of massive  early-type galaxies out to 8re	radial trends of stellar populations in galaxies provide a valuable tool tounderstand the mechanisms of galaxy growth. in this paper, we present the firstcomprehensive analysis of optical-optical and optical-nir colours, as afunction of galaxy mass, out to the halo region (8re) of early-type galaxies(etgs). we select a sample of 674 massive etgs (m*&gt;3x10^10msun) from thesdss-based spider survey. by comparing with a large range of populationsynthesis models, we derive robust constraints on the radial trends in age andmetallicity. metallicity is unambiguously found to decrease outwards, with ameasurable steepening of the slope in the outer regions (re&lt;r&lt;8re). thegradients in stellar age are found to be more sensitive to the models used, butin general, the outer regions of etgs feature older populations compared to thecores. this trend is strongest for the most massive galaxies in our sample(m*&gt;10^11msun). furthermore, when segregating with respect to large scaleenvironment, the age gradient is more significant in etgs residing in higherdensity regions. these results shed light on the processes leading from theformation of the central core to the growth of the stellar envelope of massivegalaxies. the fact that the populations in the outer regions are older and moremetal-poor than in the core suggests a process whereby the envelope of massivegalaxies is made up of accreted small satellites (i.e. minor mergers) whosestars were born during the first stages of galaxy formation.

1306.6333	chronos: a nir spectroscopic galaxy survey. from the formation of  galaxies to the peak of activity	chronos is our response to esa's call for white papers to define the sciencefor the future l2, l3 missions. chronos targets the formation and evolution ofgalaxies, by collecting the deepest nir spectroscopic data, from the formationof the first galaxies at z~10 to the peak of formation activity at z~1-3. thestrong emission from the atmospheric background makes this type of surveyimpossible from a ground-based observatory. the spectra of galaxies representthe equivalent of a dna fingerprint, containing information about the pasthistory of star formation and chemical enrichment. the proposed survey willallow us to dissect the formation process of galaxies including the timescalesof quenching triggered by star formation or agn activity, the effect ofenvironment, the role of infall/outflow processes, or the connection betweenthe galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes. to provide these data,the mission requires a 2.5m space telescope optimised for a campaign of verydeep nir spectroscopy. a combination of a high multiplex and very longintegration times will result in the deepest, largest, high-qualityspectroscopic dataset of galaxies from z=1 to 12, spanning the history of theuniverse, from 400 million to 6 billion years after the big bang, i.e. coveringthe most active half of cosmic history.

1308.4271	the nature of liner galaxies: ubiquitous hot old stars and rare  accreting black holes	galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-calledlow-ionisation nuclear emission line region (liner). for 30 years this wasattributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (agn) of lowluminosity, making liner galaxies the largest agn-sub-population, dominating innumbers over higher luminosity seyfert galaxies and quasars. this, however,poses a serious problem. while the inferred energy balance is plausible, manyliners clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an agn. usingintegral field spectroscopic data from the califa survey, we aim at comparingthe observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected fromillumination by an agn. essential for this analysis is a proper extraction ofemission-lines, especially weak lines such as the balmer hb line which issuperposed on an absorption trough. to accomplish this, we use the gandalf codewhich simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.we show for 48 galaxies with liner-like emission, that the radial emission-linesurface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a centralpoint-source and hence cannot be due to an agn alone. the most probableexplanation for the excess liner-like emission is ionisation by evolved starsduring the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-agb. this leadsus to an entirely new interpretation. post-agb stars are ubiquitous and theirionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gaspresent and stars older than ~1 gyr, unless a stronger radiation field fromyoung hot stars or an agn outshines them. this means that galaxies withliner-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but ratherby the absence of a property. it also explains why liner emission is observedmostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.

1407.2939	califa: a diameter-selected sample for an integral field spectroscopy  galaxy survey	we describe and discuss the selection procedure and statistical properties ofthe galaxy sample used by the calar alto legacy integral field area survey(califa), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies using integral fieldspectroscopy. the califa "mother sample" was selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) dr7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with anr-band isophotal major axis between 45" and 79.2" and with a redshift 0.005 &lt; z&lt; 0.03. the mother sample contains 939 objects, 600 of which will be observedin the course of the califa survey. the selection of targets for observationsis based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of themother sample. by comparison with a large set of sdss galaxies, we find thatthe califa sample is representative of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19&gt; mr &gt; -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between 10^9.7 and 10^11.4msun. inparticular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead to anysignificant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or smallgalaxies. only below luminosities of mr = -19 (or stellar masses &lt; 10^9.7msun)is there a prevalence of galaxies with larger isophotal sizes, especially ofnearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form &lt; 10% of the fullsample. we estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities andsizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimatesfrom the full sdss when accounting for large-scale structure. we also present anumber of value-added quantities determined for the galaxies in the califasample. we explore different ways of characterizing the environments of califagalaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from thefield to genuine clusters. we finally consider the expected incidence of activegalactic nuclei among califa galaxies.

1408.6816	spider x - environmental effects in central and satellite early-type  galaxies through the stellar fossil record	a detailed analysis of how environment affects the star formation history ofearly-type galaxies (etgs) is undertaken via high signal to noise ratio stackedspectra obtained from a sample of 20,977 etgs (morphologically selected) fromthe sdss-based spider survey. two major parameters are considered for thestudy: the central velocity dispersion (sigma), which relates to local driversof star formation, and the mass of the host halo, which relates toenvironment-related effects. in addition, we separate the sample betweencentrals (the most massive galaxy in a halo) and satellites. we derive trendsof age, metallicity, and [alpha/fe] enhancement, with sigma. we confirm thatthe major driver of stellar population properties in etgs is velocitydispersion, with a second-order effect associated to the central/satellitenature of the galaxy. no environmental dependence is detected for satelliteetgs, except at low sigma - where satellites in groups or in the outskirts ofclusters tend to be younger than those in the central regions of clusters. incontrast, the trends for centrals show a significant dependence on halo mass.central etgs in groups (i.e. with a halo mass &gt;10^12.5 m_sun) have youngerages, lower [alpha/fe], and higher internal reddening, than "isolated" systems(i.e. centrals residing in low-mass, &lt;10^12.5 m_sun, halos). our findings implythat central etgs in groups formed their stellar component over longer timescales than "isolated" centrals, mainly because of gas-rich interactions withtheir companion galaxies.

1409.8293	imprints of galaxy evolution on h ii regions memory of the past  uncovered by the califa survey	h ii regions in galaxies are the sites of star formation and thus particularplaces to understand the build-up of stellar mass in the universe. the lineratios of this ionized gas are frequently used to characterize the ionizationconditions. we use the hii regions catalogue from the califa survey (~5000 h iiregions), to explore their distribution across the classical [oiii]/hbeta vs.[nii]/halpha diagnostic diagram, and how it depends on the oxygen abundance,ionization parameter, electron density, and dust attenuation. we compared theline ratios with predictions from photoionization models. finally, we explorethe dependences on the properties of the host galaxies, the location withinthose galaxies and the properties of the underlying stellar population. wefound that the location within the bpt diagrams is not totally predicted byphotoionization models. indeed, it depends on the properties of the hostgalaxies, their galactocentric distances and the properties of the underlyingstellar population. these results indicate that although h ii regions are shortlived events, they are affected by the total underlying stellar population. onemay say that h ii regions keep a memory of the stellar evolution and chemicalenrichment that have left an imprint on the both the ionizing stellarpopulation and the ionized gas

0805.0791	stellar populations of late-type bulges at z=1 in the hudf	we combine the exceptional depth of the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) imagesand the deep grism acs program for extragalactic science (grapes) grismspectroscopy to explore the stellar populations of 34 bulges belonging tolate-type galaxies at z=0.8-1.3. the sample is selected based on the presenceof a noticeable 4000a break in their grapes spectra, and by visual inspectionof the hudf images. the hudf images are used to measure bulge color and sersicindex. the narrow extraction of the grapes data around the galaxy centerenables us to study the spectrum of the bulges in these late-type galaxies,minimizing the contamination from the disk of the galaxy. we use the lowresolution (r~50) spectral energy distribution (sed) around the 4000a break toestimate redshifts and stellar ages. the seds are compared with models ofgalactic chemical evolution to determine the stellar mass, and to characterizethe age distribution. we find that, (1) the average age of late-type bulges inour sample is ~1.3 gyr with stellar masses in the range log(m)=6.5-10 solar.(2) late-type bulges are younger than early-type galaxies at similar redshiftsand lack a trend of age with respect to redshift, suggesting a more extendedperiod of star formation. (3) bulges and inner disks in these late-typegalaxies show similar stellar populations, and (4) late-type bulges are betterfitted by exponential surface brightness profiles. the overall picture emergingfrom the grapes data is that, in late-type galaxies at z=1, bulges form throughsecular evolution and disks via an inside-out process.

1505.05545	chemical abundances and properties of the ionized gas in ngc 1705	we obtained [o iii] narrow-band imaging and multi-slit mxu spectroscopy ofthe blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy ngc 1705 with fors2@vlt to derive chemicalabundances of pne and h ii regions and, more in general, to characterize theproperties of the ionized gas. the auroral [o iii]\lambda4363 line was detectedin all but one of the eleven analyzed regions, allowing for a direct estimateof their electron temperature. the only object for which the [o iii]\lambda4363line was not detected is a possible low-ionization pn, the only one detected inour data. for all the other regions, we derived the abundances of nitrogen,oxygen, neon, sulfur and argon out to ~ 1 kpc from the galaxy center. we detectfor the first time in ngc 1705 a negative radial gradient in the oxygenmetallicity of -0.24 \pm 0.08 dex kpc^{-1}. the element abundances are allconsistent with values reported in the literature for other samples of dwarfirregular and blue compact dwarf galaxies. however, the average (central)oxygen abundance, 12 + log(o/h)=7.96 \pm 0.04, is ~0.26 dex lower than previousliterature estimates for ngc 1705 based on the [o iii]\lambda4363 line. fromclassical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, we exclude a major contributionfrom shock excitation. on the other hand, the radial behavior of the emissionline ratios is consistent with the progressive dilution of radiation withincreasing distance from the center of ngc 1705. this suggests that thestrongest starburst located within the central $\sim$150 pc is responsible forthe ionization of the gas out to at least $\sim$1 kpc. the gradual dilution ofthe radiation with increasing distance from the center reflects the gradual andcontinuous transition from the highly ionized h ii regions in the proximity ofthe major starburst into the diffuse ionized gas.

1509.08250	radial constraints on the initial mass function from tio features and  wing-ford band in early-type galaxies	at present, the main challenge to the interpretation of variations ingravity-sensitive line strengths as driven by a non-universal initial massfunction (imf), lies in understanding the effect of other parameters describingunresolved stellar populations, such as elemental abundance ratios. we combinevarious tio-based, imf-sensitive indicators in the optical and nir spectralwindows, along with the feh-based wing-ford band to break this degeneracy. weobtain a significant radial trend of the imf slope in xsg1, a massiveearly-type galaxy (etg), with velocity dispersion sigma~300km/s, observed withthe vlt/x-shooter instrument. in addition, we constrain both the shape andnormalization of the imf based only on a stellar population analysis. werobustly rule out a single power-law to describe the imf, whereas a power lawtapered off to a constant value at low masses (defined as a bimodal imf) isconsistent with all the observational spectroscopic data and with the stellarm/l constraints based on the jeans anisotropic modelling method. the imf inxsg1 is bottom-heavy in the central regions (corresponding to a bimodal imfslope gb~3, or a mass normalization mismatch parameter alpha~2), changingtowards a standard milky-way like imf (gb~1.3; alpha~1) around half of theeffective radius. this result, combined with previous observations of local imfvariations in massive etgs, reflects the varying processes underlying theformation of this type of galaxies, between the central core and the outerregions.

0806.1891	the outskirts of cygnus ob2	we investigate the possible existence of an extended halo of early-type starsaround cygnus ob2, which is hinted at by near-infrared color-color diagrams,and its relationship to cygnus ob2 itself, as well as to the nearby associationcygnus ob9 and to the star forming regions in the cygnus x north complex. atotal of 96 early-type stars are identified in the targeted region, whichamounts to nearly half of the observed sample. most of them have featurelessnear-infrared spectra as expected from ob stars at the available resolution.another 18 stars that display brackett emission lines can be divided betweenevolved massive stars (most likely be stars) and herbig ae/be stars based ontheir infrared excesses. a component associated with cygnus ob9/ngc 6910 isclearly identified, as well as an enhancement in the surface density ofearly-type stars at cygnus x north. we also find a field population, consistinglargely of early b giants and supergiants, which is probably the same asidentified in recent studies of the inner 1-degree circle around cygnus ob2.the age and large extension of this population discards a direct relationshipwith cygnus ob2 or any other particular association. earlier claims of thepossible large extent of cygnus ob2 beyond its central, very massive aggregateseem to be dismissed by our findings. the existence of a nearly ubiquitouspopulation of evolved stars with massive precursors suggests a massive starformation history in cygnus having started long before the formation of thecurrently observed ob associations in the region.

astro-ph;0208040	detection of co emission 12 co j=1-&gt;0 and 12 co j=2-&gt;1 from the luminous  blue variable star ag carinae: circumstellar envelope or disk?	we present the first detection of 12 co j=2-&gt;1 and 12 co j=1-&gt;0 emission fromthe lbv ag carinae. ag carinae resides in a region which is very rich inmolecular gas with complex motions. we find evidence of a slow outflow ofmolecular gas, expanding at ~ 7 km/s. this emission appears spatiallyunresolved. we argue that it is spatially localised, rather than extended, andpossibly associated with the immediate circumstellar region of ag carinae. doesit originate from a circumstellar envelope, similar to carbon stars, or from acircumstellar disk? the option of the circumstellar disk is preferable becauseit is consistent with additional independent indications for the existence ofwind asymmetries in close proximity to the central star, found fromspectropolarimetry and analysis of the uv and optical line profiles, and itprovides the conditions of density and shielding necessary for the survival ofthe co molecules in proximity to such a hot star (teff ~ 14000 k - 20000 k). inthe assumption that the co emission originated when ag carinae was in anevolved state, we derive a lower limit to the mass of molecular gas of 2.8solar masses. this is smaller, but still comparable with the mass of ionizedgas present in the circumstellar environment (4.2 solar masses), with theimplication that the molecular gas fraction can contribute significantly to theoverall mass lost from the central star in its post main sequence evolution.

astro-ph;0503102	passively evolving early-type galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 in the hubble ultra  deep field	we report on a complete sample of 7 luminous early-type galaxies in thehubble ultra deep field (udf) with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.39 and2.47 and to k&lt;23 ab. using the bzk selection criterion we have pre-selected aset of objects over the udf which fulfill the photometric conditions for beingpassively evolving galaxies at z&gt;1.4. low-resolution spectra of these objectshave been extracted from the hst+acs grism data taken over the udf by thegrapes project. redshift for the 7 galaxies have been identified based on theuv feature at rest frame 2640&lt;lambda&lt;2850 aa. this feature is mainly due to acombination of feii, mgi and mgii absorptions which are characteristic ofstellar populations dominated by stars older than about 0.5 gyr. the redshiftidentification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is furthersupported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energydistribution (sed), with the ultradeep hst+acs/nicmos imaging revealing compactmorphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. from the sed we derivestellar masses of 10^{11}msun or larger and ages of about 1 gyr. their spacedensity at &lt; z &gt;=1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2--3 smaller than thatof their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massiveand old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. much smallereffective radii are derived for some of the objects compared to local massiveellipticals, which may be due to morphological k corrections, evolution, or thepresence of a central point-like source. nuclear activity is indeed present ina subset of the galaxies, as revealed by them being hard x-ray sources, hintingto agn activity having played a role in discontinuing star formation.

astro-ph;0504264	the structure and star formation history of early-type galaxies in the  udf/grapes survey	we present a two-pronged approach to the formation of early-type galaxies,using a sample of 18 galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1 from the hst/acs ultra deep fieldand grapes surveys: 1) we combine slitless low resolution spectroscopy from thegrapes dataset with simple models of galaxy formation to explore their starformation histories. 2) we also perform an analysis of their surface brightnessdistribution with the unprecedented details provided by the acs superb angularresolution and photometric depth. our spectroscopic analysis reveals that theirstellar populations are rather homogeneous in age and metallicity and formed atredshifts z ~ 2-5. evolving them passively, they become practicallyindistinguishable from ellipticals at z = 0. also, their isophotal shapesappear very similar to those observed for nearby ellipticals, in that thepercentages of disky and boxy galaxies at z ~ 1 are close to the valuesmeasured at z = 0. moreover,we find that the isophotal structure of z ~ 1early-type galaxies obeys the correlations already observed among nearbyellipticals, i.e. disky ellipticals have generally higher characteristicellipticities, and boxy ellipticals have larger half-light radii and arebrighter in the restframe b band. in this respect then, no significantstructural differences are seen for ellipticals between z = 0 and 1.

astro-ph;0506383	the excess far-infrared emission of agn in the local universe	we have cross-correlated the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) second datarelease spectroscopic galaxy sample with the iras faint-source catalogue (fsc).optical emission line ratios are used to classify the galaxies with reliableiras 60 and 100 microns detections into agn and normal star-forming galaxies.we then create subsamples of normal galaxies and agn that are very closelymatched in terms of key physical properties such as stellar mass, redshift,size, concentration and mean stellar age (as measured by absorption lineindicators in the sdss spectra). we then quantify whether there are systematicdifferences between the ir luminosities of the galaxies and the agn in thematched subsamples. we find that the agn exhibit a significant excess in far-iremission relative to the star-forming galaxies in our sample. the excesses at60 and 100 microns are 0.21 +/- 0.03 dex and 0.12 +/- 0.035 dex inlog[l(60)/m*] and log[l(100)/m*], respectively. we then discuss whether thefar-ir excess is produced by radiation from the active nucleus that is absorbedby dust or alternatively, by an extra population of young stars that is notdetectable at optical wavelengths.

astro-ph;0508396	the hi content of the recently discovered field dwarf galaxy apples1	we present observations in a search for neutral hydrogen associated with therecently detected field dwarf galaxy apples1, performed with the parkesradiotelescope. the observed radio spectrum shows no evident (&gt; 3sigma rms)line emission indicating an upper limit for the hi content of the galaxy of ~10e6 solar masses and providing an upper value for the m(hi)/l(b) ratio equalto 2.4 solar masses/solar luminosities. the low value of the hi contentsuggested by the observations, together with the galaxy optical morphology,might indicate that apples1 is a dwarf spheroidal. this indication is incontrast with the evidence of recent star formation, which is typical for dwarfirregular galaxies. this may suggest that apples1 belongs to the class of mixeddwarf irregular/spheroidal transition-type galaxies. we also conclude that therelatively low neutral gas mass in apples1 can be explained by an extended andinefficient star formation process, without the need for a dramatic event suchas enhanced star formation or a past encounter with a massive galaxy or galaxygroup.

astro-ph;0509526	goods, udf, and the evolution of early-type galaxies	the hst/acs images of goods-south have been used to select a sample ofearly-type galaxies, based on morphology and on the kormendy relation. theclassification scheme does not use galaxy colours, hence it does not biasagainst young stellar populations. the 249 galaxies (i_ab&lt;24) paint a complexformation picture. their stellar populations show gradients which readily ruleout a large range of ages among and within galaxies. on the other hand, thereis a decrease in the comoving number density, which suggests a strong bias whencomparing local and distant early-type galaxies. this bias can be caused eitherby a significant fraction of non early-type progenitors or by a selectioneffect (e.g. dust-enshrouded progenitors). the deep images of the udf were usedto determine the structural properties of some of these galaxies. regarding thedistribution of disky/boxy isophotes, we do not find large differences withrespect to local systems. however, some early-types with the standard featuresof a red and dead galaxy reveal interesting residuals, possible signatures ofpast merging events.

astro-ph;0509551	morphology and evolution of emission line galaxies in the hubble ultra  deep field	we investigate the properties and evolution of a sample of galaxies selectedto have prominent emission lines in low-resolution grism spectra of the hubbleultra deep field (hudf). these objects, egrapes, are late type blue galaxies,characterized by small proper sizes (r_50 &lt; 2 kpc) in the 4350a rest-frame, lowmasses (5x10^9 m_sun), and a wide range of luminosities and surfacebrightnesses. the masses, sizes and volume densities of these objects appear tochange very little up to a redshift of z=1.5. on the other hand, their surfacebrightness decreases significantly from z=1.5 to z=0 while their mass-to-lightratio increases two-folds. this could be a sign that most of low redshiftegrapes have an older stellar population than high redshift egrapes and hencethat most egrapes formed at higher redshifts. the average volume density ofegrapes is (1.8 \pm 0.3)x10^{-3} mpc^{-3} between 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. many egrapeswould formally have been classified as luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs)if these had been selected based on small physical size, blue intrinsic color,and high surface brightness, while the remainder of the sample discussed inthis paper forms an extension of lcbgs towards fainter luminosities.

astro-ph;0511753	a principal component analysis approach to the star formation history of  elliptical galaxies in compact groups	(abridged) environmental differences in the stellar populations of early-typegalaxies are explored using principal component analysis (pca), focusing ondifferences between elliptical galaxies in hickson compact groups (hcgs) and inthe field. the method is model-independent and relies on variations between theobserved spectra. the projections (pc1,pc2) reveal a difference with respect toenvironment, with a wider range in pc1 and pc2 in the group sample. we define aspectral parameter (zeta=0.36pc1-pc2) which simplifies this result to a singlenumber: field galaxies have a very similar value of zeta, whereas hcg galaxiesspan a wide range in this parameter. we obtain a strong correlation between thevalues of zeta and the mass fraction in younger stars, so that some groupgalaxies present a higher fraction of them. pca is more sensitive than othermethods based on a direct analysis of observables such as the structure of thesurface brightness profile or the equivalent width of absorption lines. thelatter do not reveal any significant variation between field and compact groupgalaxies. our results imply that the presence of young stars only amounts to afraction of a percent in its contribution to the total variance.

astro-ph;0604530	evidence for tp-agb stars in high redshift galaxies, and their effect on  deriving stellar population parameters	we explore the effects of stellar population models on estimating starformation histories, ages and masses of high redshift galaxies. the focus is onthe thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase of stellarevolution, whose treatment is a source of major discrepancy among differentevolutionary population synthesis. in particular, besides the models usuallyadopted in the literature, we use models (by maraston 2005), in which thecontribution of the tp-agb phase is observationally calibrated and is thedominant source of near-ir energy for stellar populations in the age range 0.2to 2 gyr. we use a sample of high-z galaxies in the hudf, with spectroscopicredshifts, and spitzer irac and mips photometry from goods. we find that thetp-agb phase plays a key role in the interpretation of spitzer data for high-zgalaxies, when the rest-frame near-ir is sampled. when fitting without dustreddening, the models with the empirically-calibrated tp-agb phase alwaysreproduce better the observed spectral energy distributions (seds). allowingfor dust reddening improves the fits with literature models in some cases. inboth cases, the results from maraston models imply younger ages by factors upto 6 and lower stellar masses (by ~60 % on average). the observed strengths ofthe mguv spectral feature compare better to the predicted ones in the case ofthe maraston models, implying a better overall consistency of sed fitting.finally, we find that photometric redshifts improve significantly using thesemodels on the seds extending over the irac bands. this work provides the firstdirect evidence of tp-agb stars in the primeval universe.

astro-ph;0605642	the star formation history of luminous infrared galaxies	we constrain the past star formation histories of a sample of 25 distant(z~0.7) luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) detected with the mid infraredcameras isocam and mips onboard the iso and spitzer satellites.  we use high resolution vlt-fors2 spectroscopy in addition to a comprehensivelibrary of 200,000 model optical spectra to derive bayesian likelihoodestimates of the star formation histories of these galaxies based on theanalysis of balmer absorption lines and the 4000 a break.  the locus of distant lirgs in the diagram defined by hdelta_a and d4000 isroughly comparable to that of local lirgs observed with iras, suggesting thatno trend for an evolution is detected between the local and distant lirgs. weobtain similar results when using either the h8 or the h$\delta_a$ balmerabsorption-line indices in combination with d4000.  we compute a birthrate parameter (b=sfr/&lt;sfr&gt;) of 4\pm1, confirming that thedistant lirgs are currently experiencing a major phase of star formation. themost likely duration of the bursts is 0.10 gyr, during which the lirgs produce5-10 % of their current stellar mass. no evidence is found for successivestarbursts on the scale of a few times $10^7$ yr, such as those predicted bysome numerical simulations of major mergers. however, the large number densityof those galaxies suggest that they could experience between two and four lirgphases until the present epoch.

astro-ph;0609330	past and present star formation in the smc: ngc 346 and its neighborhood	in the quest of understanding how star formation occurs and propagates in thelow metallicity environment of the small magellanic cloud (smc), we acquireddeep f555w (~v), and f814w (~i) hst/acs images of the young and massive starforming region ngc 346. these images and their photometric analysis provide uswith a snapshot of the star formation history of the region. we find evidencefor star formation extending from ~10 gyr in the past until ~150 myr in thefield of the smc. the youngest stellar population (~3 +/- 1 myr) is associatedwith the ngc 346 cluster. it includes a rich component of low mass pre-mainsequence stars mainly concentrated in a number of sub-clusters, spatially co-located with co clumps previously detected by rubio et al. (2000). within ouranalysis uncertainties, these sub-clusters appear coeval with each other. themost massive stars appear concentrated in the central sub-clusters, indicatingpossible mass segregation. a number of embedded clusters are also observed.this finding, combined with the overall wealth of dust and gas, could implythat star formation is still active. an intermediate age star cluster, bs90,formed ~4.3 +/-0.1 gyr ago, is also present in the region. thus, this region ofthe smc has supported star formation with varying levels of intensity over muchof the cosmic time.

astro-ph;9407086	low mass x-ray binaries in globular clusters: a new metallicity effect	galactic globular clusters (gcs) containing bright x sources (l_x &gt; 10^{36}erg/s), commonly associated with low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), are found tobe significantly denser and more metal-rich than normal non-x-ray clusters bothin the galaxy and in m31. within a framework where lmxbs in gcs are generatedvia tidal captures in high-density clusters and (2+1) encounters in low-densityglobulars, the higher incidence of lmxbs with increasing metallicity is shownto be {\it intrinsic} and not just a by-product of other effects. two possiblemechanisms are examined: the first one assumes a dependence of the cluster imfon metallicity as recently published in the literature. the observed lmbxs,more frequently occurring in metal rich clusters, agrees with the predictednumber of ns only if metallicity accounts for a minor contribution to theobserved variation of the imf slope. other alternatives explored, such as thetotal variation of the observed imf slopes is due to (a) just metallicity and(b) the combination of metallicity and position in the galaxy lead to aclear-cut disagreement with the data. the second mechanism assumes that, atfixed cluster density, the rate of tidal captures depends on radius and mass ofthe capturing star. based on standard stellar models, stars with higher metalcontent have wider radii and higher masses, hence the rate of tidal capturesincreases with increasing metallicity. from the order of magnitude computationsmade, this new effect by itself could explain the observed ratio of 4 betweenthe frequencies of x-ray clusters in the metal-rich and metal-poor groups weobservationally determined. however, there is no reason to exclude that bothmechanisms can be at work.

astro-ph;9908200	wolf-rayet nebulae as tracers of stellar ionizing fluxes: i. m1-67	we use wr124 (wn8h) and its associated nebula m1-67, to test theoreticalnon-lte models for wolf-rayet (wr) stars. lyman continuum ionizing fluxdistributions derived from a stellar analysis of wr124, are compared withnebular properties via photo-ionization modelling. our study demonstrates thesignificant role that line blanketing plays in affecting the lyman ionizingenergy distribution of wr stars, of particular relevance to the study of hiiregions containing young stellar populations.  we confirm previous results that non-line blanketed wr energy distributionsfail to explain the observed nebular properties of m1-67, such that thepredicted ionizing spectrum is too hard. a line blanketed analysis of wr124 iscarried out using the method of hillier &amp; miller (1998), with stellarproperties in accord with previous results, except that the inclusion ofclumping in the stellar wind reduces its wind performance factor to onlyapprox2. the ionizing spectrum of the line blanketed model is much softer thanfor a comparable temperature unblanketed case, such that negligible flux isemitted with energy above the hei 504 edge. photo-ionization modelling,incorporating the observed radial density distribution for m1-67 revealsexcellent agreement with the observed nebular electron temperature, ionizationbalance and line strengths. an alternative stellar model of wr124 iscalculated, following the technique of de koter et al. (1997), augmented toinclude line blanketing following schmutz et al. (1991). good consistency isreached regarding the stellar properties of wr124, but agreement with thenebular properties of m1-67 is somewhat poorer than for the hillier &amp; millercode.

astro-ph;9912017	r4 and its circumstellar nebula: evidence for a binary merger?	we present new, ntt longslit spectroscopy of the b[e] supergiant in thebinary system r4 in the small magellanic cloud. the data show extended,forbidden n and s emissions which are typical signatures of circumstellarmatter. their extension along the space axis of the slit defines an angularsize of 8.6'' which translates into a linear size of 2.4 pc. the n emissionlines also show the velocity structure of a bipolar outflow expanding at 100km/s on average. this implies that, for a measured radius of 1.2 pc, theoutflow originated about 12000 yrs ago. the line flux ratio [nii]6584/[sii]6717indicates that the nebula is nitrogen enriched and therefore it has beenejected from the central star. this is the first bipolar, ejection nebuladetected around a well-established b[e] supergiant. the bipolar morphology andthe chemical enrichment shown by the nebula associated with r4 are consistentwith the picture of a binary merger (langer &amp; heger 1998), in which r4 wasoriginally a system composed by a close pair and a third star (the observed acompanion). the close pair merged into a single star and the merging processproduced a circumstellar nebula that was later shaped by the ensueing b starwind.
