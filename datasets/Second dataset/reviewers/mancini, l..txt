0903.2139	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. i. the transiting  planetary system wasp-5	we present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolarplanetary system wasp-5, obtained with the danish 1.54m telescope at eso lasilla. in order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussedthe telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter40 pixels (16 arcsec). data reduction was undertaken using standard aperturephotometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparisonstars. the resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag forthe first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. we construct detailed signal tonoise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to ourobservations. we model the light curves with the jktebop code and combine theresults with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary modelsto derive the physical properties of the wasp-5 system. we find that the planethas a mass of m_b = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033 mjup, a radius of r_b = 1.171 +/-0.056 +/- 0.012 rjup, a large surface gravity of g_b = 29.6 +/- 2.8 m/s2 and adensity of rho_b = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematicuncertainties). the planet's high equilibrium temperature of t_eq = 1732 +/- 80k makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.

0908.3836	lmc self lensing for ogle-ii microlensing observations	in the framework of microlensing searches towards the large magellanic cloud(lmc), we discuss the results presented by the ogle collaboration for theirogle-ii campaign \citep{lukas09}. we evaluate the optical depth, the durationand the expected rate of events for the different possible lens populations:both luminous, dominated by the lmc self lensing, and "dark", the would becompact halo objects (machos) belonging to either the galactic or to the lmchalo. the ogle-ii observational results, 2 microlensing candidate eventslocated in the lmc bar region with duration of 24.2 and 57.2 days, compare wellwith the expected signal from the luminous lens populations:$n_\mathrm{exp}=1.5$, with typical duration, for lmc self lensing, of about 50days. because of the small statistics at disposal, however, the conclusionsthat can be drawn as for the halo mass fraction, $f$, in form of compact haloobjects are not too severe. by means of a likelihood analysis we find an\emph{upper} limit for $f$, at 95% confidence level, of about 15% in the massrange $(10^{-2}-10^{-1}) \mathrm{m}_\odot$ and 26% for $0.5 \mathrm{m}_\odot$.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1111.4032	characterizing lenses and lensed stars of high-magnification single-lens  gravitational microlensing events with lenses passing over source stars	we present the analysis of the light curves of 9 high-magnificationsingle-lens gravitational microlensing events with lenses passing over sourcestars, including ogle-2004-blg-254, moa-2007-blg-176,moa-2007-blg-233/ogle-2007-blg-302, moa-2009-blg-174, moa-2010-blg-436,moa-2011-blg-093, moa-2011-blg-274, ogle-2011-blg-0990/moa-2011-blg-300, andogle-2011-blg-1101/moa-2011-blg-325. for all events, we measure the linearlimb-darkening coefficients of the surface brightness profile of source starsby measuring the deviation of the light curves near the peak affected by thefinite-source effect. for 7 events, we measure the einstein radii and thelens-source relative proper motions. among them, 5 events are found to haveeinstein radii less than 0.2 mas, making the lenses candidates of very low-massstars or brown dwarfs. for moa-2011-blg-274, especially, the small einsteinradius of $\theta_{\rm e}\sim 0.08$ mas combined with the short time scale of$t_{\rm e}\sim 2.7$ days suggests the possibility that the lens is afree-floating planet. for moa-2009-blg-174, we measure the lens parallax andthus uniquely determine the physical parameters of the lens. we also find thatthe measured lens mass of $\sim 0.84\ m_\odot$ is consistent with that of astar blended with the source, suggesting that the blend is likely to be thelens. although we find planetary signals for none of events, we provideexclusion diagrams showing the confidence levels excluding the existence of aplanet as a function of the separation and mass ratio.

1202.6255	physical properties and radius variations in the hat-p-5 planetary  system from simultaneous four-colour photometry	the radii of giant planets, as measured from transit observations, may varywith wavelength due to rayleigh scattering or variations in opacity. such aneffect is predicted to be large enough to detect using ground-basedobservations at multiple wavelengths. we present defocussed photometry of atransit in the hat-p-5 system, obtained simultaneously through stromgren u,gunn g and r, and johnson i filters. two more transit events were observedthrough a gunn r filter. we detect a substantially larger planetary radius inu, but the effect is greater than predicted using theoretical model atmospheresof gaseous planets. this phenomenon is most likely to be due to systematicerrors present in the u-band photometry, stemming from variations in thetransparency of earth's atmosphere at these short wavelengths. we use our datato calculate an improved orbital ephemeris and to refine the measured physicalproperties of the system. the planet hat-p-5b has a mass of 1.06 +/- 0.11 +/-0.01 mjup and a radius of 1.252 +/- 0.042 +/- 0.008 rjup (statistical andsystematic errors respectively), making it slightly larger than expectedaccording to standard models of coreless gas-giant planets. its equilibriumtemperature of 1517 +/- 29 k is within 60k of that of the extensively-studiedplanet hd 209458b.

1203.6269	cosmological constraints from supernova data set with corrected redshift	observations of distant type ia supernovae (sne ia), used as standardcandles, support the notion that the cosmos is filled with a mysterious form ofenergy, the dark energy. the constraints on cosmological parameters derivedfrom data of sne ia and the measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies indicate that the dark energy amounts to roughly 70% of all theenergy contained in the universe. in the hypothesis of a flat universe, weinvestigate if the dark energy is really required in order to explain the sneia experimental data, and, in this case, how much of such unknown energy isactually deduced from the analysis of these data and must be introduced in thelambdacdm model of cosmology. in particular we are interested in verifying ifthe einstein-de sitter model of the expanding universe is really to be ruledout. by using a fitting procedure based on the newton method search for aminimum, we reanalyzed the "union compilation" reported by kowalski et al.(2008) formed by 307 sne, obtaining a very different estimate of the darkenergy, that is roughly 60%. furthermore, in order to balance the correction ofthe apparent magnitude of sne ia, due to the dilation or stretching of thecorresponding light curve width, we introduce a suitable modified redsfhit.taking into account this correction, we refitted the union compilation datasetafter a selection cut. the main result that emerges from our analysis is thatthe values of omega_m and omega_lambda strongly depend on the fitting procedureand the selected sample. in particular, the constraint we obtain on the massdensity, normalized by the critical mass density, is omega_m = 0.7 for a sampleof 252, and omega_m = 1 for a sample of 242 sne ia respectively. the lattercase does not imply the existence of any additional form of dark energy.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1206.1391	hatsouth: a global network of fully automated identical wide-field  telescopes	hatsouth is the world's first network of automated and homogeneous telescopesthat is capable of year-round 24-hour monitoring of positions over an entirehemisphere of the sky. the primary scientific goal of the network is todiscover and characterize a large number of transiting extrasolar planets,reaching out to long periods and down to small planetary radii. hatsouthachieves this by monitoring extended areas on the sky, deriving high precisionlight curves for a large number of stars, searching for the signature ofplanetary transits, and confirming planetary candidates with larger telescopes.hatsouth employs 6 telescope units spread over 3 locations with large longitudeseparation in the southern hemisphere (las campanas observatory, chile; hesssite, namibia; siding spring observatory, australia). each of the hatsouthunits holds four 0.18m diameter f/2.8 focal ratio telescope tubes on a commonmount producing an 8.2x8.2 arcdeg field, imaged using four 4kx4k ccd camerasand sloan r filters, to give a pixel scale of 3.7 arcsec/pixel. the hatsouthnetwork is capable of continuously monitoring 128 square arc-degrees. wepresent the technical details of the network, summarize operations, and presentweather statistics for the 3 sites. on average each of the 6 hatsouth units hasconducted observations on ~500 nights over a 2-year time period, yielding atotal of more than 1million science frames at 4 minute integration time, andobserving ~10.65 hours per day on average. we describe the scheme of our datatransfer and reduction from raw pixel images to trend-filtered light curves andtransiting planet candidates. photometric precision reaches ~6 mmag at 4-minutecadence for the brightest non-saturated stars at r~10.5. we present detailedtransit recovery simulations to determine the expected yield of transitingplanets from hatsouth.

1403.6728	the gaps programme with harps-n at tng. iii: the retrograde orbit of  hat-p-18b	the measurement of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting exoplanetsplaces constraints on the orientation of the orbital axis with respect to thestellar spin axis, which can shed light on the mechanisms shaping the orbitalconfiguration of planetary systems. here we present the interesting case of thesaturn-mass planet hat-p-18b, which orbits one of the coolest stars for whichthe rossiter-mclaughlin effect has been measured so far. we acquired aspectroscopic time-series, spanning a full transit, with the harps-nspectrograph mounted at the tng telescope. the very precise radial velocitymeasurements delivered by the harps-n pipeline were used to measure therossiter-mclaughlin effect. complementary new photometric observations ofanother full transit were also analysed to obtain an independent determinationof the star and planet parameters. we find that hat-p-18b lies on acounter-rotating orbit, the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axisand the planet orbital axis being lambda=132 +/- 15 deg. by joint modelling ofthe radial velocity and photometric data we obtain new determinations of thestar (m_star = 0.770 +/- 0.027 m_sun; r_star= 0.717 +/- 0.026 r_sun;vsin(i_star) = 1.58 +/- 0.18 km/s) and planet (m_pl = 0.196 +/- 0.008 m_j; r_pl= 0.947 +/- 0.044 r_j) parameters. our spectra provide for the host star aneffective temperature t_eff = 4870 +/- 50 k, a surface gravity of log(g_star) =4.57 +/- 0.07 cm/s, and an iron abundance of [fe/h] = 0.10 +/- 0.06. hat-p-18bis one of the few planets known to transit a star with t_eff &lt; 6250 k on aretrograde orbit. objects such as hat-p-18b (low planet mass and/or relativelylong orbital period) most likely have a weak tidal coupling with their parentstars, therefore their orbits preserve any original misalignment. as such, theyare ideal targets to study the causes of orbital evolution in coolmain-sequence stars.

1408.1758	hats-6b: a warm saturn transiting an early m dwarf star, and a set of  empirical relations for characterizing k and m dwarf planet hosts	we report the discovery by the hatsouth survey of hats-6b, an extrasolarplanet transiting a v=15.2 mag, i=13.7 mag m1v star with a mass of 0.57 msunand a radius of 0.57 rsun. hats-6b has a period of p = 3.3253 d, mass ofmp=0.32 mjup, radius of rp=1.00 rjup, and zero-albedo equilibrium temperatureof teq=712.8+-5.1 k. hats-6 is one of the lowest mass stars known to host aclose-in gas giant planet, and its transits are among the deepest of any knowntransiting planet system. we discuss the follow-up opportunities afforded bythis system, noting that despite the faintness of the host star, it is expectedto have the highest k-band s/n transmission spectrum among known gas giantplanets with teq &lt; 750 k. in order to characterize the star we present a newset of empirical relations between the density, radius, mass, bolometricmagnitude, and v, j, h and k-band bolometric corrections for main sequencestars with m &lt; 0.80 msun, or spectral types later than k5. these relations arecalibrated using eclipsing binary components as well as members of resolvedbinary systems. we account for intrinsic scatter in the relations in aself-consistent manner. we show that from the transit-based stellar densityalone it is possible to measure the mass and radius of a ~0.6 msun star to ~7%and ~2% precision, respectively. incorporating additional information, such asthe v-k color, or an absolute magnitude, allows the precision to be improved byup to a factor of two.

1506.08173	pluto's atmosphere from stellar occultations in 2012 and 2013	we analyze two multi-chord stellar occultations by pluto observed on july18th, 2012 and may 4th, 2013, and monitored respectively from five and sixsites. they provide a total of fifteen light-curves, twelve of them being usedfor a simultaneous fit that uses a unique temperature profile, assuming a clear(no-haze) and pure n_2 atmosphere, but allowing for a possible pressurevariation between the two dates. we find a solution that fits satisfactorily(i.e. within the noise level) all the twelve light-curves, providingatmospheric constraints between ~1,190 km (pressure ~ 11 \mubar) and ~ 1,450 km(pressure ~0.1 \mubar) from pluto's center. our main results are: (1) thebest-fitting temperature profile shows a stratosphere with strong positivegradient between 1,190 km (at 36 k, 11 \mubar) and r = 1,215 km (6.0 \mubar),where a temperature maximum of 110 k is reached; above it is a mesosphere withnegative thermal gradient of -0.2 k/km up to ~ 1,390 km (0.25 \mubar), where,the mesosphere connects itself to a more isothermal upper branch around 81 k;(2) the pressure shows a small (6 %) but significant increase (6-\sigma level)between the two dates; (3) without troposphere, pluto's radius is found to ber_p = 1,190 +/- 5km. allowing for a troposphere, r_p is constrained to liebetween 1,168 and 1,195 km; (4) the currently measured co abundance is toosmall to explain the mesospheric negative thermal gradient. cooling by hcn ispossible, but only if this species is largely saturated; alternativeexplanations like zonal winds or vertical compositional variations of theatmosphere are unable to explain the observed mesospheric trend.

1507.01024	hats-7b: a hot super neptune transiting a quiet k dwarf star	iw ../submit_v2/abstract.txt ( row 1 col 1 6:48 ctrl-k h for help we reportthe discovery by the hatsouth network of hats-7b, a transiting super-neptunewith a mass of 0.120+/-0.012mj, a radius of 0.563+/-(0.046,0.034)rj, and anorbital period of 3.1853days. the host star is a moderately bright(v=13.340+/-0.010mag, k_s=10.976+/-0.026mag) k dwarf star with a mass of0.849+/-0.027msun , a radius of 0.815+/-(0.049,-0.035)rsun, and a metallicityof [fe/h]=+0.250+/-0.080. the star is photometrically quiet to within theprecision of the hatsouth measurements and has low rv jitter. hats-7b is thesecond smallest radius planet discovered by a wide-field ground-based transitsurvey, and one of only a handful of neptune-size planets with mass and radiusdetermined to 10% precision. theoretical modeling of hats-7b yields ahydrogen-helium fraction of 18+/-4% (rock-iron core and h2-he envelope), or9+/-4% (ice core and h2-he envelope), i.e.it has a composition broadly similarto that of uranus and neptune, and very different from that of saturn, whichhas 75% of its mass in h2-he. based on a sample of transiting exoplanets withaccurately (&lt;20%) determined parameters, we establish approximate power-lawrelations for the envelopes of the mass-density distribution of exoplanets.hats-7b, which, together with the recently discovered hats-8b, is one of thefirst two transiting super-neptunes discovered in the southern sky, is a primetarget for additional follow-up observations with southern hemispherefacilities to characterize the atmospheres of super-neptunes (which we defineas objects with mass greater than that of neptune, and smaller than halfwaybetween that of neptune and saturn, i.e. 0.054 mj&lt;mp&lt;0.18 mj).

1509.05609	larger and faster: revised properties and a shorter orbital period for  the wasp-57 planetary system from a pro-am collaboration	transits in the wasp-57 planetary system have been found to occur half anhour earlier than expected. we present ten transit light curves from amateurtelescopes, on which this discovery was based, thirteen transit light curvesfrom professional facilities which confirm and refine this finding, andhigh-resolution imaging which show no evidence for nearby companions. we usethese data to determine a new and precise orbital ephemeris, and measure thephysical properties of the system. our revised orbital period is 4.5s shorterthan found from the discovery data alone, which explains the early occurrenceof the transits. we also find both the star and planet to be larger and lessmassive than previously thought. the measured mass and radius of the planet arenow consistent with theoretical models of gas giants containing noheavy-element core, as expected for the sub-solar metallicity of the host star.two transits were observed simultaneously in four passbands. we use theresulting light curves to measure the planet's radius as a function ofwavelength, finding that our data are sufficient in principle but not inpractise to constrain its atmospheric properties. we conclude with a discussionof the current and future status of transmission photometry studies for probingthe atmospheres of gas-giant transiting planets.

0808.0004	inferring statistics of planet populations by means of automated  microlensing searches	(abridged) the study of other worlds is key to understanding our own, and notonly provides clues to the origin of our civilization, but also looks into itsfuture. rather than in identifying nearby systems and learning about theirindividual properties, the main value of the technique of gravitationalmicrolensing is in obtaining the statistics of planetary populations within themilky way and beyond. only the complementarity of different techniquescurrently employed promises to yield a complete picture of planet formationthat has sufficient predictive power to let us understand how habitable worldslike ours evolve, and how abundant such systems are in the universe. acooperative three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly monitoring ofmicrolensing targets, realized by means of an automated expert system and anetwork of ground-based telescopes is ready right now to be used to obtain afirst census of cool planets with masses reaching even below that of earthorbiting k and m dwarfs in two distinct stellar populations, namely thegalactic bulge and disk. the hunt for extra-solar planets acts as a principalscience driver for time-domain astronomy with robotic-telescope networksadopting fully-automated strategies. several initiatives, both into facilitiesas well as into advanced software and strategies, are supposed to see thecapabilities of gravitational microlensing programmes step-wise increasing overthe next 10 years. new opportunities will show up with high-precisionastrometry becoming available and studying the abundance of planets aroundstars in neighbouring galaxies becoming possible. finally, we should not missout on sharing the vision with the general public, and make its realization toprofit not only the scientists but all the wider society.

astro-ph;0110706	microlensing search towards m31	we present the first results of the analysis of data collected during the1998-99 observational campaign at the 1.3 meter mcgraw-hill telescope, towardsthe andromeda galaxy (m31), aimed to the detection of gravitationalmicrolensing effects as a probe of the presence of dark matter in our and inm31 halo. the analysis is performed using the pixel lensing technique, whichconsists in the study of flux variations of unresolved sources and has beenproposed and implemented by the agape collaboration. we carry out a shapeanalysis by demanding that the detected flux variations be achromatic andcompatible with a paczynski light curve. we apply the durbin-watson hypothesistest to the residuals. furthermore, we consider the background of variablessources. finally five candidate microlensing events emerge from our selection.comparing with the predictions of a monte carlo simulation, assuming a standardspherical model for the m31 and galactic haloes, and typical values for themacho mass, we find that our events are only marginally consistent with thedistribution of observable parameters predicted by the simulation.

astro-ph;0207252	microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud	the nature and the location of the lenses discovered in the microlensingsurveys done so far towards the lmc remain unclear. motivated by thesequestions we compute the optical depth and particularly the number of expectedevents for self-lensing for both the macho and eros2 observations. we calculatethese quantities also for other possible lens populations such as thin andthick disk and galactic spheroid. moreover, we estimate for each of thesecomponents the corresponding average event duration and mean mass using themass moment method. by comparing the theoretical quantities with the values ofthe observed events it is possible to put some constraints on the location andthe nature of the machos. clearly, given the large uncertainties and the fewevents at disposal it is not possible to draw sharp conclusions, neverthelesswe find that certainly at least 3-4 macho events are due to lenses in lmc,which are most probably low mass stars, but that hardly all events can be dueto self-lensing. this conclusions is even stronger when considering the eros2events, due to their spatial distribution. the most plausible solution is thatthe events observed so far are due to lenses belonging to different interveningpopulations: low mass stars in the lmc, in the thick disk, in the spheroid andpossibly some true machos in the halo.

astro-ph;0404526	gravitational lensing by black holes: a comprehensive treatment and the  case of the star s2	light rays passing very close to a black hole may experience very strongdeviations. two geometries were separately considered in the recent literature:a source behind the black hole (standard gravitational lensing); a source infront of the black hole (retro-lensing). in this paper we start from the strongfield limit approach to recover both situations under the same formalism,describing not only the two geometries just mentioned but also any intermediatepossible configurations of the system source-lens-observer, without anysmall-angle limitations. this is done for any spherically symmetric black holesand for the equatorial plane of kerr black holes. in the light of thisformalism we revisit the previous literature on retro-lensing, sensiblyimproving the observational estimates. in particular, for the case of the stars2, we give sharp predictions for the magnitude of the relativistic images andthe time of their highest brightness, which should occur at the beginning ofyear 2018. the observation of such images would open fascinating perspectiveson the measure of the physical parameters of the central black hole, includingmass, spin and distance.

astro-ph;0409720	microlensing by gas filaments	gas in the interstellar matter is generally organized in filamentarystructures, which may be also relevant for a complementary explanation of thedark matter in the galactic halo. we examine the possibility that suchstructures may act as gravitational microlenses on background sources. to thispurpose, we derive the general properties of a cylindrical lens and compare thelight curves produced by such microlensing events with those generated byspherically symmetric clouds. we find that the establishment of the symmetry ofthe lens through the sole analysis of the light curve may be problematic, whilethe analysis of the astrometric shift of the centroid of the image candiscriminate between the two classes of clouds. on the basis of our analysis,we find that only gas filaments with a very high density could be detectable.such clouds are unlikely to exist in a long-lived state. therefore,microlensing cannot discriminate on the existence and the relevance of gasfilaments in the halo, which could well be present and escape detection byordinary microlensing surveys.

astro-ph;0503664	gravitational lensing of stars in the central arcsecond of our galaxy	in the neighborhood of sgr a*, several stars (s2, s12, s14, s1, s8, s13)enjoy an accurate determination of their orbital parameters. general relativitypredicts that the central black hole acts as a gravitational lens on thesestars, generating a secondary image and two infinite series of relativisticimages. for each of these six stars, we calculate the light curves for thesecondary and the first two relativistic images, in the schwarzschild blackhole hypothesis, throughout their orbital periods. the curves are peaked aroundthe periapse epoch, but two subpeaks may arise in nearly edge-on orbits, whenthe source is behind or in front of sgr a*. we show that for most of thesestars the secondary image should be observable during its brightness peak. inparticular, s14 is the best candidate, since its secondary image reaches k=23.3with an angular separation of 0.125 mas from the apparent horizon of thecentral black hole. the detection of such images by future instruments couldrepresent the first observation of gravitational lensing beyond the weak fieldapproximation.
