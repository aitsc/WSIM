0902.0483	beryllium abundances and star formation in the halo and in the thick  disk	[abridged] beryllium is a pure product of cosmic ray spallation. this impliesa relatively simple evolution in time of the beryllium abundance and suggestsits use as a time-like observable. we study the evolution of be in the earlygalaxy and its dependence on kinematic and orbital parameters. we investigatethe formation of the halo and the thick disk of the galaxy and the use of be asa cosmochronometer. beryllium abundances are determined from high resolution,high signal to noise uves spectra with spectrum synthesis in the largest sampleof halo and thick disk stars analyzed to date. we present our observationalresults in various diagrams. 1) in a log(be/h) vs [fe/h] diagram we find amarginal statistical detection of a real scatter, above what expected frommeasurement errors, with a larger scatter among halo stars. the detection ofthe scatter is further supported by the existence of pairs of stars withidentical atmospheric parameters and different be abundances. 2) in anlog(be/h) vs [alpha/fe] diagram, the halo stars separate into two components;one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary models, while the other hastoo high alpha and be abundances and is chemically indistinguishable from thickdisk stars. this suggests that the halo is not a single uniform populationwhere a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. 3) in diagrams of rminvs [alpha/fe] and log(be/h) the thick disk stars show a possible decrease of[alpha/fe] with rmin, whereas no dependence of be with rmin is seen. thisanticorrelation suggests that the star formation rate was lower in the outerregions of the thick disc, pointing towards an inside-out formation. the lackof correlation for be indicates that it is insensitive to the local conditionsof star formation.

0903.1948	membership and lithium in the old, metal-poor open cluster berkeley 32	measurements of lithium (li) abundances in open clusters provide a uniquetool for following the evolution of this element with age, metallicity, andstellar mass. using flames/giraffe on the vlt, we obtained spectra of 157candidate members of the old, metal-poor cluster berkeley 32, to determinemembership and to study the li behavior of confirmed members. radial velocitieswere measured, allowing us to derive both the cluster velocity and membershipinformation for the sample stars. the li abundances were obtained from theequivalent width of the li i 670.8 nm feature, using curves of growth.weobtained an average radial velocity of 105.2 +/- 0.86 km/s; 53 % of the starsare confirmed as members.the li - effective temperature distribution ofunevolved members matches the upper envelope of m 67, as well as that of theslightly older and more metal-rich ngc 188.no major dispersion in li isdetected. when considering the li distribution as a function of mass, however,be 32 members with solar-like temperature are less massive and less li-depletedthan their counterparts in the other clusters. the mean li of stars in thetemperature interval 5750 &lt; teff &lt; 6050 k is log n(li)=2.47 +/- 0.16, less thana factor of two below the average li of the 600 myr old hyades, and slightlyabove the average of intermediate age (1-2 gyr) clusters, the upper envelope ofm67, and ngc 188. this value is comparable to or slightly higher than theplateau of pop. ii stars. the similarity of the average li abundance ofclusters of different age and metallicity, along with its closeness to the halodwarf plateau, is very intriguing and suggests that, whatever the initial liabundance and the li depletion histories, old stars converge to almost the samefinal li abundance.

0905.1840	metallicity of low-mass stars in orion	determining the metal content of low-mass members of young associationsprovides a tool that addresses different issues, such as triggered starformation or the link between the metal-rich nature of planet-host stars andthe early phases of planet formation. the orion complex is a well known exampleof possible triggered star formation and is known to host a rich variety ofproto-planetary disks around its low-mass stars. available metallicitymeasurements yield discrepant results. we analyzed flames/uves and giraffespectra of low-mass members of three groups/clusters belonging to the orionassociation. our goal is the homogeneous determination of the metallicity ofthe sample stars, which allows us to look for [fe/h] differences between thethree regions and for the possible presence of metal-rich stars. nine membersof the onc and one star each in the $\lambda$ ori cluster and ob1b subgroupwere analyzed. after the veiling determination, we retrieved the metallicity bymeans of equivalent widths and/or spectral synthesis using moog. we obtain anaverage metallicity for the onc [fe/h]=-0.01\pm 0.04. no metal-rich stars weredetected and the dispersion within our sample is consistent with measurementuncertainties. the metallicity of the $\lambda$ ori member is also solar, whilethe ob1b star has an [fe/h] significantly below the onc average. if confirmedby additional [fe/h] determinations in the ob1b subgroup, this result wouldsupport the triggered star formation and the self-enrichment scenario for theorion complex.

0909.5035	evidence for early disk-locking among low-mass members of the orion  nebula cluster	we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for 91 pms stars in oncwith masses in the range 0.10-0.25msun carried out with the multi-fiberspectrograph flames@eso. our aim is to better understand the disk-lockingscenario in very low-mass stars. we have derived radial velocities, vsini, andfull width at 10% of the halpha emission peak. using published measurements ofinfrared excess as disk tracer, and equivalent width of the nir caii linelambda8542, mid-ir difference [3.6]-[8.0]micron derived by spitzer data, and10% halpha width as diagnostic of the level of accretion, we have looked forany correlation between vsini divided by the radius and presence of disk andaccretion. four low-mass stars are sb2 systems. the distribution of rotationperiods derived from our vsini measurements is unimodal with a peak of fewdays. our &lt;sini&gt; is lower than the one expected for a random distribution. wefind no evidence for a population of fast rotators close to the break-upvelocity. a clear correlation between vsini/r and delta(ic-k) has been found.while for stars with no circumstellar disk a spread in the rotation rates isseen, stars with a circumstellar disk show an abrupt drop in their rotationrates by a factor of ~5. on the other hand, only a partial correlation betweenvsini and accretion is observed when other indicators are used. the x-raycoronal activity level shows no dependence on vsini/r suggesting that all starsare in a saturated regime limit. the critical velocity is probably below ourvsini detection limit of 9 km/s. the onc low-mass stars in our sample atpresent seem to be not locked, but the clear correlation we find betweenrotation and ir color excess suggests that they were locked once. in addition,the percentage of accretors seems to scale inversely to the stellar mass.

0910.2665	classical t tauri-like outflow activity in the brown dwarf mass regime	over the last number of years spectroscopic studies have strongly supportedthe assertion that protostellar accretion and outflow activity persists to thelowest masses. in this paper we present the results of our latest investigationof brown dwarf (bd) outflow activity and report on the discovery of two newoutflows. here iso-oph 32 is shown to drive a blue-shifted outflow with aradial velocity of 10-20 km/s and spectro-astrometric analysis constrains theposition angle of this outflow to 240 +/- 7 degrees. the bd candidate iso-cha1217 is found to have a bipolar outflow bright in several key forbidden lines(radial velocity = -20 km/s, +40 km/s) and with a pa of 190-210 degrees. astriking feature of the iso-cha1 217 outflow is the strong asymmetry betweenthe red and blue-shifted lobes. this asymmetry is revealed in the relativebrightness of the two lobes (red-shifted lobe is brighter), the factor of twodifference in radial velocity (the red-shifted lobe is faster) and thedifference in the electron density (again higher in the red lobe). suchasymmetries are common in jets from low mass protostars and the observation ofa marked asymmetry at such a low mass supports the idea that bd outflowactivity is scaled down from low mass protostellar activity.  in addition to presenting these new results, a comprehensive comparison ismade between bd outflow activity and jets launched by cttss. in particular, theapplication of current methods for investigating the excitation conditions andmass loss rates in ctt jets to bd spectra is explored.

1001.1834	beryllium abundances and the formation of the halo and the thick disk	the single stable isotope of beryllium is a pure product of cosmic-rayspallation in the ism. assuming that the cosmic-rays are globally transportedacross the galaxy, the beryllium production should be a widespread process andits abundance should be roughly homogeneous in the early-galaxy at a giventime. thus, it could be useful as a tracer of time. in an investigation of theuse of be as a cosmochronometer and of its evolution in the galaxy, we foundevidence that in a log(be/h) vs. [alpha/fe] diagram the halo stars separateinto two components. one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary modelswhile the other is chemically indistinguishable from the thick-disk stars. thisis interpreted as a difference in the star formation history of the twocomponents and suggests that the local halo is not a single uniform populationwhere a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. we also found evidencethat the star formation rate was lower in the outer regions of the thick disk,pointing towards an inside-out formation.

1012.2546	news from low mass star nucleosynthesis and mixing	light and intermediate nuclei as well as s-process elements have beendetected in presolar grains and in evolved red giants. the abundances of someof these nuclei cannot be accounted for by canonical stellar models and requirenon-convective mixing below the envelope, occurring during the phases of thered giant branch (rgb) and of the asymptotic giant branch (agb). similarmechanisms appear to be necessary to account for the formation of the neutronsource driving s processing. we present a short review of these phenomena andwe comment on the picture that emerges from the set of available data on theevolution and nucleosynthesis in low mass stars. our conclusions include: i)the need for deep mixing in both rgb and agb stars; ii) the suggestion thatthese phenomena occur at a non-negligible velocity, possibly incompatible withdiffusive processes; iii) the verification that the abundances of neutron-richnuclei are presently increasing in the galaxy, contrary to previousexpectations and hence that the s process has new surprises to offer us; iv)the recognition of the growing importance of very low mass stars for galacticnucleosynthesis.

1012.2649	x-shooter observations of the accreting brown dwarf j053825.4-024241	we present the first observations of a probable brown dwarf, obtained withthe new spectrograph x-shooter mounted on the ut2@vlt. the target (2massj053825.4-024241) is a 0.06 msun object in the star-formation region sigmaorionis. the x-shooter spectrum covers simultaneously the whole range from uvto nir (300-2500 nm). the j053825.4-024241 spectrum is rich in emission linesthat are typical of accreting young object and clearly shows the balmer jump.moreover, many photospheric atomic and molecular absorption lines yield thespectral type and confirm that the object is young. we compute the massaccretion rate from all available observed accretion diagnostics. we find thatthere is a large spread in the macc values (up to a factor 40) that is notcaused by variability; some of this spread may be intrinsic, i.e., owing todifferent physical conditions of the emitting region for the same macc.however, within the large error bars all macc measurements agree, and the meanvalue is logmacc ~ -9.86 +- 0.45 myr. the hydrogen balmer lines are clearlydetected up to n=25. their ratios suggest that the emitting region is cold(t~2000-3000 k), dense and in thermal equilibrium (lte), and that the lines areoptically thick up to n~21. we briefly discuss the implications of this resultfor magnetospheric accretion models.

1310.2069	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: iv -- accretion in  low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects in lupus	we present x-shooter/vlt observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-massstellar and sub-stellar objects (ysos) in the lupus star forming region,spanning a range in mass from ~0.03 to ~1.2msun, but mostly with 0.1msun &lt;mstar &lt; 0.5msun. our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship betweenexcess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, toinvestigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of thecentral object. the accretion luminosity (lacc), and from it the accretion rate(macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the uv to thenear-ir, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. the flux andluminosity (ll) of a large number of emission lines of h, he, caii, etc.,observed simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. theluminosity of all the lines is well correlated with lacc. we provide empiricalrelationships between lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which havea lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. ourmeasurements extend the pab and brg relationships to lacc values about twoorders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. we confirmthat different methodologies to measure lacc and macc yield significantlydifferent results: ha line profile modelling may underestimate macc by 0.6 to0.8dex with respect to macc derived from continuum-excess measures. suchdifferences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between maccand other ysos properties reported in the literature. we derive macc in therange 2e-12 -- 4e-8 msun/yr and conclude that macc is proportional tomstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than inprevious studies. a number of properties indicate that the physical conditionsof the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in macc.

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1312.6472	the gaia-eso survey: abundance ratios in the inner-disk open clusters  trumpler 20, ngc 4815, ngc 6705	open clusters are key tools to study the spatial distribution of abundancesin the disk and their evolution with time. using the first release of stellarparameters and abundances of the gaia-eso survey, we analyse the chemicalproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely ngc6705, ngc 4815, and trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the galacticdisk at galactocentric radius r$_{gc}\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving theirhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. we study theabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosyntheticchannels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. the main results can besummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable[el/fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metalcontent [el/h], with ngc 4815 having the lowest metallicity. their [el/fe]ratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, bothin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing theabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and withfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of mg,ni, ca in ngc 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequentvariation of its r$_{gc}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbitdetermination. the full dataset of the gaia-eso survey will be a superlativetool to constrain the chemical evolution of our galaxy by disentanglingdifferent formation and evolution scenarios.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1401.4905	three planetary companions around m67 stars	for the past six years we have carried out a search for massive planetsaround main sequence and evolved stars in the open cluster (oc) m67, usingradial velocity (rv) measurements obtained with harps at eso (la silla), sophieat ohp and hrs at het. additional rv data come from coralie at the euler swisstelescope. we aim to perform a long-term study on giant planet formation inopen clusters and determine how it depends on stellar mass and chemicalcomposition.  we report the detection of three new extrasolar planets: two in orbit aroundthe two g dwarfs ybp1194 and ybp1514, and one around the evolved star s364. theorbital solution for ybp1194 yields a period of 6.9 days, an eccentricity of0.24, and a minimum mass of 0.34 mj. ybp1514 shows periodic rv variations of5.1 days, a minimum mass of 0.40 mj, and an eccentricity of 0.39. the bestkeplerian solution for s364 yields a period of 121.7 days, an eccentricity of0.35 and a minimum mass of 1.54 mj. an analysis of h_alpha core fluxmeasurements as well as of the line bisectors spans revealed no correlationwith the rv periods, indicating that the rv variations are best explained bythe presence of a planetary companion. remarkably, ybp1194 is one of the bestsolar twins identified so far, and ybp1194b is the first planet found around asolar twin that belongs to a stellar cluster. in contrast with early reportsand in agreement with recent findings, our results show that massive planetsaround stars of open clusters are as frequent as those around field stars.

1401.4979	the gaia-eso survey: kinematic structure in the gamma velorum cluster	context: a key science goal of the gaia-eso survey (ges) is to use thekinematics of low-mass stars in young clusters to probe their dynamicalhistories and how they populate the field as they become unbound. theclustering of low-mass stars around the massive w-r binary gamma^2 velorum wasone of the first ges targets. aims: to empirically determine the radialvelocity (rv) precision of ges data, construct a kinematically unbiased sampleof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. methods: targetswere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolutionspectroscopy used to derive rvs and assess membership from the strength of theli6708a line. the rv distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihoodtechnique that accounts for unresolved binaries. results: the ges rv precisionis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-masspopulation around gamma^2 vel. the structure is well fitted by two kinematiccomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsicdispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. the secondhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by~2km/s. the first population is older by 1-2myr based on a greater level of lidepletion seen among its m-stars and is probably more centrally concentratedaround gamma^2 vel. conclusions: we consider several formation scenarios,concluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of theoriginal, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 vel, and a dispersed populationfrom the wider vela ob2 association, of which gamma^2 vel is the most massivemember. the apparent youth of gamma^2 vel compared to the older (&gt;=10myr)low-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binaryformed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of thelow-mass stars.[abridged]

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7451	the gaia-eso survey: properties of the intermediate age open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a populous ~500 myr open cluster at a galactocentric radius of 7kpc observed in the first six months of the gaia-eso survey. located in theinner galactic disk, ngc 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,where few intermediate age open clusters are found. we use the survey derivedradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elementalabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry outan analysis of cluster properties. the radial velocity distribution of stars inthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derivelikely cluster membership for stars observed by the gaia-eso survey. weinvestigate the distributions of fe and fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, andthe light elements na and al and characterize the cluster's internal chemicalhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram isanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,distance, and age. ngc 4815 is found to have a mean [fe/h]=+0.03. elementalabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, withinternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

(2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1412.4153	the gaia-eso survey: chromospheric emission, accretion properties, and  rotation in $\gamma$ velorum and chamaeleon i	we use the fundamental parameters delivered by the ges consortium in thefirst internal data release to select the members of $\gamma$ vel and cha iamong the uves and giraffe spectroscopic observations. a total of 140 $\gamma$vel members and 74 cha i members were studied. we calculated stellarluminosities through spectral energy distributions, while stellar masses werederived by comparison with evolutionary tracks. the spectral subtraction oflow-activity and slowly rotating templates, which are rotationally broadened tomatch the $v\sin i$ of the targets, enabled us to measure the equivalent widths(ews) and the fluxes in the h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ lines. the h$\alpha$ linewas also used for identifying accreting objects and for evaluating the massaccretion rate ($\dot m_{\rm acc}$). the distribution of $v\sin i$ for themembers of $\gamma$ vel displays a peak at about 10 km s$^{-1}$ with a tailtoward faster rotators. there is also some indication of a different $v\sin i$distribution for the members of its two kinematical populations. only a handfulof stars in $\gamma$ vel display signatures of accretion, while many moreaccretors were detected in the younger cha~i. accreting and active stars occupytwo different regions in a $t_{\rm eff}$-flux diagram and we propose acriterion for distinguishing them. we derive $\dot m_{\rm acc}$ in the ranges$10^{-11}$-$10^{-9} m_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and $10^{-10}$-$10^{-7} m_\odot$yr$^{-1}$for $\gamma$ vel and cha i accretors, respectively. we find less scatter in the$\dot m_{\rm acc}-m_\star$ relation derived through the h$\alpha$ ews, whencompared to the h$\alpha$ $10\%w$ diagnostics, in agreement with other authors.

1504.02484	the gaia-eso survey: n-body modelling of the gamma velorum cluster	the gaia-eso survey has recently unveiled the complex kinematic signature ofthe gamma velorum cluster: this cluster is composed of two kinematicallydistinct populations (hereafter, population a and b), showing two differentvelocity dispersions and a relative ~2 km s^-1 radial velocity (rv) shift. inthis paper, we propose that the two populations of the gamma velorum clusteroriginate from two different sub-clusters, born from the same parent molecularcloud. we investigate this possibility by means of direct-summation n-bodysimulations. our scenario is able to reproduce not only the rv shift and thedifferent velocity dispersions, but also the different centroid (~0.5 pc), thedifferent spatial concentration and the different line-of-sight distance (~5pc) of the two populations. the observed 1-2 myr age difference between the twopopulations is also naturally explained by our scenario, in which the twosub-clusters formed in two slightly different star formation episodes. oursimulations suggest that population b is strongly supervirial, while populationa is close to virial equilibrium. we discuss the implications of our models forthe formation of young star clusters and ob associations in the milky way.

1507.08066	the gaia-eso survey: characterisation of the [alpha/fe] sequences in the  milky way discs	we investigate, using the gaia-eso survey internal data-release 2, theproperties of the double sequence of the milky way discs (defined chemically asthe high-alpha and low-alpha populations), and discuss their compatibility withdiscs defined by other means such as metallicity, kinematics or positions.  this investigation uses two different approaches: in velocity space for starslocated in the extended solar neighbourhood, and in chemical space for stars atdifferent ranges of galactocentric radii and heights from the plane. theseparation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novelmanner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifyingthem with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of theirmetallicity distribution functions. then, using the separation in chemicalspace, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/fe] -[fe/h] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relativeproportions of the two discs change across the galaxy.  we find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [fe/h]~ +0.2and the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [fe/h]~ -0.8. radialand vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, withmild spatial variations in its [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths, whereas for the thickdisc we do not detect any such spatial variations.  the small variations in the spatial [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths of the thindisc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.on the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/fe] - [fe/h]variations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for themixing of the metals in the young galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration orturbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin discstarted forming.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

astro-ph;0003091	a rosat hri study of the open cluster ngc 3532	ngc 3532 is a very rich southern open cluster of age ~200-350 myr; it istherefore a good candidate to investigate the x-ray activity-age-rotationrelationship at ages intermediate between the pleiades and the hyades, where,to our knowledge, x-rays studies exist for only one cluster (ngc 6475). we haveperformed an x-ray study of ngc 3532 using hri observations retrieved from therosat archive. the observations have a limiting sensitivity $l_{\mathrm x} \sim4 \times 10^{28}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ in the center of the field. we detected ~50x-ray sources above a $4 \sigma$ threshold, half of which have a known opticalcounterpart within 10 arcsec; 15 of the x-ray sources have at least one clustermember as optical counterpart.  a comparison of ngc 3532 with the nearly coeval cluster ngc 6475 indicatesthat the former cluster is considerably x-ray underluminous with respect to ngc6475. however, because of the existence of possible selection effects,additional x-ray and optical observations are needed before definitivelyconcluding that the x-ray properties of ngc 3532 and ngc 6475 are significantlydifferent.

astro-ph;0406106	accretion in brown dwarfs: an infrared view	this paper presents a study of the accretion properties of 19 very low massobjects (mstar .01-0.1 msun) in the regions chamaeleon i and rho-oph for 8objects we obtained high resolution halpha profiles and determined massaccretion rate macc and accretion luminosity lacc. pabeta is detected inemission in 7 of the 10 rho-oph objects, but only in one in cha i. usingobjects for which we have both a determination of lacc from halpha and a pabetadetection, we show that the correlation between the pabeta luminosity andluminosity lacc, found by muzerolle et al. (1998) for t tauri stars in taurus,extends to objects with mass approx 0.03 msun; l(pab) can be used to measurelacc also in the substellar regime. the results were less conclusive forbrgamma, which was detected only in 2 objects, neither of which had an halphaestimate of macc. using the relation between l(pab) and lacc we determined theaccretion rate for all the objects in our sample (including those with nohalpha spectrum), more than doubling the number of substellar objects withknown macc. when plotted as a function of the mass of the central objecttogether with data from the literature, our results confirm the trend of lowermacc for lower mstar, although with a large spread. some of the spread isprobably due to an age effect; our very young objects in rho-oph have onaverage an accretion rate at least one order of magnitude higher than objectsof similar mass in older regions. as a side product, we found that the width ofhalpha measured at 10% peak intensity is not only a qualitative indicator ofaccretion, but can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate of macc over alarge mass range, from t tauri stars to brown dwarfs. finally, we found thatsome of our objects show evidence of mass-loss.

astro-ph;0406113	detailed chemical composition of the open cluster ic 4651: the iron  peak, alpha elements, and li	we present a detailed chemical analysis of 22 stars along thecolour-magnitude sequence of the intermediate-age (1.7 gyr) open cluster ic4651. we find for the cluster a well-defined fe abundance of [fe/h]= 0.10 +/-0.03 (internal errors), with a reddening e(b-y)=0.091. we also deriveabundances for the alpha elements mg, si, ti, and ca and find a moderateenhancement of the three former elements. among the fe group elements, cr andni are slightly overabundant ([x/fe] ~ 0.05). the na abundance among the giantsis more than 0.2 dex higher than in the dwarfs. we interpret this as due todredge-up of 23na in the giants. li abundances show a well-defined pattern: thesolar-type stars have an almost constant li abundance, just below that of thehyades, and the li-dip is pronounced and well determined. turnoff stars justabove the dip have a `cosmic' li abundance, but within a very small range ofmagnitudes (0.25 mag) higher on the turnoff, li drops by more than a factor 10implying that some extra mixing is required. among the giants, two probableclump stars show detectable li, while all the other (likely) rgb stars do not.we show that rotating stellar models including the most recent developments formeridional circulation and turbulence by shear instabilities explain very wellthe observed li pattern. the possibility remains open that the giantsexhibiting the highest li abundances are actual rgb bump stars which have justbeen through the so-called "lithium flash".

astro-ph;0407524	beryllium in turnoff stars of ngc6397: early galaxy spallation,  cosmochronology and cluster formation	we present the first detection of beryllium in two turnoff stars of the old,metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397. the beryllium lines are clearly detectedand we determine a mean beryllium abundance of log(be/h)=-12.35 +/- 0.2. theberyllium abundance is very similar to that of field stars of similar fecontent. we interpret the beryllium abundance observed as the result of primaryspallation of cosmic rays acting on a galactic scale, showing that berylliumcan be used as a powerful cosmochronometer for the first stellar generations.with this method, we estimate that the cluster formed 0.2-0.3 gyr after theonset of star formation in the galaxy, in excellent agreement with the agederived from main sequence fitting. from the same spectra we also find low o(noticeably different for the two stars) and high n abundances, suggesting thatthe original gas was enriched in cno processed material. our beryllium results,together with the n, o, and li abundances, provide insights on the formation ofthis globular cluster, showing that any cno processing of the gas must haveoccurred in the protocluster cloud before the formation of the stars we observenow. we encounter, however, difficulties in giving a fully consistent pictureof the cluster formation, able to explain the complex overall abundancepattern.

astro-ph;0408108	are beryllium abundances anomalous in stars with giant planets?	in this paper we present beryllium (be) abundances in a large sample of 41extra-solar planet host stars, and for 29 stars without any knownplanetary-mass companion, spanning a large range of effective temperatures. thebe abundances were derived through spectral synthesis done in standard localthermodynamic equilibrium, using spectra obtained with various instruments. theresults seem to confirm that overall, planet-host stars have ``normal'' beabundances, although a small, but not significant, difference might be present.this result is discussed, and we show that this difference is probably not dueto any stellar ``pollution'' events. in other words, our results support theidea that the high-metal content of planet-host stars has, overall, a``primordial'' origin. however, we also find a small subset of planet-hostlate-f and early-g dwarfs that might have higher than average be abundances.the reason for the offset is not clear, and might be related either to theengulfment of planetary material, to galactic chemical evolution effects, or tostellar-mass differences for stars of similar temperature.

astro-ph;0408109	beryllium anomalies in solar-type field stars	we present a study of beryllium (be) abundances in a large sample of fieldsolar-type dwarfs and sub-giants spanning a large range of effectivetemperatures. the analysis shows that be is severely depleted for f stars, asexpected by the light-element depletion models. however, we also show thatberyllium abundances decrease with decreasing temperature for stars cooler than$\sim$6000 k, a result that cannot be explained by current theoretical modelsincluding rotational mixing, but that is, at least in part, expected from themodels that take into account internal wave physics. in particular, the lightelement abundances of the coolest and youngest stars in our sample suggest thatbe, as well as lithium (li), has already been burned early during theirevolution. furthermore, we find strong evidence for the existence of a be-gapfor solar-temperature stars. the analysis of li and be abundances in thesub-giants of our sample also shows the presence of one case that has stilldetectable amounts of li, while be is severely depleted. finally, we comparethe derived be abundances with li abundances derived using the same set ofstellar parameters. this gives us the possibility to explore the temperaturesfor which the onset of li and be depletion occurs.

astro-ph;0507537	time scales of li evolution: a homogeneous analysis of open clusters  from zams to late-ms	we have performed a new and homogeneous analysis of all the li data availablein the literature for main sequence stars (spectral-types from late f to k) inopen clusters. in the present paper we focus on a detailed investigation of msli depletion and its time scales for stars in the 6350-5500 k effectivetemperature range. for the first time, we were able to constrain the age atwhich non-standard mixing processes, driving ms li depletion, appear. we havealso shown that ms li depletion is not a continuous process and cannot besimply described by a t^(-alpha) law. we confirm that depletion becomesineffective beyond an age of 1-2 gyr for the majority of the stars, leading toa li plateau at old ages. we compared the empirical scenario of li as afunction of age with the predictions of three non-standard models. we foundthat models including only gravity waves as main mixing process are not able tofit the li vs. age pattern and thus this kind of mixing can be excluded as thepredominant mechanism responsible for li depletion. on the other hand, modelsincluding slow mixing induced by rotation and angular momentum loss, and inparticular those including also diffusive processes not related to rotation,can explain to some extent the empirical evidence. however, none of thecurrently proposed models can fit the plateau at old ages.

astro-ph;0602618	accretion in the rho-oph pre-main sequence stars	the aim of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass accretion ratein a large, complete sample of objects in the core of the star forming regionrho-oph. the sample includes most of the objects (104 out of 111) with evidenceof a circumstellar disk from mid-infrared photometry; it covers a stellar massrange from about 0.03 to 3 msun and it is complete to a limiting mass of ~0.05msun. we used j and k-band spectra to derive the mass accretion rate of eachobject from the intensity of the hydrogen recombination lines, pab or brg. forcomparison, we also obtained similar spectra of 35 diskless objects. theresults show that emission in these lines is only seen in stars with disks, andcan be used as an indicator of accretion. however, the converse does not hold,as about 50% of our disk objects do not have detectable line emission. themeasured accretion rates show a strong correlation with the mass of the centralobject (macc ~ mstar^1.8+-0.2) and a large spread, of two orders of magnitudeat least, for any interval of mstar. a comparison with existing data for taurusshows that the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least forobjects more massive than ~0.1msun. the implications of these results arebriefly discussed.

astro-ph;0604157	the effect of heavy element opacity on pre-main sequence li depletion	recent 3-d analysis of the solar spectrum data suggests a significant changeof the solar chemical composition. this may affect the temporal evolution ofthe surface abundance of light elements since the extension of the convectiveenvelope is largely affected by the internal opacity value. we analyse theinfluence of the adopted solar mixture on the opacity in the convectiveenvelope of pre-main sequence (pms) stars and thus on pms lithium depletion.the surface li abundance depends on the relative efficiency of severalprocesses, some of them still not known with the required precision; this paperthus analyses one of the aspects of this ``puzzle''. focusing on pms evolution,where the largest amount of li burning occurs, we computed stellar models forthree selected masses (0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 msun, with z=0.013, y=0.27, alpha=1.9)by varying the chemical mixture, that is the internal element distribution inz. we analysed the contribution of the single elements to the opacity at thetemperatures and densities of interest for li depletion. several mixtures wereobtained by varying the abundance of the most important elements one at a time;we then calculated the corresponding pms li abundance evolution. we found thata mixture variation does change the li abundance: at fixed total metallicity,the li depletion increases when increasing the fraction of elements heavierthan o.

astro-ph;0609291	accretion in rho-ophiuchi brown dwarfs: infrared hydrogen line ratios	mass accretion rate determinations are fundamental for an understanding ofthe evolution of pre-main sequence star circumstellar disks. magnetosphericaccretion models are used to derive values of the mass accretion rates inobjects of very different properties, from brown dwarfs to intermediate-massstars; we test the validity of these models in the brown dwarf regime, wherethe stellar mass and luminosity, as well as the mass accretion rate, are muchlower than in t tauri stars. we have measured simultaneously two infraredhydrogen lines, pab and brg, in a sample of 16 objects in the star-formingregion rho-oph. the sample inc ludes 7 very low mass objects and brown dwarfsand 9 t tauri stars. brown dwarfs where both lines are detected have a ratiopab/brg of ~2. larger values, &gt;=3.5, are only found among the t tauri stars.the low line ratios in brown dwarfs indicate that the lines cannot originate inthe column of gas accreting from the disk onto the star along the magneticfield lines, and we suggest that they form instead in the shocked photosphere,heated to temperatures of ~3500 k. if so, in analogy to veiling estimates in ttauri stars, the hydrogen infrared line fluxes may provide a reliable measureof the accretion rate in brown dwarfs.
