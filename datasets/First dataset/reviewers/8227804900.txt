14944351460	Depositional characteristics and nonsynchronism tectonic movement of Baigang Formation in eastern depression of Baise basin	This article studies the depositional characteristics of two different sedimentary systems in Baigang Formation, in the eastern depression of Baise basin. Depositional response record is closely related with structure activity. In early and middle stages of Baigang period, progradation occurred in the southern delta because of regional uplifting. When entering late stage, progradation took place in the northern fan-delta as the structural activity in the south was relatively stable compared with a strong structural activity in the north. The structural activity in the whole basin showed obvious nonsynchronism in different side of Baise basin.

20444471461	Sequence stratigraphical characteristics of Jurassic in the north part of West Sichuan	The Jurassic gas reservoirs have been successively found out in Pingluoba, Daxingxi, Xinchang and Baimamiao structures since the first Jurassic commercial gas well was successfully drilled in Sichuan Basin in 1977. However, the Jurassic in the north part of West Sichuan has not yet evaluated up to now because of low exploration level and hysteretic research works. For this reason, the Jurassic in the region was primarily analyzed according to sequence stratigraphic methods and the research on sequence interface, systematic domain and various sequence characteristics were carried out so as to promote the study and exploration of the Jurassic in the region. On the basis of dividing the Jurassic in the region into 13 sequence interfaces and 12 grade-3 sequences, it is pointed out in the paper that the Jurassic in the region is mainly composed of prograding systematic domain and retrograding systematic domain; the former was the product during the stage of showing the basin fringe tectonic mobile intensity from weakness to strength in sedimentary sequence; and the latter was the product during the stage of representing the strong basin fringe tectonic mobile intensity in sedimentary sequence. The characteristics of various sequences are analyzed respectively in the paper also.

33744987884	Sequence filling dynamics model of passive continental margin depressed basin - A case study on the Early Devonian - Early Middle Devonian Youjiang basin	The Youjiang Basin is a passive continental margin depressed basin from the Early Devonian to early Middle Devonian. In this paper, the authors established a sequence filling dynamics model of the basin based on an integrated analysis of deposition, sequence, tectonic evolution, paleoclimate and eustatic fluctuation of the basin from the Early Devonian to early Middle Devonian. The model fully reflects the basic ideas that tectonics controls basin, basin controls facies, and sequence style was controlled by the facies distribution in time and space. The model emphasizes the decisive function of the ratio of accommodation change versus deposit supply in the process of sequence style forming, however, the accommodation change was caused by the relative sealevel fluctuation which was affected by tectonic depressing and eustatism. The model was proved by the Liujing profile, which is a typical platform edge facies in Hengxian County, and the Chehe profile, which is a typical ramp - basin edge facies in Nandan County. The model reflects obviously that eustatism is a main factor of the supper sequence formation, the regional tectonic depressing results in that the R knee point of relative sea-level curve is earlier than that of eustatic curve, and the F knee point of relative sea-level curve is later than that of eustatic curve. Paleoclimate factor was reflected by the difference of sequence filling mass (climate sensitization deposit type, biologic species). The idea and method of establishing sequence filling dynamics can offer reference to similar study in other regions or other basins. The sequence filling dynamics model is very important for geologists to understand the relation between the Tethys tectonic area and tectonic dynamics of the Youjiang Basin, to develop basin dynamics and exploit resources of the Youjiang Basin.

33646864502	Jurassic sequence stratugraphy in the western Sichuan Foreland Basin, China	The Jurassic in the West Sichuan Foreland Basin is continental detrital sedimentary strata, within which the recognizable sequence boundaries include uncomformity and erosional deposi-tion break, and lake-flooding surface. In order to overcome the limitation of these tow sequence boundaries in the continental strata studies, the authors introduce the concepts of the largest progradational surface and the largest lake-flooding surface. The largest progradational surface is just the largest erosional surface or even the unconformity, and the largest retrograding surface is just coupled by the largest lake-flooding surface. Taking the system tracts as the basic consisted units within the sedimentary sequences, in the light of progradational system tracks and retrograding system tracks, the authors divide the Jurassic of West Sichuan Foreland Basin into 8 sequences, which can be correlated within the whole basin. Since the progradational system tracks represent the products during the period from weak to strong structural activity, and also because the development of delta sediments is one of the important criteria of the progradational system tracks, so the sequence subdivision scheme is of significance to guide petroleum exploration.

The conclusions show that Xujiahe Formation mainly deposited on alluvial fans, lacustrine deltas, lacustrine facies, marine deltas facies, shoreline facies and bay facies. According to studied in detail sedimentary facies and the characteristics of the tectonic evolution in the Xujiahe period, the authors think that the paleogeography evolved from marine environment, paralic environment to continental environment in the studied zone. Furthermore, with Anxian Movement influencing, Longmenshan uplifted and became a mountain which made the studied zone isolated with Ganzi sea and became a forland basin.

The numerical well logging-microfacies model is established by means of extracting seven key logging facies elements from several well logging parameters which can reflect the variation of sedimentary microfacies and.extracting several synthesis parameters by principal constituent analysis. Based on the method above, the non-cores drills' sedimentary microfacies types are automatically discriminated. So this paper offers a supplementary method for sedimentary microfacies analysis from the numerical model, and it is very useful to the sedimentary microfacies of non-cores drills, and also indicates that geomathematics has a rather bright future in sedimentary environment analysis.

The earliest Quaternary Yunchi Formation accumulated in an alluvial fan to fan-delta environment. The subsequent Shanxiyao Formation was deposited in an environment that changed from fan-delta to lacustrine. The distribution of sedimentary facies suggests the presence of a lake in the Yichang area prior to 0.75 Ma, B.P. The lack of sediments contemporaneous with the Yunchi and Shanxiyao Formations in other areas of the Jianghan Basin, suggests that this ancient lake was limited to the Yichang area. This lake predates the present Yangtze River in the Yichang area and the Jianghan basin. Provenance studies of gravels in the Yunchi and Shanxiyao Formations, as well as gravels in terraces and the channel of the Yangtze River indicate a variety of sediment sources, but suggest that no material from the area west of the Three Gorges had been carried into the Yichang area prior to 0.75 Ma, B.P. The Yangtze River cut through Three Gorges area only after 0.75 Ma, B.P. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34047121677	Sequence stratigraphic framework of the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos basin and petroleum exploration	Through a comprehensive analysis of the outcrops, rock cores, well logging and trace element data, five sequence boundaries of different origins are identified, and on that basis, the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos basin is divided into four long-term base-level cycles (LSC1, LSC2, LSC3 and LSC4) that are persistent on a regional scale. Then the relationship between the source-reservoir-cap associations and the base-level cyclic sequences of the formation is discussed in detail and it is pointed out that the long-term base-level cycles bear close relation to the source-reservoir-cap rock association. The main reservoir sand bodies occur in the early and middle stages of the ascending half cycle and the middle and late stages of the descending half cycle of the long-term base-level cycle, and lacustrine mudstone and shale developed at positions of ascending and descending transition of the long-term base-level cycle are good hydrocarbon source rocks and cap rocks.

Compaction, quartz secondary enlargement and kaolinite an aphase-infilling are main diageneses to damage pores. The solution of felspar and carbonate minerals are the chief diageneses to form sencondary pores. Space-time configuration of various diageneses controll the development of pores. Development of reservoir pores in vertical zoning formed a secondary pores belt. So, it is significant to forecast spatial distribution of the reservoir physical properties.

34250693616	Sandstone characteristic and provenance analysis of the Permian Shanxi Formation - Shangshihezi Formation in the northeast of Ordos Basin, China	This paper analyzes the clastic composition, debris, cathodoluminescence, heavy minerals and paleocurrent of the sandstone of the Permian Shanxi Formation - Shangshihezi Formation in the northeast of Ordos Basin. These evidences display that the provenance derives from the north Yinshan paleoland, the primary cover composed of the Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rock and metamorphic rocks, and the crystallization basement composed of the Paleoproterozoic and Archean metamorphic rocks. By Dickinson triplot of clastic component, most of sands fall in the recycled orogen, and some in mixed and volcanic provenance. All the studies reveal the extension-compression cycle process of the sutural movement between the Siberian plate and North China plate. Consequently, the provenance supply represents obvious cycles. In the process, every early period of the super-long-term cycle formed by regional tectonism is combined with a period of activity regional tectonism and abundant provenance supply. In a word, the types and structural characteristic of basin filling is the response of coupling between the tectonism in provenance area and basin evolution.

34250727079	Study on diagenesis of the carbonate rocks in the Carboniferous sequence stratigraphic framework of South Guizhou	This paper studies the diagenesis of the Carboniferous carbonate rocks in the sequence stratigraphic framework of South Guizhou and draws the following conclusions. The main diagenesis developed during the LST period is fargoing karstification in the exposed area. The diagenetic environments with respect to TST are mainly marine and mixed-water environments, and the latter will transfer toward to the continent with the sea level continuously rising. During the highstand of sea level (HST), the platform carbonate sediments are subject to the marine (for the earlier period) and meteoric water (for the later period) diagenesis environment, in which rapid marine carbonate cementation and meteoric erosion, cementation and dolomitization will occur respectively. The diagenesis correlative to I -type sequence boundary, with the characteratics of long-time process and high intensity, mainly includes erosion, cementation and dolomitization which can be correlated throughout South Guizhou area. While those diageneses correlative to II -type sequence boundary occur relatively at a limited scale and have less ability in rebuilding the carbonate strata. The diageneses correlative to HST and I -type sequence boundary can produce thick dolomite and large scale pore space. So they can be considered as the effective geological evidences for predicting favorable reservoirs.

34547982470	Characteristics of Chang 6 sandstone reservoir in Baibao-Huachi region of Ordos Basin	The characteristics of Chang 6 sandstone reservoir in Baibao-Huachi region of Ordos Basin were investigated by the data of core analysis, log, scanning electron microscope, isotope analysis, porosity and permeability analysis, acoustic emission test and mercury injection test. The pore space of reservoir mainly includes the primary residual intergranular pores and secondary intergranular pores. The microfractures and dissolution only limitedly improve the petrophysical property of reservoir and connectivity of pore throat of Chang 6 sandstone reservoir with low permeability and porosity, high displacement and saturation median point pressure, small pore throat radius, poor pores throat sorting and fine skewness. The quality of reservoir was affected by sedimentary microfacies and diagenesis. Distributary channel coarse grain sandstone of slump turbidite fan was the best microfacies for the reservoir development. The carbonate minerals and the agglutination of authigenic chlorite in the early stage of diagenesis were favorable for protection of primary pores and throats in sandstone reservoirs. According to the petrophysical properties of reservoir and pore structure parameters, Chang 6 sandstone reservoir was classified into four types. The type I and type II reservoirs are the available reservoirs under the current process conditions and can be taken as the major target zones for increasing reserves.

39349118399	Distribution and accumulation of materials in shoal-reef compound gas deposits and reservoir characteristics - A case study of the Changxing-Feixian Formation in the Puguang gas field, northeastern Sichuan	The Puguang gas field is the biggest and deepest gas field recently found in the Sichuan basin, southwestern China. Recently a major breakthrough has been made in this gas field. The intensive study of the model of accumulation of materials in the shoal-reef compound gas deposit of the field has certain guiding significance for the prediction of favorable exploration areas of carbonate rocks in northeastern Sichuan and even the whole Sichuan basin. Controlled by the Kaijiang-Liangping inter-platform basin, a carbonate sedimentary system similar to Wilson's facies model is developed in the Changxing Formation and Feixianguan Formation in the Puguang area at the east side of the inter-platform basin, where there mainly occur platform evaporates, restricted platform, open platform, platform-margin reef-shoal, slopes and inter-platform basin sedimentary facies, but continental shelf facies is not well developed. The paleogeographic differentiation mainly evolved centering around the development and filling of the Kaijiang-Liangping inter-platform basin. The study of the sedimentary microfacies and microscopic geological characteristics of the reservoirs indicates that the platform-margin shoal reef facies is the most favorable facies belt for the development of reservoirs in the area and that sponge baffle dolomite, sponge skeletal reef limestone, oolitic dolomites and relic oolitic dolomite are main reservoir rock types. The development of favorable reservoirs are mainly controlled by the distribution of the sedimentary facies belt and later dolomitization, dissolution and tectonic processes.

At the same time, the paper proposes that in future, people should select the margin of palaeogormphy and old stream channel, point bar and distributary channel as main exploration regions. In addition, people should also notice the reservoir of rudaceous rocks due to alluvial vallay on the surface of uncomformity.

32144441498	Law of gas gathering and basin evolution from Shanxi to Xiashihezi Age in northern Ordos basin, China	It is well known that the late Palaeozoic Shanxi and Xiashihezi Formations are the main gas-generating strata in the Ordos basin, China. Based on the study of the relationship between the law of gas gathering and geologic agent in the basin, the authors think that the spreading of intracontinent basins and the sedimentation are the main geologic factors in the course of gas gathering. This shows that verticl erosion is stronger than lateral erosion in the river. The river provides rich material resources and bigger accomodation space. The filling action is stronger than the spreading action during the declining of the basin. So, good reservoirs can easily form. Basin-level cycle from ascending to declining can offer better reservoir sand bodies in the late ultra-long period stratigraphic sequence.

The result shows that there are two secondary sequences and eight tertiary sequences. In the Doushantuo Formation, there are one secondary sequence (SS1) and four tertiary sequences (ZSQ1 ∼ ZSQ4), and the average age of per sequence is about 12.5 Ma. The rock color in system tract is dark in general, and the argillaceous content is high. It can be regarded as good resource rock. The main sequence style is T style and H style, and T style is more. This character shows that the sea-level maybe shallow in Doushantuo period. In the Dengyin Formation, there are one secondary sequence (SS2) and four tertiary sequences (ZSQ5 ∼ ZSQ8), and the average age of per sequence is about 20 Ma. The rock color in system tract is light in general, and the dolomite content is high. It can be regarded as good reservoir rock. The main sequence style is T style and H style, and H style is more. This character shows that the sea-level maybe shallow also in Dengying period. Remarkable difference in north-south can be observed in both secondary sequences and tertiary sequences.

LST reef characterized by aggradational bioherm or patch reef is generally associated with mixed clastic turbidite, siliceous limestone and mudstones reef. The shelf margin reef is larger in size and relatively more in amount compared to LST reef and develops within interplatform basin and slope because of a better hydrodynamic environment during SMT. During transgression, the interplatform basin bioherm-reef complex continuously or discontinuously retrogrades towards basin margin and slope and then internal platform, and finally brings about transgresssive bioherm-reef complex overlapping from basin to platform, including interplatform-basin reef, slope reef, platform edge reef and internal platform reef with reefal top characterized by hard ground, bioturbate texture, submerged corrosion surface, submerged surface, submerged giving up surface. The reef cover includes silicalite, volcanic clastic turbidite, euabyssite, specularite, deepwater retrograde facies, biology dense layer, and pelagic limestone, phosphate lime mud cotained Mn et al. Its growth modes are catching-up and giving-up. The reef kinds are tower reef, catenarian reef and point reef. HST reef characterized by aggradational bioherm, transgresssive bioherm and mix reef develops abroad interplatform, platform margin, slope and basin among platforms environments, with shallowing upward sequence.

The huge thick mudstone section deposited at the transfering position from uprising to subsiding of the long-term stratigraphic base-level circles or at the upper part of nonsymmetric long-term stratigraphic base-level. It is the main regional confining bed in the Ahe Formation. According to the long-term stratigraphic base-level circles, the high-resolution sequence stratigraphic correlation framework of the depression can be established. Based on the analysis of sequence boundary and microfacies sequence, the mid-term stratigraphic base-level circles can be divided into three types of different structure (deepening upward nonsymmetric, shallowing upward nonsymmetric and symmetric mid-term stratigraphic base-level cyclic sequences). It is suggested that the mid-term stratigraphic base-level circles bear a close relation to source-reservoir-cap rock assemblage. The braided river channel sandbodies developed in the early stage of the uprising periods of the mid-term stratigraphic base-level circles. The channel bar sandbodies developed in the middle stage of the uprising periods of the mid-term stratigraphic base-level circles. The channel-mouth bar and distal bar sandbodies developed in the middle-late stage of the subsiding periods of the mid-term stratigraphic base-level circles. And the subaqueous distributary channel sandbodies developed in the late stage of the subsiding periods of the mid-term stratigraphic base-level circles.

Reefs are widespread and exposed in west Guangxi, south Guangxi, south Guizhou, middle Guangxi, east Yunnan, and have ever been distributed along platform margins or on isolated platform. Micrograph and scanning electronic microscope show that reservoir space is of pore, fissure and solution hollow in reefal limestone. The interstice types are distinguished as intragranular corroded hollow, frame pore, intergranular pore, corroded hollow, corroded hollow associated with stylolite and micropore in matrix. Intercrystalline pore, intercrystalline corroded hollow, and corroded pore, hollow fissure, controlled by non-fabric are the main types. It is suggested that the reservoir type can be classified as fissure-pore type and pore type, and the reservoir thickenss ranges from 5 to 55 m. Reservoir rocks are dominated by either boundstone or bioclastic limestone, or biolclastic dolomicrite, or cryptalline dolomite. For the later two dolomites, textures are often diagenetically altered.

Since Lower Devonian to Middle Permian Maokou period, the Hercynian movements which relied on extension motion began in the south China plate and Sanjiang tectonic area in the west of south China Plate, the deposition and the tectonic evolution of south China had characters of passive continental margin, which was characterized by intracontinental rift basin to passive continental margin rift basin for the basin type. Regarding the Dongwu movements as the sign, the Indo-Chinese movement began in the south of China. Its plate activity changed to the active continental margin and transited to the period of the retroarec basin and foreland basin. So, the Indo-Chinese movement and the Hercynian movement made a complete tectonic cycle. In term of the evolution, the authors divides it into one I sequence. Then according to different periods, the difference of evolution stage and basin type, I sequence is divided into 6 II sequence. Among them, II sequence SS1 ∼SS5 reflect the south of China developed from intracontinental rift basin to passive continental margin rift basin, which experienced initial tensile-tensile development-detention-maturity periods during Hercynian cycle. Then II sequence SS6 reflects the proceeding, which the retroarec basin and foreland basins of the south of China formed during Indo-Chinese movement.

We had studied the relationship between the sedimentary filling, sandstone component, volcanic sediment and orogenic belt, suggest that north Ordos basin and Hing Gan Mts.-Mongolia orogenic belt formed a indiscerptible orogen-basin system in Late Paleozoic.The sedimentary systems and sequence patterns of the six super sequence reveal the basin evolution from epeiric sea to intracontinental depression basin. Dickinson triplot of sandstone clastic component indicate the sediment come from north recycled-orogenic belt. volcanic sediment matter recorded the circulation and adjusting of crust-mantle matter. We suggest that small-scale river-dalta systems of Late Carboniferous-Earliest Permian owing to the terrain assembly, intermittence rifting and low-amplitude uplift, while big-scale river-dalta systems of Permian couple with collision strengthen and cyclicity uplift of the orogenic belt. The long-term complicated collision process reflected the characteristic of Chinese orogen-basin system, such as microcontinental amalgamation, soft collision, multi-cycle suturing and intensive intracontinental tectonic activities, it is significant for gentle slope forming and sand reservoir widely distribution in Upper Paleozoic ordos intercratonic depression basin.

84867822021	The distribution regularity of sand bodies in Chang-6 Member of Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation, Fuxian area, Ordos Basin	Based on a study of core, logging and seismic data, this paper studied characteristics of high-resolution sequence stratigraphy of Chang-6 Subsection of Yanchang Formation. The authors found that from northeast to southwest, the distribution model of baselevel cycle varies in order of typeA 1→typeA2→HypeBl →typeB2→typeC or typeA2, and recognized one long-term and four medium-term cyclic sequences (MSC1, MSC2, MSC3 and MSC4) . A high-resolution sequence stratigraphie framework of medium-term cyclic sequences was established. With die medium-term cyclic sequences as mapping units, four sequence-based lithofacies and paleogeography were drawn which show that the delta was mainly developed during the MSCl stage and MSC3 stage. The sand bodies were mainly developed at the same time. It is found that sand bodies were mainly developed in the subaquatic distributary channels of prograding deltas whose base -level cycle was of type Al and type A2, and the sand bodies were also developed in the alluvial fan whose base -level cycle type was type A2. Consequently, the distribution regularity of sand bodies revealed by sequence-based lithofacies and paleogeography has an important guiding significance for the petroleum exploration in the prospecting area of Fuxian located in the southeast hydrocarbon-enriched belt of Shanbei slope, Ordos Basin.

84876806346	Hydrodynamic geological effect during the waterflooding of seriously heterogeneous reservoirs	Hu12 Block of the Huzhuangji Oilfield is a typical strongly heterogeneous reservoir. The hydrodynamic geology effect was studied by comparing experimental results of cores before and after waterflooding. The experimental results show that the chemical force of acidic medium accelerates the dissolution of plagioclase, generating new kaolinite crystals in small pore throats at the same time. The chemical force has less impact on carbonate minerals. The physical force of the injected water caused the reduction of the total content of argillaceous minerals and the loss of quartz grains of silt to very fine sizes, which occurred in layers with good physical properties and developed channeling paths. In terms of changes in pore-throats, waterflooding resulted in the increase of the large pore-throats and improvement of percolation conditions, also gives rise to the reduction of pore throat sorting and the aggravation of micro-heterogeneity of reservoir. With respect to variations in reservoir macroscopic parameters, waterflooding leads to the drop of overall average effective porosity by 4.63% and the rise of overall average effective permeability by 8.93%. The physical property changes of reservoirs of different original properties take on obvious "Matthew Effect". © 2013 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

42549109616	The diagenesis character in Member 5-4-1 of Ordovician Majiagou Formation and its petroleum geology significance in the north of Jingbian gasfield, Ordos basin, China	Based on the observation of cores and slices and using sedimentary theory and SEM/CL technology, the authors study the diagenesis of carbonate rock in Member 5-4-1 of Ordovician Majiagou Formation in the north of the Jingbian gasfield of Ordos basin. The authors reach a conclusion that dolomitization and corrosin, as well as degypsification are favorable to reservoirs of this area; the other way round, recrystallization and compaction-pressolution, accompanied with dedolomitization are bad; Karstification makes the most important hole-network-system, which form good reservoirs by modification of burial corrosion. According to the diagenesis character and regional tectonic development the authors generalize the diagenesis stage and divide the diagenesis of this area into 3 diagenetic facies and 4 diagenetic parfacies. The degypsumization micritic dolomite diagenesis facies is better than the degysumization-dedolomitisation calcite dolomite diagenesis for oil exploration, the micritic dolomite diagenetic facies and the karst micritic dolomite diagenetic parfacies are not favorable for the development of holes.

41949126003	Queries about biogenesis of Quaternary gas in Qaidam Basin, NW China	Abstract: Organic geochemistry of Quaternary source rocks is not favorable to the generation of natural gas, such as the low organic matter content, the thin layer, and the low ethanoic acid content in mudstones. Seven cases of natural gas occurrences show that the gas genesis cannot be recognized by the current carbon isotope compositions. Five simulation experiments show that carbon isotopic fractionation can also happen in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Carbon isotope is not a reliable criterion for distinguishing biogenic from abiogenic gases. Based on 2 geo-transects and electromagnetic soundings, there is an uplifting upper mantle and 3 ultra-deep faults in the deeper crust, and there is a low velocity-high conductive layer in the mid crust, which is rich in CO

45449119153	Overlay relationship of basins and hydrocarbon accumulation in South China	Based on the basin evolution and source-reservoir-cap combination property, the overlay relationship of basins in South China was divided into two types of the covered type (including continuous covered type and discontinuous covered type) and the uncovered type (including upper assemblage holding type and lower assemblage holding type). The different superimposed relationships of basins have the various effects on the formation, evolution, migration, conservation and destruction of hydrocarbon. It is suggested that the prospecting of continuous covered type basin is the most superiority. The Chenhu-Tuditang double synclines in the southern Jianghan Basin and Nanling-Jurong-Hai'an Block in the northern Jiangshu Basin are the discontinuous covered types and have favorable geology conditions. The prospect of oil and gas in upper assemblage holding type areas is worthy to be studied. The preservation conditions of A'ba area may be better than that of Nanpanjiang area. The areas of lower assemblage holding type also have a good prospect for oil and gas exploration. The exploration of oil-gas reservoirs in footwall marine bed of those areas with special overlay relations resulted from large napped structure should be highlighted.

49149104926	Structural segmentation and zonation and differential deformation across and along the Longmen thrust belt, West Sichuan, China	The NE-trending Longmen thrust belt defines the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and separates the Songpan-Ganzi fold belt to the west by the Maoxian-Wenchuan fault from the Sichuan Basin to the east by the Anxian-Dujiangyan (Guanxian) fault. The Longmen thrust belt comprises a serial of thrust sheets bounded by four major SE-directed thrusting faults, i. e., from west to east the Qingchuan-Maoxian-Wenchuan fault, Beichuan-Yingxiu-Wulong fault, Anxian-Dujiangyan-Shuangshi fault and Guangyuan-Dayi-Ya'an (blind) fault. The deformation across the Lomgmen thrust belt changes from ductile to ductile-brittle to brittle from northwest to southeast, exhibiting a distinct structural zonation. According to the deformation style and the involvement of basement rocks, five structural zones are recognized, and each is bounded by the above four major faults. From west to east, they are: (1) arcuate structure and ductile deformation; (2) basement-involved thrusts and folds with cleavage; (3) concentric fold, imbricate thrusts and klippes; (4) moderate to gentle fold-thrust deformation; and (5) weakly deformed or undeformed foreland basin sequence. There are also structural segmentation along the Longmen thrust belt. The northern. Longmen Mountains is characterized by Proterozoic Jiaoziding basement complex and Tangwangzhai syncline, and the middle and southern Longmen Mountains are symbolized respectively by the Proterozoic Peng-Guan and Baoxing basement complexes, both with klippes along the front of the complexes. Along the Longmen thrust belt, from northeast to southwest, folding and thrusting initiation and finalization tend to be young, the deformation is more brittle and extensive, and the Cenozoic activity is more intense. The structural zonation and segmentation across and along the Longmen thrust belt are mainly associated with the Indosinian amalgamation between North China Block, South China Block and Qiangtang Block, and the Cenozoic India-Asia collision.

56549102650	Discussion on some important depositional events and their relationship with hydrocarbon accumulation of Yanchang Formation in south ordos basin	The event stratigraphy is a new developing point to the stratigraphical geology. Discussion and investigation on turbidity currents, volcanic and anoxic event in the south Ordos Basin reveal that there have developed characteristic turbidite of lacustrine low density flow constituted the main reservoirs in semi-deep to deep lake of the Chang 6-Chang 7 oil-bearing in south Ordos Basin. Meanwhile, several volcanic events occurred which had close relationship with the formation of effective hydrocarbon source rocks. Anoxic events mostly developed in Chang 7 oil-bearing and belonged to the local large anoxia lake. It was thought that the interaction of these events made great contribution to hydrocarbon accumulation in the Yanchang Formation. Firstly, structural depression and climate complication during the Chang 7 stage resulted in large deep water circumstance with numerous life-forms, which provided the material foundation for the formation of hydrocarbon source rock. Secondly, the subsequent occurrence of turbidity current and volcanic event led to anoxic circumstance. The death and burial of Abundant living creature also provided favorable condition for the formation of hydrocarbon source rock. Therefore, it was the interaction between depositional and volcanic events that created the oil reservoir in south Ordos Basin.

The result shows that the depositional system of the Yanchang Formation in Ordos Basin composes of alluvial fans, fluvial deposits, fan deltas, braid deltas, meandering river deltas, and lakes. During No. 8 period of Yanchang Formation, the lake basin formed. In the study area, there developed the Shenmu-Wushenqi delta, Ansai delta and Zhengning-Heshui delta, and so on. In No. 7 period of Yanchang Formation, the lake basin further developed, and the delta began narrowing. The lake water large-scale held back in Member 6 of Yanchang Formation. The delta fronts connect each other and possess the largest area. The delta fronts arrive at Wuqi-Ganquan in the northeast and Huachi-Qingyang in the southwest. In No. 4+5 period of Yanchang Formation, the shallow lake was the main subfacies. During No. 3 and No. 2 periods of Yanchang Formation, the delta plains developed dominantly. In No. 1 period of Yanchang Formation, the lake basin continued shrinking until it died out, and swamp environments appeared partly. The evolution of the basin sedimentary system in the basin has formed five sets of reservoirs and cap rock assemblages.

57649215865	Sedimentary characteristics and sequence stratigraphy of the Middle-Upper Permian in Shizhu, Chongqing, China	The marine stratigraphy is a key to the oil and gas exploration today in east of Sichuan Basin. Many research results show that the oil and gas reservoirs are located in bioherms and shoals on platform margins, which control the distribution of reservoir. Many types of carbonate rocks deposited in the Middle-Upper Permian of Shizhu of Chongqing belonging to the east of Sichuan Basin. Based on the field sections and microscope researches, the authors analyze the sedimentary characteristics and sequence stratigraphy of the Middle-Upper Permian. The results show that the Middle and Upper Permian have mainly deposited on the coast reefs, carbonate ramps, carbonate platforms and inter-platform basins. And coast reefs have developed on the bottom of the Wujiaping Formation, carbonate ramps on the lower part of the Wujiaping Formation, carbonate platform in the Maokou Formation and the Changxing Formation, and inter-platform basins on the upper part of the Maokou Formation and the Wujiaping Formation. The Middle-Upper Permian are divided into eight sequences. There have almost developed Type II sequence boundaries and are lack of SMST (Shelf Margin Systems Tract). With the influence of the Dongwu Movement, there have deposited Type I sequence boundary and LST in PSQ4. It is implied that inter-platform basins are controlled by the intraplate rifting of South China. And available blocks of reservoirs are located the around interplatform basins.

By measuring the profile in the field and analysing the microfacies indoor and according to the normal microfacies and carbonate platform model of Wilson (1975), eight types of microfacies are recognized. They are marlite; bioclastic-intraclastic packstone; bioclastic marl; bioclastic wackstone; bioclastic packstone; oncolith, ooid, alga calcarenite; bioclastic biodisturbed marlite; foraminifer packstone. The order combination of 8 types of microfacies in the study area composes three carbonate platform subfacies, that is, evaporate platform, restrctied platform and open platform subfacies. According to the longitudinal and transverse changes of the sedimentary facies, a sedimentary facies model is built. The evolvement of the sedimentary facies model is well controlled by two transgression-regression cycles with relative sea level changes. The research provides important and basic geological data for the regional geological research and oil and gas exploration and development.

57649243747	A research on the conditions of the reservoir formation and the main controlling factors of Upper Triassic Yanchang in Ordos Basin, China	The reservoir-forming conditions and the main controlling factors are the most important questions confronted by oil exploration in the oil-gas-bearing basin. By the detailed analysis of many aspects of the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation in Ordos Basin, such as the structure conditions, hydrocarbon source conditions, reservoir conditions, the conditions storing-cover combination up and the conditions of preservation, the authors think that there are the superior oil formation conditions and the fine potential to form large-scale reservoirs in Yanchang Formation. The analysis of the controlling factors of petroleum deposits indicates that the distribution of petroleum deposits is clearly controlled by the thickness of oil source rocks, the hydrocarbon-generating intensity, and the intensity of exhausting hydrocarbon. The advantageous sedimentary facies zone is the basic geologic condition of forming a delta oil pool. The underwater distributary channel of delta leading edge subfacies is often the most favorable site of gathering oil and gas. The delta leading edge subfacies is the nearest site from the depression of generating hydrocarbon and has the dominant position to trap oil and gas. A high permeable reservoir is the key factor of highly producing oil pools. There exists the relatively high permeable sandstone reservoirs in the strata of Member 6 and Member 8 of Yanchang Formation of the basin, and the high production of oil pool is directly bound up with this.

The authors consider that the Fuxian delta from the east sources does not exit in the Yanchang mid-period by studying the provenance and paleogeography and comparing lithology and paleontological. Finally, the paper also discusses the bottom shape of the lake basin of Yanchang period in Ordos based on the research of the distribution feature of mudstone of Member 7 of Yanchang Formation, effective hydrocarbon source rocks, seismic profile and sedimentary facies. The results show that the basin is wider in the north, steeper in the south, steeper in the west and wider in the east of Ordos Basin, and at the same time, the northeast delta belongs to a gentle-slope lake delta system, but the south and southwest delta mainly belongs to a steep-slope fan-delta and there exists turbidite fan sediment on the end of the delta front. These recognitions must be helpful to the oil and gas exploration of Ordos Basin in the future.

69549088466	The pattern of secondary hydrocarbon migration and its implication for hydrocarbon exploration in Malang sag of Santanghu basin, Xinjiang, China	According to the character of secondary hydrocarbon migration of a general model and on the basis of a large amount of sampling test data, this paper adopts the dynamic analysis and synthetical study method combining dynamic state with static state and combining single item with multiple items to study the characteristics of secondary hydrocarbon migration in the Malang sag of the Santanghu basin of Xinjiang. By analysing a large amount of hydrocarbon expulsed from Upper Permian Lucaogou Formation muddy source rocks matured in Late Jurassic, there are two key episodes of oil and gas accumulations recognized in the study area, including the ends of Early Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous. The faults, unconformity surfaces, fractures and communicating formations can serve as migration pathways, and the dominant way of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation is vertical and short distance migration in the hydrocarbon source region and lateral migration is a subsidiary way. The major characteristics of secondary hydrocarbon migration modes in the Malang sag are that anticline, faulted anticlines and lithologic type are the dominant migration modes in Mesozoic-Cenozoic Erathem, and that fault block, fault terrace and stratigraphic type are the dominant ones in Late Paleozoic. The practice indicates that the pattern of secondary hydrocarbon migration is of important significance for petroleum exploration.

Based on the basin evolution and source-reservoir-cap combination, overlay relationship of basins is divided into two types, they are the covered type (continuous covered type, discontinuous covered type) and uncovered type (upper assemblage holding type, lower assemblage holding type). The superimposed relationship between Mesozic and Caniozoic continental basin and pro-Mesozoic and Cenozoic marine basin affect the formation, evolution, migration, conservation and destruction of the hydrocarbon. The destruction which is build up by uplifts, depression, thrust, corrugation, block-faulting and thermo kinetic action during the basin evolution because of the polycyclic tectonic movements affect accumulation in different degree. Finally, it is suggested that the prospecting of continuous covered type is the most superiority. Chenhu-Tuditang double-synclines in southern Jianghan basin which is discontinuous covered types, has advantage geology conditions. The prospect of oil and gas in upper assemblage holding type areas is worth carefully studying and exploring, as far as the preservation conditions. The areas of lower assemblage holding type also have good prospect. For those special overlay relation of large nappe structure, formation of oil/gas reservoir and exploration should be highlighted in footwall marine bed.

This paper studied the mixed deposit in this area based on a number of regional geological data, outcrops and well logging data. Research results show that the area is characterized by interactive depositition of terrigenous fragments and carbpmate, and of terrigenous fragments and mixed sediments, and the mixed layer system formed by various types of sediments. The mixed rock composed of terrigenous sediments and carbonate are present in the same layer. Mixed sedimentary type could be divided into three categories, gentle mixed sedimentation, salutatory mixed sedimentation and complex mixed sedimentation I. But various types of sedimentation are superimposed on each other to form more complicated compound geological units. Mixed sedimentary environments are ancient continental margin and epicontinental sea. There are occurrence of sedimentary faciès such as mixed tidal flat, mixed restricted platform, mixed open platform, and sedimentary tiny faciès of mixed mud flat,mixed limestone flat, mixed dolomite plat, mixed lagoon and mixed shallow, etc. Combined with the mixed sedimentation, deposition mechanism, location and deposition environment, and under the guide of sedimentary principle, the paper proposed a mixed sedimentation model of Cambrain in the Bohai Sea Bay and further discussed controlling factors of the mixed sedimentation.

73949119702	Sequence-based lithofacies and paleogeography of lower triassic Feixianguan Formation in southeastern Sichuan Basin	Guided by the sequence stratigraphy and sedimentology and aimed at oil-gas exploration, the authors recognized two third-order sequences (SQ1, SQ2) in the Feixianguan Formation, both of which belong to the type II sequence. Sequence-based lithofacies and paleogeographic maps of Feixianguan Formation were compiled by means of condensation and instantaneity with mapping units of sedimentary system tracts. The result shows that, from the phase of SQ1TST to that of SQ2LHST, the deposition evolution changed from the mixing shelf facies to the platform facies. That is to say, during the phase of SQ1TST, the mixing shelf constituted the setting of the study area due to the rising of the sea level. During the phase of SQ1HST, based on previous deposition, the depth of the basin water gradually turned shallow and the environment changed form the mixing shelf to the open platform; at that time, the oolite beach was developed. During the phases of SQ2TST and SQ2EHST, the setting of the study area didn't change, but the oolite beaches experienced something unusual. During the phase of SQ2EHST, the number and the sizes of the oolite beaches became optimal. During the phase of SQ2LHST, however, the relative falling of the sea level and the deposition of the sediments resulted in the change of the environment of the study area from the open platform to the restricted platform, with the sedimentary rocks being mainly limestone, dolomite and gypsum rocks. It is thus concluded that the oolite beaches were mainly developed during the phase of SQ2EHST, and these beaches hence deserve much attention in future exploration.

73949124367	Distribution rule and main controlling factors of the marine facies hydrocarbon substances in the middle and upper parts of Yangtze region, China	Under the guidance of the tectonic-sequence stratigraphy, sedimentology and lithofacies palaeogeography and dynamic evolutionary view, the authors reappraise the distribution of the Sinian-Paleozoic hydrocarbon source rocks in the middle and upper parts of the Yangtze region. The vertical distribution of carbonate reservoirs is correlated well to the sequence stratigraphic framework, that is, to the transgressive system in the second order sea-level change cycle. The muddy source rocks are dominant in the main hydrocarbon source rocks and the carbonate, siliceous source rocks secondary. Their layers are good and a singl layer thickness is thinner. The hydrocarbon source rock types of parent materials and the organic evolution regularly change with the time. The Doushantuo Formation, Qiongzhusi Formation, Longmaxi Formation and the Upper Permian source rocks with better quality contribute a greater accumulation of oil and gas. The horizontal distribution and development of the favorable source rocks have differences in the sequence stratigraphic framework. The hydrocarbon source rocks are widely distributed over Sichuan Basin, only the lower-assemblage of source layers is residually preserved in Jianghan basin, however, the lower-assemblage of source layers has remained in the western border region of Xuefeng and all levels of source rocks have relatively developed in the Guizhou-Guangxi region. The distribution of the muddy source rocks are most wide with the most stable horizons, thickness and lithofacies and better organic geochemical indicators. Through the comprehensive analysis, the authors conclude that the gathering of hydrocarbon source rocks is controlled by the tectonic setting, the nature of the basin, paleoclimate, depositional environments and palaeogeography, and related to the rising of sea level with different causes. The hydrocarbon substances are always aggregated in the coastal coal-bearing system, stranded in shelves, restricted in bays, restricted in platforms, basins, continental slopes and deepwater basins.

In the early development stage of the continental depression basin, the braided river delta and the meandering river delta were successively filled, and in the mature stage of the continental depression basin, the anastomosed river delta was filled. These deltas, characterized by "big plain, small front", offered space for river evolution and sand enrichment. Distributary channels(Al type),submerged distributary channels(A2 type) microfacies of the braided river delta are considered to be the most favorable facies belts for the formation of reservoirs. Distributary channel(A2 type) and submerged distributary channel (A2 type) microfacies of the meandering river delta, and nodes of distributary channels (C1 type) of the anastomosed river delta can also become favorable reservoirs. In conclusion, the palaeophysiography and sequence filling controlled by base-1evel cycles must have had played an important role in forming lithologic reservoirs in Ordos Basin.

According to their contribution to pores, diagenesis can be divided into three types, constructive, destructive and retention processes. Compaction process resulted in sharp reduction of 20%~25% in pore. Corrosion occurred in about 80% sand pore, which is the most important factor for the improvement of reservoir pore structure. Secondary intergranular pore is common, but intergranular corrosive pore is seldom. The well-developed clay micropore and residual intergranular pore form several combinations. In retention processes, the grain-coating of lining chlorite resulted in the preservation of some pores and has positive meanings for reservoir development. Based on the observation of cores and slices and application of SEM/CL and X ray diffraction technology, combined with the types of authigenic mineral, formation temperature, producing order, relative order of the diagenetic evolution of various minerals, the structure and texture characteristics of the clastic and interstitial material, and I/S clay mineral evolution, these diagenesis were divided into 3 stages and 5 phases, including A and B the second phase of early diagenesis, A and B the second phase of middle diagenesis, and late diagenesis. The area of S4,S5, S6 and T5 are considered to be favorable reservoir position according to the diagenetic study.

It was revealed that the carbonate reservoir was correlated well to the sequence stratigraphie framework in the vertical direction,corresponding to the global highstand system tract in the second order sea-level change cycle. The reservoir showed strong heterogeneity and the secondary pores in the rocks formed by corrosion, karstification, dolomitization and fracturing were the major reservoir pore space in the Lower Paleozoic, while the primary and secondary pores were major reservoir spaces in the Upper Palaeozoic. Laterally,the distribution and development of the favorable reservoirs possesses differences in sequence stratigraphic framework. The coarse grained dolomites in the environment of tidal flat,gentle slope, karst slope and'platform or the platform edge were the most favorable reservoirs. The reservoir distribution from the Upper Permian to Middle Triassic was special in vertical and horizontal directions. Comprehensive analysis concluded that the development and distribution of carbonate reservoir were controlled by sequence stratigraphie framework,that is to say,the high-quality regional reservoirs were highly consistent with the highstand of the second-order eustatic cycle,and the third-order sea-level marine ingression was also the favorable position of local reservoirs. The late stage of regressive cycle was in favor of the development of carbonate reservoir of palaeokarst type,while the early progressive cycle was propitious to the development of carbonate reservoirs on the platform edge or the offshore barrier in platform. The high energy environment in sequence stratigraphie framework, karstification and tectonic activity were the main factors to control the formation of good reservoirs.

77952028604	Difference of the upper paleozoic lithostratigraphic gas reservoirs in ordos basin, china	The Upper Paleozoic of Ordos Basin is characterized by "gas-generating in the whole basin, gas-bearing widely and gas controlled by lithology". The comparative study between the east and the west gas reservoirs shows that the three factors, including the hydrocarbon generated widely by coal measure strata, sand accumulated broadly by shallow water delta and regional overlying rock founded by lake transgression, are the base to form the blanket lithostratigraphic gas reservoirs. In the east reservoirs, Member 2 of Shanxi Formation and Member 2 of Taiyuan Formation characterized by primary pores and relatively low porosity and high permeability are dominated by energetic environment formed by tide and stream current. In the west reservoirs, Member 8 of Shihezi Formation and Member 1 of Shanxi Formation characterized by dissolution pores and primary pores and relatively high porosity and low permeability are dominated by rich in quartz provenance and constructive diagenesis. Then, the rich in quartz provenance, energetic facies belt and constructive diagenesis are the key elements for the Upper Paleozoic gas exploration.

It finds that the types of the sequence boundary are manly the maximum flooding surface (mfs), the regional erosional unconformity surface, and the parallel unconformity surface and that five third-order sedimentary sequence are divided (SQ1∼SQ5). According to the research, the sedimentary filling characteristics of SQ3, the PST system tract occurred during the stage when the tectonic movement was quiet, the sediments mainly came form the frontier of the mountain and the wedge of the areas in West Sichuan, the delta fan sedimentary system was the main setting in the basin, and the alluvial fan sedimentary system was hardly found. The RST system tract occurred during the stage when the tectonic movement happened. At this time, the sedimentation took place on the frontier of the mountain and the wedge of the areas in West Sichuan, the alluvial fan sedimentary system was the main setting, and the delta fan sedimentary system hardly developed.

77956428749	The sequence-based lithofacies-paleogeography of Jialingjiang Formation and Leikoupo Formation in eastern Sichuan Basin, China	Based on the method of sequence-based lithofacies-paleogeography mapping, this paper studies the sequence stratigraphy and lithofacies-paleogeography of Lower Triassic Leikoupo Formation and Middle Triassic Jialingjiang Formation in eastern Sichuan Basin. The Jialingjiang Formation is divided into two sequences (TSQ1, TSQ2), and the Leikoupo Formation into one sequence (TSQ3). Taking the system tract or sequence as the mapping unit, 5 maps of sequencebased lithofacies paleogeography are drawn from Jialingjiang Formation to Leikoupo Formation in eastern Sichuan Basin. In TST of TSQ1 there mainly deposits limestone of open platform and in HST of TSQ1 there deposits in restricted platform facies gypsolith, gypsum-dolomite and pelitic-dolomite, showing the sea level falling and the evaporated environment in eastern Sichuan basin. In TST of TSQ2 there also deposits limestone of open platform. Then, with the water body shoaling, there deposits gypsolith, gypsum-dolomite and pelitic-dolomite of restricted platform in HST of TSQ2. With the Jiangnan old land enlarging, TSQ3 is incomplete and the upper stratum is absent. From east to west, in TSQ3 there deposits clastic rock to the carbonate and the beach-barrier coast to restricted platform in sedimentary environment. The most important factor of controlling sequence filling and paleogeography evolvement is the sea level fluctuation.

77956430914	Constraints of the Jiangnan-Xuefeng upheaval to the depositional system and paleogeography distribution of southeast Sichuan-South Guizhou depression during Shiniulan period	In this paper, based on the study of the sedimentology and stratal relationship of the data on the outcrop and well of the Xiaoheba Formation in southeast Sichuan area between early Paleozoic and late Paleozoic, and integrated with the previous researches, the authors think that the Jiangnan-Xuefeng upheaval formed in the early Silurian Shiniulan period (Xiaoheba period) of the late Caledonian, and the Guizhou centre upheaval and Sichuan centre upheaval were produced by the Duyun movement, being earlier than the Jiangnan-Xuefeng upheaval. Although the three upheavals may become the provenance of the Xiaoheba sandstone in theory, the old current of the Xiaoheba Formation is N-NW. Furthermore, some carbonate rock clastics are found in the Xiaoheba Formation because the Guizhou centre upheaval and Sichuan centre upheaval were deposited by carbonate rocks during Sinian to early Silurian. Therefore, the Jiangnan-Xuefeng upheaval is the source area of the Xiaoheba sandstone of the East Sichuan-South Guizhou depression. In addition, the authors think that the Xiaoheba Formation belongs to a delta environment, characterized by microfacies delta distribution in the Xiaoheba period. They map the paleo-geography and sandbody thickness isoline in order to provide the basis for finding new natural gas exploration strata.

The origins of the thrust structures are the fault-thrust movement by extrusion force and the fault-gliding movement by extensional regime. The thrust structures are widely developed in different tectonic units of various areas in the world. Especially, there are good pool-formed conditions such as hydrocarbon generation, reservoir-cap rock and traps in the thrust structure zone of foreland basins. The thrust structure zone of foreland basins has good conditions of tectonic evolution and trap formation, hydrocarbon generation and expulsion in source rock, mating with traps, reservoir-cap assemblage and hydrocarbon preservation, which are favorable for hydrocarbon accumulation. The five factors for controlling oil and gas exploration in the thrust structure zone including recognition degree of the basic petroleum geological conditions, correctness of structural analysis, quality of seismic data, precision of structural mapping and the effectiveness of drilling-logging and technological measures were analyzed. The principles and working outline of oil-gas exploration in the thrust structures regions were proposed.

Detailed observation in the field and the contents of major elements, REE and isotope of silicalites suggest that the Maokou Formation silicalites were hydrothermal origin and were deposited under platform-basin facies environments. The silicalites are characterized by relatively high contents (80. 09%-97. 91%) of SiO<inf>2</inf> and enrichment of Fe and Mn, with a ratio of Al/(A1+Fe+Mn) being 0. 30 and average total REE of 8. 72 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. δCe values range from 0. 39 to 0. 81 with a negative anomly. δEu of 0. 35-5.85, changes from no obvious anomaly to positive anomaly. δ<sup>30</sup>Si is from 0. 2‰ to 1. 2%o that is very similar to that of hydrothermal quartz. δ<sup>18</sup>O calculation also indicates that the paleotemperatures of the sea water was 34-89°C during the formation of the silicalites.

The results demonstrate that three kinds of sedimentary environments exist in Upper Permian Changxing Formation, i.e., open platform, shoal of platform margin and inter-platform basins. The Changxing Formation of the study area can be divided into two third -order sequences of PSQ1 and PSQ2, and both are composed of the transgressive systems tract (TST) and the highstand systems tract (HST), with the thickness of TST larger than that of HST. A comparison with the sedimentary fácies and sequence stratigraphy characteristics of adjacent areas indicates that the sedimentary environments of Changxing Formation must have been open platform, shoal of platform margin and deep inter-platform basins in vertical direction. In the eastward transverse direction, there formed the sedimentary belt of shallow-water carbonate platform and deep basin sediments in the area of Anshun to Ganzhai during the PSQ2 period of late Permian. During late Permian, sea began the transgression from south to north.

So pepole can make the most of the research of heavy minerals in order to analyze the provenance and sedimentary environment. By the relative analysis of heavy minerals, this article illustrates that the provenance direction of the sandstones of the Lower Silurian Xiaoheba Formation in Southeast Sichuan is from southeast to northwest, that is to say, the provenance comes from the southwest section of the Xuefengshan uplift, and the provenance direction of the sandstone of the Lower Silurian Xiaoheba Formation in West Hunan is from northeast to southwest, that is to say, the provenance comes from northeast section of the Xuefengshan uplift. The heavy mineral assemblages indicate that the provenance mainly consists of multi-cycle sedimentary rocks, basic rocks, ultrabasic rocks, and basicintermediate effusive rocks in Southeast Sichuan, the provenance mainly consists of order sedimentary rocks and a few intermediate effusive rocks formed in the stable tectonic-sedimentary environment. The characteristics and distribution of the pyrite and brown hematite in the Xiaoheba stage indicate that the Xuefengshan uplift and Qianzhong uplift are oxidized environment, while the Nanchuan and Xiushan-Yanhe are two depressions in a reducing environment.

The main purpose of which is to reconstruct the forming process of the structure dynamically, judge the distribution of traps accurately and explain the relationship between the migration, accumulation and destruction of the hydrocarbon and the structure evolution reasonably. It is understood that the Hercynian to early Indosinian period is the embryonic stage for the depression formation, the deformation intensity decreasing from the South to North. The late Indosinian to Yanshanian period is the stage of uplift development deformation with the feature of structure's distortion earlier in the south than in the north and the distortion intensity decreased from the south to the north. The Himalayan period is adjusting and modifying stage for the deep paleo tectonic, featured the intensity of the adjusting and modifying decreasing from north to south in NS direction and stronger in the middle and weaker in the east section and west section in the EW direction. The tectonic movement and trap formation is characterized by mainly the uplift and erosion in Late Indosinian period, the successive fold strengthening in Mid-late Yanshanian period, and the thrust fold modifying in Himalayan period. The relationships between the formation of trap and the migration of hydrocarbon are as follows: (1) the traps formed in Hercynian to early Indosinian period were earlier than the main stage of the hydrocarbon's generation and expulsion, (2) the traps formed in late Indosinian to middle Yanshanian Movement stage were almost at same time with the main stage of hydrocarbon's generation and expulsion, (3) the traps formed in late Yanshanian movement to early Himalayan movement stage were litter bit late than the main stage of hydrocarbon's generation and expulsion and (4) the traps formed in Late Himalayan period were much later than the main stages of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion.

79955896906	Distribution of source-reservoir-cap rock assemblages within the sequence framework from the Devonian to the Middle Triassic in the Sichuan Basin	Guided by the sequence framework, the characteristics of source rocks, reservoir rocks and source-reservoir-cap rock assemblages were discussed in detail for the Devonian to the Middle Triassic in the Sichuan Basin. Combined with the existing results of hydrocarbon exploration, a diagram of the source-reservoir-cap rock assemblages within the supersequence framework was established. Two sets of regional source rocks and three sets of regional reservoir rocks are developed under the supersequence framework. The dark carbonatite and mudstone that contain much organic matter are developed in the transgressive systems tracts of SS5 and SS6, and the hydrocarbon generating centers are developed in the cratonic depression and deep shelf. The SS4 transgressive systems tract reservoir is karst reservoir related to ancient uplifts. The SS5 highstand systems tract reservoir rock is mainly developed in the platform margin reef/beach. The SS6 transgressive systems tract-highstand systems tract reservoir rock is mainly developed in the platform margin reef/beach. In all, three source-reservoir-cap assemblages occur in the Sichuan Basin from the Devonian to the Middle Triassic, including composite, highstand and transgressive. Regional source rocks are developed in the transgressive system of the supersequence. Regional reservoir rocks are developed in the highstand system of the supersequence. The distribution characteristics of the regional cap rocks are similar to that of the regional source rocks.

Mudstone deposited during the Doushantuo stage of Lower Sinian, the Qiongzhusi Formation of Lower Cambrian and the Longmaxi Formation of Lower Silurian. Two types of source rocks deposited within the Qixia Formation of Middle Permian and the Wujiaping Formation of Upper Permian. The distribution characteristics of each stage are studied in detail. According to this study, the main hydrocarbon generating center of Doushantuo Formation locates in the Fuling district, the main hydrocarbon generating center of Qiongzhusi Formation locates in the area from Chengdu to Zigong. There are two main hydrocarbon generating centers which are Wanxian district and Luzhou-Qijiang area during the Longmaxi Formation, three hydrocarbon generating centers during Qixia Formation, and single hydrocarbon generating centers in Wanxian-Wushan district during the Wujiaping Stage. The maturity evolution of source rocks turns to matured or over-matured stage and the hydrocarbon-generating intensity is controlled by the abundance of organic matter and thickness of source rock. The stage of TST within the second-order sequence is better to deposit regional source rock. The types of source rock, organic matter and abundance of organic matter are mainly controlled by the sediment settings, the distribution and the maturity evolution of source rock are mainly affected by the tectonic movement.

79955694710	Genesis and distribution pattern of shallow water delta sandbodies in Member 8 of Lower Shihezi Formation in the northwest of Ordos Basin	Member 8 of Lower Shihezi Formation in the northwest of Ordos Basin is characterized by the regional tectonic setting with steady and slow subsidence, large area, gentle slope, relatively shallow water and multiple sources. The gentle slope-type shallow braided river delta is developed. The author takes the stratigraphie and sedimentary process-response dynamic principles as a theoretical basis, and uses the theory and technology of the high-resolution sequence stratigraphy to explore the genetic combination types of this kind of delta sandbodies. The sandbodies were evidently influenced by the relation between accommodations and sediment alimentations during the base-level up and down changes. The sandbodies in Member 8 consists of two vertical superposed types of progradation model and aggradation model from bottom to top. The progradation model mainly includes high-energy truncation style channels, low-energy truncation style channels, and deformity recombination which mouses bars at the bottom and under water distributary channels at the top The aggradation model mainly includes low-energy truncation style channels, complete channels, downside deformity recombination which mouses bars at the bottom and under water distributary channels at the top. On the basis of the above analysis, the high energy channel sandbodies on the sequence boundary are abundant in lithological reservoirs in the delta plains which show the great potential for oil and gas exploration. Consequently, The genesis and distribution pattern of sandbodies in a gentle slope-type shallow braided river delta is established based on the spatial-temporal distribution of the sandbodies in Member 8 of the study area.

0035979284	The way and implications of rebuilding palaeogeomorphology	Palaeogeomorphology is one of the main factors. It controls not only the development and distribution of the late sedimentary facies but also the assemblage of reservoirs and capping formations. Just like the modern geomorphology, it is influenced by the tectonic position, climate, base level, and so on. Rebuilding the palaeogeomorphology is a complex work. The Jurassic sedimentary strata of the Ordos Basin develops upon the denudation surface generated during the Indosinian orogeny, and their characteristics are being controlled by palaeogeomorphology. Therefore, the renewing work of the palaeogeomorphology of Ordos before Jurassic deposition can efficiently direct the exploration of the Jurassic oil reservoir. The palaeogeomorphology of the Ordos Basin shows that the northern and western parts are high but the southern and eastern parts are low in the basin. It includs five palaeogeomorphologic units, that is, highland, valley plain, hilly area depression area and palaeo-river. The paper mainly discusses the ways of rebuilding palaeogeomorphology and its relationship with the late oil reservoir through rebuilding the palaeogeomorphology of the Ordos Basin before Jurassic.

0035980758	The application of sequence lithofacies and paleogeography mapping to the analyses of lithofacies-paleogeography	As a system of map representation, lithofacies-paleogeographical map is one of geological data which involve rich information of basin's tectonic evolution and sedimentary history. The contents of lithofacies-paleogeographical map and compilation method suggest the present situation of sedimentology. The focus of making the map is on choosing well the mapping units which belong to the composition or elements of the lithofacies-paleogeographical map and display extraordinary stratigraphic units and typical stratigraphic records. Generally speaking, a sort of mapping unit means an isochronous geological body with a similar sedimentation unit. In the study history, it can be divided into 3 stages to study lithofacies and paleogeography and make the lithofacies-paleogeographical map. The latter shows the notable mark. Based on paleontology and stratigraphy, chronostratigraphy is the basic mapping unit to make the first generation paleogeographical map at the beginning of sedimentological research. With the development of researching, petrostratigraphy and lithologic correlation lead to the paleolithologic map and paleogeographical map which involve the factors of mobilism. That is the second generation map. The theory of sequence stratigraphy has now brought the new thought about making the paleogeographical map which is based on sequence stratigraphy and tectonic analysis. This is the third generation map. Firstly as mapping units, sequences or system tracts are chosen to make "time- compressed" map. On the other hand, some surface boundaries, for instance, sequence boundary, maximum flooding surface, the boundary of system tracts may all be used to make the sequence lithofacies- paleogeographic map. The map of 3rd generation owns some superiorities for making and using it. This paper gives some examples of the sequence lithofacies-paleogeographical map from the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi area in China during Devonian. They show an advanced thinking and method of compiling a lithofacies-paleogeographical map.

The conditions of reservoir formation are discussed from the angle of sedimentology, and an important relationship between them have been recognized.

79960233096	Sedimentary characteristics and sequence characteristics of Late Carboniferous and early Early Permian period in Dushan, southern Guizhou Province	Carbonate rock deposition of great thickness occurred in Upper Carboniferous period in southern Guizhou, characterized by wide distribution, integrated strata, well stratigraphic continuity, diverse depositional environments and abundant lithologic combinations. Southern Guizhou is an ideal location for studying carbonate rock sedimentary characteristics and sequence stratigraphy. Based on field measured data (mainly dependent on Jiadaozhai section of Dushan area in association with other sections), this paper employed the relevant theory and methods of sedimentology and outcrop sequence stratigraphy to analyze sedimentary characteristics of outcrop, and then divided sequences and made correlation. It is recognized that southern Guizhou mainly developed restricted platforms, open platforms, platform marginal slopes, and platform basins, whereas Dushan developed only restricted platforms and open platforms. In general, they appear as NNE - trending platforms and SSW-trending basins. The characteristics of sequence filling show that sequence filling was controlled by the third-order sea-level changes at the early stage, and was controlled by both tectonic activity and third-order sea-level changes at the late stage, finding expression in filling and leveling in the carbonate platform.

Guided by dynamics of sequence filling and combined with single profiles, profile correlation and plane changes, the authors analyzed filling material and evolution characteristics of sedimentary facies in the process of sequence filling. A study of the process of sequence filling reveals that there were two pulsing tectonic activities in each transgressive period and high stand period, with the trend of gradually increasing transgression, and intense extension in NE direction resulted in the formation of synsedimentary faults in NW direction which had time-ordered characteristics. The authors have confirmed that the platform-basin stretched into intra-platform and formed platform alternating with platform -basin. It is concluded that the time -ordered characteristics of tectonism resulted in the differentiation of the distribution of the sedimentary fácies in different periods.

80855129161	Sequence stratigraphy and paleogeography of Carboniferous in the south of Guizhou Sag, China	The Carboniferous strata are extensively distributed in the south of the Guizhou sag. They have the characteristics of clear stratigraphie division and correlation, plentiful sediment types and better outcrops. It is suitable to make the sequence stratigraphy research in these areas. Based on the outcrop sequence stratigraphy method, the Carboniferous is divided into two second order sequences and 12 third order sequences in the south of the Guizhou sag. Although the Carboniferous is all over in the sag interior, the lower lst-3th sequences are eroded near the edge of the successive ancient land or in the shallow water on the depositional high land. The authors take the two second order sequences system tracts as the mapping units to draw 5 Carboniferous sequence-lithofacies paleogeography maps. The seawater is only limited to some low-lying areas and most of the region is exposed to the environment in LST during SSl. As the seawater intrudes into the north, the south of the Guizhou sag becomes alternately platform and basin in TST during SSl. HST inherits paleogeographic environment of TST during SSl. However, the shoreline has retreated from north to south, the platform range relatively expanded and basin becomes relatively narrow. Because the extensional movement are enhanced in the south of the Guizhou sag, the basin appears a branch of the "Y" shape, showing a complex paleogeographic environment in which platform and basin alternate in TST during SS2. The seawater has slowly retreated. However, the sedimentary environment remains unchanged in HST durine SS2.

81355123878	Structural superimposition and conjunction and its effects on hydrocarbon accumulation in the Western Sichuan Depression	Records of unconformities and lithologic facies and analysis of paleo-structure show that at least eleven tectonic boundaries exist in the Meso-Cenozoic continental strata in the Western Sichuan Depression. Affected by the Longmenshan thrust belt on the west side, Micangshan structural belt on the north side and Chuandian structural belt on the southwest side, NE-trending, sub-EW-trending and sub-NS-trending structures were developed correspondingly in the Western Sichuan Depression. The NE-trending structures were developed in varying degrees in most tectonic movements, while the sub-EW-trending and sub-NS-trending structures were formed in the Yanshanian and Himalayan, respectively. The three groups of structures were superimposed by one another in multi-stage tectonic movements, producing mainly five types of structural complexes, i.e. coaxial superimposition, orthogonal superimposition, oblique superimposition, multi-direction superimposition, and structural conjunction. Structural controls on hydrocarbon accumulation in the Western Sichuan Depression can be expressed as the following three aspects, i.e. timing, location and modification. Hydrocarbon distribution and the formation of primary gas pools were mostly controlled by early structures (in the Indosinian and Yanshanian), whereas late structures (mainly in the Himalayan) only had modification effects on early gas pools, resulting in structural displacement, reservoir improvement, the destruction of primary gas pools and the formation of secondary oil pools. Accurate reconstruction of the Indosinian-Yanshanian paleo-structures and fracture behaviors during the multi-stage and multi-direction structural superimposition are two important aspects that need to be paid more attention to in the future hydrocarbon exploration in this region. © 2011 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

81355152131	Differential uplift driven by thrusting and its lateral variation along the Longmenshan belt, western Sichuan, China: Evidence from fission track thermochronology	A number of thermochronologic studies have been carried out to investigate the Cenozoic exhumation history of the Longmenshan range, which defines the eastern margin of the Tibet Plateau and is characterized by the paradox of high topographic gradients with but low convergence rates. However, the Mesozoic thermal history and the lateral variation of both Cenozoic and Mesozoic uplift of the Longmenshan are not yet well understood. In this article, we present zircon(ZFT)and apatite(AFT)fission track data for samples collected from three transects along the northern, central and southern Longmenshan Thrust Belt(LMTB).There were several cooling events, revealed by the ZFT and AFT ages, in the Longmenshan region since the Indosinian deformation, i.e., the Late Triassic(~200 Ma), the end of Early Cretaceous(~100 Ma), the Early Cenozoic(30~65 Ma)and the Late Miocene(9~15 Ma)events. At a regional scale, the Longmenshan experienced a slow cooling between the Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic followed by a rapid cooling since the Middle Miocene, rapid cooling started at 9~15 Ma, with a sharp increase of exhumation rate from <0.1 mm/a to 0.15~0.3 mm/a, up to 0.9 mm/a locally. Comparison of ZFT and AFT ages shows that the northern LMTB cooled more rapidly than central and southern LMTB during the Mesozoic, while younger AFT ages indicates more rapid exhumation in central and southern LMTB during the Late Cenozoic. Multiple thermochronologic data reveal that the Beichuan fault and Pengguan fault have accommodated significant differential exhumation across faults by thrusting activity and associated denudation, with a greater amount of differential exhumation across faults from north to south. We suggest that the major cause for the rapid exhumation of the Longmenshan range during the Late Cenozoic is the thrusting activities superimposed upon the regional uplift of the Tibet Plateau, not necessary the channel flow within the lower crust.

84857549266	Spatial variation in Meso-Cenozoic exhumation history of the Longmen Shan thrust belt (eastern Tibetan Plateau) and the adjacent western Sichuan basin: Constraints from fission track thermochronology	The NE-trending Longmen Shan thrust belt, marking the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau adjacent to the Sichuan basin, is characterized by the paradox of high topographic gradients but low convergence rates, and thus critical for understanding of geodynamic processes involved in the eastward growth of the plateau. Many low-temperature thermochronological studies focused on the central and southern portions of the Longmen Shan and western Sichuan basin to investigate the Cenozoic exhumation history of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, but little work has been done on their northern portions. Furthermore, the spatial variation in both Cenozoic and Mesozoic thermal histories of this region has been poorly documented. In this paper, zircon (ZFT) and apatite (AFT) fission track analyses for samples collected from three transects and three boreholes covering the northern, central and southern Longmen Shan and the western Sichuan basin provide new data demonstrating several cooling events in this region since the Indosinian deformation. They occurred during the late Triassic (∼200. Ma), at the end of early Cretaceous (∼100. Ma), during the early Cenozoic (60-40. Ma), the early Miocene (20-25. Ma) and the late Miocene (9-14. Ma), respectively. On regional scale the Longmen Shan experienced a slow cooling between the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, followed by a rapid cooling during the late Cenozoic, when the rapid regional exhumation began at ∼10. Ma, with a sharp increase in exhumation rate from <0.1. mm/yr to >0.2. mm/yr, up to 0.9. mm/yr locally. Comparison of ZFT and AFT ages shows that during the Mesozoic the northern segment of the Longmen Shan belt cooled more rapidly than the central and southern segments, while younger AFT ages indicate more rapid exhumation in central and southern segments of the belt during the late Cenozoic. Similar trend is demonstrated within the western Sichuan basin, where the onset of exhumation changes from ∼45. Ma in the northern portion to 20-25. Ma in the central and southern portions of the basin. The thermochronological data reveal that the Yingxiu-Beichuan and Guanxian-Anxian faults have accommodated significant differential exhumation by thrusting activity and associated denudation, with a greater amount of differential exhumation from north to south. We propose that the major cause for the rise in topography and rapid exhumation in the Longmen Shan thrust belt during the late Cenozoic is the thrusting activities integrated with the regional uplift of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, a process unrelated to the channel flow within the lower crust. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84862021112	Stratigraphical correlation of the Liuchapo Formation with the Dengying Formation in South China	The Liuchapo Formation, composed dominantly of silicalite, is widespread in Hunan, Guizhou and Chongqing pvorvinces, South China. In the Liuchapo Formation, there is a dolomite bed of varied thickness and/or a mud-siltstone bed overlaid by a 0-10 cm thick purple mudrock horizon. The Wulingshan Biota, a macrobiota, occurs in a black shales intercalated in siliceous rocks below the dolomite bed at Taoyuan, western Hunan Province. This macrobiota is similar to the Miaohe Biota from western Hubei and the Wenghui Biota from northwestern Guizhou provinces in morphological type, assembled features, and their buried and preserved characters. But comparing the late two macrobiotas, the Wulingshan Biota is poor in dichotomous macroalgae and is comparatively simpler in the structures and lower in evolution. It is regarded as the Late Doushantuoian of the Ediacaran (Sinian). In that case, the dolomite bed or the mud-siltstone bed in the Liuchapo Formation is regarded as an indication of a see-level falling and crust rising in deeper sea area during the Dengyingxiaian period. The sedimentary age of the Liuchapo Formation in Hunan and Guizhou is from the Ediacaran (Sinian) Doushantuoian to the Early Early Cambrian.

84862657047	Late paleozoic sedimentary filling and gas accumulation in the north Ordos basin	To reveal the nature gas accumulation regularity of Late Paleozoic in Ordos basin, based on the datum of field outcrops, drilling core, well log, seismic inversion, and sample analysis, this paper analyzes the coupling of "provenance-transportation-aggregation" and sandy accumulation in the sedimentary filling process, which shows that there were multi-provenances and several river systems during Late Paleozoic in the north of Ordos intercontinental basin and the broad and gentle slope palaeogeography and frequently migrating shallow water delta resulted in the stereoNET-blanket sand body. What's more, the sequence division of the Upper Paleozoic stratigraphy is proposed, and the history of basin evolution and sedimentary filling is analyzed, on basis of which is concluded that the stereoNET-blanket sand body formed by the distributary channels of braided river delta system or meandering river delta system benefited the gas migration and accumulation deposited in the period SLSC3-SLSC4 of Ordos basin transforming from marine to land, the mudstone of anastomosed river delta and shallow lake system founded the regional cover, and the coal of Taiyuan Formation and Shanxi Formation is the source rock.

84862850721	Sedimentary filling characteristics and evolution process from permian to middle triassic in south guizhou and middle guangxi	Based on identifying the sequence surface and analyzing the sequence stratigraphy of outcrops and well data, this paper regularized the stratigraphie classification of different facies from Permian to middle Triassic in south Guizhou and middle Guangxi. The Permian-middle Triassic strata in the study area can be divided into 2 super sequences and 19 third-order sequences. Taking super sequence system tracts as the mapping units, the authors drew the tectonic-sequence lithofacies paleogeographic map, which shows depositional facies distribution pattern of different stages from Permian to middle Triassic. This paper analyzed the filling processes at three evolution stages from Permian to middle Triassic in the study area, i.e., stage of rift valley basin of passive margin, stage of rift valley basin of back-arc, stage of foreland basin. On such a basis, a model of sedimentary filling and dynamic evolution during the process of relative sea level change was constructed, which shows that the lowstand period was the alternate basin -upheaval stage, the transgression period was the formation stage of alternate platform-basin, and the highstand period was the typical sedimentary pattern of alternate platform-basin during the period of the passive continental margin rift basin and the backarc rift basin from Permian to middle Triassic in south Guizhou and middle Guangxi. From middle Triassic, affected by Indosinian movement, the sedimentary pattern of alternate platform -basin was ended and transformed into the sedimentation of turbidite of foreland basin.

84863012057	Provenance and sandy accumulation regularity of Neopaleozoic in North Ordos Basin	The Neopaleozoic lithostratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoir is a hot spot of exploration in Ordos Basin. In order to recognize the relationship between sedimentary filling and large-area reservoirs distribution, based on abundant data of outcrops and well-drillings, the characteristics of provenance and sand body of upper Paleozoic in north Ordos Basin were researched.The results show that during the period of Benxi and Taiyuan, clastics supply was inadequate, and the margin of epeiric sea was filled by small-sized tide dominate delta and broadly tide flat. During the period of Shanxi and Shangshihezi, clastics supply was abundant, and Ordos intercratonic depression basin formed and sand was widely accumulated by large-scale shallow water delta. During the period of Xiashihezi of basin maturity phase, its slope gradient decreased, and mass of fine grained sediment was deposited by anastomosed river delta. The sandy accumulation system of "provenance-transportation-aggregation" ternary factors coupling charactered by multi-provenances, multi-drainage shallow water delta and gentle slope palaeogeomorphy, builded up three-dimensional netty-blanket sand-boy, formed multi and small scale lithostratigraphic trap which was of large-area distribution, made the regularity of "gas generating in the whole basin whole, gas-bearing widely, gas reservoirs controlling by lithology".

84863156335	Differential uplift process of Longmen mountain in Mesozoic-Cenozoic	Based on analysis on fission track dating of apatite and zircon in the granite and sand samples collected from the south, middle and north segment of Longmen Mountain, it is found that the uplift process of Longmen Mountain can be divided into different segments along strike direction and zones in East-West direction. From Songpan-Ganzi fold belt through Longmen thrust belt to western Sichuan foreland basin, the entire Songpan-Ganzi fold belt has experienced regional uplift, and the fission track age shows positive correlation with altitude; while in Longmen thrust belt, the fission track age has negative or no correlation with altitude, suggesting that thrust fault play a dominant role during the uplift process. However, in western Sichuan foreland basin, the samples partly or entirely annealed with burial depth. On both sides of Maoxian-Wenchuan fault, there is an obvious difference in zircon fission track age but no evident difference for apatite, suggesting that the west of Maoxian-Wenchuan fault has undergone more rapid uplift during 38-10 Ma. On both the sides of Beichuan fault, apatite shows obvious fission track age, suggesting a quick uplift process occurred in the west of Beichuan fault during 10-0 Ma. Along strike direction, zircon fission track age increases gradually from north to south part of Longmen Mountain, which may indicate a more rapid uplift process in the northern part during Late Indosinian or Early Yanshanian. Apatite fission track age generally decreases from north through middle and to south, reflecting a more rapid uplift in the middle and south than in the north during Cenezoic.

84863250506	Characteristics of the Permian sequence stratigraphy and the paleogeographic environment in South Guizhou sag, China	The Permian strata in the South Guizhou sag are well developed and the characteristics of sedimentary differentiation are significant. Therefore, the Permian strata in the South Guizhou sag are of important petroleum geological significance. This paper uses the relevant theories and research methods with the outcrop sequence stratigraphy. Based on the detailed sedimentologic investigations and refined strata division and correlation, The Permian strata from Longlinian stage to Changxing stage are divided into two incomplete super sequences and 12 third-order sequences, and the sequences are correlated. Taking the super-sequence system tract as the mapping unit, the sequence-lithofacies paleogeography map of each stage in Permian is compiled systematically and the evolutionary features of the paleogeography are discussed combined with the factors such as the sea level change, tectonic activities and characteristics of carbonate growth. The authors think that the compensation sediments in the platform-basin are good source rocks and the high energy shoal inside the carbonate platform and the high energy reef-bank association on the platform margin are favorable reservoir facies belts.

84864742345	Discussion of sedimentary environment and its geological enlightenment of shanxi formation in ordos basin	Late Paleozoic of Ordos Basin has undergone a huge change of the level, and occurred many times the transgression which, on the Benxi-Taiyuan background of epicontinental deposition by long-term studies have reached a broad consensus, while the conversion of a critical period in the sea deposition of Shanxi has a rather controversy. In view of the actual, this article was known as the starting point of previous achievement According to the distribution of marine strata, paleontology, sedimentary structures, petrography, diagenesis and other geological basis for the reference, comprehensive calculation of boron law paleosalinity, Sr/Ba ratio and boron gallium rubidium content of the relationship between the three elements of different geochemical test results, mainly for the Early Permian Shanxi Period which is the conversions of marine-continental facies sedimentary environment for a more in-depth analysis. That Shanxi 2 is still in the context of epicontinental marine sedimentation stage Shanxi 1 is the conversions of marinecontinental stage as a critical period of transition, and Xiashihezi Period before they are fully into the new evolution of continental basins stage. Establishing the geochemical proxies section of east-west and north-south in Ordos Basin. Summed up the ancient salinity and Sr/Ba ratio from south to north, from west to east, there is the general trend of decreasing. And such trends in the early and midShanxi 2 were most clearly, as the latter regression continues to expand, disappeared late in the Shanxi 1. The reason can be attributed to the ancient geography of the period and what impact the two sea water level differences. On this basis, the Ordos Basin Late Paleozoic sedimentary evolution is divided into three stages, and it is base on super long-term base level cycle eventually to the establishment of the sequence stratigraphic framework.

84864750639	Filling process and evolutionary model of sedimentary sequence of Middle-Upper Yangtze craton in Caledonian ( Cambrian-Silurian )	Guided by the idea of "tectonic-controlled basin, basin-controlled sedimentary facies, sedimentary facies-controlled source-reservoir-cap assemblage" and the principle of "process-response", namely that the basin is formed by crust-mantle coupling, plate activation and tectonic movement, and the space-time distribution of the sedimentary sequence and the fácies zone association is formed by the sedimentary and filling processes of basin, while the configuration of sedimentary sequence of different orders, the superimposed pattern of system tract and the space-time association of facies zone are closely related with the sedimentary filling process of basin. On the basis of many research and exploration results of the Middle and Upper Yangtze cratonic basin made by previous research findings, it is thought that further study on sedimentary environment, sequence configuration and the filling process of sedimentary and so on, are significantly important to deepening the understanding and oil and gas resources exploration of the researched area Therefore, relied on the sedimentary response records of the profile configuration of sedimentary sequence, the superimposed pattern of system tract and facies zone association, the sedimentary filling process of basin can be effectively revealed by analyzing the temporal and spatial variation law of these records. Specific technical route is that the tectonic-sequence ( second-order sequence) that indicates the overall characteristics of basin is considered as the basis, the sequence stratigraphy (third-order sequence) that indicates the filling framework of basin is taken as the research unit Meanwhile, the sequence configuration, superimposed modes ( above fourth-order sequence) and the distribution pattern of facies belts are taken as the research objects. Based on the division of the type and evolutionary phase of Middle and Upper Yangtze cratonic basin in Caledonian Period, this paper has analyzed the sedimentary filling process of typical basin, discussed the filling characteristics of sedimentary sequence and its difference and established the sedimentary evolution model in stages. It is found by the study that the Middle and Upper Yangtze craton in Caledonian Period is composed of two sedimentary system tracts including intracraton and craton-margin and the basin undergoes two evolutionary phases that change from extension mechanism to compression mechanism, which are composed of three stages of sedimentary filling processes including rift valley type basin, chasmic basin and depression basin. Generally, the Caledonian cratonic basin under different evolutionary phases or the basin of different types under the same evolutionary phase has different sedimentary responses including sedimentary formation type, sequence configuration and superimposed pattern of system tract, which indicates the distinguishable sedimentary filling characteristics and obviously different controlling factors. In a word, the controlling factors for the filling process of tectonic-sequence are complicated and changeable, which are composed of the structural characteristics of basement, tectonic movement, discordogenic fault, paleohigh, the change of relative sea level, climate change, provenance supply and so on, while the mutual effect and comprehensive influence of these factors are the key to form the special sequence configuration and superimposed pattern for the specific basin in specific period. Besides, the sedimentary model of each phase has inheritance and divergence characteristics in some aspects such as filling background, formation type, distribution law of facies zone, evolutionary process and controlling factors. Especially, the Middle and Upper Yangtze craton in Caledonian is characterized by the framework of uplift and depression, in which the platform edge banks, introplatform dolomite beaches and the salt and gypsumis are of great significance to preservation and accumulation of oil and gas.

84864781264	Filling process and evolutionary model of sedimentary sequence of Middle-Upper Yangtze craton in Hercynian-Indosinian ( Devonian-Middle Triassic)	Guided by the idea of ''tectonic-controlled basin, basin-controlled sedimentary facies, sedimentary facies-controlled source-reservoir-cap assemblage" and the principle of "process-response", namely that the basin is formed by crust-mantle coupling, plate activation and tectonic movement, and the space-time distribution of the sedimentary sequence and the facies zone association is formed by the sedimentary and filling processes of basin, while the configuration of sedimentary sequence of different orders, the superimposed pattern of system tract and the space-time association of facies zone are closely related with the sedimentary filling process of basin. On the basis of many research and exploration results of the Middle and Upper Yangtze cratonic basin made by previous research findings, it is thought that further study on sedimentary environment, sequence configuration and the filling process of sedimentary and so on are significantly important to deepening the understanding and oil and gas resources exploration of the researched area. Therefore, relied on the sedimentary response records of the profile configuration of sedimentary sequence, the superimposed pattern of system tract and facies zone association, the sedimentary filling process of basin can be effectively revealed by analyzing the temporal and spatial variation law of these records. Specific technical route is that the tectonic-sequence ( second-order sequence) that indicates the overall characteristics of basin is considered as the basis, the sequence stratigraphy (third-order sequence) that indicates the filling framework of basin is taken as the research unit. Meanwhile, the sequence configuration, superimposed modes ( above fourth-order sequence) and the distribution pattern of facies belts are taken as the research objects. This paper has discussed the sedimentary filling process of Middle-Upper Yangtze cratonic basin in Hercynian-Indosinian period, analyzed the filling characteristics of sedimentary sequence and its difference in typical basin and established the sedimentary evolution model in stages. It is found by the study that both the Middle and Upper Yangtze craton in Hercynian-indosinian period and Caledonian period ( see Huang et al. , 2011 ) are similarly composed of two sedimentary system tracts including intracraton and craton-margin and undergo two evolutionary phases composed of the extension phase of craton-margin and the phase changing from extension to compression, while the differences between them are the different basin types and obvious evolutionary differentiation. Generally, the sedimentary filling characteristics of typical basin indicate that the difference between the filling characteristics of the basins in different periods depends on the change of the controlling factors of sedimentary filling process, and the controlling effect of each factor varies with time and place. Consequendy, the controlling factors for the filling process of tectonic-sequence are complicated and changeable, which are composed of synsedimentary fault, palaeogeographic pattern, palaeohigh, the change of productivity of carbonate, the change of relative sea level, the tectonic characteristics of basement, tectonic movement and so on. Additionally, all these controlling factors can control the development of the sedimentary sequence by influencing some aspects of the sedimentary filling process of sequence including the boundary condition, palaeogeographic background, sedimentary environment, provenance property, sequence configuration and superimposed pattern, which is the basic reason for the difference of the filling characteristics of sedimentary sequence. Basically, the sedimentary model of each phase has distinguishable filling background, sedimentary formation type, distribution law of facies zone, evolutionary process and controlling factors. Especially, the middle and upper Yangtze eraron in hercynian-indosinian is characterized by the framework of upliftdepression in introplatform and platform-basin in platform edge, in which the high energy environment of introplatform and platform edge provide a good material basis for the development of the high-quality reservoirs, such as the reef-beach, and the low energy environment of introplatform and interplatform basin for the high efficiency seal rocks and the better source rocks.

In this paper, characteristics of sequence stratigraphy of Majiagou Formation were analyzed, sequence-based lithofacies and paleogeography were also compiled by means of condensation of mapping units of sedimentary system tracts. It is indicated that the basin sedimentary evolution was controlled by the North China Sea and the Qilian Sea, with the former being an epeiric sea and the latter being an epicontinental sea. OSQ1, OSQ2, OSQ3 and OSQ5 are mainly restricted platforms in TST,and some areas are anointed lakes in HST; open platform is the main facies of OSQ4 and OSQ6 whether in TST or HST; reef and shoal are formed in HST of southwest margin.

The distribution of reservoirs is mainly controlled by depositional system, especially the reservoirs of S2 stage and H9 stage which are the main gas reservoirs in the basin and are controlled by a river-delta depositional system. The geothermal history is reconstructed and three stages of the migration of humic gas are divided according to the study of geodynamic history of the basin. It is believed that the last formation of gas pools occured in Miocene, which was characterized by long time of gas formation and supply, and by large amount of gas reserve, which were favourable conditions for the formation of large-scale humic gas field.

84871963226	Sedimentary system distribution and evolution of Permian in South Guizhou-Middle Guangxi, China	Based on the data of outcrop measurements and drilling wells and combined with the determination of thin sections, the paper analyzes the microfacies and divides Permian into 2 super sequences and 12 third-order sequences. The coast, carbonate plateau and platformal basin sedimentary systems are recognized after studying the sequence stratigraphy, sedimentary system and evolution of palaeogeography in South Guizhou and Middle Guangxi. Carbonate plateau facies is dominant in South Guizhou and platform-basin facies in Middle Guangxi. The evolution of palaeogeography in the stratigraphie framework shows that South Guizhou was a denuded area because of the affections of sealevel changing and structure uplift and Middle Guangxi was a alternate pattern of plateau and uplift in Early Permian; Carbonate plateau dominated in South Guizhou and the alternation of plateau and uplift did in Middle Guangxi because of the rising of sealevel in Middle Permian; The study area uplifted and exposed because of the Dongwu tectonic movement in the early phase of Late Permian; Carbonate plateau dominated in South Guizhou again and the alternation of plateau and uplift occurred again in Middle Guangxi because of transgression in the middle-late phase of Late Permian. The above basin structure evolution controls the reef facies distribution.

Based on the analysis of the well sections, core, thin sections and the observation of measured sections, the authors are dealt with the characteristics and genesis of the Middle Cambrian gypsum rock in Sichuan basin. Firstly, using gypsum, dolomite and clay minerals as three end members, the gypsum rocks in the basin are divided into three major categories (muddy dolomitic gypsum rock, gypsum-bearing dolomite and gupsum-bearing shale) and ten sub-categories. Secondly, based on the basic composition and structure of the sections of the gypsum rock, five typical gypsum rock section types (called the sections of the Dingshan, Gongshen, Fangshen, Jianshen and Fandian types respectively) are summarized. Based on a large number of well sections in Sichuan basin, the contour maps of gypsum rocks are drawn and they show that there are two major salt concentrated areas in the Middle Cambrian: South Sichuan-North Guizhou and Wanxian-Zhongxian. Finally, on the basis of above studies, a genetic model is established for the gypsum rocks in the basin. The mechanisms operated for the gypsum rocks in the basin are supratidal evaporation and limited salt lake behind the sand bar (beach) during the Middle Cambrian.

The results indicate that: (1) According to the analyses of the clastic constituents of sandstone and the tectonic background of provenance, there are the characteristics in study area that the ratio of quartz in sandstones increases gradually while the ratio of debris in sedimentary rocks decreases gradually from the leading edge of Longmenshan to the middle part of the basin and that the provenance is mainly Longmenshan in the west of study area, while the Micang-Daba mountains in the north contribute little. (2) There develop mainly alluvial fans, fluvial, braid river deltas, lakes sedimentary systems in Upper Jurassic Penglaizhen Formation in the middle part of the West Sichuan depression. (3) People have drawn the contour map of ratio of sandstone and the sedimentary facies diagram of Penglaizhen Formation in the middle part of the West Sichuan depression. They indicate that the sedimentary environment, sand bodies and distribution patterns in the different sedimentary periods of Panglaizhen Formation were mainly controlled by the fluctuation of lake level and the supply of provenance. In the deposition period of the first member of Penglaizhen Formation, there mainly developed alluvial fan-lake sediments in the study area. In the deposition period of the second member, the range of the alluvial fan and fluvial sediments gradually broadened, the braid river deltas sediments gradually carried forward to the lake basin, and the range of the lake sediments reduced gradually. In the deposition period of the third member, the range of alluvial fan sediments and fluvial sediments reduced gradually, while the braid river deltas sediments became wider than that in the second member, and the range of lake sediments did not change obviously. In the deposition period of the fourth member, there mainly developed fluvial, braid river deltas and lakes sediments and no alluvial fan sediments. Along with the braid river deltas sediments carrying forward to the lake basin, the range of lacustrine sediments became narrower than that in the third member.

84876428500	Hydrodynamic geology effect during the waterflooding of seriously heterogeneous reservoirs	Hu12 Block of the Huzhuangji Oilfield is a typical strongly heterogeneous reservoir. The hydrodynamic geology effect was studied by comparing experimental results of cores before and after waterflooding. The experimental results show that the chemical force of acidic medium accelerates the dissolution of plagioclase, generating new kaolinite crystals in small pore throats at the same time. The chemical force has less impact on carbonate minerals. The physical force of the injected water caused the reduction of the total content of argillaceous minerals and the loss of quartz grains of silt to very fine sizes, which occurred in layers with good physical properties and developed channeling paths. In terms of changes in pore-throats, waterflooding resulted in the increase of the large pore-throats and improvement of percolation conditions, also gives rise to the reduction of pore throat sorting and the aggravation of micro-heterogeneity of reservoir. With respect to variations in reservoir macroscopic parameters, waterflooding leads to the drop of overall average effective porosity by 4.63% and the rise of overall average effective permeability by 8.93%. The physical property changes of reservoirs of different original properties take on obvious "Matthew Effect".

The fan delta-front underwater distributary channel controls the development of sand body and fracture can improve the physical properties of reservoir, which together control the distribution and development of reservoirs. In view of the complex tectonics, and the difficult comparison between seismic horizon due to the oscillation and migration of riverway, this paper used the seismic horizon comparison based on the seismic frequency division technology, identified the distribution of underwater distributary channel according to the seismic facies and seismic attribute sections.

84879911965	Jurassic sedimentary transformation event recorded by detrital components in the middle part of western Sichuan	Sandstone is the direct record of mountain uplift in the basin, and its detrital components have a good effect in analyzing orogenic belts and tectonic setting of sedimentary provenances. Jurassic sediments were systematically investigated with four main methods, i.e., features comparison in detrital components, vertical evolution characteristics of detrital components in single well, Dickinson chart and evolution characteristics between Q/(F+L) and F/L of component maturity. Some conclusions have been reached; (1) On the basis of spatial distribution features of the detrital components of sandstones, the authors believe that the middle Jurassic Shaximiao Formation in the study area was effected by the western Longmenshan orogenic belt and the northern Micang-Daba orogenic belt simultaneously. (2) According to the vertical correlation of the detrital components and the analysis of compositional maturity of sandstones in a single well, the authors have found that near the boundary between Qianfoya Formation and Shaximiao Formation, the provenance had a significant change, suggesting that there existed an important sedimentary transformation event in western Sichuan area at that time, which was closely connected with the tectonic evolution of Micang-Daba Mountain. (3) The detrital components of sandstones reflect the activity of the orogenic belts around the basin. With relatively stable structures, sandstones had a high compositional maturity from the early Jurassic to the middle Jurassic. In middle and late Middle Jurassic, due to the influence of the thrusting of the Micang-Daba Mountian, sandstones showed a low compositional maturity, and volcanic detritus increased. In the early Late Jurassic, the structures got relatively stable, and the compositional maturity of sandstones increased. Towards the late Late Jurassic, due to the influence of the Longmenshan orogenic belt in western Sichuan, the feature of sandstones became similar to that of the front sandstones in Longmenshan area.

It is showed that the Yangzhong rock mass has A/CNK ratios ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 3, and AR ratios from 2. 69 to 4. 28, suggesting that it belongs to typical S-type granite of orogenic granitic magma.

Trace element abundance shows that Ta, Nb, Zr, Hf is of negative abnormality while Rb,Th,Ce and Sm of obvious positive abnormality. Analysis of major element, REE elements,trace element abundance shows that the Yangzhong rock mass formed in the extensional stage of post orogenic collision environment. The study of composition of sedimentary clasts, variation of sedimentary facies and magmatic activity demonstrates that the Ailao Mountains oceanic basin ended its extension in the early to middle Permian and entered the stage of collision,which is evidenced by dating of Yangzhong rock mass with 263. 1 Ma±2. 3 Ma age.

Taking SHS area as target, by geologic analysis, we concluded six main controlling factors for the accumulation of coalbed methane, including structure pattern, coalbed thickness, lithology of overlays, sedimentary environment (coal quality), fractures development and coalbed permeability. Then, seismic structure interpretation, seismic attributes analysis, seismic acoustic impedance inversion, seismic facies analysis, ESP fracture detection technique and seismic elastic parameters inversion is chosen to separately analyze the above controlling factors. After setting weight coefficients of prediction results of all the seismic techniques, AHP evaluation is conducted to realize the comprehensive prediction of coalbed methane enrichment zone of SHS region and the prediction result shows good consistency with well drilling data.

84884256385	Sedimentary and burial environment of black shales of Sinian to Early Palaeozoic in Upper Yangtze region	Black shales within the Sinian (Ediacaran) to Early Paleozoic strata from Upper Yangtze region are the three high quality source rocks of Sinian to Early Paleozoic marine Lower Assemblage in South China, which are generally thought to be the result of deposition under stagnant and suboxic conditions. According to the information of sedimentary structure and biological, ecological patterns, the sedimentary environment and burial condition of these black shales are discussed. The benthonic organisms and abundant natant organisms indicate that there were, in the sedimentary environment of black shales, an oxic upper-water in where abundant organisms lived and repropagated to provide organic-rich matters for deposits, and a suboxic or dysoxic bottom-water in where the decomposition of organic-matters were weakened and/or baffled for the preservation of organic-rich matters. In addition, the sedimentary structures formed by water-energy (e. g. the ranking orientation of fossils and their fragments, the oblique bedding in nonblack-shale rocks intercalated in black shales) show that there were measure of water-energy or an periodic and intermittent hydroenergy in the bottom-water. The water-energy was able to promote the oxygenic diffusion in bottom-water for the benthonic organisms. With the increase of the water-rich muddy deposits, the oxygen-exchanging efficiency between the deposited water and sea-water was weakening to intensify the stagnation and reduction of the deposited water inner deposits. Simultaneously, the organic-rich matter (e. g. organismic corpses and excreta) buried by deposits were decaying and decomposing to advance the reduction around them, so that the organic-rich matter were preserved to form the black shales.

84883569007	Paleokarstification in carbonates of 4th Member of Middle Triassic Leikoupo Formation in northeastern Sichuan basin and its petroleum geological significance	The hydrocarbon breakthrough in the 4th member of the Leikoupo Formation shows important geological significance for petroleum exploration. Based on comprehensive analyses composed of outcrop and drill-core observations, thin-section petrographic examinations, well log analysis, fluid inclusion studies, and carbon, oxygen, strontium isotopic composition measurements, the authors divided paleokarst faces of the study area into six types, i.e., surface eluvium, speleothem composed of break-down clasts, fillings from underground rivers, crack of base rock, solution of base rock, and dissolution and replacement of base rock. According to hydrodynamic conditions, the paleokarstification can be divided in descending order into surface-karst zone, vertical vadose zone, horizontal phreatic zone and deep-karst zone. Using the impression method and based on the distribution characteristics of relict stratum, the authors restored palaeokarst geomorphology for the 4th Member of the Leikoupo Formation and presented more details of micro-geomorphology for Yuanba area. It is held that karst slope is the most advantageous geomorphic unit for the formation of reservoirs, with the most favorable place being middle-upper slope. Karst hammock is the most advantageous micro-geomorphic units for the formation of reservoirs. Paleokarstification plays an important role in the reservoir formation of 4th Member of Leikoupo Formation and its features control the distribution of favorable reservoirs in both vertical and planar directions.

0043076256	The delta depositional system distribution of late Paleozoic era in Ordos basin	It has been proved by oil and gas exploration that most oil and gas resources occur in the sandbodies of the delta depositional system in Ordos basin. Therefore, it is very important to study the feature of plane distribution of the delta depositional system in Neopaleozoic. According to a quantity of drive well materials, this paper makes a deep study of the late Paleozoic delta depositional system in Ordos basin. The result indicates that it can be divided into two stages. The first stage is the late Carbonic Benxi period - early Dias Taiyuan period, and it is delta depositional system of marine facies. The second stage is the early Permian Shanxi period - late Permian Shiqianfeng period, and it is delta depositional system of lake facies. There are differences in the development background, composition of facies zone, type of sandbodies between these two kinds of the delta depositional systems. On the basis of the above, the paper discusses the feature of plane distribution of the delta depositional system. It is very useful for future oil and gas exploration.

84890242058	Shale gas exploration potential and direction of Qianfoya Formation in West Sichuan and North Sichuan, China	The shale rich in organic mass is widely developed in Middle Jurassic Qianfoya Formation of West Sichuan and North Sichuan. Its buried depth is relatively shallow and can be used as favorable continental shale gas exploration strata in Sichuan Basin. Based on the petrophysical analysis of core data and log data, the electrical standard to indentify the shale rich in organic mass is established. The thickness and depth distribution map of shale rich in organic mass made by using the statistics and division results and sedimentary background shows that the shale thickness is generally 70 m, the depth is mainly 2 km and the distribution is relatively stable. This set of shale has good conditions to form shale gas reservoirs. The organic mass types of the shale are mainly Type II and Type III, few Type I. The abundance of organic matter is generally low, but higher in the area between Langzhong, Nanchong and Chengdu in the central region and in the area from Dazhu to Liangping in the southwestern region. The mass fraction is generally more than 1.5%. The evolution of organic matter (R

84890378475	Salt tectonics and basin evolution in the Gabon Coastal Basin, West Africa	The Gabon Coastal Basin is a typical saliferous basin located in the middle portion of the West African passive continental margin. Complex salt tectonics make sedimentary sequences and structural frameworks difficult to interpret and can lead to difficulties in construction of balanced cross-sections and reconstruction of basin evolutionary processes. Sedimentary facies and salt structural patterns displaying zonation are based on seismic reflection profiles and drilling data. Two near-vertical fault systems, NW-SE and NE-SW, caused basin to be subdivided E-W zoning and N-S partitioning. Scarp slopes and extension faults formed in the Hinge belt III zone where salt diapir piercement occurred and numbers of salt pillars, salt stocks and salt rollers developed under transtension of coupled near-orthogonal fault systems. The zone east of Hinge belt III is characterized by small-scale salt domes and salt pillows. To the west are large-scale salt walls and salt bulge anticlines caused by diapirism promoted by tension and torsion that also resulted in formation of numerous salt pillars, salt stocks and salt rollers. Our modeling of salt tectonic structures indicates that they were produced by plastic rheological deformation of salt under regional stress fields that varied during three distinct phases of extension, compression and re-activation. Hinge belt III was active from Coniacian to Early Eocene, which was a critical period of formation of salt structures when many extension-related salt structures formed and salt diapirism controlled the distribution of turbidite fans. Rootless extrusion-related salt stocks developed throughout the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene as a result of local ephemeral low-intensity tectonic inversion. Post Oligocene salt diapirism was weak and salt tectonics had a weak influence on sedimentation. Balanced cross-sections of two saliferous horizons crossing different tectonic units from east to west reveal that the basin tectonic evolution and sediment filling processes can be divided into three stages containing seven episodes of rifting, transition and drifting. © 2013 China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
