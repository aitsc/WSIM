0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0910.0015	hierarchical models of high redshift galaxies with thermally pulsing  asymptotic giant branch stars: comparison with observations	in a recent paper we presented the first semi-analytic model of galaxyformation in which the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase ofstellar evolution has been fully implemented. here we address the comparisonwith observations, and show how the tp-agb recipe affects the performance ofthe model in reproducing the colours and near-ir luminosities of high-redshiftgalaxies. we find that the semi-analytic model with the tp-agb better matchesthe colour-magnitude and colour-colour relations at z ~ 2, both fornearly-passive and for star-forming galaxies. the model with tp-agb producesstar-forming galaxies with red v-k colours, thus revising the uniqueinterpretation of high-redshift red objects as 'red &amp; dead'. we also show thatwithout the tp-agb the semi-analytic model fails at reproducing the observedcolours, a situation that cannot be corrected by dust reddening. we alsoexplore the effect of nebular emission on the predicted colour-magnituderelation of star-forming galaxies, to conclude that it does not play asignificant role in reddening their colours, at least in the range ofstar-formation rates covered by the model. finally, the rest-frame k-bandluminosity function at z ~ 2.5 is more luminous by almost 1 magnitude. thisindicates that the agn feedback recipe that is adopted to regulate thehigh-mass end of the luminosity function should be sophisticated to take theeffect of the stellar populations into account at high redshifts.

0912.0259	environment and self-regulation in galaxy formation	the environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxiesconsiderably best visible through the well-known morphology-densityrelationship. in this paper we study the effect of environment on the evolutionof early-type galaxies by analysing the stellar population properties of 3,360galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the sdss in theredshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.06. we find that the distribution of ages is bimodalwith a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ~2.5gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. this is analogue to 'redsequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containingboth early and late type galaxies. the fraction of the young, rejuvenatedgalaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasingenvironmental density up to about 45 per cent. the rejuvenated galaxies havelower alpha/fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoingstar formation through their emission line spectra. all objects that host agnin their centres without star formation are part of the red sequencepopulation. we confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results thatluminosity weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha/fe element ratios of the redsequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass.most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive toenvironmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. we infer thatearly-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billionyears ago around z~0.2. a self-regulated formation phase without environmentaldependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which theenvironment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy interactions.

1003.5214	empirical calibrations of optical absorption line indices based on the  stellar library miles	stellar population models of absorption line indices are an important toolfor the analysis of stellar population spectra. they are most accuratelymodelled through empirical calibrations of absorption line indices with thestellar parameters effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity, theso-called fitting functions. here we present new empirical fitting functionsfor the 25 optical lick absorption line indices based on the new stellarlibrary miles. the major improvements with respect to the lick/ids library arethe better sampling of stellar parameter space, a generally higher signal-to-noise, and a careful flux calibration. in fact we find that errors onindividual index measurements in miles are considerably smaller than inlick/ids. instead we find the rms of the residuals between the final fittingfunctions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters. weprovide fitting functions for both lick/ids and miles spectral resolutions, andcompare our results with other fitting functions in the literature. a fortran90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellarpopulation models. we further calculate the offsets in index measurementsbetween the lick/ids system to a flux calibrated system. for this purpose weuse the three libraries miles, elodie, and stelib. we find that offsets arenegligible in some cases, most notably for the widely used indices hbeta, mgb,fe5270, and fe5335. in a number of cases, however, the difference between fluxcalibrated library and lick/ids is significant with the offsets depending onindex strengths. interestingly, there is no general agreement between the threelibraries for a large number of indices, which hampers the derivation of auniversal offset between the lick/ids and flux calibrated systems.

1006.0229	the hierarchical build-up of the tully-fisher relation	we use the semi-analytic model galics to predict the tully-fisher relation inthe b, i and for the first time, in the k band, and its evolution withredshift, up to z~1. we refined the determination of the disk galaxies rotationvelocity, with a dynamical recipe for the rotation curve, rather than a simpleconversion from the total mass to maximum velocity. the new recipe takes intoaccount the disk shape factor, and the angular momentum transfer occurringduring secular evolution leading to the formation of bulges. this producesmodel rotation velocities that are lower by ~20-25% for the majority of thespirals. we implemented stellar population models with a complete treatment ofthe tp-agb, which leads to a revision of the mass-to-light ratio in thenear-ir. i/k band luminosities increase by ~0.3/0.5 mags at redshift z=0 and by~0.5/1 mags at z=3. with these two new recipes in place, the comparison betweenthe predicted tully-fisher relation with a series of datasets in the opticaland near-ir, at redshifts between 0 and 1, is used as a diagnostics of theassembly and evolution of spiral galaxies in the model. at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2 the matchbetween the new model and data is remarkably good, especially for later-typespirals (sb/sc). at z=0 the new model shows a net improvement in comparisonwith its original version of 2003, and in accord with recent observations inthe k band, the model tully-fisher also shows a morphological differentiation.however, in all bands the z=0 model tully-fisher is too bright. we argue thatthis behaviour is caused by inadequate star formation histories in the modelgalaxies at low redshifts. the star-formation rate declines too slowly, due tocontinuous gas infall that is not efficiently suppressed. an analysis of themodel disk scale lengths, at odds with observations, hints to some missingphysics in the modeling of disk formation inside dark matter halos.

1009.1392	the effect of thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars on the  evolution of the rest-frame near-infrared galaxy luminosity function	we address the fundamental question of matching the rest-frame k-bandluminosity function (lf) of galaxies over the hubble time using semi-analyticmodels, after modification of the stellar population modelling. we include themaraston evolutionary synthesis models, that feature a higher contribution bythe thermally pulsating - asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) stellar phase, intothree different semi-analytic models, namely the de lucia and blaizot versionof the munich model, morgana and the menci model. we leave all other inputphysics and parameters unchanged. we find that the modification of the stellarpopulation emission can solve the mismatch between models and the observedrest-frame k-band luminosity from the brightest galaxies derived from ukidssdata at high redshift. for all explored semi-analytic models this holds at theredshifts - between 2 and 3 - where the discrepancy was recently pointed out.the reason for the success is that at these cosmic epochs the model galaxieshave the right age (~1 gyr) to contain a well-developed tp-agb phase whichmakes them redder without the need of changing their mass or age. at the sametime, the known overestimation of the faint end is enhanced in the k-band whenincluding the tp-agb contribution. at lower redshifts (z&lt;2) some of theexplored models deviate from the data. this is due to too short mergingtimescales and inefficient 'radio-mode' agn feedback. our results show that astrong evolution in mass predicted by hierarchical models is compatible with noevolution on the bright-end of the k-band lf from z=3 to the local universe.this means that, at high redshifts and contrary to what is commonly accepted,k-band emission is not necessarily a good tracer of galaxy mass.

1010.4569	flux-calibrated stellar population models of lick absorption-line  indices with variable element abundance ratios	we present new stellar population models of lick absorption-line indices withvariable element abundance ratios. the models are based on our new calibrationsof absorption-line indices with stellar parameters derived from the milesstellar library. the key novelty compared to our previous models is that theyare now available at the higher spectral resolution of miles (~2.7a fwhm) andflux-calibrated, hence not tied anymore to the lick/ids system. this isessential for the interpretation of galaxy spectra where calibration stars arenot available, such as large galaxy redshift surveys or other high-redshiftobservations. we note that the miles resolution appears to be comparable tosdss resolution, so that our models can be applied to sdss data without anycorrections for instrumental spectral resolution. for the first time we providerandom errors for the model predictions based on the uncertainties in thecalibration functions and the underlying stellar parameter estimates. we showthat random errors are small except at the edges of the parameter space(high/low metallicities and young ages &lt;1 gyr) where the stellar library isunder-sampled. we calibrate the base model for the parameters age, metallicityand alpha/fe ratio with galactic globular cluster and galaxy gradient data. wediscuss two model flavours with different input stellar evolutionary tracksfrom the frascati and padova groups. the new model release now includesabundance variations of the elements c, n, mg, na, si, ca, ti, cr, and fe. theindividual elements that are best accessible with these models and the standardset of lick absorption features are c, n, mg, ca, ti, and fe. the model data isavailable at www.icg.port.ac.uk/~thomasd.

1010.4570	chemical abundance ratios of galactic globular clusters from modelling  integrated light spectroscopy	we use our new, flux-calibrated stellar population model of absorption-lineindices to derive ages, metallicities, and various element abundance ratiosfrom integrated light spectroscopy of galactic globular clusters. the agesagree well with the literature and are all consistent with the age of theuniverse. there is a considerable scatter, though, and we obtain systematicallylarger ages than cmd determinations mostly for metal-rich globular clusters.the metallicities agree well with literature values on the zinn &amp; west scale,if we adopt iron abundance [fe/h] for those clusters whose ages agree with thecmd ages. it turns out that the derivation of individual element abundanceratios is not reliable at [fe/h]&lt;-1 dex, while the [alpha/fe] ratio is robustat all metallicities. we find general enhancement of light and alpha elements,as expected, with significant variations for some elements. the elements o andmg follow the same general enhancement with almost identical distributions of[o/fe] and [mg/fe]. we obtain slightly lower [c/fe] and very high [n/fe]ratios, instead. this chemical anomaly, commonly attributed to self-enrichment,is well known in globular clusters from individual stellar spectroscopy. it isthe first time that this pattern is obtained also from the integrated light.the alpha elements follow a pattern such that the heavier elements ca and tiare less enhanced. more specifically, the [ca/fe] and [ti/fe] ratios are lowerthan [o/fe] and [mg/fe] by about 0.2 dex. this trend is also seen in recentdeterminations of element abundances in globular cluster and field stars of themilky way. this suggests that type ia supernovae contribute significantly tothe enrichment of the heavier alpha elements as predicted by nucleosynthesiscalculations and galactic chemical evolution models.

1101.1529	sdss-iii: massive spectroscopic surveys of the distant universe, the  milky way galaxy, and extra-solar planetary systems	building on the legacy of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-i and ii),sdss-iii is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the milkyway, and the population of giant planets around other stars. in keeping withsdss tradition, sdss-iii will provide regular public releases of all its data,beginning with sdss dr8 (which occurred in jan 2011). this paper presents anoverview of the four sdss-iii surveys. boss will measure redshifts of 1.5million massive galaxies and lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using thebao feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations ofthe distance scale and hubble expansion rate at z&lt;0.7 and at z~2.5. segue-2,which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (r=1800) optical spectra of118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matterhalo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. apogee will obtainhigh-resolution (r~30,000), high signal-to-noise (s/n&gt;100 per resolutionelement), h-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the firsthigh-precision spectroscopic survey of all galactic stellar populations (bulge,bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectraldiagnostics. marvels will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 fgk starswith the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed todetect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedenteddata set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giantplanet systems.

1101.1559	the eighth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first data from  sdss-iii	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) started a new phase in august 2008, withnew instrumentation and new surveys focused on galactic structure and chemicalevolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering ofgalaxies and the quasar ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search forplanets around ~8000 stars. this paper describes the first data release ofsdss-iii (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the sdss). the releaseincludes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the southern galactic cap,bringing the total footprint of the sdss imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over athird of the celestial sphere. all the imaging data have been reprocessed withan improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometricrecalibration and flat-field determination. this release also includes all datafrom the second phase of the sloan extension for galactic understanding andevolution (segue-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 starsat both high and low galactic latitudes. all the more than half a millionstellar spectra obtained with the sdss spectrograph have been reprocessedthrough an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determinationof metallicity for high metallicity stars.

0709.3015	observational evidence for agn feedback in early-type galaxies	a major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is theinclusion of so-called agn feedback. the energy input from an active centralmassive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxiesat later epochs. a major problem is that this process is poorly understood, andcompelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. insearch for signatures of agn feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 from the sdss database.key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterionthrough visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased againstrecent star formation and nuclear activity. the objects with emission (~20 percent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in thecolour-mass diagram. star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, whileearly-types with agn are located considerably closer to and almost on the redsequence. star formation-agn composites are found right between these twoextremes. we further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novelmethod that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-uv to near-ir andstellar absorption indices. we find that in those objects deviating from thered sequence star formation occurred several 100 myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. we identify an evolutionary sequence fromstar formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. this transition processlasts about 1 gyr, and the peak agn phase occurs roughly half a gyr after thestarburst. the most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressedby nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1106.3331	the morphology of galaxies in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic  survey	we study the morphology of luminous and massive galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.7targeted in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) using publiclyavailable hubble space telescope imaging from cosmos. our sample (240 objects)provides a unique opportunity to check the visual morphology of these galaxieswhich were targeted based solely on stellar population modelling. we find thatthe majority (74+/-6%) possess an early-type morphology (elliptical or s0),while the remainder have a late-type morphology. this is as expected from thegoals of the boss target selection which aimed to predominantly select slowlyevolving galaxies, for use as cosmological probes, while still obtaining a fairfraction of actively star forming galaxies for galaxy evolution studies. weshow that a colour cut of (g-i)&gt;2.35 selects a sub-sample of boss galaxies with90% early-type morphology - more comparable to the earlier luminous red galaxy(lrg) samples of sdss-i/ii. the remaining 10% of galaxies above this cut have alate-type morphology and may be analogous to the "passive spirals" found atlower redshift. we find that 23+/-4% of the early-type galaxies are unresolvedmultiple systems in the sdss imaging. we estimate that at least 50% of theseare real associations (not projection effects) and may represent a significant"dry merger" fraction. we study the sdss pipeline sizes of boss galaxies whichwe find to be systematically larger (by 40%) than those measured from hstimages, and provide a statistical correction for the difference. these detailsof the boss galaxies will help users of the data fine-tune their selectioncriteria, dependent on their science applications. for example, the main goalof boss is to measure the cosmic distance scale and expansion rate of theuniverse to percent-level precision - a point where systematic effects due tothe details of target selection may become important.

1108.4719	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z=0.6: i. a new method for  physical parameter estimation	we use principal component analysis (pca) to estimate stellar masses, meanstellar ages, star formation histories (sfhs), dust extinctions and stellarvelocity dispersions for ~290,000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than$10^{11}msun and redshifts in the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss). we find the fraction of galaxies with active starformation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens abovea stellar mass of 10^{11.5}msun at z~0.6. this is in striking contrast toz~0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declinesmonotonically with stellar mass. at stellar masses of 10^{12}msun, therefore,the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z~0.6 to thepresent-day reaches a factor of ~10. when we stack the spectra of the mostmassive, star-forming galaxies at z~0.6, we find that half of their [oiii]emission is produced by agns. the black holes in these galaxies are accretingon average at ~0.01 the eddington rate. to obtain these results, we use thestellar population synthesis models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) to generate alibrary of model spectra with a broad range of sfhs, metallicities, dustextinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. the pca is run on this library toidentify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range3700-5500a. we demonstrate that linear combinations of these components canrecover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the4000a break strength and hda, with greatly improved s/n. this method is able torecover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellarage, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low s/n bossspectra. we examine the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the inputparameters in our model library and the different stellar population synthesismodels.

1109.0543	stellar population models at high spectral resolution	we present new, high-to-intermediate spectral resolution stellar populationmodels, based on four popular libraries of empirical stellar spectra, namelypickles, elodie, stelib and miles. these new models are the same as ourprevious models, but with higher resolution and based on empirical stellarspectra, while keeping other ingredients the same including the stellarenergetics, the atmospheric parameters and the treatment of thethermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch and the horizontal branchmorphology. we further compute very high resolution (r=20,000) models based onthe theoretical stellar library marcs which extends to the near-infrared. wetherefore provide merged high resolution stellar population models, extendingfrom ~1000 aa to 25,000 aa. we compare how these libraries perform in stellarpopulation models and highlight spectral regions where discrepancies are found.we confirm our previous findings that the flux around the v-band is lower (in anormalised sense) in models based on empirical libraries than in those based onthe basel-kurucz library, which results in a bluer b-v colour. most noticeablythe theoretical library marcs gives results fully consistent with the empiricallibraries. this same effect is also found in other models using miles, namelyvazdekis et al. and conroy &amp; gunn, even though the latter authors reach theopposite conclusion. the bluer predicted b-v colour (by 0.05 magnitudes in ourmodels) is in better agreement with both the colours of luminous red galaxiesand globular cluster data. we test the models on their ability to reproduce,through full spectral fitting, the ages and metallicities of galactic globularclusters as derived from cmd fitting and find overall good agreement.{abridged}

1112.0322	chemical element ratios of sdss early-type galaxies	we discuss chemical enrichments of ~4000 sdss early-type galaxies using astracers the element abundance ratios [c/fe], [n/fe], [o/fe], [mg/fe], [ca/fe]and [ti/fe]. we utilise the stellar population models of absorption lineindices from thomas, maraston &amp; johansson (2011) which are based on the milesstellar library. we confirm previous results of increasing age, [z/h] and[o/fe] ratios (most often represented by [{\alpha}/fe] in the literature) withvelocity dispersion. we further derive identical correlations with velocitydispersion for the abundance ratios [o/fe], [mg/fe] and [c/fe], implying thatc/mg and c/o are close to solar values. this sets a lower limit on theformation time-scales and star-burst components of early-type galaxies to ~0.4gyr, which is the lifetime of a 3msun star, since the full c enrichment must bereached. [n/fe] correlates with velocity dispersion, but offset to lower valuesand with a steeper slope compared to the other element ratios. we do not findany environmental dependencies for the abundances of c and n, contrary toprevious reports in the literature. [fe/h] does not correlate with velocitydispersion over the entire parameter range covered, but for fixed age we find asteep trend for the [fe/h]-{\sigma} relation. this trend is weaker than theanalogous for total metallicity (which also shows steeper trends at fixed age)owing to the lower fe contribution from sn ia for more massive early-typegalaxies. we find [ca/fe] ratios that are close to solar values over the entirevelocity dispersion range covered. tentative, due to large scatter, the resultsfor [ti/fe] indicate that ti follows the trends of ca. this implies asignificant contribution from sn ia to the enrichment of heavy{\alpha}-elements and puts strong constraints on supernova nucleosynthesis andmodels of galactic chemical evolution.

1201.2988	the boss emission-line lens survey. ii. investigating mass-density  profile evolution in the slacs+bells strong gravitational lens sample	we present an analysis of the evolution of the central mass-density profileof massive elliptical galaxies from the slacs and bells strong gravitationallens samples over the redshift interval z ~ 0.1-0.6, based on the combinationof strong-lensing aperture mass and stellar velocity-dispersion constraints. wefind a significant trend towards steeper mass profiles (parameterized by thepower-law density model with rho ~ r^[-gamma]) at later cosmic times, withmagnitude d&lt;gamma&gt;/dz = -0.60 +/- 0.15. we show that the combined lens-galaxysample is consistent with a non-evolving distribution of stellar velocitydispersions. considering possible additional dependence of &lt;gamma&gt; onlens-galaxy stellar mass, effective radius, and sersic index, we find marginalevidence for shallower mass profiles at higher masses and larger sizes, butwith a significance that is sub-dominant to the redshift dependence. using theresults of published monte carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys, weverify that our mass-profile evolution result cannot be explained by lensingselection biases as a function of redshift. interpreted as a true evolutionarysignal, our result suggests that major dry mergers involving off-axistrajectories play a significant role in the evolution of the averagemass-density structure of massive early-type galaxies over the past 6 gyr. wealso consider an alternative non-evolutionary hypothesis based on variations inthe strong-lensing measurement aperture with redshift, which would imply thedetection of an "inflection zone" marking the transition between thebaryon-dominated and dark-matter halo-dominated regions of the lens galaxies.further observations of the combined slacs+bells sample can constrain thispicture more precisely, and enable a more detailed investigation of themultivariate dependences of galaxy mass structure across cosmic time.

1202.6241	the progenitors of present-day massive red galaxies up to z ~ 0.7 -  finding passive galaxies using sdss-i/ii and sdss-iii	we present a comprehensive study of 250,000 galaxies targeted by the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) up to z ~ 0.7 with the specific goal ofidentifying and characterising a population of galaxies that has evolvedwithout significant merging. we compute a likelihood that each boss galaxy is aprogenitor of the luminous red galaxies (lrgs) sample, targeted by sdss-i/ii upz ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of lrgs and their inferred star-formationhistories, metallicity histories and dust content. we determine merger rates,luminosity growth rates and the evolution of the large-scale clustering betweenthe two surveys, and we investigate the effect of using different stellarpopulation synthesis models in our conclusions. we demonstrate that our sampleis slowly evolving (of the order of 2 +/- 1.5% per gyr by merging). ourconclusions refer to the bright and massive end of the galaxy population, withmi0.55 &lt; -22, and m* &gt; 1e11.2 msolar, corresponding roughly to 95% and 40% ofthe lrgs and boss galaxy populations, respectively. our analysis further showsthat any possible excess of flux in boss galaxies, when compared to lrgs, frompotentially unresolved targets at z ~ 0.55 must be less than 1% in ther0.55-band (approximately equivalent to the g-band in the rest-frame ofgalaxies at z=0.55). when weighting the boss galaxies based on the predictedproperties of the lrgs, and restricting the analysis to the reddest bossgalaxies, we find an evolution of the large-scale clustering that is consistentwith dynamical passive evolution, assuming a standard cosmology. we concludethat our likelihoods give a weighted sample that is as clean and as close topassive evolution (in dynamical terms, i.e. no or negligible merging) aspossible, and that is optimal for cosmological studies.

1203.3548	recovering galaxy stellar population properties from broad-band spectral  energy distribution fitting	(abridged) we explore the dependence of galaxy stellar population propertiesderived from broad-band sed-fitting - such as age, stellar mass, dustreddening, etc. - on a variety of parameters, such as sfhs, metallicity, imf,dust reddening and reddening law, and wavelength coverage. mock galaxies serveas test particles. we confirm our earlier results based on real z=2 galaxies,that usually adopted \tau-models lead to overestimate the sfr and tounderestimate the stellar mass. here, we show that - for star-forming galaxies- ages, masses and reddening, can be well determined simultaneously only whenthe correct sfh is identified. this is the case for inverted-\tau-models athigh-z, for which we find that the mass recovery (at fixed imf) is as good as~0.04 dex. since the right sfh is usually unknown we quantify offsets generatedby adopting standard fitting setups. stellar masses are generallyunderestimated resulting from underestimating ages. for fitting setups with avariety of sfhs the median mass recovery at z ~ 2-3 is as decent as ~0.1 dex,albeit with large scatter. the situation worsens towards lower redshiftsbecause of the variety of possible sfhs and ages (~0.6 dex at z=0.5). apractical trick to improve upon this is to exclude reddening from the fittingto avoid unrealistically young and dusty solutions. reddening and sfrs shouldthen be determined by a separate fit. as expected, the recovery of propertiesis better for passive galaxies. for the two galaxy types the parameter recoveryis optimal for a wavelength coverage from the rest-frame uv to the rest-framenear-ir. we quantify the effect of narrowing the wavelength coverage oradding/removing filters which can be useful for planning observational surveys.finally, we provide scaling relations that allow the transformation of stellarmasses obtained using different template fitting setups and stellar populationmodels.

1207.6114	stellar masses of sdss-iii boss galaxies at z~0.5 and constraints to  galaxy formation models	we calculate stellar masses for massive luminous galaxies at redshift 0.2-0.7using the first two years of data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energydistributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies areused to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. accurateboss spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. we find that thedistribution of stellar masses in boss is narrow (delta log m~0.5 dex) andpeaks at about logm ~ 11.3 (for a kroupa initial stellar mass function), andthat the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, inagreement with the intended boss target selection. the galaxy masses probed byboss extend over ~10^{12} m, providing unprecedented measurements of thehigh-mass end of the galaxy mass function. we find that the galaxy numberdensity above ~ 2.5 10^{11} m agrees with previous determinations. we perform acomparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the bosstarget selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. the abundanceof massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the boss data, butthe models lack galaxies at the massive end. moreover, no evolution withredshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance ofmassive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. additionally, bossdata display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in thelocal universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. on the otherhand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span anarrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. we argue that thelack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly dueto metallicity, which is too low in the models.

1209.1204	the evolution of brightest cluster galaxies in a hierarchical universe	we investigate the evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) fromredshift z~1.6 to z~0. we use the semi-analytic model of croton et al. (2006)with a new spectro-photometric model based on the maraston (2005) stellarpopulations and a new recipe for the dust extinction. we compare the modelpredictions of the k-band luminosity evolution and the j-k, v-i and i-k colourevolution with a series of datasets, including collins et al. (nature, 2009)who argued that semi-analytic models based on the millennium simulation cannotreproduce the red colours and high luminosity of bcgs at z&gt;1. we show insteadthat the model is well in range of the observed luminosity and correctlyreproduces the colour evolution of bcgs in the whole redshift range up toz~1.6. we argue that the success of the semi-analytic model is in large partdue to the implementation of a more sophisticated spectro-photometric model. ananalysis of the model bcgs shows an increase in mass by a factor ~2 since z~1,and star formation activity down to low redshifts. while the consensusregarding bcgs is that they are passively evolving, we argue that thisconclusion is affected by the degeneracy between star formation history andstellar population models used in sed-fitting, and by the inefficacy oftoy-models of passive evolution to capture the complexity of real galaxies,expecially those with rich merger histories like bcgs. following this argument,we also show that in the semi-analytic model the bcgs show a realistic mix ofstellar populations, and that these stellar populations are mostly old. inaddition, the age-redshift relation of the model bcgs follows that of theuniverse, meaning that given their merger history and star formation history,the ageing of bcgs is always dominated by the ageing of their stellarpopulations. in a lambdacdm universe, we define such evolution as "passive inthe hierarchical sense".

1303.3551	the different star-formation histories of blue and red spiral and  elliptical galaxies	[abridged] we study the spectral properties of intermediate mass galaxies asa function of colour and morphology. we use galaxy zoo to define threemorphological classes of galaxies, namely early-types (ellipticals), late-type(disk-dominated) face-on spirals and early-type (bulge-dominated) face-onspirals. we classify these galaxies as blue or red according to their sdss g-rcolour and use the spectral fitting code vespa to calculate time-resolvedstar-formation histories, metallicity and total starlight dust extinction fromtheir sdss fibre spectra. we find that red late-type spirals show lessstar-formation in the last 500 myr than blue late-type spirals by up to afactor of three, but share similar star-formation histories at earlier times.this decline in recent star-formation explains their redder colour: theirchemical and dust content are the same. we postulate that red late-type spiralsare recent descendants of blue late-type spirals, with their star-formationcurtailed in the last 500 myrs. the red late-type spirals are however stillforming stars approximately 17 times faster than red ellipticals over the sameperiod. red early-type spirals lie between red late-type spirals and redellipticals in terms of recent-to-intermediate star-formation and dust content.therefore, it is plausible that these galaxies represent an evolutionary linkbetween these two populations. they are more likely to evolve directly into redellipticals than red late-type spirals. blue ellipticals show similarstar-formation histories as blue spirals (regardless of type), except they haveformed less stars in the last 100 myrs. however, blue ellipticals havedifferent dust content, which peaks at lower extinction values than all spiralgalaxies.

1305.3617	calibrating stellar population models with magellanic cloud star  clusters	stellar population models are commonly calculated using star clusters ascalibrators for those evolutionary stages that depend on free parameters.however, discrepancies exist among different models, even if similar sets ofcalibration clusters are used. with the aim of understanding thesediscrepancies, and of improving the calibration procedure, we consider a set of43 magellanic cloud (mc) clusters taking age and photometric information fromthe literature. we carefully assign ages to each cluster based on up-to-datedeterminations ensuring that these are as homogeneous as possible. to cope withstatistical fluctuations, we stack the clusters in five age bins deriving foreach of them integrated luminosities and colors. we find that clusters becomeabruptly red in optical and optical-ir colors as they age from ~0.6 to 1 gyr,which we interpret as due to the development of a well-populated thermallypulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb). we argue that other studies missedthis detection because of coarser age binnings. maraston (2005; m05) andgirardi et al. (2010) models predict the presence of a populated tp-agb at ~0.6gyr, with a correspondingly very red integrated color, at variance with thedata; bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) and conroy et al. (2009) models run within theerror bars at all ages. the discrepancy between the synthetic colors of m05models and the average colors of mc clusters results from the now obsolete agescale adopted. finally, our finding that the tp-agb phase appears to developbetween ~0.6-1 gyr is dependent on the adopted age scale for the clusters andmay have important implications for stellar evolution.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1308.0604	recovering galaxy stellar population properties from broad-band spectral  energy distribution fitting ii. the case with unknown redshift	(abridged) in a recent work we explored the dependence of galaxy stellarpopulation properties derived from broad-band spectral energy distributionfitting on the fitting parameters, e.g. sfhs, age grid, metallicity, imf, dustreddening, reddening law, filter setup and wavelength coverage. in this paperwe consider also redshift as a free parameter in the fit and study whether onecan obtain reasonable estimates of photometric redshifts and stellar populationproperties at once. we use mock star-forming as well as passive galaxies placedat various redshifts (0.5 to 3) as test particles. mock star-forming galaxiesare extracted from a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. we show that forhigh-z star-forming galaxies photometric redshifts, stellar masses andreddening can be determined simultaneously when using a broad wavelengthcoverage and a wide template setup in the fit. masses are similarly wellrecovered (median ~ 0.2 dex) as at fixed redshift. for old galaxies with littlerecent star formation masses are better recovered than in the fixed redshiftcase, such that the median recovered stellar mass improves by up to 0.3 dexwhereas the uncertainty in the redshift accuracy increases by only ~ 0.05.however, a failure in redshift recovery also means a failure in mass recovery.as at fixed redshift mismatches in sfh and degeneracies between age, dust andnow also redshift cause underestimated ages, overestimated reddening andunderestimated masses. stellar masses are best determined at low redshiftwithout reddening in the fit (median underestimation ~ 0.1 dex for similarlywell recovered redshifts). not surprisingly, the recovery of properties issubstantially better for passive galaxies. in all cases, the recovery ofphysical parameters is crucially dependent on the wavelength coverage adoptedin the fitting. scaling relations for the transformation of stellar masses areprovided.

1310.2604	combined analysis of hubble and vlt photometry of the intermediate mass  black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1	in this paper we present a combined analysis of data obtained with the hubblespace telescope (hst), very large telescope (vlt), and swift x-ray telescope(xrt) of the intermediate mass black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1 that were taken 2months apart between september and november 2010. previous separate analyses ofthese data found that they were consistent with an irradiated accretion discwith contribution from either a very young or very old stellar population, andalso indicated that the optical flux of the hlx-1 counterpart could bevariable. such variability could only be attributed to a varying accretiondisc, so simultaneous analysis of all data sets should break the degeneraciesin the model fits. we thus simultaneously fit the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) from near-infrared through to x-ray wavelengths of the twoepochs of data with a model consisting of an irradiated accretion disc and astellar population. we show that this combined analysis rules out an oldstellar population, finding that the sed is dominated by emission from anaccretion disc with moderate reprocessing in the outer disc around anintermediate mass black hole imbedded in a young (20 myr) stellar cluster witha mass of 1e5 msun. we also place an upper limit on the mass of an additionalhidden old stellar population of 1e6 msun. however, optical r-band observationsof hlx-1 obtained with the gemini-south telescope covering part of the decayfrom a later x-ray outburst are consistent with constant optical flux,indicating that the observed variability between the hst and vlt observationscould be spurious caused by differences in the background subtraction appliedto the two optical data sets. in this scenario the contribution of the stellarpopulation, and thus the stellar mass of the cluster, may be higher (abridged).

1312.4854	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: cosmological implications of the full shape of the  clustering wedges in the data release 10 and 11 galaxy samples	we explore the cosmological implications of the angle-averaged correlationfunction, xi(s), and the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s) and xi_para(s), of thelowz and cmass galaxy samples from data release 10 and 11 of the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. our results show no significantevidence for a deviation from the standard lcdm model. the combination of theinformation from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmicmicrowave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the universeto omega_k = 0.0010 +- 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to sum m_nu &lt; 0.23 ev(95% confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species ton_eff=3.31 +- 0.27, and the dark energy equation of state to w_de = -1.051 +-0.076. these limits are further improved by adding information from type iasupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. in particular,this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent darkenergy equation of state, in which case we find w_de=-1.024 +- 0.052. weexplore the constraints on the growth-rate of cosmic structures assumingf(z)=omega_m(z)^gamma and obtain gamma=0.69 +- 0.15, in agreement with thepredictions from general relativity of gamma=0.55.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1312.4899	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey (boss): measuring growth rate and geometry with  anisotropic clustering	we use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 11 cmass sample to measurethe linear growth rate of structure, the hubble expansion rate and the comovingdistance scale. our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses an effectivevolume of 6.0 ${\rm gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. wefind $f\sigma_8 = 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $h = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}$ and $d_{\rm a} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm mpc}$when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. when we fix thebackground expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\lambda$cdm modelin agreement with recent planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$(6 per cent accuracy). while our measurements are generally consistent with thepredictions of $\lambda$cdm and general relativity, they mildly favor models inwhich the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what ispredicted by general relativity. combining our measurements with recent cosmicmicrowave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmologicalparameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. separatelyvarying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent accuracy)and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equationof state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. bothconstraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of $w=-1$ and$\gamma = 0.554$.

1401.3405	evidence for a constant imf in early-type galaxies based on their x-ray  binary populations	a number of recent studies have proposed that the stellar initial massfunction (imf) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function ofgalaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom heavy imfs. these bottomheavy imfs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars,and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars and blackholes. in this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number ofblack holes and neutron stars based on the power-law imf variation required toreproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. we thentest whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass x-raybinary populations (lmxbs) of nearby early-type galaxies. in these binaries, aneutron star or black hole accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. theirnumber is therefore expected to scale with the number of black holes andneutron stars present in a galaxy. we find that the number of lmxbs per k-bandlight is similar among the galaxies in our sample. these data thereforedemonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the imf from massive stars down tothose now dominating the k-band light, and are consistent with an invariantimf. our results are inconsistent with an imf which varies from akroupa/chabrier like imf for low mass galaxies to a steep power-law imf (withslope $x$=2.8) for high mass galaxies. we discuss how these observationsconstrain the possible forms of the imf variations and how future chandraobservations can enable sharper tests of the imf.

1405.1431	redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of massive galaxies from  sdss-iii/boss	we study the redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of ~180,000massive galaxies from sdss-iii/boss combined with a local early-type galaxysample from sdss-ii in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt; 0.6. the typical stellar massof this sample is mstar~2x10^{11} msun. we analyze the evolution of the galaxyparameters effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion, and the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift. as the effective radii of boss galaxies atthese redshifts are not well resolved in the sdss imaging we calibrate the sdsssize measurements with hst/cosmos photometry for a sub-sample of galaxies. wefurther apply a correction for progenitor bias to build a sample which consistsof a coeval, passively evolving population. systematic errors due to sizecorrection and the calculation of dynamical mass, are assessed through montecarlo simulations. at fixed stellar or dynamical mass, we find moderateevolution in galaxy size and stellar velocity dispersion, in agreement withprevious studies. we show that this results in a decrease of the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift at &gt;2sigma significance. by combining oursample with high-redshift literature data we find that this evolution of thedynamical to stellar mass ratio continues beyond z~0.7 up to z&gt;2 as mdyn/mstar~(1+z)^{-0.30+/- 0.12} further strengthening the evidence for an increase ofmdyn/mstar with cosmic time. this result is in line with recent predictionsfrom galaxy formation simulations based on minor merger driven mass growth, inwhich the dark matter fraction within the half-light radius increases withcosmic time.

1406.6065	the aimss project i: bridging the star cluster - galaxy divide	we describe the structural and kinematic properties of the first compactstellar systems discovered by the aimss project. these spectroscopicallyconfirmed objects have sizes ($\sim$6 $&lt;$ r$_{\rm e}$ [pc] $&lt;$ 500) and masses($\sim$2$\times$10$^{6}$ $&lt;$ m$_*$/m$_\odot$ $&lt;$ 6$\times$10$^{9}$) spanningthe range of massive globular clusters (gcs), ultra compact dwarfs (ucds) andcompact elliptical galaxies (ces), completely filling the gap between starclusters and galaxies.  several objects are close analogues to the prototypical ce, m32. theseobjects, which are more massive than previously discovered ucds of the samesize, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend forcompact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for auniversal "zone of avoidance" for dynamically hot stellar systems in themass-size plane.  overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1)massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. our dataprovide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type ucd/ce populationinto two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by thestripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formedthrough the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues ofclassical ellipticals. we find compact stellar systems around galaxies in lowto high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processesresponsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1411.2597	on the intermediate-redshift central stellar mass-halo mass relation,  and implications for the evolution of the most massive galaxies since z~1	the stellar mass-halo mass relation is a key constraint in all semi-analytic,numerical, and semi-empirical models of galaxy formation and evolution.however, its exact shape and redshift dependence remain debated. several recentworks support a relation in the local universe steeper than previously thought.based on the comparisons with a variety of data on massive central galaxies, weshow that this steepening holds up to z~1, for stellar masses mstar&gt;2e11 msun.specifically, we find significant evidence for a high-mass end slope of\beta&gt;0.35-0.70, instead of the usual \beta~0.20-0.30 reported by a number ofprevious results. when including the independent constraints from the recentboss clustering measurements, the data, independent of any systematic errors instellar masses, tend to favor a model with a very small scatter (&lt; 0.15 dex) instellar mass at fixed halo mass, in the redshift range z &lt; 0.8 and formstar&gt;3e11 msun, suggesting a close connection between massive galaxies andhost halos even at relatively recent epochs. we discuss the implications of ourresults with respect to the evolution of the most massive galaxies since z~1.

1501.04726	the science case for multi-object spectroscopy on the european elt	this white paper presents the scientific motivations for a multi-objectspectrograph (mos) on the european extremely large telescope (e-elt). the moscase draws on all fields of contemporary astronomy, from extra-solar planets,to the study of the halo of the milky way and its satellites, and from resolvedstellar populations in nearby galaxies out to observations of the earliest'first-light' structures in the partially-reionised universe. the materialpresented here results from thorough discussions within the community over thepast four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a commonstrategy toward realising a mos capability on the e-elt. the cases have beendistilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define themosaic instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and'high definition'). when combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of thee-elt, mosaic will be the world's leading mos facility. in analysing therequirements we also identify a high-multiplex mos for the longer-term plansfor the e-elt, with an even greater multiplex (&gt;1000 targets) to enable studiesof large-scale structures in the high-redshift universe. following the greenlight for the construction of the e-elt the mos community, structured throughthe mosaic consortium, is eager to realise a mos on the e-elt as soon aspossible. we argue that several of the most compelling cases for elt science,in highly competitive areas of modern astronomy, demand such a capability. forexample, mos observations in the early stages of e-elt operations will beessential for follow-up of sources identified by the james webb space telescope(jwst). in particular, multi-object adaptive optics and accurate skysubtraction with fibres have both recently been demonstrated on sky, makingfast-track development of mosaic feasible.

1509.04000	old age and super-solar metallicity in a massive z~1.4 early-type galaxy  from vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy	we present the first estimate of age, stellar metallicity and chemicalabundance ratios, for an individual early-type galaxy at high-redshift (z =1.426) in the cosmos field. our analysis is based on observations obtained withthe x-shooter instrument at the vlt, which cover the visual and near infraredspectrum at high (r &gt;5000) spectral resolution. we measure the values ofseveral spectral absorptions tracing chemical species, in particular magnesiumand iron, besides determining the age-sensitive d4000 break. we compare themeasured indices to stellar population models, finding good agreement. we findthat our target is an old (t &gt; 3 gyr), high-metallicity ([z/h] &gt; 0.5) galaxywhich formed its stars at z_{form} &gt; 5 within a short time scale ~0.1 gyr, astestified by the strong [\alpha/fe] ratio ( &gt; 0.4), and has passively evolvedin the first &gt; 3-4 gyr of its life. we have verified that this result is robustagainst the choice and number of fitted spectral features, and stellarpopulation model. the result of an old age and high-metallicity has importantimplications for galaxy formation and evolution confirming an early and rapidformation of the most massive galaxies in the universe.

1509.06529	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey data release 12: galaxy  target selection and large scale structure catalogues	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), part of the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) iii project, has provided the largest survey of galaxyredshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshiftsmeasured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. keyto analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurementsis understanding the detailed properties of this sample. potential issuesinclude variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in thetargeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern ofspectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for whichredshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due toobservational systematics. we document here the target selection algorithmsused to create the galaxy samples that comprise boss. we also present thealgorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final datarelease (dr12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify thesurvey mask. the algorithms are an evolution of those used by the boss team toconstruct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accuratelyquantify the galaxy sample. the code used, designated mksample, is releasedwith this paper.

1511.03264	the aimss project iii: the stellar populations of compact stellar  systems	in recent years, a growing zoo of compact stellar systems (csss) have beenfound whose physical properties (mass, size, velocity dispersion) place thembetween classical globular clusters (gcs) and true galaxies, leading to debatesabout their nature. here we present results using a so far underutiliseddiscriminant, their stellar population properties. based on new spectroscopyfrom 8-10m telescopes, we derive ages, metallicities, and [\alpha/fe] of 29csss. these range from gcs with sizes of merely a few parsec to compactellipticals larger than m32. together with a literature compilation, thisprovides a panoramic view of the stellar population characteristics ofearly-type systems. we find that the csss are predominantly more metal richthan typical galaxies at the same stellar mass. at high mass, the compactellipticals (ces) depart from the mass-metallicity relation of massiveearly-type galaxies, which forms a continuous sequence with dwarf galaxies. atlower mass, the metallicity distribution of ultra-compact dwarfs (ucds) changesat a few times $10^7$ m$_{\odot}$, which roughly coincides with the mass whereluminosity function arguments previously suggested the gc population ends. thehighest metallicities in csss are paralleled only by those of dwarf galaxynuclei and the central parts of massive early types. these findings can beinterpreted as csss previously being more massive and undergoing tidalinteractions to obtain their current mass and compact size. such aninterpretation is supported by csss with direct evidence for tidal stripping,and by an examination of the css internal escape velocities.

1511.05573	revisiting the role of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch  phase in high-redshift galaxies	we study the debated contribution from thermally pulsing asymptotic giantbranch (tp-agb) stars in evolutionary population synthesis models. weinvestigate the spectral energy distributions (seds) of a sample of 51spectroscopically confirmed, high-z ($1.3&lt;z_{\rm spec}&lt;2.7$), galaxies usingthree evolutionary population synthesis models with strong, mild and lighttp-agb. our sample is the largest of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies onwhich such models are tested so far. galaxies were selected as passive, but wemodel them using a variety of star formation histories in order not to bedependent on this pre-selection.  we find that the observed seds are best fitted with a significantcontribution of tp-agb stars or with substantial dust attenuation. withoutincluding reddening, tp-agb-strong models perform better and deliver solutionsconsistent within $1\sigma$ from the best-fit ones in the vast majority ofcases. including reddening, all models perform similarly. using independentconstraints from observations in the mid- and far-ir, we show thatlow/negligible dust attenuation, i.e. $e(b-v)\lesssim 0.05$ , should bepreferred for the seds of passively-selected galaxies. given that tp-agb-lightmodels give systematically older ages for passive galaxies, we suggest numbercounts of passive galaxies at higher redshifts as a further test todiscriminate among stellar population models.

astro-ph;0004145	strong balmer lines in old stellar populations: no need for young ages  in ellipticals?	comparing models of simple stellar populations (ssp) with observed linestrengths generally provides a tool to break the age-metallicity degeneracy inelliptical galaxies. due to the wide range of balmer line strengths observed,ellipticals have been interpreted to exhibit an appreciable scatter in age. inthis paper, we analyze composite stellar population models with a simple mix ofan old metal-rich and an old metal-poor component. we show that these modelssimultaneously produce strong balmer lines and strong metallic lines withoutinvoking a young population. the key to this result is that our models arebased on ssps that better match the steep increase of hbeta in metal-poorglobular clusters than models in the literature. hence, the scatter of hbetaobserved in cluster and luminous field elliptical galaxies can be explained bya spread in the metallicity of old stellar populations. we check our model withrespect to the so-called g-dwarf problem in ellipticals. for a galaxy subsamplecovering a large range in uv-v colors we demonstrate that the addition of anold metal-poor subcomponent does not invalidate other observational constraintslike colors and the flux in the mid-uv.

astro-ph;0107533	the star cluster system of the 3 gyr old merger remnant ngc 1316: clues  from optical and near-infrared photometry	the giant merger remnant galaxy ngc 1316 (fornax a) is an ideal probe forstudying the long-term effects of a past major merger on star cluster systems,given its spectroscopically derived merger age of ~3 gyr which we reported in arecent paper. here we present new ground-based, large-area optical and near-irimaging of star clusters in ngc 1316, complemented with deep hst/wfpc2 imaging.we find that the optical-near-ir colours and luminosities of the brightest ~10clusters in ngc 1316 are consistent with those of intermediate-age (2-3 gyr)populations. unlike `normal' giant ellipticals, the b-i colour distribution ofclusters in ngc 1316 is not clearly bimodal. however, the luminosity functions(lfs) of the blue and red parts of the cluster colour distribution aredifferent: the red cluster lf is well represented by a power law with index-1.2 +/- 0.3, extending to about 1.5 mag brighter (in b) than those of typicalgiant ellipticals. in contrast, the shape of the blue cluster lf is consistentwith that of `normal' spiral and elliptical galaxies. we conclude that the starcluster system of ngc 1316 is a combination of a population of age ~3 gyrhaving roughly solar metallicity and a population of old, metal-poor clusterswhich probably belonged to the pre-merger galaxies. after the 3 gyr old,metal-rich clusters fade to an age of 10 gyr, they will form a red `peak' in abimodal cluster colour distribution. this `red peak' will have a colourconsistent with that found in `normal, old' giant ellipticals of the samegalaxy luminosity (taking age dimming into account). these features of the starcluster system of ngc 1316 are fully consistent with scenarios for forming`normal' giant elliptical galaxies through gas-rich mergers at look-back times$\ga$ 10 gyr.

astro-ph;0202166	the epochs of early-type galaxy formation in clusters and in the field	we compute new population synthesis models of lick absorption line indiceswith variable alpha/fe ratios and use them to derive average ages,metallicities, and alpha/fe element enhancements for a sample of 126 field andcluster early-type galaxies. calibrating the models on galactic globularclusters, we show that any population synthesis model being based on stellarlibraries of the milky way is intrinsically biased towards super-solar alpha/feratios at metallicities below solar. we correct for this bias, so that themodels presented here reflect constant alpha/fe ratios at all metallicities.the use of such unbiased models is essential for studies of stellar systemswith sub-solar metallicities like (extragalactic) globular clusters or dwarfgalaxies.  for the galaxy sample investigated here, we find a clear correlation betweenalpha/fe and velocity dispersion. zero-point, slope, and scatter of thiscorrelation turn out to be independent of the environment. additionally, thealpha/fe ratios and mean ages of elliptical galaxies are well correlated, i.e.galaxies with high alpha/fe ratios have also high average ages. this stronglyreinforces the view that the alpha/fe element enhancement in ellipticals isproduced by short star formation timescales rather than by a flattening of theinitial mass function. the more massive the galaxy, the shorter is its starformation timescale, and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of starformation, independent of the environmental density. we show that this findingis incompatible with the predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation models,in which star formation is tightly linked to the assembly history of darkmatter halos.

astro-ph;0209238	integrated spectroscopy of bulge globular clusters and fields i. the  data base and comparison of individual lick indices in clusters and bulge	we present a comprehensive spectroscopic study of the integrated light ofmetal-rich galactic globular clusters and the stellar population in thegalactic bulge. we measure line indices which are defined by the lick standardsystem and compare index strengths of the clusters and galactic bulge. bothmetal-rich globular clusters and the bulge are similar in most of the indices,except for the cn index. we find a significant enhancement in the cn/&lt;fe&gt; indexratio in metal-rich globular clusters compared with the galactic bulge. themean iron index &lt;fe&gt; of the two metal-rich globular clusters ngc 6528 and ngc6553 is comparable with the mean iron index of the bulge. index ratios such asmgb/&lt;fe&gt;, mg2/&lt;fe&gt;, ca4227/&lt;fe&gt;, and tio/&lt;fe&gt;, are comparable in both stellarpopulation indicating similar enhancements in individual elements which aretraced by the indices. from the globular cluster data we fully empiricallycalibrate several metallicity-sensitive indices as a function of [fe/h] andfind tightest correlations for the mg2 index and the composite [mgfe] index. wefind that all indices show a similar behavior with galactocentric radius,except for the balmer series, which show a large scatter at all radii. however,the scatter is entirely consistent with the cluster-to-cluster variations inthe horizontal branch morphology.

astro-ph;0209250	stellar population models of lick indices with variable element  abundance ratios	we provide the whole set of lick indices from cn1 to tio2 of simple stellarpopulation models with, for the first time, variable element abundance ratios,[alpha/fe]=0.0, 0.3, 0.5, [alpha/ca]=-0.1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, and [alpha/n]=-0.5,0.0. the models cover ages between 1 and 15 gyr, metallicities between 1/200and 3.5 solar. our models are free from the intrinsic alpha/fe bias that wasimposed by the milky way template stars up to now, hence they reflectwell-defined alpha/fe ratios at all metallicities. the models are calibratedwith milky way globular clusters for which metallicities and alpha/fe ratiosare known from independent spectroscopy of individual stars. the metallicitiesthat we derive from the lick indices mgb and fe5270 are in excellent agreementwith the metallicity scale by zinn &amp; west (1984), and we show that the latterprovides total metallicity rather than iron abundance. we can reproduce therelatively strong cn-absorption features cn1 and cn2 of galactic globularclusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor three. anenhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with theindices mg1 and c24668. the calcium sensitive index ca4227 of globular clustersis well matched by our models with [ca/fe]= 0.3, including the metal-rich bulgeclusters ngc 6528 and ngc 6553. from our alpha/fe enhanced models we infer thatthe index [mgfe] defined by gonzalez (1993) is quite independent of alpha/fe,but still slightly decreases with increasing alpha/fe. we define a slightmodification of this index that is completely independent of alpha/fe andserves best as a tracer of total metallicity. searching for blue indices thatgive similar information as mgb and fe, we find that cn1 and fe4383 may be bestsuited to estimate alpha/fe ratios of objects at redshifts z~1.

astro-ph;0302063	the impact of alpha/fe enhanced stellar evolutionary tracks on the ages  of elliptical galaxies	we complement our study of alpha/fe enhanced stellar population models oflick absorption indices (thomas et al. 2003) by comparing two sets of alpha/feenhanced models. in both models the impact on lick indices due to alpha/feenhancement is accounted for through a modification of the stellar absorptionline-strengths using the response functions of tripicco &amp; bell (1995). one setof models, however, uses solar-scaled, the other alpha/fe enhanced stellarevolutionary tracks. since the alpha/fe enhanced tracks are hotter than thesolar-scaled ones (salasnich et al. 2000), the correspondent stellar populationmodels have slightly weaker metallic indices (i.e. mgb, &lt;fe&gt; etc.) and strongerbalmer line indices (hbeta) (maraston et al 2003). here we explorequantitatively the impact of this effect on the alpha/fe ratios, metallicitiesand ages that are derived for elliptical galaxies. we find that the modestdecrease of the metallic indices mgb and &lt;fe&gt; balance each other, such thatfully consistent alpha/fe ratios are derived for stellar systems using alpha/feenhanced models with either solar-scaled or alpha/fe enhanced stellar tracks.the decrease of the metallic indices and the increase of hbeta conspire in away that also consistent metallicities are obtained. the derived ages, instead,are significantly different. the inclusion of alpha/fe enhanced stellar tracksleads to the derivation of ages as high as 30 gyr for elliptical galaxies. forthe same objects, ages not older than 15 gyr are obtained, if alpha/fe enhancedmodels using solar-scaled tracks are adopted. this may indicate that currentstellar evolutionary models overestimate the bluing of stellar evolutionarytracks due to alpha/fe enhanced chemical mixtures at super-solar metallicities.

astro-ph;0303615	new clues on the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxies	we use our new stellar population models, which include effects from variableelement abundance ratios, to model the ca4227 absorption line indices ofearly-type galaxies (trager et al.), and to derive calcium element abundances.we find that calcium, although being an alpha-element, is depressed withrespect to the other alpha-elements by up to a factor 2. this confirmsquantitatively earlier speculations that early-type galaxies are calciumunderabundant. we find a clear correlation between alpha/ca ratio and centralvelocity dispersion, which implies that more massive galaxies are more calciumunderabundant. interestingly this correlation extends down to the dwarfspheroidal galaxies of the local group for which alpha/ca ratios have beenmeasured from high-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars (shetrone etal.). the increase of the calcium underabundance with galaxy mass balances thehigher total metallicities of more massive galaxies, so that calcium abundancein early-type galaxies is fairly constant and in particular does not increasewith increasing galaxy mass. this result may be the key to understand why thecaii triplet absorption of early-type galaxies at 8600 a is constant to within5 per cent over a large range of velocity dispersions (saglia et al.; cenarroet al.). the origin of the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxiesremains yet to be understood. we argue that formation timescales aredisfavoured to produce calcium underabundance, and that the option ofmetallicity dependent supernova yields may be the most promising track tofollow.

[mgfe]' is used as aspectroscopic metallicity indicator which is least affected by [alpha/fe]variations. we introduce an interpolation routine to simultaneously deriveages, metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios from diagnostic grids constructedfrom lick indices. from a comparison of high-quality data with ssp modelpredictions, we find that ~2/3 of the globular clusters in early-type galaxiesare older than 10 gyr, up to 1/3 have ages in the range ~5-10 gyr, and only afew cluster are younger than ~5 gyr. our sample of globular clusters coversmetallicities from [z/h] = -1.3 up to ~0.5 dex. we find that metal-richglobular clusters show on average a smaller mean age and a larger age scatterthan their metal-poor counterparts. [alpha/fe] diagnostic plots show thatglobular cluster systems in early-type galaxies have super-solar alpha/feabundance ratios with a mean [alpha/fe] = 0.47+/-0.06 dex and a dispersion ofabout 0.3 dex. we find evidence for a correlation between [alpha/fe] andmetallicity, in the sense that more metal-rich clusters exhibit loweralpha-element enhancements.

0809.1096	destruction of molecular gas reservoirs in early-type galaxies by active  galactic nucleus feedback	residual star formation at late times in early-type galaxies and theirprogenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red,passively evolving systems we see today. likewise, residual or newly accretedreservoirs of molecular gas that are fuelling star formation must be destroyed.this suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonlyattributed to agn feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelledduring a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. however,direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of thismolecular gas and an agn phase has been missing so far. we present newmm-wavelength observations from the iram 30m telescope of a sample of lowredshift sdss early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process ofquenching of late-time star formation. our observations show that thedisappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 myr with theonset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to starformation alone. since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerfulquasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity agn episodes aresufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. this`suppression mode' of agn feedback is very different from the `truncation mode'linked to powerful quasar activity during early phases of galaxy formation.

0809.1867	modeling the color evolution of luminous red galaxies - improvements  with empirical stellar spectra	predicting the colors of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) has been a long-standing problem. the g,r,i colors of lrgsare inconsistent with stellar population models over the redshift range0.1&lt;z&lt;0.7. the g-r colors in the models are on average redder than the datawhile the r-i colors in the models are bluer towards low redshift. beyondredshift 0.4, the predicted r-i color becomes instead too red, while thepredicted g-r agrees with the data. we provide a solution to this problem,through a combination of new astrophysics and a fundamental change to thestellar population modeling. we find that the use of the empirical library ofpickles (1998) instead of theoretical spectra modifies the predicted colorsexactly in the way suggested by the data. the reason is a lower flux in theempirical libraries, with respect to the theoretical ones, in the wavelengthrange 5500-6500 aa. the discrepancy increases with decreasing effectivetemperature independently of gravity. this result has general implications fora variety of studies from globular clusters to high-redshift galaxies. theastrophysical part of our solution regards the composition of the stellarpopulations of these massive luminous red galaxies. we find that on top of theprevious effect one needs to consider a model in which ~3% of the stellar massis in old metal-poor stars. other solutions such as substantial blue horizontalbranch at high metallicity or young stellar populations can be ruled out by thedata. our new model provides a better fit to the g-r and r-i colors of lrgs andgives new insight into the formation histories of these most massive galaxies.our model will also improve the k- and evolutionary corrections for lrgs whichare critical for fully exploiting present and future galaxy surveys.

astro-ph;9807338	evolutionary synthesis of stellar populations: a modular tool	a new tool for the evolutionary synthesis of stellar populations (eps) ispresented, which is based on three independent matrices, giving respectively:1) the fuel consumption during each evolutionary phase as a function of stellarmass; 2) the typical temperatures and gravities during such phases; 3) coloursand bolometric corrections as functions of gravity and temperature. the modularstructure of the code allows to easily assess the impact on the syntheticspectral energy distribution of the various assumptions and model ingredients,such as, for example, uncertainties in stellar evolutionary models, mixinglength, the temperature distribution of horizontal branch (hb) stars, agb massloss, and colour-temperature transformations. the so-called ``agb-phasetransition'' in magellanic cloud clusters is used to calibrate the contributionof the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase (tp-agb) to thesynthetic integrated luminosity. as an illustrative example, solar metallicity($y=0.27,z=0.02$) models, with ages ranging between 30 {\rm myr} and 15 {\rmgyr} and various choices for the slope of the initial mass function (imf), arepresented. synthetic broad band colours and the luminosity contributions of thevarious evolutionary stages are compared with lmc and galactic globular clusterdata. in all these cases, a good agreement is found. finally, we show theevolution of stellar mass-to-light ratios in the bolometric and u,b,v,r, and kpassbands, in which the contribution of stellar remnants is accounted for.

astro-ph;9906088	the uncertainties in the synthetic indices for stellar populations	the study of line strengths in the spectra of early-type galaxies has provento be a powerful tool for investigating the age and the metallicity of thesesystems. when computing models for spectrophotometric narrow-band indices,index calibrations as functions of the relevant stellar parameters (e.g.temperature, gravity and metal content) are used. thus synthetic indices dependupon these calibrations (called fitting functions), as well as on the stellarevolution ingredients adopted. all these inputs suffer from uncertainties,which impact on the derived value for the indices. in this paper we addressthis problem quantitatively. we compute synthetic mg2, fe5270, fe5335 and hbetaindices for simple stellar populations (ssp) of various ages and metallicities,under different prescriptions for the fitting functions. this allows us toestimate the impact of the uncertainties in the fitting functions. by comparingour models to those of other authors computed with the same fitting functions,we estimate the uncertainty associated to the use of different stellarevolution prescriptions. it is found that the modelling of the horizontalbranch impacts particularly on &lt;fe&gt; and hbeta. in the range of parametersexplored, the uncertainties introduced by the use of different fittingfunctions can be appreciably larger than the error affecting the observationaldata. this typically occurs at high z for the metallic line strengths, at low zfor the hbeta index.

0812.1225	the impact of tp-agb stars on hierarchical galaxy formation models	the spectro-photometric properties of galaxies in galaxy formation models areobtained by combining the predicted history of star formation and massaccretion with the physics of stellar evolution through stellar populationmodels. in the recent literature, significant differences have emergedregarding the implementation of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branchphase of stellar evolution. the emission in the tp-agb phase dominates thebolometric and near-ir spectrum of intermediate-age (~1 gyr) stellarpopulations, hence it is crucial for the correct modeling of the galaxyluminosities and colours. in this paper for the first time, we incorporate afull prescription of the tp-agb phase in a semi-analytic model of galaxyformation. we find that the inclusion of the tp-agb in the model spectradramatically alters the predicted colour-magnitude relation and its evolutionwith redshift. when the tp-agb phase is active, the rest-frame v-k galaxycolours are redder by almost 2 magnitudes in the redshift range z~2-3 and by 1magnitude at z~1. very red colours are produced in disk galaxies, so that thev-k colour distributions of disk and spheroids are virtually undistinguishableat low redshifts. we also find that the galaxy k-band emission is more than 1magnitude higher in the range z~1-3. this may alleviate the difficulties met bythe hierarchical clustering scenario in predicting the red galaxy population athigh redshifts. the comparison between simulations and observations have to berevisited in the light of our results.
