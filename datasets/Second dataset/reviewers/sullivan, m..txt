0901.2476	the mean type ia supernova spectrum over the past 9 gigayears	we examine the possibility of evolution with redshift in the mean rest-frameultraviolet (uv; &lt;4500a) spectrum of type ia supernovae (sne ia) sampling theredshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1.3. we find new evidence for a decrease with redshift inthe strength of intermediate-mass element (ime) features, particularly si iiand to a lesser extent ca ii "h&amp;k" and mg ii blends, indicating lower imeabundances in the higher redshift sne. a larger fraction of luminous, widerlight-curve width (higher "stretch") sne ia are expected at higher redshiftthan locally, so we compare our observed spectral evolution with that predictedby a redshift-evolving stretch distribution (howell et al. 2007) coupled with astretch-dependent sn ia spectrum. we show that the sense of the spectralevolution can be reproduced by this simple model, though the highest redshiftevents seem additionally deficient in si and ca. we also examine the mean sn iauv-optical colors as a function of redshift, thought to be sensitive tovariations in progenitor composition. we find that the expected stretchvariations are sufficient to explain the differences, although improved data atz~0 will enable more precise tests. thus, to the extent possible with theavailable datasets, our results support the continued use of sne ia asstandardized candles.

physics;0110089	results from a prototype permanent magnet dipole-quadrupole hybrid for  the pep-ii b-factory	we describe the construction of a prototype hybrid permanent magnet dipoleand quadruple. the magnet consists of two concentric rings of smco magneticmaterial 5 cm in length. the outer ring is made of 16 uniformly magnetizedblocks assembled as a halbach dipole and the inner ring has 32 blocks orientedin a similar fashion so as to generate a quadruple field. the resultantsuperimposed field is an offset quadruple field which allows us to center thefield on the high-energy beam in the interaction region of the pepii b factory.the dipole blocks are glued to the inside surface of an outer support collarand the quadruple blocks are held in a fixture that allows radial adjustment ofthe blocks prior to potting the entire assembly with epoxy. an extensivecomputer model of the magnet has been made and from this model we developed atuning algorithm that allowed us to greatly reduce the n=3-17 harmonics of themagnet.

0910.0059	hydrogen-poor superluminous stellar explosions	supernovae (sne) are stellar explosions driven by gravitational orthermonuclear energy, observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeksor more. in all known sne, this radiation comes from internal energy depositedin the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesizedelements (typically 56ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in theenvelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the sn debris andslowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. here we report on a newclass of luminous sne whose observed properties cannot be explained by any ofthese known processes. these include four new sne we have discovered, and twopreviously unexplained events (sn 2005ap; scp 06f6) that we can now identify asmembers. these sne are all ~10 times brighter than sne ia, do not show anytrace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (uv) flux for extended periodsof time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent withradioactivity. our data require that the observed radiation is emitted byhydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~10^15 cm) andexpanding at high velocities (&gt;10^4 km s^-1). these long-lived, uv-luminousevents can be observed out to redshifts z&gt;4 and offer an excellent opportunityto study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distantgalaxies.

1002.1249	gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (snls)	the observed brightness of type ia supernovae is affected by gravitationallensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, whichintroduces an additional dispersion into the hubble diagram. we look forevidence of lensing in the supernova legacy survey 3-year data set. weinvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the hubble diagram andthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution offoreground galaxies. a deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, andwell established mass luminosity relations are used. we find evidence of alensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. the current result is limited bythe number of sne, their redshift distribution, and the other sources ofscatter in the hubble diagram. separating the galaxy population into a red anda blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signaldetection. on the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, theprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the massluminosity relations have little effect. we show that for the full supernovalegacy survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type ia sne and ~200photometrically identified type ia sne), there is an 80% probability ofdetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.

1002.1374	constraining dark matter halo properties using lensed snls supernovae	this paper exploits the gravitational magnification of sne ia to measureproperties of dark matter haloes. the magnification of individual sne ia can becomputed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halomodels. we model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singularisothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeyingluminosity dependent scaling laws. a homogeneously selected sample of 175 sneia from the first 3-years of the supernova legacy survey (snls) in the redshiftrange 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloesassociated with foreground galaxies. the best-fitting velocity dispersionscaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. we furtherfind that the normalisation of the velocity dispersion of passive and starforming galaxies are consistent with empirical faber-jackson and tully-fisherrelations, respectively. if we make no assumption on the normalisation of theserelations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 percent confidence level. using recent models of dust extinction we deduce thatthe impact of this effect on our results is very small. we also investigate thebrightness scatter of sne ia due to gravitational lensing. the gravitationallensing scatter is approximately proportional to the sn ia redshift. we findthe constant of proportionality to be b = 0.055 +0.039 -0.041 mag (b &lt; 0.12 magat the 95 per cent confidence level). if this model is correct, thecontribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of sne ia issmall for the snls sample.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1103.1797	the subluminous and peculiar type ia supernova ptf09dav	ptf09dav is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn) discovered by thepalomar transient factory (ptf). spectroscopically, it appears superficiallysimilar to the class of subluminous sn1991bg-like sne, but it has severalunusual features which make it stand out from this population. its peakluminosity is fainter than any previously discovered sn1991bg-like sn ia (m_b-15.5), but without the unusually red optical colors expected if the faintluminosity were due to extinction. the photospheric optical spectra have veryunusual strong lines of sc ii and mg i, with possible sr ii, together withstronger than average ti ii and low velocities of ~6000 km/s. the host galaxyof ptf09dav is ambiguous. the sn lies either on the extreme outskirts (~41kpc)of a spiral galaxy, or in an very faint (m_r&gt;-12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike other1991bg-like sne which are invariably associated with massive, old stellarpopulations. ptf09dav is also an outlier on the light-curve-width--luminosityand color--luminosity relations derived for other sub-luminous sne ia. theinferred 56ni mass is small (0.019+/-0.003msun), as is the estimated ejectamass of 0.36msun. taken together, these properties make ptf09dav a remarkableevent. we discuss various physical models that could explain ptf09dav. heliumshell detonation or deflagration on the surface of a co white-dwarf can explainsome of the features of ptf09dav, including the presence of sc and the lowphotospheric velocities, but the observed si and mg are not predicted to bevery abundant in these models. we conclude that no single model is currentlycapable of explaining all of the observed signatures of ptf09dav.

(2011). we use the 472 sne ia in this sample, accounting forrecently discovered correlations between sn ia luminosity and host galaxyproperties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertaintiesdirectly in the cosmological fits. combining the snls3 data with the full wmap7power spectrum, the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy powerspectrum, and a prior on the hubble constant h0 from shoes, in a flat universewe find omega_m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5% measure of thedark energy equation-of-state parameter w. the statistical and systematicuncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertaintiesdominated by the photometric calibration of the sn ia fluxes -- without thesecalibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. whenrelaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega_m=0.271+/-0.015,omega_k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. parameterizing the timeevolution of w as w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), gives w_0=-0.905+/-0.196,w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. all of our results are consistentwith a flat, w=-1 universe. the size of the snls3 sample allows various teststo be performed with the sne segregated according to their light curve and hostgalaxy properties. we find that the cosmological constraints derived from thesedifferent sub-samples are consistent. there is evidence that the coefficient,beta, relating sn ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at&gt;4sigma significance (in addition to the known sn luminosity--host relation);however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and iscurrently a sub-dominant systematic.

1106.4008	constraining type ia supernovae progenitors from three years of snls  data	while it is generally accepted that type ia supernovae are the result of theexplosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting mass in a binary system, thedetails of their genesis still elude us, and the nature of the binary companionis uncertain. kasen (2010) points out that the presence of a non-degeneratecompanion in the progenitor system could leave an observable trace: a fluxexcess in the early rise portion of the lightcurve caused by the ejecta impactwith the companion itself. this excess would be observable only under favorableviewing angles, and its intensity depends on the nature of the companion. wesearched for the signature of a non-degenerate companion in three years ofsupernova legacy survey data by generating synthetic lightcurves accounting forthe effects of shocking and comparing true and synthetic time series withkolmogorov-smirnov tests. our most constraining result comes from noting thatthe shocking effect is more prominent in rest-frame b than v band: we rule outa contribution from white dwarf-red giant binary systems to type ia supernovaexplosions greater than 10% at 2 sigma, and than 20% at 3 sigma level.

1109.0948	photometric selection of type ia supernovae in the supernova legacy  survey	we present a sample of 485 photometrically identified type ia supernovacandidates mined from the first three years of data of the cfht supernovalegacy survey (snls). the images were submitted to a deferred processingindependent of the snls real-time detection pipeline. light curves of alltransient events were reconstructed in the g_m, r_m, i_m and z_m filters andsubmitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possiblesupernovae. pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by lightcurve shape criteria. type ia supernova identification relied on eventcharacteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normalsne ia. the light curve fitter salt2 was used for this purpose, assigning hostgalaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. the selected sample of 485candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the snls spectroscopicidentification. the contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated tobe 4%. testing hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us tomeasure the malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. the resultis fully consistent with the precise monte carlo based estimate used to correctsn ia distance moduli in the snls 3-year cosmological analyses. this paperdemonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshiftsupernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects forcosmological analyses from future large photometric sn ia surveys.

1109.5757	the rise-time of normal and subluminous type ia supernovae	we calculate the average stretch-corrected rise-time of type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the supernova legacy survey. we use the aggregate lightcurves ofspectroscopic and photometrically identified sne ia to fit the rising part ofthe lightcurve with a simple quadratic model. we obtain a lightcurve shapecorrected, i .e. stretch-corrected, fiducial rise-time of 17.02^{+0.18}_{-0.28}(stat) days. the measured rise-time differs from an earlier finding by the snls(conley et al. 2006) due to the use of different sn ia templates. we compare itto nearby samples using the same methods and find no evolution in the earlypart of the lightcurve of sne ia up to z=1. we search for variations amongdifferent populations, particularly subluminous objects, by dividing the samplein stretch. bright and slow decliners (s&gt;1.0) have consistent stretch-correctedrise-times compared to fainter and faster decliners (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0); they areshorter by 0.57^{+0.47}_{-0.50} (stat) days. subluminous sne ia (here definedas objects with s&lt;0.8), although less constrained, are also consistent, with arise-time of 18.03^{+0.81}_{-1.37} (stat) days. we study several systematicbiases and find that the use of different fiducial templates may affect theaverage rise-time but not the intrinsic differences between populations. basedon our results, we estimate that subluminous sne ia are powered by 0.05-0.35solar masses of radioactive nickel synthesized in the explosion. ourconclusions are the same for the single-stretch and two-stretchparameterizations of the lightcurve.

0710.3896	verifying the cosmological utility of type ia supernovae: implications  of a dispersion in the ultraviolet spectra	we analyze the mean rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) spectrum of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and its dispersion using high signal-to-noise keck-i/lris-bspectroscopy for a sample of 36 events at intermediate redshift (z=0.5)discovered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey(snls). we introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in ourspectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the snls sne andtheir host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the uvspectral properties of a large sample of distant sne ia. although the mean snia spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history,precise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparablesample of high quality local spectra. within the high-redshift sample, wediscover significant uv spectral variations and exclude dust extinction as theprimary cause by examining trends with the optical sn color. althoughprogenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we seeare much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expectedpatterns. an interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength ofselected uv features with phase. we also demonstrate systematic differences inthe sn ia spectral features with sn light curve width in both the uv and theoptical. we show that these intrinsic variations could represent a statisticallimitation in the future use of high-redshift sne ia for precision cosmology.we conclude that further detailed studies are needed, both locally and atmoderate redshift where the rest-frame uv can be studied precisely, in orderthat future missions can confidently be planned to fully exploit sne ia ascosmological probes [abridged].

1112.4851	the palomar transient factory photometric calibration	the palomar transient factory (ptf) provides multiple epoch imaging for alarge fraction of the sky. here we describe the photometric calibration of theptf data products that relates the ptf magnitudes to other mag systems. thecalibration process utilizes sdss r~16 mag point source objects as photometricstandards. during photometric conditions, this allows us to solve for theextinction coefficients and color terms, and to estimate the cameraillumination correction. this also enables the calibration of fields that areoutside the sdss footprint. we test the precision and repeatability of the ptfphotometric calibration. given that ptf is observing in a single filter eachnight, we define a ptf calibrated magnitude system for r-band and g-band. weshow that, in this system, 59% (47%) of the photometrically calibrated ptfr-band (g-band) data achieve a photometric precision of 0.02-0.04 mag. giventhe objects' color, the ptf magnitude system can be converted to other systems.a night-by-night comparison of the calibrated magnitudes of individual starsobserved on multiple nights shows that they are consistent to a level of ~0.02mag. most of the data that were taken under non-photometric conditions can becalibrated relative to other epochs of the same sky footprint obtained duringphotometric conditions. we provide a guide describing the use of the ptfphotometric calibration data products, as well as the transformations betweenthe ptf magnitude system and the sdss and johnson-cousins systems.

1205.7040	hubble space telescope studies of low-redshift type ia supernovae:  evolution with redshift and ultraviolet spectral trends	we present an analysis of the maximum light, near ultraviolet (nuv; 2900-5500a) spectra of 32 low redshift (0.001&lt;z&lt;0.08) type ia supernovae (sne ia),obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst). we combine this spectroscopicsample with high-quality gri light curves obtained with robotic telescopes tomeasure photometric parameters, such as stretch, optical colour, andbrightness. by comparing our data to a comparable sample of sne ia atintermediate-z (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9), we detect modest spectral evolution (3-sigma), inthe sense that our mean low-z nuv spectrum has a depressed flux compared to itsintermediate-z counterpart. we also see a strongly increased dispersion aboutthe mean with decreasing wavelength, confirming the results of earlier surveys.these trends are consistent with changes in metallicity as predicted bycontemporary sn ia spectral models. we also examine the properties of variousnuv spectral diagnostics in the individual spectra. we find a generalcorrelation between stretch and the velocity (or position) of many nuv spectralfeatures. in particular, we observe that higher stretch sne have larger ca iih&amp;k velocities, that also correlate with host galaxy stellar mass. this lattertrend is probably driven by the well-established correlation between stretchand stellar mass. we find no trends between uv spectral features and opticalcolour. mean spectra constructed according to whether the sn has a positive ornegative hubble residual show very little difference at nuv wavelengths,indicating that the nuv evolution and variation we identify do not directlycorrelate with hubble residuals. our work confirms and strengthens earlierconclusions regarding the complex behaviour of sne ia in the nuv spectralregion, but suggests the correlations we find are more useful in constrainingprogenitor models than improving the use of sne ia as cosmological probes.

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1206.0748	x-ray emission from supernovae in dense circumstellar matter  environments: a search for collisionless shocks	(abridged). the optical light curve of some sne may be powered by the outwarddiffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock in optically thickcircumstellar matter (csm). recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediatedand -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into acollisionless shock and can produce hard x-rays. the x-rays are expected topeak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. here we report on asearch, using swift and chandra, for x-ray emission from 28 sne that belong toclasses whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense csm(iin/ibn/slsn-i). two sne in our sample have x-ray properties that are roughlyconsistent with the expectation for x-rays from a collisionless shock inoptically thick csm. therefore, we suggest that their optical light curves arepowered by shock breakout in csm. we show that two other events were too x-raybright during the sn maximum optical light to be explained by the shockbreakout model. we conclude that the light curves of some, but not all,type-iin/ibn sne are powered by shock breakout in csm. for the rest of the snein our sample, including all the slsn-i events, our x-ray limits are not deepenough and were typically obtained at too early times to conclude about theirnature. we argue that the optical light curves of sne, for which the x-rayemission peaks at late times, are likely powered by the diffusion of shockenergy from a dense csm. we comment about the possibility to detect some ofthese events in radio.

1208.4130	studying the diversity of type ia supernovae in the ultraviolet:  comparing models with observations	in the ultraviolet (uv), type ia supernovae (sne ia) show a much largerdiversity in their properties than in the optical. using a stationarymonte-carlo radiative transfer code, a grid of spectra at maximum light wascreated varying bolometric luminosity and the amount of metals in the outerlayers of the sn ejecta. this model grid is then compared to a sample ofhigh-redshift sne ia in order to test whether the observed diversities can beexplained by luminosity and metallicity changes alone. the dispersion inbroadband uv flux and colours at approximately constant optical spectrum can bereadily matched by the model grid. in particular, the uv1-b colour is found tobe a good tracer of metal content of the outer ejecta, which may in turnreflect on the metallicity of the sn progenitor. the models are less successfulin reproducing other observed trends, such as the wavelengths of key uvfeatures, which are dominated by reverse fluorescence photons from the optical,or intermediate band photometric indices. this can be explained in terms of thegreater sensitivity of these detailed observables to modest changes in therelative abundances. specifically, no single element is responsible for theobserved trends. due to their complex origin, these trends do not appear to begood indicators of either luminosity or metallicity.

1302.2983	pessto monitoring of sn 2012hn: further heterogeneity among faint type i  supernovae	we present optical and infrared monitoring data of sn 2012hn collected by thepublic eso spectroscopic survey for transient objects (pessto). we show that sn2012hn has a faint peak magnitude (mr ~ -15.7) and shows no hydrogen and noclear evidence for helium in its spectral evolution. instead, we detectprominent ca ii lines at all epochs, which relates this transient to previouslydescribed 'ca-rich' or 'gap' transients. however, the photospheric spectra(from -3 to +32 d with respect to peak) of sn 2012hn show a series ofabsorption lines which are unique, and a red continuum that is likely intrinsicrather than due to extinction. lines of ti ii and cr ii are visible. this maybe a temperature effect, which could also explain the red photospheric colour.a nebular spectrum at +150d shows prominent caii, oi, ci and possibly mgi lineswhich appear similar in strength to those displayed by core-collapse sne. toadd to the puzzle, sn 2012hn is located at a projected distance of 6 kpc froman e/s0 host and is not close to any obvious starforming region. overall sn2012hn resembles a group of faint h-poor sne that have been discovered recentlyand for which a convincing and consistent physical explanation is stillmissing. they all appear to explode preferentially in remote locations offsetfrom a massive host galaxy with deep limits on any dwarf host galaxies,favouring old progenitor systems. sn 2012hn adds heterogeneity to this sampleof objects. we discuss potential explosion channels including he-shelldetonations and double detonations of white dwarfs as well as peculiarcore-collapse sne.

0705.0367	is there evidence for a hubble bubble? the nature of type ia supernova  colors and dust in external galaxies	we examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of type iasupernovae (sne ia) for the $\sim 3 \sigma$ detection of a ``hubble bubble'' --a departure of the local value of the hubble constant from its globallyaveraged value \citep{jha:07}. by comparing the mlcs2k2 fits used in that studyto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, wedemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of sn color excesses(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of acolor gradient across the local sample. if the slope of the linear relation($\beta$) between sn color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then thebubble disappears. if, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely frommilky way-like dust, then sn data clearly favors a hubble bubble. wedemonstrate that sn data give $\beta \simeq 2$, instead of the $\beta \simeq 4$one would expect from purely milky-way-like dust. this suggests that either snintrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a singlelight-curve shape parameter, or that dust around sn is unusual. disentanglingthese possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey snia cosmology.

1306.5655	superb technical design report	in this technical design report (tdr) we describe the superb detector thatwas to be installed on the superb e+e- high luminosity collider. the superbasymmetric collider, which was to be constructed on the tor vergata campus nearthe infn frascati national laboratory, was designed to operate both at theupsilon(4s) center-of-mass energy with a luminosity of 10^{36} cm^{-2}s^{-1}and at the tau/charm production threshold with a luminosity of 10^{35}cm^{-2}s^{-1}. this high luminosity, producing a data sample about a factor 100larger than present b factories, would allow investigation of new physicseffects in rare decays, cp violation and lepton flavour violation. thisdocument details the detector design presented in the conceptual design report(cdr) in 2007. the r&amp;d and engineering studies performed to arrive at the fulldetector design are described, and an updated cost estimate is presented.  a combination of a more realistic cost estimates and the unavailability offunds due of the global economic climate led to a formal cancelation of theproject on nov 27, 2012.

1307.2247	sn 2010jl: optical to hard x-ray observations reveal an explosion  embedded in a ten solar mass cocoon	(abridged) some supernovae (sne) may be powered by the interaction of the snejecta with a large amount of circumstellar matter (csm). here we outline amethod to measure the mass of the optically thick csm around such sne. wepresent observations of sn2010jl, including the first detection of a sn usingnustar. the total radiated luminosity of sn2010jl is extreme, at least 9e50erg. by modeling the visible-light data, we robustly show that the mass of thecircumstellar material within ~1e16 cm of the progenitor was in excess of 10solar masses, likely ejected tens of years prior to the sn explosion. ourmodeling suggests that the shock velocity during shock breakout was ~6000 km/s,decelerating to ~2600 km/s about two years after maximum light. our late-timenustar+xmm spectra of the sn presumably provide the first direct measurement ofsn shock velocity two years after the sn maximum light -- measured to be in therange of 2000 to 4500 km/s if the ions and electrons are in equilibrium, and&gt;~2000 km/s if they are not in equilibrium. this measurement is in agreementwith the shock velocity predicted by our modeling of the optical data. we alsoshow that the mean radial density distribution of the csm roughly follows anr^-2 law. a possible explanation for the massive csm with a wind-like profileis that they are the result of multiple pulsational pair instability eventsprior to the sn explosion, separated from each other by years.

1307.2366	a multi-wavelength investigation of the radio-loud supernova ptf11qcj  and its circumstellar environment	we present the discovery, classification, and extensive panchromatic (fromradio to x-ray) follow-up observations of ptf11qcj, a supernova discovered bythe palomar transient factory. ptf11qcj is located at a distance of dl ~ 124mpc. our observations with the karl g. jansky very large array show that thisevent is radio-loud: ptf11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable tothat of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated supernova 1998bw (l_{5ghz} ~10^{29} erg/s/hz). ptf11qcj is also detected in x-rays with the chandraobservatory, and in the infrared band with spitzer. our multi-wavelengthanalysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material. theradio observations suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of ~10^{-4} msun/yr x(v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest moving ejecta(at ~10d after explosion). however, these estimates are derived assuming thesimplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellarmaterial characterized by radial power-law density profile, and do not accountfor possible inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.the radio light curve shows deviations from such a simple model, as well as are-brightening at late times. the x-ray flux from ptf11qcj is compatible withthe high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission (within thelarge uncertainties). an ir light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreementwith our infrared data. our analysis of pre-explosion data from the palomartransient factory suggests that a precursor eruption of absolute magnitude m_r~ -13 mag may have occurred ~ 2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion. based onour panchromatic follow-up campaign, we conclude that ptf11qcj fits theexpectations from the explosion of a wolf-rayet star. precursor eruptions maybe a feature characterizing the final pre-explosion evolution of such stars.

1310.0470	two superluminous supernovae from the early universe discovered by the  supernova legacy survey	we present spectra and lightcurves of snls 06d4eu and snls 07d2bv, twohydrogen-free superluminous supernovae discovered by the supernova legacysurvey. at z = 1.588, snls 06d4eu is the highest redshift superluminous sn witha spectrum, at m_u = -22.7 is one of the most luminous sne ever observed, andgives a rare glimpse into the restframe ultraviolet where these supernovae putout their peak energy. snls 07d2bv does not have a host galaxy redshift, butbased on the supernova spectrum, we estimate it to be at z ~ 1.5. bothsupernovae have similar observer-frame griz lightcurves, which map to restframelightcurves in the u-band and uv, rising in ~ 20 restframe days or longer, anddeclining over a similar timescale. the lightcurves peak in the shortestwavelengths first, consistent with an expanding blackbody starting near 15,000k and steadily declining in temperature. we compare the spectra to theoreticalmodels, and identify lines of c ii, c iii, fe iii, and mg ii in the spectrum ofsnls 06d4eu and scp 06f6, and find that they are consistent with an expandingexplosion of only a few solar masses of carbon, oxygen, and other trace metals.thus the progenitors appear to be related to those suspected for sne ic. a highkinetic energy, 10^52 ergs, is also favored. normal mechanisms of poweringcore- collapse or thermonuclear supernovae do not seem to work for thesesupernovae. we consider models powered by 56ni decay and interaction withcircumstellar material, but find that the creation and spin-down of a magnetarwith a period of 2ms, magnetic field of 2 x 10^14 gauss, and a 3 solar massprogenitor provides the best fit to the data.

0801.4968	type ia supernovae rates and galaxy clustering from the cfht supernova  legacy survey	the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey (snls) has createda large homogeneous database of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0) type iasupernovae (sne ia). the snls team has shown that correlations exist between snia rates, properties, and host galaxy star formation rates. the snls sn iadatabase has now been combined with a photometric redshift galaxy catalog andan optical galaxy cluster catalog to investigate the possible influence ofgalaxy clustering on the sn ia rate, over and above the expected effect due tothe dependence of sfr on clustering through the morphology-density relation. weidentify three cluster sne ia, plus three additional possible cluster sne ia,and find the sn ia rate per unit mass in clusters at intermediate redshifts isconsistent with the rate per unit mass in field early-type galaxies and the snia cluster rate from low redshift cluster targeted surveys. we also find thenumber of sne ia in cluster environments to be within a factor of two ofexpectations from the two component snia rate model.

1311.6344	the host galaxies of type ia supernovae discovered by the palomar  transient factory	we present spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies of 82 low-redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the palomar transient factory (ptf).we determine star-formation rates, gas-phase/stellar metallicities, and stellarmasses and ages of these objects. as expected, strong correlations between thesn ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found:fainter, faster-declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-richgalaxies. there is some evidence that redder sne ia explode in highermetallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the sn colour and hostgalaxy extinction based on the balmer decrement, suggesting that the colourvariation of these sne does not primarily arise from this source. sne ia inhigher-mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colourcorrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the strongercorrelation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the moreimportant variable. we also compared the host stellar mass distribution to thatin galaxy targeted sn surveys and the high-redshift untargeted supernova legacysurvey (snls). snls has many more low mass galaxies, while the targetedsearches have fewer. this can be explained by an evolution in the galaxystellar mass function, coupled with a sn delay-time distribution proportionalto $t^{-1}$. finally, we found no significant difference in themass--metallicity relation of our sn ia hosts compared to field galaxies,suggesting any metallicity effect on the sn ia rate is small.

1401.4064	improved cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the sdss-ii  and snls supernova samples	we present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type iasupernova (sn ia) observations obtained by the sdss-ii and snls collaborations.the data set includes several low-redshift samples (z&lt;0.1), all 3 seasons fromthe sdss-ii (0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.4), and 3 years from snls (0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1) and totals\ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae with high quality lightcurves. we have followed the methods and assumptions of the snls 3-year dataanalysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition ofthe full sdss-ii spectroscopically-confirmed sn ia sample in both the trainingof the salt2 light curve model and in the hubble diagram analysis (\nsdsscsne), 2) inter-calibration of the snls and sdss surveys and reduced systematicuncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect tothe cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errorsassociated with the salt2 modeling of sn ia light-curves. we producerecalibrated sn ia light-curves and associated distances for the sdss-ii andsnls samples. the large sdss-ii sample provides an effective, independent,low-z anchor for the hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error fromcalibration systematics in the low-z sn sample. for a flat lcdm cosmology wefind omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recentcmb measurement from the planck and wmap experiments. our result is 1.8sigma(stat+sys) different than the previously published result of snls 3-year data.the change is due primarily to improvements in the snls photometriccalibration. when combined with cmb constraints, we measure a constantdark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flatuniverse. adding bao distance measurements gives similar constraints:w=-1.027+-0.055.

1401.5468	precursors prior to type iin supernova explosions are common: precursor  rates, properties, and correlations	there is a growing number of supernovae (sne), mainly of type iin, whichpresent an outburst prior to their presumably final explosion. these precursorsmay affect the sn display, and are likely related to some poorly chartedphenomena in the final stages of stellar evolution. here we present a sample of16 sne iin for which we have palomar transient factory (ptf) observationsobtained prior to the sn explosion. by coadding these images taken prior to theexplosion in time bins, we search for precursor events. we find five type iinsne that likely have at least one possible precursor event, three of which arereported here for the first time. for each sn we calculate the control time.based on this analysis we find that precursor events among sne iin are common:at the one-sided 99% confidence level, more than 50% of sne iin have at leastone pre-explosion outburst that is brighter than absolute magnitude -14, takingplace up to 1/3 yr prior to the sn explosion. the average rate of suchprecursor events during the year prior to the sn explosion is likely largerthan one per year, and fainter precursors are possibly even more common. wealso find possible correlations between the integrated luminosity of theprecursor, and the sn total radiated energy, peak luminosity, and rise time.these correlations are expected if the precursors are mass-ejection events, andthe early-time light curve of these sne is powered by interaction of the snshock and ejecta with optically thick circumstellar material.

1404.1002	early ultraviolet emission in the type ia supernova lsq12gdj: no  evidence for ongoing shock interaction	we present photospheric-phase observations of lsq12gdj, a slowly-declining,uv-bright type ia supernova. classified well before maximum light, lsq12gdj hasextinction-corrected absolute magnitude $m_b = -19.8$, and pre-maximumspectroscopic evolution similar to sn 1991t and the super-chandrasekhar-mass sn2007if. we use ultraviolet photometry from swift, ground-based opticalphotometry, and corrections from a near-infrared photometric template toconstruct the bolometric (1600-23800 \aa) light curve out to 45 days past$b$-band maximum light. we estimate that lsq12gdj produced $0.96 \pm 0.07$$m_\odot$ of $^{56}$ni, with an ejected mass near or slightly above thechandrasekhar mass. as much as 27% of the flux at the earliest observed phases,and 17% at maximum light, is emitted bluewards of 3300 \aa. the absence ofexcess luminosity at late times, the cutoff of the spectral energy distributionbluewards of 3000 \aa, and the absence of narrow line emission and strong na id absorption all argue against a significant contribution from ongoing shockinteraction. however, up to 10% of lsq12gdj's luminosity near maximum lightcould be produced by the release of trapped radiation, including kinetic energythermalized during a brief interaction with a compact, hydrogen-poor envelope(radius $&lt; 10^{13}$ cm) shortly after explosion; such an envelope arisesgenerically in double-degenerate merger scenarios.

1404.4085	interaction-powered supernovae: rise-time vs. peak-luminosity  correlation and the shock-breakout velocity	interaction of supernova (sn) ejecta with the optically thick circumstellarmedium (csm) of a progenitor star can result in a bright, long-lived shockbreakout event. candidates for such sne include type iin and superluminous sne.if some of these sne are powered by interaction, then there should be arelation between their peak luminosity, bolometric light-curve rise time, andshock-breakout velocity. given that the shock velocity during shock breakout isnot measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between therise time and the peak luminosity of these sne. here, we present a sample of 15sne iin for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peakluminosity from observations obtained using the palomar transient factory. wereport on a possible correlation between the r-band rise time and peakluminosity of these sne, with a false-alarm probability of 3%. assuming thatthese sne are powered by interaction, combining these observables and theoryallows us to deduce lower limits on the shock-breakout velocity. the lowerlimits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected forsne (i.e., ~10^4 km/s). this supports the suggestion that the early-time lightcurves of sne iin are caused by shock breakout in a dense csm. we note thatsuch a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms. performing such atest on other classes of sne (e.g., superluminous sne) can be used to rule outthe interaction model for a class of events.

1405.1325	super-luminous supernovae from pessto	we present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poorsuper-luminous supernovae followed by the public eso spectroscopic survey oftransient objects (pessto). time series spectroscopy from a few days aftermaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,with spectra dominated by ca ii, mg ii, fe ii and si ii, which evolve slowlyover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. we determine bolometric lightcurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy inputby magnetar spin-down, 56ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaquecircumstellar shell. we investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of oursample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain thepossible mechanisms behind these events. we have followed these events tobeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fadingsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diversebehaviour at this phase. models powered by radioactivity require unrealisticparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previousstudies. both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to beviable candidates. a large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phaseluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapiddrop in flux. this would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, orthat the x-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. the lightcurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d aftermaximum light. we argue that this could result either from multiple shells ofcircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of theejecta.

0803.3441	sifto: an empirical method for fitting sne ia light curves	we present sifto, a new empirical method for modeling type ia supernovae (sneia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. we make use ofhigh-redshift sn observations when training the model, allowing us to extend itbluer than rest frame u. this increases the utility of our high-redshift snobservations by allowing us to use more of the available data. we find thatwhen the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription,applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description.sifto therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies differentstretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter andthe stretch in the rest-frame b band. we compare sifto to other publishedlight-curve models by applying them to the same set of sn photometry, anddemonstrate that sifto and salt2 perform better than the alternatives whenjudged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. wefurther demonstrate that when sifto and salt2 are trained on the same data setthe cosmological results agree.

1410.0091	type ia supernova spectral features in the context of their host galaxy  properties	we analyse spectroscopic measurements of 122 type ia supernovae (sne ia) withz&lt;0.09 discovered by the palomar transient factory, focusing on the propertiesof the si ii 6355 and ca ii `near-infrared triplet' absorptions. we examine thevelocities of the photospheric si ii 6355, and the velocities and strengths ofthe photospheric and high-velocity ca ii, in the context of the stellar mass(mstellar) and star-formation rate (sfr) of the sn host galaxies, as well asthe position of the sn within its host. we find that sne ia with faster si ii6355 tend to explode in more massive galaxies, with the highest velocity eventsonly occuring in galaxies with mstellar &gt; 3*10^9 solar mass. we also find someevidence that these highest velocity sne ia explode in the inner regions oftheir host galaxies, similar to the study of wang et al. (2013), although thetrend is not as significant in our data. we show that these trends areconsistent with some sn ia spectral models, if the host galaxy stellar mass isinterpreted as a proxy for host galaxy metallicity. we study the strength ofthe high-velocity component of the ca ii near-ir absorption, and show that sneia with stronger high-velocity components relative to photospheric componentsare hosted by galaxies with low stellar mass, blue colour, and a high ssfr.such sne are therefore likely to arise from the youngest progenitor systems.this argues against a pure orientation effect being responsible forhigh-velocity features in sn ia spectra and, when combined with other studies,is consistent with a scenario where high-velocity features are related to aninteraction between the sn ejecta and circumstellar medium (csm) local to thesn.

1411.1064	the rising light curves of type ia supernovae	we present an analysis of the early, rising light curves of 18 type iasupernovae (sne ia) discovered by the palomar transient factory (ptf) and thela silla-quest variability survey (lsq). we fit these early data flux using asimple power-law $(f(t) = {\alpha\times t^n})$ to determine the time of firstlight $({t_0})$, and hence the rise-time $({t_{rise}})$ from first light topeak luminosity, and the exponent of the power-law rise ($n$). we find a meanuncorrected rise time of $18.98 {\pm} 0.54$ days, with individual sn rise-timesranging from $15.98$ to $24.7$ days. the exponent n shows significantdepartures from the simple 'fireball model' of $n = 2$ (or ${f(t) \proptot^2}$) usually assumed in the literature. with a mean value of $n = 2.44 {\pm}0.13$, our data also show significant diversity from event to event. thisdeviation has implications for the distribution of 56ni throughout the snejecta, with a higher index suggesting a lesser degree of 56ni mixing. therange of n found also confirms that the 56ni distribution is not standardthroughout the population of sne ia, in agreement with earlier work measuringsuch abundances through spectral modelling. we also show that the duration ofthe very early light curve, before the luminosity has reached half of itsmaximal value, does not correlate with the light curve shape or stretch used tostandardise sne ia in cosmological applications. this has implications for thecosmological fitting of sn ia light curves.

1501.07232	des13s2cmm: the first superluminous supernova from the dark energy  survey	we present des13s2cmm, the first spectroscopically-confirmed superluminoussupernova (slsn) from the dark energy survey (des). we briefly discuss the dataand search algorithm used to find this event in the first year of desoperations, and outline the spectroscopic data obtained from the europeansouthern observatory (eso) very large telescope to confirm its redshift (z =0.663 +/- 0.001 based on the host-galaxy emission lines) and likely spectraltype (type i). using this redshift, we find m_u_peak = -21.05 +0.10 -0.09 forthe peak, rest-frame u-band absolute magnitude, and find des13s2cmm to belocated in a faint, low metallicity (sub-solar), low stellar-mass host galaxy(log(m/m_sun) = 9.3 +/- 0.3); consistent with what is seen for other slsne-i.we compare the bolometric light curve of des13s2cmm to fourteen similarlywell-observed slsne-i in the literature and find it possesses one of theslowest declining tails (beyond +30 days rest frame past peak), and is thefaintest at peak. moreover, we find the bolometric light curves of all slsne-istudied herein possess a dispersion of only 0.2-0.3 magnitudes between +25 and+30 days after peak (rest frame) depending on redshift range studied; thiscould be important for 'standardising' such supernovae, as is done with themore common type ia. we fit the bolometric light curve of des13s2cmm with twocompeting models for slsne-i - the radioactive decay of 56ni, and a magnetar -and find that while the magnetar is formally a better fit, neither modelprovides a compelling match to the data. although we are unable to conclusivelydifferentiate between these two physical models for this particular slsn-i,further des observations of more slsne-i should break this degeneracy,especially if the light curves of slsne-i can be observed beyond 100 days inthe rest frame of the supernova.

1502.06034	a comparative study of type ii-p and ii-l supernova rise times as  exemplified by the case of lsq13cuw	we report on our findings based on the analysis of observations of the typeii-l supernova lsq13cuw within the framework of currently accepted physicalpredictions of core-collapse supernova explosions. lsq13cuw was discoveredwithin a day of explosion, hitherto unprecedented for type ii-l supernovae.this motivated a comparative study of type ii-p and ii-l supernovae withrelatively well-constrained explosion epochs and rise times to maximum(optical) light. from our sample of twenty such events, we find evidence of apositive correlation between the duration of the rise and the peak brightness.on average, sne ii-l tend to have brighter peak magnitudes and longer risetimes than sne ii-p. however, this difference is clearest only at the extremeends of the rise time versus peak brightness relation. using two differentanalytical models, we performed a parameter study to investigate the physicalparameters that control the rise time behaviour. in general, the modelsqualitatively reproduce aspects of the observed trends. we find that thebrightness of the optical peak increases for larger progenitor radii andexplosion energies, and decreases for larger masses. the dependence of the risetime on mass and explosion energy is smaller than the dependence on theprogenitor radius. we find no evidence that the progenitors of sne ii-l havesignificantly smaller radii than those of sne ii-p.

1503.02293	strong near-infrared carbon in the type ia supernova iptf13ebh	we present near-infrared (nir) time-series spectroscopy, as well ascomplementary ultraviolet (uv), optical, and nir data, of the type ia supernova(sn ia) iptf13ebh, which was discovered within two days from the estimated timeof explosion. the first nir spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosionand may be the earliest nir spectrum yet obtained of a sn ia. the most strikingfeatures in the spectrum are several nir c i lines, and the c i {\lambda}1.0693{\mu}m line is the strongest ever observed in a sn ia. interestingly, no strongoptical c ii counterparts were found, even though the optical spectroscopictime series began early and is densely-cadenced. except at the very earlyepochs, within a few days from the time of explosion, we show that the strongnir c i compared to the weaker optical c ii appears to be general in sne ia.iptf13ebh is a fast decliner with {\delta}m15(b) = 1.79 $\pm$ 0.01, and itsabsolute magnitude obeys the linear part of the width-luminosity relation. itis therefore categorized as a "transitional" event, on the fast-declining endof normal sne ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like objects. iptf13ebh showsnir spectroscopic properties that are distinct from both the normal andsubluminous/91bg-like classes, bridging the observed characteristics of the twoclasses. these nir observations suggest composition and density of the innercore similar to that of 91bg-like events, and a deep reaching carbon burninglayer not observed in slower declining sne ia. there is also a substantialdifference between the explosion times inferred from the early-time light curveand the velocity evolution of the si ii {\lambda}0.6355 {\mu}m line, implying along dark phase of ~ 4 days.

1504.02101	diversity in extinction laws of type ia supernovae measured between  $0.2$ and $2\,\mu\mathrm{m}$	we present ultraviolet (uv) observations of six nearby type~ia supernovae(sne~ia) obtained with the hubble space telescope, three of which were alsoobserved in the near-ir (nir) with wide-field camera~3. uv observations withthe swift satellite, as well as ground-based optical and near-infrared dataprovide complementary information. the combined data-set covers the wavelengthrange $0.2$--$2~\mu$m. by also including archival data of sn 2014j, we analysea sample spanning observed colour excesses up to $e(b-v)=1.4~$mag. we study thewavelength dependent extinction of each individual sn and find a diversity ofreddening laws when characterised by the total-to-selective extinction $r_v$.in particular, we note that for the two sne with $e(b-v)\gtrsim1~$mag, forwhich the colour excess is dominated by dust extinction, we find$r_v=1.4\pm0.1$ and $r_v=2.8\pm0.1$. adding uv photometry reduces theuncertainty of fitted $r_v$ by $\sim50\,$% allowing us to also measure $r_v$ ofindividual low-extinction objects which point to a similar diversity, currentlynot accounted for in the analyses when sne~ia are used for studying theexpansion history of the universe.

1504.04857	nebular spectra and abundance tomography of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe: a normal sn ia with a stable fe core	a series of optical and one near-infrared nebular spectra covering the firstyear of the type ia supernova sn 2011fe are presented and modelled. the densityprofile that proved best for the early optical/ultraviolet spectra, "rho-11fe",was extended to lower velocities to include the regions that emit at nebularepochs. model rho-11fe is intermediate between the fast deflagration model w7and a low-energy delayed-detonation. good fits to the nebular spectra areobtained if the innermost ejecta are dominated by neutron-rich, stable fe-groupspecies, which contribute to cooling but not to heating. the correct thermalbalance can thus be reached for the strongest [feii] and [feiii] lines to bereproduced with the observed ratio. the 56ni mass thus obtained is 0.47 +/-0.05 mo. the bulk of 56ni has an outermost velocity of ~8500 km/s. the mass ofstable iron is 0.23 +/- 0.03 mo. stable ni has low abundance, ~10^{-2} mo. thisis sufficient to reproduce an observed emission line near 7400 a. asub-chandrasekhar explosion model with mass 1.02 mo and no central stable fedoes not reproduce the observed line ratios. a mock model where neutron-richfe-group species are located above 56ni following recent suggestions is alsoshown to yield spectra that are less compatible with the observations. thedensities and abundances in the inner layers obtained from the nebularanalysis, combined with those of the outer layers previously obtained, are usedto compute a synthetic bolometric light curve, which compares favourably withthe light curve of sn 2011fe.

1505.01078	lsq14bdq: a type ic super-luminous supernova with a double-peaked light  curve	we present data for lsq14bdq, a hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernova (slsn)discovered by the la silla quest survey and classified by the public esospectroscopic survey of transient objects. the spectrum and light curve arevery similar to slow-declining slsne such as ptf12dam. however, detectionswithin ~1 day after explosion show a bright and relatively fast initial peak,lasting for ~15 days, prior to the usual slow rise to maximum light. thebroader, main peak can be fit with either central engine or circumstellarinteraction models. we discuss the implications of the precursor peak in thecontext of these models. it is too bright and narrow to be explained as anormal 56ni-powered sn, and we suggest that interaction models may struggle tofit the two peaks simultaneously. we propose that the initial peak may arisefrom the post-shock cooling of extended stellar material, and reheating by acentral engine drives the second peak. in this picture, we show that anexplosion energy of ~2x10^{52} erg and a progenitor radius of a few hundredsolar radii would be required to power the early emission. the competing enginemodels involve rapidly spinning magnetars (neutron stars) or fall-backaccretion onto a central black hole. the prompt energy required may favour theblack hole scenario. the bright initial peak effectively rules out a compactwolf-rayet star as a progenitor, since the inferred energies and ejected massesbecome unphysical.

1505.02988	the rise-time of type ii supernovae	we investigate the early-time light-curves of a large sample of 223 type iisupernovae (sne) from the sloan digital sky survey and the supernova legacysurvey. having a cadence of a few days and sufficient non-detections prior toexplosion, we constrain rise-times, i.e. the durations from estimated first tomaximum light, as a function of effective wavelength. at restframe g-band(4722a), we find a distribution of fast rise-times with median of (7.5+/-0.3)days. comparing these durations with analytical shock models of rabinak andwaxman (2013); nakar and sari (2010) and hydrodynamical models of tominaga etal. (2009), which are mostly sensitive to progenitor radius at these epochs, wefind a median characteristic radius of less than 400 solar radii. the inferredradii are on average much smaller than the radii obtained for observed redsupergiants (rsg). investigating the post-maximum slopes as a function ofeffective wavelength in the light of theoretical models, we find that massivehydrogen envelopes are still needed to explain the plateaus of sne ii. wetherefore argue that the sn ii rise-times we observe are either a) the shockcooling resulting from the core collapse of rsg with small and dense envelopes,or b) the delayed and prolonged shock breakout of the collapse of a rsg with anextended atmosphere or embedded within pre-sn circumstellar material.

1507.05137	the difference imaging pipeline for the transient search in the dark  energy survey	we describe the difference imaging pipeline (diffimg) used to detecttransients in deep images from the dark energy survey supernova program(des-sn) in its first observing season from aug 2013 through feb 2014. des-snis a search for transients in which ten 3-deg^2 fields are repeatedly observedin the g,r,i,z passbands with a cadence of about 1 week. the observing strategyhas been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts forthousands of type ia supernova (sn ia) with the goal of measuring dark energyparameters. the essential diffimg functions are to align each search image to adeep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine thesubtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects.the vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selectionrequirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are130 detections per deg^2 per observation in each band, of which only 25% areartifacts. of the 7500 transients discovered by des-sn in its first observingseason, each requiring a detection on at least 2 separate nights, monte carlosimulations predict that 27% are expected to be supernova. another 30% of thetransients are artifacts, and most of the remaining transients are agn andvariable stars. fake sne ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluatedetection efficiencies, and to understand the diffimg performance. the diffimgefficiency measured with fake sne agrees well with expectations from a montecarlo simulation that uses analytical calculations of the fluxes and theiruncertainties. in our 8 "shallow" fields with single-epoch 50% completenessdepth 23.5, the sn ia efficiency falls to 1/2 at redshift z 0.7, in our 2"deep" fields with mag-depth 24.5, the efficiency falls to 1/2 at z 1.1.

0805.3983	clustering of supernova ia host galaxies	for the first time the cross-correlation between type ia supernova hostgalaxies and surrounding field galaxies is measured using the supernova legacysurvey sample. over the z=0.2 to 0.9 redshift range we find that supernovahosts are correlated an average of 60% more strongly than similarly selectedfield galaxies over the 3-100 arcsec range and about a factor of 3 morestrongly below 10 arcsec. the correlation errors are empirically establishedwith a jackknife analysis of the four snls fields. the hosts are morecorrelated than the field at a significance of 99% in the fitted amplitude andslope, with the point-by-point difference of the two correlation functionshaving a reduced $\chi^2$ for 8 degrees of freedom of 4.3, which has aprobability of random occurrence of less than 3x10^{-5}. the correlation angleis 1.5+/-0.5 arcsec, which deprojects to a fixed co-moving correlation lengthof approximately 6.5+/- 2/h mpc. weighting the field galaxies with the mass andstar formation rate supernova frequencies of the simple a+b model produces goodagreement with the observed clustering. we conclude that these supernovaclustering differences are primarily the expected outcome of the dependence ofsupernova rates on galaxy masses and stellar populations with their clusteringenvironment.

1508.04774	spectral models for early time sn 2011fe observations	we use observed uv through near ir spectra to examine whether sn 2011fe canbe understood in the framework of branch-normal sne ia and to examine itsindividual peculiarities. as a benchmark, we use a delayed-detonation modelwith a progenitor metallicity of z_solar/20. we study the sensitivity offeatures to variations in progenitor metallicity, the outer density profile,and the distribution of radioactive nickel. the effect of metallicityvariations in the progenitor have a relatively small effect on the syntheticspectra. we also find that the abundance stratification of sn 2011fe resemblesclosely that of a delayed detonation model with a transition density that hasbeen fit to other branch-normal type ia supernovae. at early times, the modelphotosphere is formed in material with velocities that are too high, indicatingthat the photosphere recedes too slowly or that sn 2011fe has a lower specificenergy in the outer ~0.1 m_sun than does the model. we discuss severalexplanations for the discrepancies. finally, we examine variations in both thespectral energy distribution and in the colors due to variations in theprogenitor metallicity, which suggests that colors are only weak indicators forthe progenitor metallicity, in the particular explosion model that we havestudied. we do find that the flux in the u band is significantly higher atmaximum light in the solar metallicity model than in the lower metallicitymodel and the lower metallicity model much better matches the observedspectrum.

1512.00733	type ii supernova energetics and comparison of light curves to  shock-cooling models	during the first few days after explosion, type ii supernovae (sne) aredominated by relatively simple physics. theoretical predictions regardingearly-time sn light curves in the ultraviolet (uv) and optical bands are thusquite robust. we present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $r$-band type iisn light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $&gt;5$detections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrainedtime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. we show that the energy per unit mass($e/m$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-timeoptical data to the model of rabinak &amp; waxman (2011), while the progenitorradius cannot be determined based on $r$-band data alone. we find that type iisn explosion energies span a range of $e/m=(0.2-20)\times 10^{51} \;\rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\left\langlee/m \right\rangle = 0.85\times 10^{51} \; \rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), corrected formalmquist bias. assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates alarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. moreover, $e/m$ is positivelycorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\rm{ni}$ produced in the explosion, aspredicted by some recent models of core-collapse sne. we further presentseveral empirical correlations. the peak magnitude is correlated with thedecline rate ($\delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with therise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peakmagnitude. faster declining sne are more luminous and have longer rise times.this limits the possible power sources for such events.

1512.00846	flash spectroscopy: emission lines from the ionized circumstellar  material around $&lt;10$-day-old type ii supernovae	supernovae (sne) embedded in dense circumstellar material (csm) may showprominent emission lines in their early-time spectra ($\leq 10$ days after theexplosion), owing to recombination of the csm ionized by the shock-breakoutflash. from such spectra ("flash spectroscopy"), we can measure variousphysical properties of the csm, as well as the mass-loss rate of the progenitorduring the year prior to its explosion. searching through the palomar transientfactory (ptf and iptf) sn spectroscopy databases from 2009 through 2014, wefound 12 type ii sne showing flash-ionized (fi) signatures in their firstspectra. all are younger than 10 days. these events constitute 14\% of all 84sne in our sample having a spectrum within 10 days from explosion, and 18\% ofsne~ii observed at ages $&lt;5$ days, thereby setting lower limits on the fractionof fi events. we classified as "blue/featureless" (bf) those events having afirst spectrum which is similar to that of a black body, without any emissionor absorption signatures. it is possible that some bf events had fi signaturesat an earlier phase than observed, or that they lack dense csm around theprogenitor. within 2 days after explosion, 8 out of 11 sne in our sample areeither bf events or show fi signatures. interestingly, we found that 19 out of21 sne brighter than an absolute magnitude $m_r=-18.2$ belong to the fi or bfgroups, and that all fi events peaked above $m_r=-17.6$ mag, significantlybrighter than average sne~ii.

0808.2129	is there a redshift cutoff for submillimetre galaxies?	we present new optical and infrared photometry for a statistically completesample of seven 1.1 mm selected sources with accurate submillimetre arraycoordinates. we determine photometric redshifts for four of the seven sourcesof 4.47, 4.50, 1.49 and 0.64. of the other three sources two are undetected atoptical wavelengths down to the limits of very deep subaru andcanada-france-hawaii telescope images ($\sim$27 mag ab, i band) and thephotometry of the remaining source is corrupted by a bright nearby galaxy. thesources with the highest redshifts are at higher redshifts than all but one ofthe $\sim$200 sources taken from the largest recent 850 $\mu$m surveys, whichmay indicate that 1.1 mm surveys are more efficient at finding sources at veryhigh redshifts than 850 $\mu$m surveys. we investigate the evolution of thenumber density with redshift of our sample using a banded $v_{e}/v_{a}$analysis and find no evidence for a redshift cutoff, although the number ofsources is very small. we also perform the same analysis on a statisticallycomplete sample of 38 galaxies selected at 850$\mu$m from the goods-n field andfind evidence for a drop-off in the number density beyond $z\sim1$ and 2 forhot and cold dust dominated smgs respectively, confirming the earlierconclusion of wall, pope &amp; scott. we also find strong evidence for theexistence of two differently evolving sub-populations separated in luminosity,with a higher relative density of the high luminosity galaxies at higherredshifts.

astro-ph;0211444	the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae as a function of host galaxy  morphology	(abridged) we present new results on the hubble diagram of distant type iasupernovae (sne ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. this makesit possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitlycomparing sne residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with thelarger sample. the cosmological parameters derived from these sne ia hosted bypresumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for acosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and theinternal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (a_b&lt;0.2).thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely tosystematically dim distant sne ia in a manner that would produce a spuriouscosmological constant. we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant snediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) using the combination ofhst stis imaging, keck esi spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.we compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 sne ia. the scatter observed in thesne ia hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. we findthe scatter in the sne ia hubble diagram is smallest for sne occurring inearly-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.moreover, sne residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 magbrighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those inlate-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in thelate-type systems.

astro-ph;0307377	the phoenix deep survey: x-ray properties of faint radio sources	in this paper we use a 50ks xmm-newton pointing overlapping with the phoenixdeep survey, a homogeneous radio survey reaching mujy sensitivities, to explorethe x-ray properties and the evolution of star-forming galaxies. uv, opticaland nir photometry is available and is used to estimate photometric redshiftsand spectral types for radio sources brighter than r=21.5mag (total of 82).sources with r&lt;21.5mag and spiral galaxy seds (34) are grouped into tworedshift bins with a median of z=0.240 and 0.455 respectively. stackinganalysis for both the 0.5-2 and 2-8kev bands is performed on these subsamples.a high confidence level signal (&gt;3.5sigma) is detected in the 0.5-2kev bandcorresponding to a mean flux of ~3e-16cgs for both subsamples. this fluxtranslates to mean luminosities of ~5e40 and 1.5e41cgs for the z=0.240 and0.455 subsamples respectively. only a marginally significant signal (2.6sigma)is detected in the 2-8kev band for the z=0.455 subsample. we argue that thestacked signal above is dominated by star-formation. the mean l_x/l_b ratio andthe mean l_x of the two subsamples are found to be higher than opticallyselected spirals and similar to starbursts. we also find that the mean l_x andl_1.4 of the faint radio sources studied here are consistent with the l_x-l_1.4correlation of local star-forming galaxies. moreover, the x-ray emissivity ofsub-mjy sources to z~0.3 is found to be elevated compared to local hiigalaxies. the observed increase is consistent with l_x evolution of the form(1+z)^3. assuming that our sample is indeed dominated by starbursts this isdirect evidence for evolution of such systems at x-ray wavelengths. using anempirical l_x to sfr conversion we estimate a global sfr density at z~0.3 of\~0.029m_o/yr/mpc in agreement with previous studies.

astro-ph;0402456	deep sauron spectral-imaging of the diffuse lyman-alpha halo lab1 in  ssa22	we have used the sauron panoramic integral field spectrograph to study thestructure of the ly-alpha emission-line halo, lab1, surrounding thesub-millimeter galaxy smm j221726+0013. this emission-line halo was discoveredduring a narrow-band imaging survey of the z=3.1 large-scale structure in thessa22 region. our observations trace the emission halo out to almost 100 kpcfrom the sub-millimeter source and identify two distinct ly-alpha `mini-haloes'around the nearby lyman-break galaxies. the main emission region has a broadline profile, with variations in the line profile seeming chaotic and lackingevidence for a coherent velocity structure. the data also suggests thatly-alpha emission is suppressed around the sub-mm source. interpretation of theline structure needs care because ly-alpha may be resonantly scattered, leadingto complex radiative transfer effects, and we suggest that the suppression inthis region arises because of such effects. we compare the structure of thecentral emission-line halo with local counter-parts, and find that the emissionline halo around ngc 1275 in the perseus cluster may be a good local analogue,although the high redshift halo is factor of ~100 more luminous and appears tohave higher velocity broadening. around the lyman-break galaxy c15, theemission line is narrower, and a clear shear in the emission wavelength isseen. a plausible explanation for the line profile is that the emission gas isexpelled from c15 in a bipolar outflow, similar to that seen in m82.

astro-ph;0407078	the phoenix deep survey: the radio properties of the hard x-ray selected  sample	the radio properties of hard (2-8kev) x-ray selected sources are explored bycombining a single 50ks xmm-newton pointing with the ultra-deep and homogeneousphoenix radio (1.4ghz) survey (hopkins et al. 2003). a total of 43 sources aredetected above the x-ray flux limit f_x(2-8kev)=7.7e-15cgs with 14 of themexhibiting radio emission above ~40mujy (3sigma). the x-ray/radio matchedpopulation lies in the borderline between radio loud and quiet agns andcomprises sources with both soft and hard x-ray spectral properties suggestingboth obscured and unobscured systems. the spectroscopically identifiedsub-sample (total of 6 x-ray/radio matches) comprises narrow emission line agns(4) with hard x-ray spectral properties and broad line sources (2) with softx-ray spectra. we find evidence that the fraction of x-ray/radio matchesincreases from ~20% for sources with rest-frame column density n_h&lt;1e22cm^-2 to\~50% for more absorbed systems. poor statistics however, limit thesignificance of the above result to the ~2sigma level. also, the x-ray/radiomatched sources have flatter coadded x-ray spectrum(gamma=1.78^{+0.05}_{-0.03}) compared to sources without radio emission(gamma=2.00^{+0.03}_{-0.04}). a possible explanation for the higher fraction ofabsorbed sources with radio emission at the mujy level is the presence ofcircum-nuclear starburst activity that both feeds and obscures the centralengine. for a small sub-sample of z~0.4 radio emitting agns with n_h&gt;1e22cm^-2their combined spectrum exhibits a soft x-ray component that may be associatedwith star-formation activity, although other possibilities cannot be excluded.we also find that radio emitting agns make up about 13-20% of the hard-bandx-ray background depending on the adopted normalisation.

(1996) andthen cross-correlating the resulting density maps with the ero positions. ouranalysis provides direct evidence that eros are associated with overdensitiesat redshifts z&gt;1. we also exploit the deep radio 1.4ghz data (limiting flux60microjy) available to explore the association of eros and faint radio sourcesand whether the two populations trace similar large scale structures.cross-correlation of the two samples (after excluding 17eros with radiocounterparts) gives a 2sigma signal only for the sub-sample of high-z radiosources (z&gt;0.6). although the statistics are poor this suggests that it is thehigh-z radio sub-sample that traces similar structures with eros.

astro-ph;0411578	the phoenix deep survey: spectroscopic catalog	the phoenix deep survey is a multi-wavelength survey based on deep 1.4 ghzradio imaging, reaching well into the sub-100 microjy level. one of the aims ofthis survey is to characterize the sub-mjy radio population, exploring itsnature and evolution. in this paper we present the catalog and results of thespectroscopic observations aimed at characterizing the optically ``bright''(r&lt;~ 21.5 mag) counterparts of faint radio sources. out of 371 sources withredshift determination, 21% have absorption lines only, 11% show agnsignatures, 32% are star-forming galaxies, 34% show narrow emission lines thatdo not allow detailed spectral classification (due to poor signal-to-noiseratio and/or lack of diagnostic emission lines) and the remaining 2% areidentified with stars. for the star-forming galaxies with a balmer decrementmeasurement we find a median extinction of a(ha)=1.9 mag, higher than that ofoptically selected samples. this is a result of the radio selection, which isnot biased against dusty systems. using the available spectroscopicinformation, we estimate the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxiesin two independent redshift bins at z~0.1 and 0.3 respectively. we find directevidence for strong luminosity evolution of these systems consistent with l(1.4ghz) ~ (1+z)^(2.7).

astro-ph;0510857	photometric selection of high-redshift type ia supernovae	we present a method for selecting high-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia)located via rolling sn searches. the technique, using both color and magnitudeinformation of events from only 2-3 epochs of multi-band real-time photometry,is able to discriminate between sne ia and core collapse sne. furthermore, forthe sne ia, the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase and light-curveparameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. wedemonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of sne iaand core-collapse sne, where the selection method effectively rejects mostcore-collapse sne while retaining sne ia. we also apply the selection code toreal-time data acquired as part of the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey (snls). during the period may 2004 to january 2005 in the snls,440 sn candidates were discovered of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopicallyas sne ia and 15 as core-collapse events. for this test dataset, the selectiontechnique correctly identifies 100% of the identified sne ii as non-sne ia withonly a 1-2% false rejection rate. the predicted parameterization of the sne iahas a precision of |delta_z|/(1+z_spec)&lt;0.09 in redshift, and +/- 2-3rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planningspectroscopic follow-up observations. we also investigate any bias introducedby this selection method on the ability of surveys such as snls to measurecosmological parameters (e.g., w and omega matter), and find any effect to benegligible.

astro-ph;0703529	k-corrections and spectral templates of type ia supernovae	with the advent of large dedicated type ia supernova (sn ia) surveys,k-corrections of sne ia and their uncertainties have become especiallyimportant in the determination of cosmological parameters. while k-correctionsare largely driven by sn ia broad-band colors, it is shown here that thediversity in spectral features of sne ia can also be important. for anindividual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity inspectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filtersare aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters aremisaligned). to minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed sn iaspectral energy distribution (sed), we outline a prescription for deriving amean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneoussample of observed spectra. we then remove the effects of broad-band colors andmeasure the remaining uncertainties in the k-corrections associated with thediversity in spectral features. finally, we present a template spectroscopicsequence near maximum light for further improvement on the k-correctionestimate. a library of ~600 observed spectra of ~100 sne ia from heterogeneoussources is used for the analysis.

(1992). this work represents an extension ofthe initial study of treyer et al.

(1999), we interpret this discrepancy interms of a starburst model for our uv-luminous sources. whilst we can explainmost of our observations in this way, there remains a small population withextreme uv-optical colours which cannot be understood.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.

hep-ph;0106289	more on the interaction region of pep-n	the pep-n project consists of a small, very low-energy e- storage ring (vler)located in one of the interaction-straight regions of pep-ii. the small ring isbrought into collision with the low-energy (3.1 gev) e+ beam (ler). thecenter-of-mass energies from this collision are between the phi and j/psiresonances. we achieve a head-on collision through the use of a centralmagnetic dipole field that generates a large horizontal bending field. thisfield is also the central field of the detector. the large energy range of thevler, in order to maximize the center-of-mass energy range, complicates thecollision point geometry. in order to maintain the beam orbits near thecollision point two techniques are used. the first is to scale the centraldipole field up and down with the energy of the vler and the second is to usepassive shielding to decrease the integral b.dl of the dipole field seen by thevler. changes in the orbit of the ler are corrected with local bending magnets.further details of the interaction region geometry as well as design issuesthat include synchrotron radiation from the high-current positron beam arediscussed.

0812.3020	dwarf galaxy clustering and missing satellites	at redshifts around 0.1 the cfht legacy survey deep fields contain some6x10^4 galaxies spanning the mass range from 10^5 to 10^12 msun. we measure thestellar mass dependence of the two point correlation using angular measurementsto largely bypass the errors, approximately 0.02 in the median, of thephotometric redshifts. inverting the power-law fits with limber's equation wefind that the auto-correlation length increases from a very low 0.4hmpc at10^5.5 msun to the conventional 4.5hmpc at 10^10.5 msun. the power law fit tothe correlation function has a slope which increases from gamma approximately1.6 at high mass to gamma approximately 2.3 at low mass. the spatialcross-correlation of dwarf galaxies with more massive galaxies shows fairlysimilar trends, with a steeper radial dependence at low mass than predicted innumerical simulations of sub-halos within galaxy halos. to examine the issue ofmissing satellites we combine the cross-correlation measurements with ourestimates of the low mass galaxy number density. we find on the average thereare 60+/-20 dwarfs in sub-halos with m(total) &gt; 10^7 msun for a typical localgroup m(total)/m(stars)=30, corresponding to m/l_v approximately 100 for agalaxy with no recent star formation. the number of dwarfs per galaxy is abouta factor of two larger than currently found for the milky way. nevertheless,the average dwarf counts are about a factor of 30 below lcdm simulationresults. the divergence from lcdm predictions is one of slope of the relation,approximately dn/dlnm approximately -0.5 rather than the predicted -0.9, notsudden onset at some characteristic scale. the dwarf galaxy star formationrates span the range from passive to bursting, which suggests that there arefew completely dark halos.
