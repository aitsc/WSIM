0901.3597	a statistical study of gamma-ray burst afterglows measured by the swift  ultra-violet optical telescope	we present the first statistical analysis of 27 uvot optical/ultra-violetlightcurves of grb afterglows. we have found, through analysis of thelightcurves in the observer's frame, that a significant fraction rise in thefirst 500s after the grb trigger, that all lightcurves decay after 500s,typically as a power-law with a relatively narrow distribution of decayindices, and that the brightest optical afterglows tend to decay the quickest.we find that the rise could either be produced physically by the start of theforward shock, when the jet begins to plough into the external medium, orgeometrically where an off-axis observer sees a rising lightcurve as anincreasing amount of emission enters the observers line of sight, which occursas the jet slows. we find that at 99.8% confidence, there is a correlation, inthe observed frame, between the apparent magnitude of the lightcurves at 400sand the rate of decay after 500s. however, in the rest frame a spearman ranktest shows only a weak correlation of low statistical significance betweenluminosity and decay rate. a correlation should be expected if the afterglowswere produced by off-axis jets, suggesting that the jet is viewed from withinthe half-opening angle theta or within a core of uniform energy densitytheta_c. we also produced logarithmic luminosity distributions for three restframe epochs. we find no evidence for bimodality in any of the distributions.finally, we compare our sample of uvot lightcurves with the xrt lightcurvecanonical model. the range in decay indices seen in uvot lightcurves at anyepoch is most similar to the range in decay of the shallow decay segment of thexrt canonical model. however, in the xrt canonical model there is no indicationof the rising behaviour observed in the uvot lightcurves.

0704.1297	the exceptionally extended flaring activity in the x-ray afterglow of  grb 050730 observed with swift and xmm-newton	we present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of swiftand xmm-newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) grb 050730. thex-ray afterglow of grb 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposedintense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitudein time. seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ksafter the burst were observed. the underlying decay of the afterglow was welldescribed by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 sand t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. the temporal decay slopes before, between andafter these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. the spectrum of the x-rayafterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with anabsorbing column density n_h=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.strong x-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. in themajority of the flares (6/7) the ratio delta_t/t_p between the duration of theevent and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.we showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first threeflares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, asexpected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshedshocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slowmoving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. theevent fully satisfies the e_p-e_iso amati relation while is not consistent withthe e_p-e_jet ghirlanda relation.

1010.6212	a statistical comparison of the optical/uv and x-ray afterglows of  gamma-ray bursts using the swift ultra-violet optical and x-ray telescopes	we present the systematic analysis of the uvot and xrt light curves for asample of 26 swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs). by comparing the optical/uv andx-ray light curves, we found that they are remarkably different during thefirst 500s after the bat trigger, while they become more similar during themiddle phase of the afterglow, i.e. between 2000s and 20000s. if we takeliterally the average properties of the sample, we find that the mean temporalindices observed in the optical/uv and x-rays after 500s are consistent with aforward-shock scenario, under the assumptions that electrons are in the slowcooling regime, the external medium is of constant density and the synchrotroncooling frequency is situated between the optical/uv and x-ray observing bands.while this scenario describes well the averaged observed properties, someindividual grb afterglows require different or additional assumptions, such asthe presence of late energy injection. we show that a chromatic break (a breakin the x-ray light curve that is not seen in the optical) is present in theafterglows of 3 grbs and demonstrate evidence for chromatic breaks in a further4 grbs. the average properties of these breaks cannot be explained in terms ofthe passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the observed bands,nor a simple change in the external density. it is difficult to reconcilechromatic breaks in terms of a single component outflow and instead, morecomplex jet structure or additional emission components are required.

1302.7113	the seven year swift-xrt point source catalog (1swxrt)	swift is a multi-wavelength observatory specifically designed for gamma-rayburst (grb) astronomy that is operational since 2004. swift is also a veryflexible multi-purpose facility that supports a wide range of scientific fieldssuch as active galactic nuclei, supernovae, cataclysmic variables, galactictransients, active stars and comets. the swift x-ray telescope (xrt) hascollected more than 150 ms of observations in its first seven years ofoperations. we present the list of all the x-ray point sources detected in xrtimaging data taken in photon counting mode during the first seven years ofswift operations. all these point-like sources, excluding the gamma-ray bursts(grb), will be stored in a catalog publicly available (1swxrt). we consider allxrt observations with exposure time &gt; 500 s taken in the period 2005-2011. datawere reduced and analyzed with standard techniques and a list of detectedsources for each observation was produced. a careful visual inspection wasperformed to remove extended, spurious and piled-up sources. positions, countrates, fluxes and the corresponding uncertainties were computed. we haveanalyzed more than 35,000 xrt fields, with exposures ranging between 500 s and100 ks, for a total exposure time of 140 ms. the catalog includes ~ 89,000entries, of which almost 85,000 are not affected by pile-up and are not grbs.since many xrt fields were observed several times, we have a total of ~36,000distinct celestial sources. we computed count rates in three energy bands:0.3-10 kev (full, or f), 0.3-3 kev (soft, or s) and 2-10 kev (hard, or h). eachentry has a detection in at least one of these bands. in particular, we detect~ 80,000, ~ 70,000 and ~ 25,500$ in the f, s and h band, respectively. countrates were converted into fluxes in the 0.5-10, 0.5-2 and 2-10 kev bands. somepossible scientific uses of the catalog are also highlighted.

0712.3290	swift and chandra detections of supernova 2006jc: evidence for  interaction of the supernova shock with a circumstellar shell	the peculiar type ib supernova (sn) 2006jc has been observed with theuv/optical telescope (uvot) and x-ray telescope (xrt) on board the swiftobservatory over a period of 19 to 183 days after the explosion. signatures ofinteraction of the outgoing sn shock with dense circumstellar material (csm)are detected, such as strong x-ray emission (l_{0.2-10} &gt; e39 erg/s) and thepresence of mgii 2800a line emission visible in the uv spectra. in combinationwith a chandra observation obtained on day 40 after the explosion, the x-raylight curve is constructed, which shows a unique rise of the x-ray emission bya factor of ~5 over a period of ~4 months, followed by a rapid decline. weinterpret the unique x-ray and uv properties as a result of the sn shockinteracting with a shell of material that was deposited by an outburst of thesn progenitor two years prior to the explosion. our results are consistent withthe explosion of a wolf-rayet star that underwent an episodic mass ejectionqualitatively similar to those of luminous blue variable stars prior to itsexplosion. this led to the formation of a dense (&gt;e7 cm**-3) shell at adistance of ~e16 cm from the site of the explosion, which expands with the wrwind at a velocity of (1300+/-300) km/s.

1501.05951	space telescope and optical reverberation mapping project. ii. swift and  hst reverberation mapping of the accretion disk of ngc 5548	recent intensive swift monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 yielded282 usable epochs over 125 days across six uv/optical bands and the x-rays.this is the densest extended agn uv/optical continuum sampling ever obtained,with a mean sampling rate &lt;0.5 day. approximately daily hst uv sampling wasalso obtained. the uv/optical light curves show strong correlations (r_max =0.57 - 0.90) and the clearest measurement to date of interband lags. these lagsare well-fit by a \tau propto \lambda^4/3 wavelength dependence, with anormalization that indicates an unexpectedly large disk radius of 0.35 +/- 0.05lt-day at 1367 a, assuming a simple face-on model. the u-band shows amarginally larger lag than expected from the fit and surrounding bands, whichcould be due to balmer continuum emission from the broad-line region assuggested by korista and goad. the uv/x-ray correlation is weaker (r_max &lt;0.45) and less consistent over time. this indicates that while swift isbeginning to measure uv/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disktheory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationshipwith x-ray variability is less well understood. combining this accretion disksize estimate with those from quasar microlensing studies suggests that agndisk sizes scale approximately linearly with central black hole mass over awide range of masses.

0805.1426	optimal coaddition of imaging data for rapidly fading gamma-ray burst  afterglows	we present a technique for optimal coaddition of image data for rapidlyvarying sources, with specific application to gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows.unweighted coaddition of rapidly fading afterglow lightcurve data becomescounterproductive relatively quickly. it is better to stop coaddition of thedata once noise dominates late exposures. a better alternative is to optimallyweight each exposure to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) of the finalcoadded image data. by using information about grb lightcurves and image noisecharacteristics, optimal image coaddition increases the probability ofafterglow detection and places the most stringent upper limits onnon-detections. for a temporal power law flux decay typical of grb afterglows,optimal coaddition has the greatest potential to improve the s/n of afterglowimaging data (relative to unweighted coaddition), when the decay rate is high,the source count rate is low, and the background rate is high. the optimalcoaddition technique is demonstrated with applications to swiftultraviolet/optical telescope (uvot) data of several grbs, with and withoutdetected afterglows.

astro-ph;0010356	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the seyfert 2 galaxy circinus with  chandra	results from a 60 ks chandra hetgs observation of the nearby seyfert 2circinus are presented. the spectrum shows a wealth of emission lines at bothsoft and hard x-rays, including lines of ne, mg, si, s, ar, ca, and fe, and aprominent fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev. we identify several of the he-likecomponents and measure several of the lyman lines of the h-like ions. thelines' profiles are unresolved at the limited signal-to-noise ratio of thedata. our analysis of the zeroth-order image in a companion paper constrainsthe size of the emission region to be 20-60 pc, suggesting that emission withinthis volume is almost entirely due to the reprocessing of the obscured centralsource. here we show that a model containing two distinct components canreproduce almost all the observed properties of this gas. the ionized componentcan explain the observed intensities of the ionized species, assumingtwice-solar composition and an n \propto r^{-1.5} density distribution. theneutral component is highly concentrated, well within the 0.8arcsec pointsource, and is responsible for almost all of the observed kalpha (6.4 kev)emission. circinus seems to be different than mkn~3 in terms of its gasdistribution.

(2000) are detected in x-rays; these fourare among our hardest chandra sources, and we argue that they containmoderately luminous obscured agn. overall, however, the small chandra detectionfraction suggests a relatively small agn content in the optically selected veryred object population.

astro-ph;0508071	the swift x-ray telescope	the swift gamma-ray explorer is designed to make prompt multiwavelengthobservations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and grb afterglows. the x-ray telescope(xrt) enables swift to determine grb positions with a few arcseconds accuracywithin 100 seconds of the burst onset.  the xrt utilizes a mirror set built for jet-x and an xmm/epic mos ccddetector to provide a sensitive broad-band (0.2-10 kev) x-ray imager witheffective area of &gt; 120 cm^2 at 1.5 kev, field of view of 23.6 x 23.6arcminutes, and angular resolution of 18 arcseconds (hpd). the detectionsensitivity is 2x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 10^4 seconds. the instrument isdesigned to provide automated source detection and position reporting within 5seconds of target acquisition. it can also measure the redshifts of grbs withfe line emission or other spectral features. the xrt operates in anauto-exposure mode, adjusting the ccd readout mode automatically to optimizethe science return for each frame as the source intensity fades. the xrt willmeasure spectra and lightcurves of the grb afterglow beginning about a minuteafter the burst and will follow each burst for days or weeks.

astro-ph;0508332	evidence for a canonical grb afterglow light curve in the swift/xrt data	we present new observations of the early x-ray afterglows of the first 27gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected with the swift x-ray telescope (xrt). theearly x-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadlyconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay(t^{-alpha} with 3&lt;alpha_1&lt;5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay(0.2&lt;alpha_2&lt;0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1&lt;alpha_3&lt;1.5).these power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,300s&lt;t_{break,1}&lt;500s and 10^3s&lt;t_{break,2}&lt;10^4s. on top of this canonicalbehavior of the early x-ray light curve, many events have superimposed x-rayflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lastingsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the grb. wefind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of theprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to ourline of sight. the first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes placewhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallowflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into theexternal shock. when this energy injection stops, a second break is thenobserved in the light curve (t_{break,2}). this energy injection increases theenergy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f&gt;4, and augments thealready severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-rayemission.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0509737	detection of a huge explosion in the early universe	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are bright flashes of high energy photons that canlast from about 10 milliseconds to 10 minutes. their origin and nature havepuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the firstx-ray afterglows of long (&gt; 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the firstoptical and radio counterparts were found. these measurements established thatlong grbs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminousstar-forming host galaxies. they are likely produced in core-collapseexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativisticjets (collapsar model). internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of therelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slowmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. these shocksare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularlyshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinctinternal collision. the expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellarmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible forproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the x-ray, optical andradio bands. here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the mostdistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to adistance of 13 billion light-years from earth, corresponding to a time when theuniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old. the discovery of agamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive starsonly 700 million years after the big bang. the very high redshift burstsrepresent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the universecame out of the dark ages.

astro-ph;0510566	swift and optical observations of grb 050401	we present the results of the analysis of gamma-ray and x-ray data of grb050401 taken with the swift satellite, together with a series of ground-basedfollow-up observations. the swift x-ray light curve shows a clear break atabout 4900 seconds after the grb. the decay indices before and after the breakare consistent with a scenario of continuous injection of radiation from the'central engine' of the grb to the fireball. alternatively, this behaviourcould result if ejecta are released with a range of lorentz factors with theslower shells catching up the faster at the afterglow shock position. the twoscenarios are observationally indistinguishable. the grb 050401 afterglow isquite bright in the x-ray band but weak in the optical, with an optical tox-ray flux ratio similar to those of 'dark bursts'. we detect a significantamount of absorption in the x-ray spectrum, with n_h = (1.7 +/- 0.2) x 10^22cm^-2 at a redshift of z=2.9, which is typical of a dense circumbust medium.such high column density implies an unrealistic optical extinction of 30magnitudes if we adopt the galactic extinction law, which would not consistentwith optical detection of the afterglow. this suggests that the extinction lawis different from the galactic one.

astro-ph;0510677	swift observations of the x-ray bright grb 050315	this paper discusses swift observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 050315(z=1.949) from 80 s to 10 days after the onset of the burst. the x-ray lightcurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.however, both the prompt hard x-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the bat)and the first ~ 300 s of x-ray emission (observed by the xrt) can be explainedby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. extrapolating the batlight curve into the xrt band suggests the rapidly decaying, early x-rayemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strongsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray emission may be relatedto the simple temporal and spectral character of this x-ray rich grb. theprompt (bat) spectrum was a steep down to 15 kev, and appeared to continuethrough the xrt bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with theamati relation. following the initial steep decline the x-ray afterglow did notfade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index ofalpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.the apparent `plateau' in the x-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep x-ray lightcurves revealed by swift. if the second afterglow break is identified with ajet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying e_gamma&gt; 10^50 erg.

astro-ph;0511576	discovery of an afterglow extension of the prompt phase of two gamma ray  bursts observed by swift	bat and xrt observations of two recent well-covered grbs observed by swift,grb 050315 and grb 050319, show clearly a prompt component joining the onset ofthe afterglow emission. by fitting a power law form to the gamma-ray spectrum,we extrapolate the time dependent fluxes measured by the bat, in the energyband 15-350 kev, into the spectral regime observed by the xrt 0.2-10 kev, andexamine the functional form of the rate of decay of the two light curves. wefind that the bat and xrt light curves merge to form a unified curve. there isa period of steep decay up to ~300 s, followed by a flatter decay. the durationof the steep decay, ~100 s in the source frame after correcting forcosmological time dilation, agrees roughly with a theoretical estimate for thedeceleration time of the relativistic ejecta as it interacts with circumstellarmaterial. for grb 050315, the steep decay can be characterized by anexponential form, where one e-folding decay time t_e(bat) ~ 24+/-2 s, andt_e(xrt) ~ 35+/-2 s. for grb 050319, a power law decay -(d ln f/d ln t) = n,where n is about 3, provides a reasonable fit. the early time x-ray fluxes areconsistent with representing the lower energy tail of the prompt emission, andprovide our first quantitative measure of the decay of the prompt gamma-rayemission over a large dynamic range in flux. the initial steep decay isexpected due to the delayed high latitude photons from a curved shell ofrelativistic plasma illuminated only for a short interval. the overallconclusion is that the prompt phase of grbs remains observable for hundreds ofseconds longer than previously thought.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;0602142	testing the curvature effect and internal origin of gamma-ray burst  prompt emissions and x-ray flares with swift data	the x-ray light curves of many gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) have a very steep-decay component (tail) following theprompt gamma-rays in the early phase and have some erratic flares occurring ata time from ~10^2 up to ~10^5 seconds. based on the assumption that these tailsand flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors aredominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present aself-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36prompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 grb xrt light curves. our results showthat the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flaresare usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission orthe corresponding x-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation ofthe internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and x-ray flares. ourresults indicate that each x-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of centralengine activity and the grb central engine remains active after the promptemission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the grb trigger (e.g. grb050502b &amp; grb 050724). this challenges the conventional central engine modelsand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. we further show thatthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the grbduration. we also identify a minority group of grbs whose combined bat-xrtlight curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between theprompt emission and the afterglow. these grbs may have an external origin forboth the prompt emission and the afterglow.

astro-ph;0610570	swift observations of grb050904: the most distant cosmic explosion ever  observed	swift discovered the high redshift (z=6.29) grb050904 with the burst alerttelescope (bat) and began observing with its narrow field instruments 161 safter the burst onset. this gamma-ray burst is the most distant cosmicexplosion ever observed. because of its high redshift, the x-ray telescope(xrt) and bat simultaneous observations provide 4 orders of magnitude ofspectral coverage (0.2-150 kev; 1.4-1090 kev in the source rest frame) at avery early source-frame time (22 s). grb050904 was a long, multi-peaked, brightgrb with strong variability during its entire evolution. the light curveobserved by the xrt is characterized by the presence of a long flaring activitylasting up to 1-2 hours after the burst onset in the burst rest frame, with noevidence of a smooth power-law decay following the prompt emission as seen inother grbs. however, the bat tail extrapolated to the xrt band joins the xrtearly light curve and the overall behavior resembles that of a very long grbprompt. the spectral energy distribution softens with time, with the photonindex decreasing from -1.2 during the bat observation to -1.9 at the end of thexrt observation. the dips of the late x-ray flares may be consistent with anunderlying x-ray emission arising from the forward shock and with theproperties of the optical afterglow reported by tagliaferri et al. (2005b). weinterpret the bat and xrt data as a single continuous observation of the promptemission from a very long grb. the peculiarities observed in grb050904 could bedue to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the universe;very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide anexplanation.

astro-ph;0610635	swift detects a remarkable gamma-ray burst, grb 060614, that introduces  a new classification scheme	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are known to come in two duration classes, separatedat ~2 s. long bursts originate from star forming regions in galaxies, haveaccompanying supernovae (sne) when near enough to observe and are likely causedby massive-star collapsars. recent observations show that short burstsoriginate in regions within their host galaxies with lower star formation ratesconsistent with binary neutron star (ns) or ns - black hole (bh) mergers.moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no sne havebeen so far associated with short grbs. we report here on the bright, nearbygrb 060614 that does not fit in either class. its ~102 s duration groups itwith long grbs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely withinthe short grb subclass. moreover, very deep optical observations exclude anaccompanying supernova, similar to short grbs. this combination of a longduration event without accompanying sn poses a challenge to both a collapsarand merging ns interpretation and opens the door on a new grb classificationscheme that straddles both long and short bursts.

astro-ph;0612494	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments and by konus-wind. thanks to theseexceptional circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the promptemission could be studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges (up to 2mev). while the x-ray emission (0.2-10 kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst,the optical component follows a different pattern, likely indicating adifferent origin, possibly the onset of external shocks. the prompt grbspectrum shows significant spectral evolution, with both the peak energy andthe spectral index varying. as observed in several long grbs, significant lagsare measured between the hard- and low-energy components, showing that thisbehaviour extends over 3 decades in energy. the grb peaks are also much broaderat soft energies. this is related to the temporal evolution of the spectrum,and can be accounted for by the softening of the electron spectral index withtime. the burst energy (e_iso~5x10^{53} erg at z=2.297) and average peak energy(e_p~300 kev) make grb 060124 consistent with the amati relation. the x-rayafterglow is characterized by a decay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0612661	swift multi-wavelength observations of the bright flaring burst  grb051117a	we report on the temporal and spectral characteristics of the early x-rayemission from the gamma ray burst 051117a as observed by swift. the superbquality of the early x-ray light-curve and spectra of this source, one of thebrightest seen by the x-ray telescope at such early times, allows anunprecedented look at the spectral and temporal evolution of the prompt andearly afterglow emission for this grb and allows us to place stringent limitson the detection of lines. the x-ray light-curve at early times ischaracteristic of a shot-noise process, with individual shots well-modelled bya fast-rise and exponential decay spanning a broad range in rise-times anddecay rates. a temporal spectral analysis of the early light-curve shows thatthe photon index and source intensity are highly correlated with the spectrumbeing significantly harder when brighter, consistent with the movement of thepeak of the band function to lower energies following individual flares. thehigh quality spectrum obtained from the first orbit of wt mode data, enables usto place a 3 sigma upper limit on the strength of any emission line features ofew &lt; 15 ev, assuming a narrow emission-line of 100 ev at the peak of theeffective area (abridged).

astro-ph;0702371	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: temporal properties and morphology	we present the first systematic investigation of the morphological and timingproperties of flares in grbs observed by swift/xrt. we consider a large sampledrawn from all grbs detected by swift, integral and hete-2 prior to 2006 jan31, which had an xrt follow-up and which showed significant flaring. our sampleof 33 grbs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69flares. the strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clearanti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time ofoccurrence. fitting each x-ray flare with a gaussian model, we find that themean ratio of the width and peak time is &lt;delta t / t &gt; = 0.13+/-0.10, albeitwith a large scatter. late flares at times &gt; 2000 seconds have long durations,delta t&gt;300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.we further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulsesdetected in the prompt phase by bat and the number of x-ray flares detected byxrt, finding no correlation. however, we find that the distribution ofintensity ratios between successive bat prompt pulses and that betweensuccessive xrt flares is the same, an indication of a common origin forgamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares. all evidence indicates that flares areindeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standardfireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.while all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flaresmay also be explained by refreshed shocks. however, 10 can only be explained byprolonged activity of the central engine.

astro-ph;0703192	grb 060505: a possible short-duration gamma-ray burst in a star forming  region at redshift of 0.09	on 2006 may 5, a four second duration, low energy, ~10^49 erg, gamma-rayburst (grb) was observed, spatially associated with a z=0.0894 galaxy. here, wereport the discovery of the grb optical afterglow and observations of itsenvironment using gemini-south, hubble space telescope (hst), chandra, swiftand the very large array. the optical afterglow of this grb is spatiallyassociated with a prominent star forming region in the sc-type galaxy 2dfgrss173z112. its proximity to a star forming region suggests that the progenitordelay time, from birth to explosion, is smaller than about 10 myr. our hst deepimaging rules out the presence of a supernova brighter than an absolutemagnitude of about -11 (or -12.6 in case of ``maximal'' extinction) at abouttwo weeks after the burst, and limits the ejected mass of radioactive nickel 56to be less than about 2x10^-4 solar mass (assuming no extinction). although itwas suggested that grb 060505 may belong to a new class of long-duration grbswith no supernova, we argue that the simplest interpretation is that thephysical mechanism responsible for this burst is the same as for short-durationgrbs.

astro-ph;0703765	x-ray, uv, and optical observations of supernova 2006bp with swift:  detection of early x-ray emission	we present results on the x-ray and optical/uv emission from the type iip sn2006bp and the interaction of the sn shock with its environment, obtained withthe x-ray telescope (xrt) and uv/optical telescope (uvot) on-board the swiftobservatory. sn 2006bp is detected in x-rays at a 4.5 sigma level ofsignificance in the merged xrt data from days 1 to 12 after the explosion. ifthe x-ray luminosity of (1.8+/-0.4)e39 ergs/s is caused by interaction of thesn shock with circumstellar material (csm), deposited by a stellar wind fromthe progenitor's companion star, a mass-loss rate of ~e-05 m_sun/yr isinferred. the mass-loss rate is consistent with the non-detection in the radiowith the vla on days 2, 9, and 11 after the explosion and characteristic of ared supergiant progenitor with a mass around 12-15 m_sun prior to theexplosion. in combination with a follow-up xmm-newton observation obtained onday 21 after the explosion, an x-ray rate of decline with index 1.2+/-0.6 isinferred. since no other sn has been detected in x-rays prior to the opticalpeak and since type iip sne have an extended 'plateau' phase in the optical, wediscuss the scenario that the x-rays might be due to inverse compton scatteringof photospheric optical photons off relativistic electrons produced incircumstellar shocks. however, due to the high required value of the lorentzfactor (~10-100) we conclude that inverse compton scattering is an unlikelyexplanation for the observed x-ray emission. the fast evolution of theoptical/ultraviolet spectral energy distribution and the spectral changesobserved with swift reveal the onset of metal line-blanketing and cooling ofthe expanding photosphere during the first few weeks after the outburst.

0810.1844	integral/ibis and swift/xrt observations of hard cataclysmic variables	the analysis of the third integral/ibis survey has revealed several newcataclysmic variables, most of which turned out to be intermediate polars, thusconfirming that these objects are strong emitters in hard x-rays. here wepresent high energy spectra of all 22 cataclysmic variables detected in the 3rdibis survey and provide the first average spectrum over the 20-100 kev band forthis class. our analysis indicates that the best-fit model is a thermalbremsstrahlung with an average temperature of &lt;kt&gt; ~22 kev. recently, eleven(ten intermediate polars and one polar) of these systems have been followed-upby swift/xrt (operating in the 0.3-10 kev energy band), thus allowing us toinvestigate their spectral behaviour over the range ~0.3-100 kev. thanks tothis wide energy coverage, it was possible for these sources to simultaneouslymeasure the soft and hard components and estimate their temperatures. the softemission, thought to originate in the irradiated poles of the white dwarfatmosphere, is well described by a blackbody model with temperatures in therange ~60-120 ev. the hard emission, which is supposed to be originated fromoptically thin plasma in the post-shock region above the magnetic poles, isindeed well modelled with a bremsstrahlung model with temperatures in the range~16-33 kev, similar to the values obtained from the integral data alone. inseveral cases we also find the presence of a complex absorber: one totally(with nh ~(0.4-28) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}) and one partially (with nh ~(0.7-9) x10^{23} cm^{-2}) covering the source. only in four cases (v709 cas, gk per, igrj06253+7334 and igr j17303-0601), we find evidence for the presence of an ironline at 6.4 kev. we discuss our findings in the light of the systems parametersand cataclysmic variables/intermediate polars modelling scenario.
