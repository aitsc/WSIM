0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

0909.3583	searches for gravitational waves from known pulsars with s5 ligo data	we present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond andyoung pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the ligo detectors. forthis search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for allpulsars using radio and x-ray observations. we demonstrate an updated searchmethod that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to beincluded in the search. we report no signal detection from any of the targetsand therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wavesignal strength. the most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. wepresent updated limits on gravitational radiation from the crab pulsar, wherethe measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. thislimits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of theavailable spin-down power. for the x-ray pulsar j0537-6910 we reach thespin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from itstays phase locked to the x-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsarsj1913+1011 and j1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-downlimit. of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limitsare only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. for theseour best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 forj1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is7.0x10^-8 for j2124-3358.

0912.3480	oscillations of rotating magnetised neutron stars with purely toroidal  magnetic fields	we investigate the oscillation spectrum of rotating newtonian neutron starsendowed with purely toroidal magnetic fields, using a time evolution code toevolve linear perturbations in the cowling approximation. the background staris generated by numerically solving the mhd equilibrium equations and may benonspherical by virtue of both rotation and magnetic effects; hence ourperturbations and background are fully consistent. whilst the background fieldis purely toroidal, the perturbed field is mixed poloidal-toroidal. fromfourier analysis of the perturbations we are able to identify a number ofmagnetically-restored alfv\'en (or $a$-) modes. we show that in a rotating starpure inertial and $a$-modes are replaced by hybrid magneto-inertial modes,which reduce to $a$-modes in the nonrotating limit and inertial modes in thenonmagnetic limit. we show that the $r$-mode instability is suppressed bymagnetic fields in sufficiently slowly rotating stars. in addition, wedetermine magnetic frequency shifts in the $f$-mode. we discuss theastrophysical relevance of our results, in particular for magnetaroscillations.

1003.0379	modeling the gamma-ray emission produced by runaway cosmic rays in the  environment of rx j1713.7-3946	diffusive shock acceleration in supernova remnants is the most widely invokedparadigm to explain the galactic cosmic ray spectrum. cosmic rays escapingsupernova remnants diffuse in the interstellar medium and collide with theambient atomic and molecular gas. from such collisions gamma-rays are created,which can possibly provide the first evidence of a parent population of runawaycosmic rays. we present model predictions for the gev to tev gamma-ray emissionproduced by the collisions of runaway cosmic rays with the gas in theenvironment surrounding the shell-type supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946. thespectral and spatial distributions of the emission, which depend upon thesource age, the source injection history, the diffusion regime and thedistribution of the ambient gas, as mapped by the lab and nanten surveys, arestudied in detail. in particular, we find for the region surrounding rxj1713-3946, that depending on the energy one is observing at, one may observestartlingly different spectra or may not detect any enhanced emission withrespect to the diffuse emission contributed by background cosmic rays. thisresult has important implications for current and future gamma-ray experiments.

1003.2480	predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors	we present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types ofcompact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advancedversions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors ligo and virgo.astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a numberof assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. the mostconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binaryneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars inour galaxy. these yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per myr per milky wayequivalent galaxy (mweg), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 permyr per mweg to 1000 per myr per mweg. we convert coalescence rates intodetection rates based on data from the ligo s5 and virgo vsr2 science runs andprojected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. using the detectorsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02per year for initial ligo-virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between0.0002 and 0.2 per year. the likely binary neutron-star detection rate for theadvanced ligo-virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a rangebetween 0.4 and 400 per year.

1009.2630	galactic center at very high-energies	employing data collected during the first 25 months' observations by thefermi-lat, we describe and subsequently seek to model the very high energy(&gt;300 mev) emission from the central few parsecs of our galaxy. we analyze themorphological, spectral and temporal characteristics of the central source,1fgl j1745.6-2900. remarkably, the data show a clear, statistically significantsignal at energies above 10 gev, where the fermi-lat has an excellent angularresolution comparable to the angular resolution of hess at tev energies, whichmakes meaningful the joint analysis of the fermi and hess data. our analysisdoes not show statistically significant variability of 1fgl j1745.6-2900. usingthe combination of fermi data on 1fgl j1745.6-2900 and hess data on thecoincident, tev source hess j1745-290, we show that the spectrum of the centralgamma-ray source is inflected with a relatively steep spectral region matchingbetween the flatter spectrum found at both low and high energies. we seek tomodel the gamma-ray production in the inner 10 pc of the galaxy and examine, inparticular, cosmic ray (cr) proton propagation scenarios that reproduce theobserved spectrum of the central source. we show that a model that instantiatesa transition from diffusive propagation of the cr protons at low energy toalmost rectilinear propagation at high energies (given a reasonableenergy-dependence of the assumed diffusion coefficient) can well explain thespectral phenomenology. in general, however, we find considerable degeneracybetween different parameter choices which will only be broken with the additionof morphological information that gamma-ray telescopes cannot deliver givencurrent angular resolution limits.we argue that a future analysis done incombination with higher-resolution radio continuum data holds out the promiseof breaking this degeneracy.

1010.1153	ambipolar diffusion in superfluid neutron stars	in this paper we reconsider the problem of magnetic field diffusion inneutron star cores. we model the star as consisting of a mixture of neutrons,protons and electrons, and allow for particle reactions and binary collisionsbetween species. our analysis is in much the same spirit as that of goldreich &amp;reisenegger (1992), and we content ourselves with rough estimates of magneticdiffusion timescales, rather than solving accurately for some particular fieldgeometry. however, our work improves upon previous treatments in one crucialrespect: we allow for superfluidity in the neutron star matter. we find thatthe consequent mutual friction force, coupling the neutrons and chargedparticles, together with the suppression of particles collisions and reactions,drastically affect the ambipolar magnetic field diffusion timescale. inparticular, the addition of superfluidity means that it is unlikely that thereis ambipolar diffusion in magnetar cores on the timescale of the lifetimes ofthese objects, contradicting an assumption often made in the modelling of theflaring activity commonly observed in magnetars. our work suggests that if adecaying magnetic field is indeed the cause of magnetar activity, the fieldevolution is likely to take place outside of the core, and might representhall/ohmic diffusion in the stellar crust, or else that a mechanism other thanstandard ambipolar diffusion is active, e.g. flux expulsion due to theinteraction between neutron vortices and magnetic fluxtubes.

1104.2712	beating the spin-down limit on gravitational wave emission from the vela  pulsar	we present direct upper limits on continuous gravitational wave emission fromthe vela pulsar using data from the virgo detector's second science run. theseupper limits have been obtained using three independent methods that assume thegravitational wave emission follows the radio timing. two of the methodsproduce frequentist upper limits for an assumed known orientation of the star'sspin axis and value of the wave polarization angle of, respectively,$1.9\ee{-24}$ and $2.2\ee{-24}$, with 95% confidence. the third method, underthe same hypothesis, produces a bayesian upper limit of $2.1\ee{-24}$, with 95%degree of belief. these limits are below the indirect {\it spin-down limit} of$3.3\ee{-24}$ for the vela pulsar, defined by the energy loss rate inferredfrom observed decrease in vela's spin frequency, and correspond to a limit onthe star ellipticity of $\sim 10^{-3}$. slightly less stringent results, butstill well below the spin-down limit, are obtained assuming the star's spinaxis inclination and the wave polarization angles are unknown.

1107.3503	pulsar state switching, timing noise and free precession	recent radio pulsar observations have shown that a number of pulsars displayinteresting long term periodicities in their spin-down rates. at least some ofthese pulsars also undergo sharp changes in pulse profile. this has beenconvincingly attributed to the stars abruptly switching between two differentmagnetospheric states. the sharpness of these transitions has been taken asevidence against free precession as the mechanism behind the long termvariations. we argue that such a conclusion is premature. by performing asimple best-fit analysis to the data, we show that the relationship between theobserved spin and modulation periods is of approximately the correct form to beaccounted for by the free precession of a population of neutron stars withstrained crusts, the level of strain being similar in all of the stars, andconsistent with the star retaining a memory of a former faster rotation rate.we also provide an argument as to why abrupt magnetospheric changes can occurin precessing stars, and how such changes would serve to magnify the effect ofprecession in the timing data, making the observation of the precession morelikely in those stars where such switching occurs. we describe how futureobservations could further test the precession hypothesis advanced here.

1204.3781	gravitational waves from color-magnetic `mountains' in neutron stars	neutron stars may harbour the true ground state of matter in the form ofstrange quark matter. if present, this type of matter is expected to be a colorsuperconductor, a consequence of quark pairing with respect to the color/flavordegrees of freedom. the stellar magnetic field threading the quark core becomesa color-magnetic admixture and, in the event that superconductivity is of typeii, leads to the formation of color-magnetic vortices. in this letter we showthat the volume-averaged color-magnetic vortex tension force should naturallylead to a significant degree of non-axisymmetry in systems like radio pulsars.we show that gravitational radiation from such color-magnetic `mountains' inyoung pulsars like the crab and vela could be observable by the future einsteintelescope, thus becoming a probe of paired quark matter in neutron stars. thedetectability threshold can be pushed up toward the sensitivity level ofadvanced ligo if we invoke an interior magnetic field about a factor tenstronger than the surface polar field.

1307.7078	three evolutionary paths for magnetar oscillations	quasi-periodic oscillations have been seen in the light curves followingseveral magnetar giant flares. these oscillations are of great interest as theyprobably provide our first ever view of the normal modes of oscillation ofneutron stars. the state-of-the-art lies in the study of the oscillations ofelastic-magnetic stellar models, mainly with a view to relating the observedfrequencies to the structure and composition of the star itself. we advancethis programme by considering several new physical mechanisms that are likelyto be important for magnetar oscillations. these relate to thesuperfluid/superconducting nature of the stellar interior, and the damping ofthe modes, both through internal dissipation mechanisms and the launching ofwaves into the magnetosphere. we make simple order-of-magnitude estimates toshow that both the frequencies and the damping time of magnetar oscillationscan evolve in time, identifying three distinct `pathways' that can be followed,depending upon the initial magnitude of the mode excitation. these results areinteresting as they show that the information buried in magnetar qpos may beeven richer than previously thought, and motivate more careful examination ofmagnetar light curves, to search for signatures of the different types ofevolution that we have identified.

1401.0939	the ninja-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational  waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations	the numerical injection analysis (ninja) project is a collaborative effortbetween members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave astrophysicscommunities. the purpose of ninja is to study the ability to detectgravitational waves emitted from merging binary black holes and recover theirparameters with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. we reporthere on the results of the second ninja project, ninja-2, which employs 60complete binary black hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portionmodelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-newtonianportion modelling the early inspiral. in a "blind injection challenge" similarto that conducted in recent ligo and virgo science runs, we added 7 hybridwaveforms to two months of data recolored to predictions of advanced ligo andadvanced virgo sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. theresulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection algorithms and 6 ofthe waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in athousand years. parameter estimation algorithms were run on each of thesewaveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angularmomenta and sky position of these waveforms. we also perform a large-scalemonte-carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybridwaveforms with early advanced ligo and advanced virgo sensitivity curves. ourresults predict that early advanced ligo and advanced virgo will have avolume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300mpc (1gpc) for$10m_{\odot}+10m_{\odot}$ ($50m_{\odot}+50m_{\odot}$) binary black holecoalescences. we demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta inthe waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction insensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta.

1403.0860	implications of an r-mode in xte j1751-305: mass, radius and spin  evolution	recently strohmayer and mahmoodifar presented evidence for a coherentoscillation in the x-ray light curve of the accreting millisecond pulsar xtej1751-305, using data taken by rxte during the 2002 outburst of this source.they noted that a possible explanation includes the excitation of a non-radialoscillation mode of the neutron star, either in the form of a g-mode or anr-mode. the r-mode interpretation has connections with proposed spin-evolutionscenarios for systems such as xte j1751-305. here we examine in detail thisinteresting possible interpretation. using the ratio of the observedoscillation frequency to the star's spin frequency, we derive an approximateneutron star mass-radius relation which yields reasonable values for the massover the range of expected stellar radius (as constrained by observations ofradius-expansion burst sources). however, we argue that the large modeamplitude suggested by the strohmayer and mahmoodifar analysis would inevitablylead to a large spin-down of the star, inconsistent with its observed spinevolution, regardless of whether the r-mode itself is in a stable or unstableregime. we therefore conclude that the r-mode interpretation of the observedoscillation is not consistent with our current understanding of neutron stardynamics and must be considered unlikely. finally we note that, subject to theavailability of a sufficiently accurate timing model, a directgravitational-wave search may be able to confirm or reject an r-modeinterpretation unambiguously, should such an event, with a similar inferredmode amplitude, recur during the advanced detector era.

1408.1249	developing a model for neutron star oscillations following starquakes	glitches -- sudden increases in spin rate -- are observed in many pulsars.one mechanism advanced to explain glitches in the youngest pulsars is that theyare caused by a starquake, a sudden rearrangement of the crust of the neutronstar. starquakes have the potential to excite some of the oscillation modes ofthe neutron star, which means that they are of interest as a source ofgravitational waves. these oscillations could also have an impact on radioemission. in this paper we make upper estimates of the amplitude of theoscillations produced by a starquake, and the corresponding gravitational waveemission. we then develop a more detailed framework for calculating theoscillations excited by the starquake, using a toy model of a solid,incompressible star where all strain is lost instantaneously from the star atthe glitch. for this toy model, we give plots of the amplitudes of the modesexcited, as the shear modulus and rotation rate of the star are varied. we findthat for our specific model, the largest excitation is generally of a modesimilar to the $f$-mode of an incompressible fluid star, but that other modesof the star are excited to a significant degree over small parameter ranges ofthe rotation rate.

1408.1822	prospects for detection of synchrotron emission from secondary electrons  and positrons in starless cores: application to g0.216+0.016	we investigate the diffusion of cosmic rays into molecular cloud complexes.using the cosmic-ray diffusion formalism of protheroe, et al. (2008), weexamine how cosmic rays diffuse into clouds exhibiting different densitystructures, including a smoothed step-function, as well as gaussian andinverse-$r$ density distributions, which are well known to trace the structureof star-forming regions. these density distributions were modelled as anapproximation to the galactic centre cloud g0.216+0.016, a recently-discoveredmassive dust clump that exhibits limited signs of massive star formation andthus may be the best region in the galaxy to observe synchrotron emission fromsecondary electrons and positrons. examination of the resulting synchrotronemission, produced by the interaction of cosmic ray protons interacting withambient molecular matter producing secondary electrons and positrons revealsthat, due to projection effects, limb-brightened morphology results in allcases. however, we find that the gaussian and inverse-$r$ density distributionsshow much broader flux density distributions than step-function distributions.significantly, some of the compact (compared to the $2.2''$ resolution, 5.3 ghzjvla observations) sources show non-thermal emission, which may potentially beexplained by the density structure and the lack of diffusion of cosmic raysinto the cloud. we find that we can match the 5.3 and 20 ghz flux densities ofthe non-thermal source jvla~1 and 6 from rodr\'{\i}guez &amp; zapata (2014) with alocal cosmic ray flux density, a diffusion coefficient suppression factor of$\chi=0.1-0.01$ for a coefficient of $3\times10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, and amagnetic field strength of 470 $\mu$g.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1410.8044	the effect of timing noise on targeted and narrow-band coherent searches  for continuous gravitational waves from pulsars	most searches for continuous gravitational-waves from pulsars use taylorexpansions in the phase to model the spin-down of neutron stars. studies ofpulsars demonstrate that their electromagnetic (em) emissions suffer from\emph{timing noise}, small deviations in the phase from taylor expansionmodels. how the mechanism producing em emission is related to any continuousgravitational-wave (cw) emission is unknown; if they either interact or arelocked in phase then the cw will also experience timing noise. any disparitybetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methodswill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (snr), referred to as`mismatch'. in this work we assume the cw suffers a similar level of timingnoise to its em counterpart. we inject and recover fake cw signals, whichinclude timing noise generated from observational data on the crab pulsar.measuring the mismatch over durations of order $\sim 10$ months, the effect isfor the most part found to be small. this suggests recent so-called`narrow-band' searches which placed upper limits on the signals from the craband vela pulsars will not be significantly affected. at a fixed observationtime, we find the mismatch depends upon the observation epoch. considering theaveraged mismatch as a function of observation time, we find that it increasesas a power law with time, and so may become relevant in long baseline searches.

1501.05832	parameter choices and ranges for continuous gravitational wave searches  for steadily spinning neutron stars	we consider the issue of selecting parameters and their associated ranges forcarrying out searches for continuous gravitational waves from steadily rotatingneutron stars. we consider three different cases (i) the "classic" case of astar spinning about a principal axis; (ii) a biaxial star, not spinning about aprincipal axis; (iii) a triaxial star spinning steady, but not about aprincipal axis (as described in jones, mnras vol 402, 2503 (2010)). the firstof these emits only at one frequency; the other two at a pair of harmonicallyrelated frequencies. we show that in all three cases, when written in terms ofthe original "source parameters", there exist a number of discretedegeneracies, with different parameter values giving rise to the samegravitational wave signal. we show how these can be removed by suitablyrestricting the source parameter ranges. in the case of the model as writtendown by jones, there is also a continuous degeneracy. we show how to removethis through a suitable rewriting in terms of "waveform parameters", chosen soas to make the specialisations to the other stellar models particularly simple.we briefly consider the (non-trivial) relation between the assignment of priorprobabilities on one set of parameters verses the other. the results of thispaper will be of use when designing strategies for carrying out searches forsuch multi-harmonic gravitational wave signals, and when performing parameterestimation in the event of a detection.

1508.00416	first results and future prospects for dual-harmonic searches for  gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars	we investigate a method to incorporate signal models that allow an additionalfrequency harmonic in searches for gravitational waves from spinning neutronstars. we assume emission is given by the general triaxial non-aligned model ofjones, whose waveform under certain conditions reduces to that of a biaxialprecessing star, or a simple rigidly rotating triaxial aligned star. thetriaxial non-aligned and biaxial models can produce emission at both the star'srotation frequency ($f$) and $2f$, whilst the latter only emits at $2f$. wehave studied parameter estimation for signal models using both a set ofphysical source parameters, and a set of waveform parameters that remove adegeneracy. we have assessed the signal detection efficiency, and used bayesianmodel selection to investigate how well we can distinguish between the threemodels. we found that for signal-to-noise ratios (snrs) $\gtrsim 6$ there is nosignificant loss in efficiency if performing a search for a signal at $f$ and$2f$ when the source is only producing emission at $2f$. however, for sourceswith emission at both $f$ and $2f$ signals could be missed by a search only at$2f$. we also find that for a triaxial aligned source, the correct model isalways favoured, but for a triaxial non-aligned source it can be hard todistinguish between the triaxial non-aligned model and the biaxial model, evenat high snr. finally, we apply the method to a selection of known pulsars usingdata from the ligo fifth science run. we give the first upper limits ongravitational wave amplitude at both $f$ and $2f$ and apply the model selectioncriteria on real data.

1510.03621	first low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals	in this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on virgo vsr2 andvsr4 data. the search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 hz and128 hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. the startingpoint was a set of short fast fourier transforms (fft), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. on each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the frequencyhough transform inan incoherent step. only coincident candidates among vsr2 and vsr4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. the criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer ffts followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. no evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint vsr2-vsr4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 hz and 128 hz. this is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 hz. we setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{hz}$.

0807.0127	interpretation of radio continuum and molecular line observations of sgr  b2: free-free and synchrotron emission, and implications for cosmic rays	recent ammonia (1,1) inversion line data on the galactic star forming regionsgr b2 show that the column density is consistent with a radial gaussiandensity profile with a standard deviation of 2.75 pc. deriving a formula forthe virial mass of spherical gaussian clouds, we obtain a virial mass of 1.9million solar masses for sgr b2. for this matter distribution, a reasonablemagnetic field and an impinging flux of cosmic rays of solar neighbourhoodintensity, we predict the expected synchrotron emission from the sgr b2 giantmolecular cloud due to secondary electrons and positrons resulting from cosmicray interactions, including effects of losses due to pion production collisionsduring diffusive propagation into the cloud complex.  we assemble radio continuum data at frequencies between 330 mhz and 230 ghz.  from the spectral energy distribution the emission appears to be thermal atall frequencies. before using these data to constrain the predicted synchrotronflux, we first model the spectrum as free-free emission from the known ultracompact hii regions plus emission from an envelope or wind with a radialdensity gradient. this severely constrains the possible synchrotron emission bysecondary electrons to quite low flux levels. the absence of a significantcontribution by secondary electrons is almost certainly due to multi-gev energycosmic rays being unable to penetrate far into giant molecular clouds. thiswould also explain why 100 mev--gev gamma-rays (from neutral pion decay orbremsstrahlung by secondary electrons) were not observed from sgr b2 by egret,while tev energy gamma-rays were observed, being produced by higher energycosmic rays which more readily penetrate giant molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0011063	freely precessing neutron stars: model and observations	we present a model of a freely precessing neutron star which is then comparedagainst pulsar observations. the aim is to draw conclusions regarding thestructure of the star, and test theoretical ideas of crust-core coupling andsuperfluidity. we argue that, on theoretical grounds, it is likely that thecore neutron superfluid does not participate in the free precession of thecrust. we apply our model to the handful of proposed observations of freeprecession that have appeared in the literature. assuming crust-onlyprecession, we find that all but one of the observations are consistent withthere not being any pinned crustal superfluid at all; the maximum amount ofpinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-10 of the totalstellar moment of inertia. however, the observations do not rule out thepossibility that the crust and neutron superfluid core precess as a singleunit. in this case the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with theobservations is about 10^-8 of the total stellar moment of inertia. both ofthese values are many orders of magnitude less than the 10^-2 value predictedby many theories of pulsar glitches. we conclude that superfluid pinning, atleast as it affects free precession, needs to be reconsidered.

astro-ph;0111582	strange stars as persistent sources of gravitational waves	we investigate the relevance of the gravitational-wave driven r-modeinstability for strange stars. we find that the unstable r-modes affect strangestars in a way that is quite distinct from the neutron star case. for accretingstrange stars we show that the onset of r-mode instability does not lead to thethermo-gravitational runaway that is likely to occur in neutron stars. instead,the strange star evolves towards a quasi-equilibrium state on a timescale ofabout a year. this mechanism could thus explain the clustering ofspin-frequencies inferred from khz qpo data in low-mass x-ray binaries. foryoung strange stars we show that the r-mode driven spin-evolution is alsodistinct from the neutron star case. in a young strange star the r-modeundergoes short cycles of instability during the first few months. this isfollowed by a quasi-adiabatic phase where the r-mode remains at a small,roughly constant, amplitude for thousands of years. another distinguishingfeature from the neutron star case is that the r-modes in a strange star nevergrow to large amplitudes. our results suggest that the r-modes in strange staremit a persistent gravitational-wave signal that should be detectable withlarge-scale interferometers given an observation time of a few months. ifdetected, these signals would provide unique evidence for the existence ofstrange stars, which would put useful constraints on the parameters of qcd.

astro-ph;0609438	mountains on neutron stars: accreted vs. non-accreted crusts	the aim of this paper is to compare the two cases of an isolated neutronstar, with a non-accreted crust, and that of an accreting neutron star, with anaccreted crust, and try to estimate which one of the two would make a bettersource of gravitational waves. in order to do this we must evaluate the maximum``mountain'' that the crust can sustain in these two cases. we first do thisusing the formalism of ushomirsky, cutler and bildsten (2000) and find that themaximum quadrupole is very similar in the two cases, with the non-accretedcrust sustaining a slightly larger mountain. we then develop a perturbationformalism for the problem, that allows us to drop the cowling approximation andhave more control over the boundaries. the use of this formalism confirms thatthere is not much difference between the two cases, but leads to resultsapproximately one order of magnitude larger than those we obtain with theformalism of ushomirsky, cutler and bildsten (2000).

gr-qc;0106094	gravitational waves from freely precessing neutron stars	in this paper we model the gravitational wave emission of a freely precessingneutron star. the aim is to estimate likely source strengths, as a guide forgravitational wave astronomers searching for such signals. we model the star asa partly elastic, partly fluid body with quadrupolar deformations of its momentof inertia tensor. the angular amplitude of the free precession is limited bythe finite breaking strain of the star's crust. the effect of internaldissipation on the star is important, with the precession angle being rapidlydamped in the case of a star with an oblate deformation. we then go on to studydetailed scenarios where free precession is created and/or maintained by someastrophysical mechanism. we consider the effects of accretion torques,electromagnetic torques, glitches and stellar encounters. we find that themechanisms considered are either too weak to lead to a signal detectable by anadvanced ligo interferometer, or occur too infrequently to give a reasonableevent rate. we therefore conclude that, using our stellar model at least, freeprecession is not a good candidate for detection by the forthcoming laserinterferometers.

gr-qc;0406045	is timing noise important in the gravitational wave detection of neutron  stars?	in this paper we ask whether the phenomenon of timing noise long known inelectromagnetic pulsar astronomy is likely to be important in gravitationalwave (gw) observations of spinning-down neutron stars. we find that timingnoise is strong enough to be of importance only in the young pulsars, whichmust have larger triaxialities than theory predicts for their gw emission to bedetectable. however, assuming that their gw emission is detectable, we list thepulsars for which timing noise is important, either because it is strong enoughthat its neglect by the observer would render the source undetectable, or elsebecause it is a measurable feature of the gw signal. we also find that timingnoise places a limit on the observation duration of a coherent blind gw search,and suggest that hierarchical search techniques might be able to cope with thisproblem. demonstration of the presence or absence of timing noise in the gwchannel would give a new probe of neutron star physics.
