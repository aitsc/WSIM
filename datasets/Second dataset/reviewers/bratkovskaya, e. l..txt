nucl-th;0001008	aspects of thermal and chemical equilibration of hadronic matter	we study thermal and chemical equilibration in 'infinite' hadron matter aswell as in finite size relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions using a buucascade transport model that contains resonance and string degrees-of-freedom.the 'infinite' hadron matter is simulated within a cubic box with periodicboundary conditions. the various equilibration times depend on baryon densityand energy density and are much shorter for particles consisting of lightquarks then for particles including strangeness. for kaons and antikaons thechemical equilibration time is found to be larger than $\simeq$ 40 fm/c for allbaryon and energy densities considered. the inclusion of continuum excitations,i.e. hadron 'strings', leads to a limiting temperature of $t_s\simeq$ 150 mev.we, furthermore, study the expansion of a hadronic fireball afterequilibration. the slope parameters of the particles after expansion increasewith their mass; the pions leave the fireball much faster then nucleons andaccelerate subsequently heavier hadrons by rescattering ('pion wind'). if thesystem before expansion is close to the limiting temperature $t_s$, the slopeparameters for all particles after expansion practically do not depend on(initial) energy and baryon density. finally, the equilibration in relativisticnucleus-nucleus collision is considered. since the reaction time here is muchshorter than the equilibration time for strangeness, a chemical equilibrium ofstrange particles in heavy-ion collisions is not supported by our transportcalculations. however, the various particle spectra can approximately bedescribed within the blast model.

1103.4239	electromagnetic field evolution in relativistic heavy-ion collisions	the hadron string dynamics (hsd) model is generalized to include the creationand evolution of retarded electromagnetic fields as well as the influence ofthe magnetic and electric fields on the quasiparticle propagation. thetime-space structure of the fields is analyzed in detail for non-central au+aucollisions at $\sqrt{s_{nn}}=$200 gev. it is shown that the created magneticfield is highly inhomogeneous but in the central region of the overlappingnuclei it changes relatively weakly in the transverse direction. for the impactparameter $b=$10 fm the maximal magnetic field - perpendicularly to thereaction plane - is obtained of order $eb_y/m_\pi^2\sim$5 for a very short time$\sim$ 0.2 fm/c, which roughly corresponds to the time of a maximal overlap ofthe colliding nuclei. we find that at any time the location of the maximum inthe $eb_y$ distribution correlates with that of the energy density of thecreated particles. in contrast, the electric field distribution, being alsohighly inhomogeneous, has a minimum in the center of the overlap region.furthermore, the field characteristics are presented as a function of thecollision energy and the centrality of the collisions. to explore the effect ofthe back reaction of the fields on hadronic observables a comparison of hsdresults with and without fields is exemplified. our actual calculations show nonoticeable influence of the electromagnetic fields - created in heavy-ioncollisions - on the effect of the electric charge separation with respect tothe reaction plane.

1205.6809	strongly intensive measures for multiplicity fluctuations	the recently proposed two families of strongly intensive measures offluctuations and correlations are studied within hadron-string-dynamics (hsd)transport approach to nucleus-nucleus collisions. we consider the measures$\delta^{k\pi}$ and $\sigma^{k\pi}$ for kaon and pion multiplicities in au+aucollisions in a wide range of collision energies and centralities. thesestrongly intensive measures appear to cancel the participant numberfluctuations. this allows to enlarge the centrality window in the analysis ofevent-by-event fluctuations up to at least of 10% most central collisions. wealso present a comparison of the hsd results with the data of na49 and starcollaborations. the hsd describes $\sigma^{k\pi}$ reasonably well. however, thehsd results depend monotonously on collision energy and do not reproduce thebump-deep structure of $\delta^{k\pi}$ observed from the na49 data in theregion of the center of mass energy of nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{nn}}= 8\div 12$gev. this fact deserves further studies. the origin of this `structure' is notconnected with simple geometrical or limited acceptance effects, as theseeffects are taken into account in the hsd simulations.

1508.03887	heavy flavor in relativistic heavy-ion collisions	we study charm production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions by usingthe parton-hadron-string dynamics (phsd) transport approach. the initial charmquarks are produced by the pythia event generator tuned to fit the transversemomentum spectrum and rapidity distribution of charm quarks from fixed-ordernext-to-leading logarithm (fonll) calculations. the produced charm quarksscatter in the quark-gluon plasma (qgp) with the off-shell partons whose massesand widths are given by the dynamical quasi-particle model (dqpm), whichreproduces the lattice qcd equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. therelevant cross sections are calculated in a consistent way by employing theeffective propagators and couplings from the dqpm. close to the critical energydensity of the phase transition, the charm quarks are hadronized into $d$mesons through coalescence and/or fragmentation. the hadronized $d$ mesons theninteract with the various hadrons in the hadronic phase with cross sectionscalculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy-quark spin symmetry.the nuclear modification factor $r_{aa}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $d^0$mesons from phsd are compared with the experimental data from the starcollaboration for au+au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{nn}}$ =200 gev and to the alicedata for pb+pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{nn}}$ =2.76 tev. we find that in thephsd the energy loss of $d$ mesons at high $p_t$ can be dominantly attributedto partonic scattering while the actual shape of $r_{aa}$ versus $p_t$ reflectsthe heavy-quark hadronization scenario, i.e. coalescence versus fragmentation.also the hadronic rescattering is important for the $r_{aa}$ at low $p_t$ andenhances the $d$-meson elliptic flow $v_2$.

1510.04120	chiral symmetry restoration versus deconfinement in heavy-ion collisions  at high baryon density	we study the production of strange hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions from4 to 160 a gev within the parton-hadron-string dynamics (phsd) transportapproach that is extended to incorporate essentials aspects of chiral symmetryrestoration (csr) in the hadronic sector (via the schwinger mechanism) on topof the deconfinement phase transition as implemented in phsd. especially the$k^+/\pi^+$ and the $(\lambda+\sigma^0)/\pi^-$ ratios in central au+aucollisions are found to provide information on the relative importance of bothtransitions. the modelling of chiral symmetry restoration is driven by thepion-nucleon $\sigma$-term in the computation of the quark scalar condensate$&lt;q {\bar q}&gt;$ that serves as an order parameter for csr and also scalesapproximately with the effective quark masses $m_s$ and $m_q$. furthermore, thenucleon scalar density $\rho_s$, which also enters the computation of $&lt;q {\barq}&gt;$, is evaluated within the nonlinear $\sigma-\omega$ model which isconstraint by dirac-brueckner calculations and low energy heavy-ion reactions.the schwinger mechanism (for string decay) fixes the ratio of strange to lightquark production in the hadronic medium. we find that above $\sim$80 a gev thereaction dynamics of heavy nuclei is dominantly driven by partonicdegrees-of-freedom such that traces of the chiral symmetry restoration are hardto identify. our studies support the conjecture of 'quarkyonic matter' inheavy-ion collisions from about 5 to 40 a gev and provide a microscopicexplanation for the maximum in the $k^+/\pi^+$ ratio at about 30 a gev whichonly shows up if a transition to partonic degrees-of-freedom is incorporated inthe reaction dynamics and is discarded in the traditional hadron-string models.

1512.08126	effective qcd and transport description of dilepton and photon  production in heavy-ion collisions and elementary processes	in this review we address the dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion reactionsand in particular the information obtained from electromagnetic probes thatstem from the partonic and hadronic phases. the out-of-equilibrium descriptionof strongly interacting relativistic fields is based on the theory of kadanoffand baym. for the modeling of the partonic phase we introduce a dynamicalquasiparticle model (dqpm) for qcd in equilibrium. the widths and masses of thequasiparticles are controlled by transport coefficients in comparison tolattice qcd results. the resulting off-shell transport approach - denoted byparton-hadron-string dynamics (phsd) - also includes covariant dynamicalhadronization and keeps track of the hadronic interactions in the final phase.we show that phsd captures the bulk dynamics of heavy-ion collisions from spsto lhc energies and provides a basis for the evaluation of the electromagneticemissivity, using the same dynamical parton propagators as for the systemevolution. direct photon production in elementary processes and heavy-ionreactions at rhic and lhc energies is investigated and the status of the photonv2 puzzle - a large elliptic flow of the direct photons observed in a+acollisions - is addressed. we discuss the roles of hadronic and partonicsources for the photon spectra and the flow coefficients v2 and v3 and also thepossibility to subtract the qgp signal from observables. furthermore, theproduction of dilepton pairs is addressed from sis to lhc energies. thelow-mass dilepton yield is enhanced due to the in-medium modification of therho-meson and at the lowest energy also due to a multiple regeneration ofdelta-resonances. in addition, a signal of the partonic degrees-of-freedom isfound in the intermediate dilepton mass regime (1.2gev&lt;m&lt;3gev), which can shedlight on the nature of the very early degrees-of-freedom in nucleus-nucleuscollisions.

0808.0022	parton transport and hadronization from the dynamical quasiparticle  point of view	the hadronization of an expanding partonic fireball is studied within theparton-hadron-strings dynamics (phsd) approach which is based on a dynamicalquasiparticle model (dqpm) matched to reproduce lattice qcd results inthermodynamic equilibrium. apart from strong parton interactions the expansionand development of collective flow is driven by strong gradients in the partonmean-fields. an analysis of the elliptic flow $v_2$ demonstrates a linearcorrelation with the spatial eccentricity $\epsilon$ as in case of idealhydrodynamics. the hadronization occurs by quark-antiquark fusion or 3 quark/3antiquark recombination which is described by covariant transition rates. sincethe dynamical quarks become very massive, the formed resonant 'pre-hadronic'color-dipole states ($q\bar{q}$ or $qqq$) are of high invariant mass, too, andsequentially decay to the groundstate meson and baryon octets increasing thetotal entropy. this solves the entropy problem in hadronization in a naturalway. the resulting particle ratios turn out to be in line with those from agrandcanonical partition function at temperature $t \approx 170$ mev ratherindependent from the initial temperature and indicate an approximatestrangeness equilibration.

0808.1504	open and hidden charm in proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions	we review the collectivity and the suppression pattern of charmed mesons -produced in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at sps (158 agev) andrhic energies (21 atev) - in comparison to dynamical and thermal models. inparticular, we examine the charmonium `melting' and the `comover dissociation'scenarios - implemented in a microscopic transport approach - in comparison tothe available data from the sps and rhic. the analysis shows that the dynamicsof c, c-bar quarks at rhic are dominated by partonic or `pre-hadronic'interactions in the strongly coupled plasma stage. both the `charmoniummelting' and the hadronic `comover absorption and recreation model' are found,however, to be compatible with the experimental observation at sps energies;the experimental ratio of psi'/j/psi versus centrality clearly favors the`hadronic comover' scenario. we find that the collective flow of charm in thepurely hadronic hadron-string dynamics (hsd) transport appears compatible withthe data at sps energies, but substantially underestimates the data at top rhicenergies. thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of d-mesons and the low r_aa(p_t) ofj/psi seen experimentally have to be attributed to early interactions ofnon-hadronic degrees of freedom. simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronicinteractions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the j/psirapidity distribution from pp to central au+au collisions at the top rhicenergy. we demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of low-pt j/psi'sin central au+au collisions indicates that a large fraction of final j/psimesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary.throughout this review we, furthermore, provide predictions for charmobservables from au+au collisions at fair energies of 25-35 agev.

0810.4257	charmed hadron signals of partonic medium	we present a short review of our results on the collectivity and thesuppression pattern of charmed mesons in heavy-ion collisions based on themicroscopic hadron-string dynamics (hsd) transport approach for differentscenarios of charm interactions with the surrounding matter - the 'comover'dissociation by mesons with further recreation by d+dbar channels and'pre-hadronic' interaction scenarios. while at sps energies the hadronic'comover' absorption scenario is found to be compatible with the experimentaldata, the dynamics of c and cbar quarks at rhic are dominated by partonic or'pre-hadronic' interactions in the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma stageand cannot be modeled by pure hadronic interactions. we find that thecollective flow of charm in the purely hadronic scenario appears compatiblewith the data at sps energies but underestimates the data at top rhic energies.thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of d mesons and the low r_aa(pt) of j/psi seenexperimentally at rhic have to be attributed to early interactions ofnon-hadronic degrees of freedom. simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronicinteractions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the j/psirapidity distribution from p+p to central au+au collisions at the top rhicenergy. we demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of high-ptj/psi's in central au+au collisions indicates that a fraction of final j/psimesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary.
