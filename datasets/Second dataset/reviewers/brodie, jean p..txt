0901.1693	an ultra compact dwarf around the sombrero galaxy (m104): the nearest  massive ucd	we report the discovery of an ultra compact dwarf (ucd) associated with thesombrero galaxy (m104). this is the closest massive ucd known and the firstspectroscopically verified massive ucd which is located in a low densityenvironment.  the object, we name sucd1, was identified in hst/acs imaging and confirmed tobe associated with the sombrero galaxy by its recession velocity obtained fromkeck spectra. the light profile is well fitted by a wilson model. we measure ahalf light size of 14.7 +/- 1.4 pc, an absolute magnitude of m_v = -12.3 mag(m_k = -15.1 mag) and an internal velocity dispersion of 25.0 +/- 5.6 km/s.such values are typical of ucds. from lick spectral indices we measure aluminosity-weighted central age of 12.6 +/- 0.9 gyrs, [fe/h] of -0.08 +/- 0.08dex and [alpha/fe] of 0.06 +/- 0.07 dex. the lack of colour gradients suggeststhese values are representative of the entire ucd. the derived stellar andvirial masses are the same, within errors, at ~3.3 x 10e7 msun. thus we find nostrong evidence for dark matter or the need to invoke a non-standard imf.  we also report arguably the first x-ray detection of a bona fide ucd, whichwe attribute to the presence of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). the x-rayluminosity of l_x = 0.56 x 10e38 erg/s is consistent with the values observedfor gcs of the same metallicity. overall we find sucd1 has properties similarto other known ucds and massive gcs.

0902.3025	structure and substructure of galactic spheroids	the full spatio-chemo-dynamical structure of galaxies of all types andenvironments at low redshift provides a critical accompaniment to observationsof galaxy formation at high redshift. the next decade brings the observationalopportunity to strongly constrain nearby galaxies' histories of star formationand assembly, especially in the spheroids that comprise the large majority ofthe stellar mass in the universe but have until now been difficult to study. inorder to constrain the pathways to building up the spheroidal "red-sequence",various standard techniques in photometry and spectroscopy, particularly withresolved tracer populations like globular clusters and planetary nebulae, canbe scaled up to comprehensive surveys as improved wide-field instrumentation isincreasingly available. at the same time, progress in adaptive optics on gianttelescopes could for the first time permit deep, resolved photometric andspectroscopic analysis of large samples of individual stars in these systems,thereby revolutionizing galaxy studies. strong theoretical support is needed inorder to understand the new observational constraints via detailed modeling andself-consistent simulations of star and galaxy formation throughout cosmictime.

0905.4424	probing the 2-d kinematic structure of early-type galaxies out to 3  effective radii	we detail an innovative new technique for measuring the 2-d velocity moments(rotation velocity, velocity dispersion and gauss-hermite coefficients h$_3$and h$_4$) of the stellar populations of galaxy halos using spectra from keckdeimos multi-object spectroscopic observations. the data are used toreconstruct 2-d rotation velocity maps.  here we present data for five nearby early-type galaxies to ~3 effectiveradii. we provide significant insights into the global kinematic structure ofthese galaxies, and challenge the accepted morphological classification inseveral cases. we show that between 1-3 effective radii the velocity dispersiondeclines very slowly, if at all, in all five galaxies. for the two galaxieswith velocity dispersion profiles available from planetary nebulae data we findvery good agreement with our stellar profiles. we find a variety of rotationprofiles beyond 1 effective radius, i.e rotation speed remaining constant,decreasing \emph{and} increasing with radius. these results are of particularimportance to studies which attempt to classify galaxies by their kinematicstructure within one effective radius, such as the recent definition of fast-and slow- rotator classes by the sauron project. our data suggests that therotator class may change when larger galacto-centric radii are probed. this hasimportant implications for dynamical modeling of early-type galaxies. the datafrom this study are available on-line.

1002.1107	deriving metallicities from the integrated spectra of extragalactic  globular clusters using the near-infrared calcium triplet	the ca triplet (cat) feature in the near-infrared has been employed as ametallicity indicator for individual stars as well as integrated light ofgalactic globular clusters (gcs) and galaxies with varying degrees of success,and sometimes puzzling results. using the deimos multi-object spectrograph onkeck we obtain a sample of 144 integrated light spectra of gcs around thebrightest group galaxy ngc 1407 to test whether the cat index can be used as ametallicity indicator for extragalactic gcs. different sets of single stellarpopulation models make different predictions for the behavior of the cat as afunction of metallicity. in this work, the metallicities of the gcs around ngc1407 are obtained from cat index values using an empirical conversion. themeasured cat/metallicity distributions show unexpected features, the mostremarkable being that the brightest red and blue gcs have similar cat valuesdespite their large difference in mean color. suggested explanations for thisbehavior in the ngc 1407 gc system are: 1) the cat may be affected by apopulation of hot blue stars, 2) the cat may saturate earlier than predicted bythe models, and/or 3) color may not trace metallicity linearly. until thesepossibilities are understood, the use of the cat as a metallicity indicator forthe integrated spectra of extragalactic gcs will remain problematic.

1104.5503	global properties of `ordinary' early-type galaxies: photometry and  spectroscopy of stars and globular clusters in ngc 4494	we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial, kinematic, and chemicalproperties of stars and globular clusters (gcs) in the `ordinary' ellipticalgalaxy ngc 4494 using data from the keck and subaru telescopes. we derivegalaxy surface brightness and colour profiles out to large galactocentricradii. we compare the latter to metallicities derived using the near-infraredcalcium triplet. we obtain stellar kinematics out to ~3.5 effective radii. thelatter appear flattened or elongated beyond ~1.8 effective radii in contrast tothe relatively round photometric isophotes. in fact, ngc 4494 may be aflattened galaxy, possibly even an s0, seen at an inclination of ~45 degrees.we publish a catalogue of 431 gc candidates brighter than i=24 based on thephotometry, of which 109 are confirmed spectroscopically and 54 have measuredspectroscopic metallicities. we also report the discovery of 3spectroscopically confirmed ultra-compact dwarfs around ngc 4494 with measuredmetallicities of -0.4&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.3. based on their properties, we conclude thatthey are simply bright gcs. the metal-poor globular clusters are found to berotating with similar amplitude as the galaxy stars, while the metal-richglobular clusters show marginal rotation. we supplement our analysis withavailable literature data and results. using model predictions of galaxyformation, and a suite of merger simulations, we find that many of theobservational properties of ngc 4494 may be explained by formation in arelatively recent gas-rich major merger. complete studies of individualgalaxies incorporating a range of observational avenues and methods such as theone presented here will be an invaluable tool for constraining the fine detailsof galaxy formation models, especially at large galactocentric radii.

1106.0745	the fossil record of two-phase galaxy assembly: kinematics and  metallicities in the nearest s0 galaxy	we present a global analysis of kinematics and metallicity in the nearest s0galaxy, ngc 3115, along with implications for its assembly history. the datainclude high-quality wide-field imaging from suprime-cam on the subarutelescope, and multi-slit spectra of the field stars and globular clusters(gcs) obtained using keck-deimos/lris and magellan-imacs. within two effectiveradii, the bulge (as traced by the stars and metal-rich gcs) is flattened androtates rapidly (v/sigma &gt; 1.5). at larger radii, the rotation declinesdramatically to v/sigma ~ 0.7, but remains well-aligned with the inner regions.the radial decrease in characteristic metallicity of both the metal-rich andmetal-poor gc subpopulations produces strong gradients with power law slopes of-0.17 +/- 0.04 and -0.38 +/- 0.06 dex per dex, respectively. we argue that thispattern is not naturally explained by a binary major merger, but instead by atwo-phase assembly process where the inner regions have formed in an earlyviolent, dissipative phase, followed by the protracted growth of the outerparts via minor mergers with typical mass ratios of ~ 15-20:1.

1106.5058	the globular cluster population of ngc 7457: clues to the evolution of  field s0 galaxies	in this paper we present the results of a wide-field imaging study of theglobular cluster (gc) system of the field s0 galaxy ngc 7457. to derive theglobal properties of the gc system, we obtained deep bvr images with the wiyn3.5 m telescope and minimosaic imager and studied the gc population of ngc 7457to a projected radius of approximately 30 kpc. our ground-based data werecombined with archival and published hubble space telescope data to probe theproperties of the gc system close to the galaxy center and reduce contaminationin the gc candidate sample from foreground stars and background galaxies. weperformed surface photometry of ngc 7457 and compared the galaxy's surfacebrightness profile with the surface density profile of the gc system. theprofiles have similar shapes in the inner 1 arcminute (3.9 kpc), but the gcsystem profile appears to flatten relative to the galaxy light at larger radii.the gc system of ngc 7457 is noticeably elliptical in our images; we measure anellipticity of 0.66 +/- 0.14 for the gc distribution, which is consistent withour measured ellipticity of the galaxy light. we integrated the radial surfacedensity profile of the gc system to derive a total number of gcs n_gc = 210 +/-30. the gc specific frequency normalized by the galaxy luminosity and mass ares_n = 3.1 +/- 0.7 and t = 4.8 +/- 1.1, respectively. comparing the derived gcsystem properties and other empirical data for ngc 7457 to s0 formationscenarios suggests that this field s0 galaxy may have formed in an unequal-massmerger.

1107.0757	spectra of globular clusters in the sombrero galaxy: evidence for  spectroscopic metallicity bimodality	we present a large sample of over 200 integrated-light spectra of confirmedglobular clusters (gcs) associated with the sombrero (m104) galaxy taken withthe deimos instrument on the keck telescope. a significant fraction of thespectra have signal-to-noise levels high enough to allow measurements of gcmetallicities using the method of brodie &amp; huchra (1990). we find adistribution of spectroscopic metallicities ranging from -2.2 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; +0.1that is bimodal, with peaks at [fe/h] ~ -1.4 and -0.6. thus the gc system ofthe sombrero galaxy, like a few other galaxies now studied in detail, reveals abimodal spectroscopic metallicity distribution supporting the long-held beliefthat colour bimodality reflects two metallicity subpopulations. this furthersuggests that the transformation from optical colour to metallicity for oldstellar populations, such as gcs, is not strongly non-linear. we also explorethe radial and magnitude distribution with metallicity for gc subpopulationsbut small number statistics prevent any clear trends in these distributions.

1109.5696	the relationships among compact stellar systems: a fresh view of ultra  compact dwarfs	we use a combined imaging and spectroscopic survey of the nearby centralcluster galaxy, m87, to assemble a sample of 34 confirmed ultra compact dwarfs(ucds) with half-light radii of &gt;~ 10 pc measured from hubble space telescopeimages. this doubles the existing sample in m87, making it the largest suchsample for any galaxy, while extending the detection of ucds to unprecedentedlylow luminosities (mv = -9). with this expanded sample, we find no correlationbetween size and luminosity, in contrast to previous suggestions, and nogeneral correlation between size and galactocentric distance. we explore therelationships between ucds, less luminous extended clusters (including faintfuzzies), globular clusters (gcs), as well as early-type galaxies and theirnuclei, assembling an extensive new catalog of sizes and luminosities forstellar systems. most of the m87 ucds follow a tight color-magnitude relation,offset from the metal-poor gcs. this, along with kinematical differences,demonstrates that most ucds are a distinct population from normal gcs, and notsimply a continuation to larger sizes and higher luminosities. the ucdcolor-magnitude trend couples closely with that for virgo dwarf ellipticalnuclei. we conclude that the m87 ucds are predominantly stripped nuclei. thebrightest and reddest ucds may be the remnant nuclei of more massive galaxieswhile a subset of the faintest ucds may be tidally limited and related to morecompact star clusters. in the broader context of galaxy assembly, blue ucds maytrace halo build-up by accretion of low-mass satellites, while red ucds may bemarkers of metal-rich bulge formation in larger galaxies.

1112.2154	dwarfs gobbling dwarfs: a stellar tidal stream around ngc 4449 and  hierarchical galaxy formation on small scales	a candidate diffuse stellar substructure was previously reported in the haloof the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 4449 by karachentsev et al. we map andanalyze this feature using a unique combination of deep integrated-light imagesfrom the black bird 0.5-meter telescope, and high-resolution wide-field imagesfrom the 8-meter subaru telescope, which resolve the nebulosity into a streamof red giant branch stars, and confirm its physical association with ngc 4449.the properties of the stream imply a massive dwarf spheroidal progenitor, whichafter complete disruption will deposit an amount of stellar mass that iscomparable to the existing stellar halo of the main galaxy. the ratio betweenluminosity or stellar-mass between the two galaxies is ~1:50, while theindirectly measured dynamical mass-ratio, when including dark matter, may be~1:10-1:5. this system may thus represent a "stealth" merger, where aninfalling satellite galaxy is nearly undetectable by conventional means, yethas a substantial dynamical influence on its host galaxy. this singulardiscovery also suggests that satellite accretion can play a significant role inbuilding up the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies, and possibly in triggeringtheir starbursts.

1112.2213	evidence for inhomogeneous reionization in the local universe from  metal-poor globular cluster systems	exploiting a fundamental characteristic of galaxy assembly in the{\lambda}cdm paradigm, the observed spatial biasing and kinematics ofmetal-poor globular star clusters are used to constrain the local reionizationepoch around individual galaxies. selecting three galaxies located in differentenvironments, the first attempt at constraining the environmental propagationof reionization in the local universe is carried out. the joint constraint fromthe three galaxies (z_reion = 10.5^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) agrees remarkably well withthe latest wmap constraint on z_reion for a simple instantaneous reionizationmodel. more importantly, the range of z_reion values found here are consistentwith the global range of z_reion estimates from other observations. wefurthermore find a 1.7{\sigma} indication that reionization completed inlow-density environments before the intergalactic medium in high-densityenvironments was reionized. this is consistent with certain theoretical modelsthat predict that reionization was globally prolonged in duration, with neutralhydrogen pockets surviving in high-density environments, even after thesurrounding regions were reionized. more generally, this work provides a usefulconstraint on the formation history of galaxy stellar halos.

1112.3959	the ongoing assembly of a central cluster galaxy: phase-space  substructures in the halo of m87	the halos of galaxies preserve unique records of their formation histories.we carry out the first combined observational and theoretical study ofphase-space halo substructure in an early-type galaxy: m87, the central galaxyin the virgo cluster. we analyze an unprecedented wide-field, high-precisionphotometric and spectroscopic data set for 488 globular clusters (gcs), whichincludes new, large-radius subaru/suprime-cam and keck/deimos observations. wefind signatures of two substructures in position-velocity phase-space. one is asmall, cold stream associated with a known stellar filament in the outer halo;the other is a large shell-like pattern in the inner halo that implies amassive, hitherto unrecognized accretion event. we perform extensivestatistical tests and independent metallicity analyses to verify the presenceand characterize the properties of these features, and to provide more generalmethodologies for future extragalactic studies of phase-space substructure. thecold outer stream is consistent with a dwarf galaxy accretion event, while forthe inner shell there is tension between a low progenitor mass implied by thecold velocity dispersion, and a high mass from the large number of gcs, whichmight be resolved by a ~0.5 l* e/s0 progenitor. we also carry outproof-of-principle numerical simulations of the accretion of smaller galaxiesin an m87-like gravitational potential. these produce analogous features to theobserved substructures, which should have observable lifetimes of ~1 gyr. theshell and stream gcs together support a scenario where the extended stellarenvelope of m87 has been built up by a steady rain of material that continuesuntil the present day. this phase-space method demonstrates unique potentialfor detailed tests of galaxy formation beyond the local group.

1209.5390	the sluggs survey: ngc 3115, a critical test case for metallicity  bimodality in globular cluster systems	due to its proximity (9 mpc) and the strongly bimodal color distribution ofits spectroscopically well-sampled globular cluster (gc) system, the early-typegalaxy ngc 3115 provides one of the best available tests of whether the colorbimodality widely observed in gc systems generally reflects a true metallicitybimodality. color bimodality has alternatively been attributed to a stronglynonlinear color--metallicity relation reflecting the influence of hothorizontal branch stars. here we couple subaru suprime-cam gi photometry withkeck/deimos spectroscopy to accurately measure gc colors and a cat index thatmeasures the caii triplet. we find the ngc 3115 gc system to be unambiguouslybimodal in both color and the cat index. using simple stellar populationmodels, we show that the cat index is essentially unaffected by variations inhorizontal branch morphology over the range of metallicities relevant to gcsystems (and is thus a robust indicator of metallicity) and confirm bimodalityin the metallicity distribution. we assess the existing evidence for andagainst multiple metallicity subpopulations in early and late-type galaxies andconclude that metallicity bi/multimodality is common. we briefly discuss howthis fundamental characteristic links directly to the star formation andassembly histories of galaxies.

1310.2607	the sluggs survey: wide-field stellar kinematics of early-type galaxies	we present stellar kinematics of 22 nearby early-type galaxies (etgs), basedon two-dimensional (2d) absorption line stellar spectroscopy out to ~2-4 r_e(effective radii), as part of the ongoing sluggs survey. the galaxies span afactor of 20 in intrinsic luminosity, as well as a full range of environmentand etg morphology. our data consist of good velocity resolution (sigma_inst ~25 km/s) integrated stellar-light spectra extracted from the individualslitlets of custom made keck/deimos slitmasks. we extract stellar kinematicsmeasurements (v, sigma, h_3, and h_4) for each galaxy. combining withliterature values from smaller radii, we present 2d spatially resolved maps ofthe large-scale kinematic structure in each galaxy. we find that the kinematichomogeneity found inside 1 r_e often breaks down at larger radii, where avariety of kinematic behaviors are observed. while central slow rotators remainslowly rotating in their halos, central fast rotators show more diversity,ranging from rapidly increasing to rapidly declining specific angular momentumprofiles in the outer regions. there are indications that the outer trendsdepend on morphological type, raising questions about the proposed unificationof the elliptical and lenticular (s0) galaxy families in the atlas^3d survey.several galaxies in our sample show multiple lines of evidence for distinctdisk components embedded in more slowly rotating spheroids, and we suggest ajoint photometric-kinematic approach for robust bulge-disk decomposition. ourobservational results appear generally consistent with a picture of two-phase(in-situ plus accretion) galaxy formation.

1401.1501	the sluggs survey: breaking degeneracies between dark matter, anisotropy  and the imf using globular cluster subpopulations in the giant elliptical ngc  5846	we study the mass and anisotropy distribution of the giant elliptical galaxyngc 5846 using stars, as well as the red and blue globular cluster (gc)subpopulations. we break degeneracies in the dynamical models by takingadvantage of the different phase space distributions of the two gcsubpopulations to unambiguously constrain the mass of the galaxy and theanisotropy of the gc system. red gcs show the same spatial distribution andbehaviour as the starlight, whereas blue gcs have a shallower density profile,a larger velocity dispersion and a lower kurtosis, all of which suggest adifferent orbital distribution. we use a dispersion-kurtosis jeans analysis andfind that the solutions of separate analyses for the two gc subpopulationsoverlap in the halo parameter space. the solution converges on a massive darkmatter halo, consistent with expectations from $\lambda$cdm and wmap7 cosmologyin terms of virial mass ($\log m_{dm} \sim13.3 m_{sun}$) and concentration($c_{vir}\sim8$). this is the first such analysis that solves the dynamics ofthe different gc subpopulations in a self-consistent manner. our methodimproves the uncertainties on the halo parameter determination by a factor oftwo and opens new avenues for the use of elliptical galaxy dynamics as tests ofpredictions from cosmological simulations. the implied stellar mass-to-lightratio derived from the dynamical modelling is fully consistent with a salpeterinitial mass function (imf) and rules out a bottom light imf. the different gcsubpopulations show markedly distinct orbital distributions at large radii,with red gcs having an anisotropy parameter $\beta\sim0.4$ outside $\sim3r_e$,and the blue gcs having $\beta\sim0.15$ at the same radii, while centrally($\sim1r_e$) they are both isotropic. we discuss the implications of ourfindings within the two-phase formation scenario for early-type galaxies.

1401.5128	the sluggs survey: new evidence for a tidal interaction between the  early type galaxies ngc 4365 and ngc 4342	we present new imaging and spectral data for globular clusters (gcs) aroundngc 4365 and ngc 4342. ngc 4342 is a compact, x-ray luminous s0 galaxy with anunusually massive central black hole. ngc 4365 is another atypical galaxy thatdominates the w' group of which ngc 4342 is a member. using imaging from themegacam instrument on the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) we identify astream of gcs between the two galaxies and extending beyond ngc 4342. thestream of gcs is spatially coincident with a stream/plume of stars previouslyidentified. we find that the photometric colours of the stream gcs match thoseassociated with ngc 4342, and that the recession velocity of the combined gcsfrom the stream and ngc 4342 match the recession velocity for ngc 4342 itself.these results suggest that ngc 4342 is being stripped of gcs (and stars) as itundergoes a tidal interaction with the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc 4365. wecompare ngc 4342 to two well-known, tidally stripped galaxies (m32 and ngc4486b) and find various similarities. we also discuss previous claims by bogdanet al. (2012a) that ngc 4342 cannot be undergoing significant tidal strippingbecause it hosts a large dark matter halo.

1402.0687	ultra compact dwarfs in the perseus cluster: ucd formation via tidal  stripping	we present the results of a keck/deimos survey of ultra compact dwarfs (ucds)in the perseus cluster core. we confirm cluster membership for 14 ucds, withradial velocities ~5300 km s$^{-1}$. two of these confirmed perseus ucds haveextremely blue colours ($b-r &lt; 0.6$ mag), reside in star forming filamentssurrounding ngc 1275, and have likely formed as massive star clusters in thelast ~100 myr. we also measure a central velocity dispersion of a third, ucd13($\sigma_0 = 38 \pm 8$ km s$^{-1}$), the most extended ucd in our sample. wedetermine it to have radius $r_{e} = 85 \pm 1.1$ pc, a dynamical mass of ($2.3\pm 0.8)\times10^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$, and a metallicity [z/h]$=-0.52^{+0.33}_{-0.29}$ dex. ucd13 and the cluster's central galaxy, ngc 1275,have a projected separation of 30 kpc and a radial velocity difference of ~20km s$^{-1}$. based on its size, red colour, internal velocity dispersion,dynamical mass, metallicity and proximity to ngc 1275, we argue that ucd13 islikely the remnant nucleus of a tidally stripped de, with this progenitor dehaving $m_{b} \approx -16$ mag and mass $\sim10^{9}$ m$_{\odot}$.

1405.0008	the sluggs survey: hst/acs mosaic imaging of the ngc 3115 globular  cluster system	we present hst/acs $g$ and $z$ photometry and half-light radii $r_{\rm h}$measurements of 360 globular cluster (gc) candidates around the nearby s0galaxy ngc 3115. we also include subaru/suprime-cam $g$, $r$, and $i$photometry of 421 additional candidates. the well-established color bimodalityof the gc system is obvious in the hst/acs photometry. we find evidence for a"blue tilt" in the blue gcs, wherein the blue gcs get redder as luminosityincreases, indicative of a mass-metallicity relationship. we find a colorgradient in both the red and blue subpopulations, with each group of clustersbecoming bluer at larger distances from ngc 3115. the gradient is of similarstrength in both subpopulations, but is monotonic and more significant for theblue clusters. on average, the blue clusters have ~10% larger $r_{\rm h}$ thanthe red clusters. this average difference is less than is typically observedfor early-type galaxies but does match that measured in the literature form104, suggesting that morphology and inclination may affect the measured sizedifference between the red and blue clusters. however, the scatter on the$r_{\rm h}$ measurements is large. we also identify 31 clusters more extendedthan typical gcs, which we consider ultra-compact dwarf (ucd) candidates. manyof these objects are fainter than typical ucds. while it is likely that asignificant number will be background contaminants, six of these ucd candidatesare spectroscopically confirmed. to explore low-mass x-ray binaries in the gcsystem, we match our acs and suprime-cam detections to corresponding chandrax-ray sources. we identify 45 x-ray - gc matches, 16 among the bluesubpopulation and 29 among the red subpopulation. these x-ray/gc coincidencefractions are larger than is typical for most gc systems, probably due to theincreased depth of the x-ray data compared to previous studies of gc systems.

1405.2079	the sages legacy unifying globulars and galaxies survey (sluggs): sample  definition, methods, and initial results	we introduce and provide the scientific motivation for a wide-fieldphotometric and spectroscopic chemodynamical survey of nearby early-typegalaxies (etgs) and their globular cluster (gc) systems. the sluggs (sageslegacy unifying globulars and galaxies) survey is being carried out primarilywith subaru/suprime-cam and keck/deimos. the former provides deep gri imagingover a 900 arcmin^2 field-of-view to characterize gc and host galaxy colors andspatial distributions, and to identify spectroscopic targets. the nir caiitriplet provides gc line-of-sight velocities and metallicities out to typically~8 r_e, and to ~15 r_e in some cases. new techniques to extract integratedstellar kinematics and metallicities to large radii (~2-3 r_e) are used inconcert with gc data to create two-dimensional velocity and metallicity mapsfor comparison with simulations of galaxy formation. the advantages of sluggscompared with other, complementary, 2d-chemodynamical surveys are its superiorvelocity resolution, radial extent, and multiple halo tracers. we describe thesample of 25 nearby etgs, the selection criteria for galaxies and gcs, theobserving strategies, the data reduction techniques, and modeling methods. thesurvey observations are nearly complete and more than 30 papers have so farbeen published using sluggs data. here we summarize some initial results,including signatures of two-phase galaxy assembly, evidence for gc metallicitybimodality, and a novel framework for the formation of extended star clustersand ultracompact dwarfs. an integrated overview of current chemodynamicalconstraints on gc systems points to separate, in-situ formation modes at highredshifts for metal-poor and metal-rich gcs.

1405.2338	the sluggs survey: exploring the metallicity gradients of nearby  early-type galaxies to large radii	stellar metallicity gradients in the outer regions of galaxies are a criticaltool for disentangling the contributions of in-situ and ex-situ formed stars.in the two-phase galaxy formation scenario, the initial gas collapse createssteep metallicity gradients, while the accretion of stars formed in satellitestends to flatten these gradients in the outskirts, particularly for massivegalaxies. this work presents the first compilation of extended metallicityprofiles over a wide range of galaxy mass. we use the deimos spectrograph onthe keck telescope in multi-slit mode to obtain radial stellar metallicityprofiles for 22 nearby early-type galaxies. from the calcium triplet lines inthe near-infrared we measure the metallicity of the starlight up to 3 effectiveradii. we find a relation between the outer metallicity gradient and galaxymass, in the sense that lower mass systems show steeper metallicity gradientsthan more massive galaxies. this result is consistent with a picture in whichthe ratio of ex-situ to in-situ formed stars is lower in less massive galaxiesas a consequence of the smaller contribution by accretion. in addition, weinfer a correlation between the strength of the calcium triplet feature in thenear-infrared and the stellar initial mass function slope that is consistentwith recent models in the literature.

1406.5511	kinematics and simulations of the stellar stream in the halo of the  umbrella galaxy	we study the dynamics of faint stellar substructures around the umbrellagalaxy, ngc 4651, which hosts a dramatic system of streams and shells formedthrough the tidal disruption of a nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy. weelucidate the basic characteristics of the system (colours, luminosities,stellar masses) using multi-band subaru/suprime-cam images. the implied stellarmass-ratio of the ongoing merger event is about 1:50. we identify candidatekinematic tracers (globular clusters, planetary nebulae, h ii regions), andfollow up a subset with keck/deimos spectroscopy to obtain velocities. we findthat 15 of the tracers are likely associated with halo substructures, includingthe probable stream progenitor nucleus. these objects delineate a kinematicallycold feature in position-velocity phase space. we model the stream using singletest-particle orbits, plus a rescaled pre-existing n-body simulation. we infera very eccentric orbit with a period of roughly 0.35 gyr and turning points atapproximately 2-4 and 40 kpc, implying a recent passage of the satellitethrough the disc, which may have provoked the visible disturbances in the hostgalaxy. this work confirms that the kinematics of low surface brightnesssubstructures can be recovered and modeled using discrete tracers - abreakthrough that opens up a fresh avenue for unraveling the detailed physicsof minor merging.

1406.6065	the aimss project i: bridging the star cluster - galaxy divide	we describe the structural and kinematic properties of the first compactstellar systems discovered by the aimss project. these spectroscopicallyconfirmed objects have sizes ($\sim$6 $&lt;$ r$_{\rm e}$ [pc] $&lt;$ 500) and masses($\sim$2$\times$10$^{6}$ $&lt;$ m$_*$/m$_\odot$ $&lt;$ 6$\times$10$^{9}$) spanningthe range of massive globular clusters (gcs), ultra compact dwarfs (ucds) andcompact elliptical galaxies (ces), completely filling the gap between starclusters and galaxies.  several objects are close analogues to the prototypical ce, m32. theseobjects, which are more massive than previously discovered ucds of the samesize, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend forcompact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for auniversal "zone of avoidance" for dynamically hot stellar systems in themass-size plane.  overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1)massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. our dataprovide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type ucd/ce populationinto two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by thestripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formedthrough the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues ofclassical ellipticals. we find compact stellar systems around galaxies in lowto high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processesresponsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.

1408.2558	the aimss project ii: dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios across the star  cluster - galaxy divide	the previously clear division between small galaxies and massive starclusters is now occupied by objects called ultra compact dwarfs (ucds) andcompact ellipticals (ces). here we combine a sample of ucds and ces withvelocity dispersions from the aimss project with literature data to exploretheir dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios.  we confirm that the mass ratios of many ucds in the stellar mass range 10$^6$-- 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$ are systematically higher than those for globularclusters which have mass ratios near unity. however, at the very highest massesin our sample, i.e. 10$^9$ -- 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, we find that ce galaxiesalso have mass ratios of close to unity, indicating their central regions aremostly composed of stars.  suggested explanations for the elevated mass ratios of ucds have included avariable imf, a central black hole, and the presence of dark matter. here wepresent another possible explanation, i.e. tidal stripping. under variousassumptions, we find that the apparent variation in the mass ratio with stellarmass and stellar density can be qualitatively reproduced by published tidalstripping simulations of a dwarf elliptical galaxy. in the early stages of thestripping process the galaxy is unlikely to be in virial equilibrium. at latestages, the final remnant resembles the properties of $\sim$10$^7$ m$_{\odot}$ucds. finally, we discuss the need for more detailed realistic modelling oftidal stripping over a wider range of parameter space, and observations tofurther test the stripping hypothesis.

1409.8676	the sluggs survey: globular cluster stellar population trends from weak  absorption lines in stacked spectra	as part of the sluggs survey, we stack 1137 keck deimos spectra of globularclusters from 10 galaxies to study their stellar populations in detail. thestacked spectra have median signal to noise ratios of $\sim 90$ \aa$^{-1}$.besides the calcium triplet, we study weaker sodium, magnesium, titanium andiron lines as well as the h$\alpha$ and higher order paschen hydrogen lines. ingeneral, the stacked spectra are consistent with old ages and a milky way-likeinitial mass function. however, we see different metal line index strengths atfixed colour and magnitude, and differences in the calcium triplet--colourrelation from galaxy to galaxy. we interpret this as strong evidence forvariations in the globular cluster colour--metallicity relation betweengalaxies. two possible explanations for the colour--metallicity relationvariations are that the average ages of globular clusters vary from galaxy togalaxy or that the average abundances of light elements (i.e. he, c, n and o)differ between galaxies. stacking spectra by magnitude, we see that the coloursbecome redder and metal line indices stronger with brighter magnitudes. thesetrends are consistent with the previously reported `blue tilts' beingmass--metallicity relations.

1412.2752	detection of a distinct metal-poor stellar halo in the early-type galaxy  ngc 3115	we present the resolved stellar populations in the inner and outer halo ofthe nearby lenticular galaxy ngc~3115. using deep hst observations, we analyzestars two magnitudes fainter than the tip of the red giant branch (trgb). westudy three fields along the minor axis of this galaxy, 19, 37 and 54 kpc fromits center -- corresponding to 7, 14, 21 effective radii (r_{e}). even at theselarge galactocentric distances, all of the fields are dominated by a relativelyenriched population, with the main peak in the metallicity distributiondecreasing with radius from [z/h] ~ -0.5 to -0.65. the fraction of metal-poorstars ([z/h] &lt; -0.95) increases from 17%, at 16-37 kpc, to 28%, at ~54 kpc. weobserve a distinct low metallicity population (peaked at [z/h] ~ -1.3 and withtotal mass 2*10^{10}m_{\odot} ~ 14% of the galaxy's stellar mass) and arguethat this represents the detection of an underlying low metallicity stellarhalo. such halos are generally predicted by galaxy formation theories and havebeen observed in several late type galaxies including the milky way and m31.the metallicity and spatial distribution of the stellar halo of ngc~3115 areconsistent with the galaxy's globular cluster system, which has a similar lowmetallicity population that becomes dominant at these large radii. this findingsupports the use of globular clusters as bright chemo-dynamical tracers ofgalaxy halos. these data also allow us to make a precise measurement of themagnitude of the trgb, from which we derive a distance modulus of ngc~3115 of30.05\pm0.05\pm0.10_{sys} (10.2\pm0.2\pm0.5_{sys} mpc).

1503.00726	radial distributions of sub-populations in the globular cluster m15: a  more centrally concentrated primordial population	we examine the radial distributions of stellar populations in the globularcluster (gc) m15, using hst/wfc3 photometry of red giants in thenitrogen-sensitive f343n-f555w color. surprisingly, we find that giants with"primordial" composition (i.e., n abundances similar to those in field stars)are the most centrally concentrated within the wfc3 field. we then combine ourwfc3 data with sdss u, g photometry and find that the trend reverses for radii&gt;1' (3 pc) where the ratio of primordial to n-enhanced giants increasesoutwards, as already found by lardo et al. the ratio of primordial to enrichedstars thus has a u-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near thehalf-light radius. n-body simulations show that mass segregation might producea trend resembling the observed one, but only if the n-enhanced giants are~0.25 mo less massive than the primordial giants, which requires extreme heenhancement (y~0.40). however, such a large difference in y is incompatiblewith the negligible optical color differences between primordial and enrichedgiants which suggest delta y &lt; 0.03 and thus a difference in turn-off mass ofdelta m &lt; 0.04 mo between the different populations. the radial trends in m15are thus unlikely to be of dynamical origin and presumably reflect initialconditions, a result that challenges all current gc formation scenarios. wenote that population gradients in the central regions of gcs remain poorlyinvestigated and may show a more diverse behavior than hitherto thought.

1503.07520	a sluggs and gemini/gmos combined study of the elliptical galaxy m60:  wide-field photometry and kinematics of the globular cluster system	we present new wide-field photometry and spectroscopy of the globularclusters (gcs) around ngc 4649 (m60), the third brightest galaxy in the virgocluster. imaging of ngc 4649 was assembled from a recently-obtained hst/acsmosaic, and new subaru/suprime-cam and archival cfht/megacam data. about 1200sources were followed up spectroscopically using combined observations fromthree multi-object spectrographs: keck/deimos, gemini/gmos and mmt/hectospec.we confirm 431 unique gcs belonging to ngc 4649, a factor of 3.5 larger thanprevious datasets and with a factor of 3 improvement in velocity precision. weconfirm significant gc colour bimodality and find that the red gcs are morecentrally concentrated, while the blue gcs are more spatially extended. weinfer negative gc colour gradients in the innermost 20 kpc and flat gradientsout to large radii. rotation is detected along the galaxy major axis for alltracers: blue gcs, red gcs, galaxy stars and planetary nebulae. we compare theobserved properties of ngc 4649 with galaxy formation models. we find thatformation via a major merger between two gas-poor galaxies, followed bysatellite accretion, can consistently reproduce the observations of ngc 4649 atdifferent radii. we find no strong evidence to support an interaction betweenngc 4649 and the neighbouring spiral galaxy ngc 4647. we identify interestinggc kinematic features in our data, such as counter-rotating subgroups and bumpykinematic profiles, which encode more clues about the formation history of ngc4649.

1504.00075	small scatter and nearly-isothermal mass profiles to four half-light  radii from two-dimensional stellar dynamics of early-type galaxies	we study the total mass-density profile for a sample of 14 fast-rotatorearly-type galaxies (stellar masses $10.2&lt;\log m_\ast/m_\odot&lt;11.7$). wecombine observations from the sluggs and atlas3d surveys to map out the stellarkinematics in two-dimensions, out to a median radius for the sample of fourhalf-light radii $r_e$ (or 10 kpc), and a maximum radius of 2.0-6.2 $r_e$ (or4-21 kpc). we use axisymmetric dynamical models based on the jeans equations,which allow for a spatially varying anisotropy, and employ quite generalprofiles for the dark halos, and in particular do not place any restriction onthe profile slope. this is made possible by the availability of spatiallyextended two-dimensional kinematics. we find that our relatively simple modelsprovide a remarkably good description of the observed kinematics. the resultingtotal density profiles are well described by a nearly-isothermal power law$\rho_{\rm tot}(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ from $r_e$/10 to at least 4$r_e$, thelargest average deviation being 11%. the average logarithmic slope is$\langle\gamma\rangle=2.19\pm0.03$ with observed rms scatter of just$\sigma_\gamma=0.11$. this scatter out to large radii, where dark matterdominates, is as small as previously reported by lensing studies around$r\approx r_e/2$, where the stars dominate. our bulge-halo conspiracy placesmuch tighter constraints on galaxy formation models. it illustrates the powerof two-dimensional stellar kinematics observations at large radii. it would nowbe important to test the generality of our results for different galaxy typesand larger samples.

1504.03325	the sluggs survey: multi-population dynamical modelling of the  elliptical galaxy ngc 1407 from stars and globular clusters	we perform in-depth dynamical modelling of the luminous and dark matter (dm)content of the elliptical galaxy ngc 1407. our strategy consists of solving thespherical jeans equations for three independent dynamical tracers: stars, bluegcs and red gcs in a self-consistent manner. we adopt a maximum-likelihoodmarkov-chain monte carlo fitting technique in the attempt to constrain theinner slope of the dm density profile (the cusp/core problem), and the stellarinitial mass function (imf) of the galaxy. we find the inner logarithmic slopeof the dm density profiles to be $\gamma = 0.6\pm0.4$, which is consistent witheither a dm cusp ($\gamma = 1$) or with a dm core $(\gamma = 0)$. our findingsare consistent with a salpeter imf, and marginally consistent with a kroupaimf. we infer tangential orbits for the blue gcs, and radial anisotropy for redgcs and stars. the modelling results are consistent with the virialmass--concentration relation predicted by $\lambda$cdm simulations. the virialmass of ngc 1407 is $\log$ $m_{\rm vir} = 13.3 \pm 0.2 m_{\odot}$, whereas thestellar mass is $\log m_* = 11.8 \pm 0.1 m_{\odot}$. the overall uncertaintieson the mass of ngc 1407 are only 5 per cent at the projected stellar effectiveradius. we attribute the disagreement between our results and previous x-rayresults to the gas not being in hydrostatic equilibrium in the central regionsof the galaxy. the halo of ngc 1407 is found be dm dominated, with a dynamicalmass-to-light ratio of $m/l=260_{-100} ^{+174} m_{\odot}/l_{\odot, b}$.however, this value can be larger up to a factor of 3 depending on the assumedprior on the dm scale radius.

1505.04795	the sluggs survey: combining stellar and globular cluster metallicities  in the outer regions of early-type galaxies	the outer halo regions of early-type galaxies carry key information abouttheir past accretion history. however, spectroscopically probing the stellarcomponent at such galactocentric radii is still challenging. using keck/deimos,we have been able to measure the metallicities of the stellar and globularcluster components in 12 early-type galaxies out to more than $10~\rm{r_{e}}$.we find similar metallicity gradients for the metal-poor and metal-richglobular cluster subpopulations, suggesting a common formation process for thetwo subpopulations. this is in conflict with most current theoreticalpredictions, where the metal-poor globular clusters are thought to be purelyaccreted and metal-rich globular clusters mostly formed in-situ. moreover, wefind that the globular cluster metallicity gradients show a trend with galaxymass, being steeper in lower-mass galaxies than in higher-mass galaxies. thisis similar to what we find for the outermost galaxy stars and suggests a moreactive accretion history, with a larger role played by major mergers, in themost massive galaxies. this conclusion is qualitatively consistent withexpectations from two-phase galaxy assembly models. finally, we find that thesmall difference in metallicity between galaxy stars and metal-rich globularclusters at $1~\rm{r_{e}}$ may correlate with galaxy mass. the origin of thisdifference is not currently clear.

1506.05447	the megasecond chandra x-ray visionary project observation of ngc 3115  (iii): luminosity functions of lmxbs and dependence on stellar environments	we have studied the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) in the nearby lenticular galaxy ngc 3115, using the megasecondchandra x-ray visionary project observation. with a total exposure time of ~1.1ms, we constructed the xlf down to a limiting luminosity of ~10^36 erg/s, muchdeeper than typically reached for other early-type galaxies. we foundsignificant flattening of the overall lmxb xlf from dn/dl \proptol^{-2.2\pm0.4} above 5.5x10^37 erg/s to dn/dl \propto l^{-1.0\pm0.1} below it,though we could not rule out a fit with a higher break at ~1.6x10^38 erg/s. wealso found evidence that the xlf of lmxbs in globular clusters (gcs) is overallflatter than that of field lmxbs. thus our results for this galaxy do notsupport the idea that all lmxbs are formed in gcs. the xlf of field lmxbs seemsto show spatial variation, with the xlf in the inner region of the galaxy beingflatter than that in the outer region, probably due to contamination of lmxbsfrom undetected and/or disrupted gcs in the inner region. the xlf in the outerregion is probably the xlf of primordial field lmxbs, exhibiting dn/dl \proptol^{-1.2\pm0.1} up to a break close to the eddington limit of neutron star lmxbs(~1.7x10^38 erg/s). the break of the gc lmxb xlf is lower, at ~1.1x10^37 erg/s.we also confirm previous findings that the metal-rich/red gcs are more likelyto host lmxbs than the metal-poor/blue gcs, which is more significant for moreluminous lmxbs, and that more massive gcs are more likely to host lmxbs.

1506.06820	the sluggs survey: inferring the formation epochs of metal-poor and  metal-rich globular clusters	we present a novel, observationally-based framework for the formation epochsand sites of globular clusters (gcs) in a cosmological context. measuringdirectly the mean ages of the metal-poor and metal-rich gc subpopulations inour own galaxy, and in other galaxies, is observationally challenging. here weapply an alternative approach utilising the property that the galaxymass-metallicity relation is a strong function of redshift (or look-back age)but is relatively insensitive to galaxy mass for massive galaxies. assumingthat gcs follow galaxy mass-metallicity relations that evolve with redshift,one can estimate the mean formation epochs of the two gc subpopulations byknowing their mean metallicities and the growth in host galaxy mass withredshift. recently, the sluggs survey has measured the spectroscopicmetallicities for over 1000 gcs in a dozen massive early-type galaxies. here weuse these measurements, and our new metallicity matching method, to infer amean age for metal-rich gcs of 11.5 gyr (z = 2.9) and a range of 12.2 to 12.8gyr (4.8 &lt; z &lt; 5.9) for the metal- poor gcs, depending on whether they mostlyformed in accreted satellites or in-situ within the main host galaxy. wecompare our values to direct age measurements for milky way gcs and predictionsfrom cosmological models. our findings suggest that reionisation preceded mostgc formation, and that it is unlikely to be the cause of gc bimodal metallicitydistributions.

'alpha-enhanced' stellarpopulation models. we verified the reliability of these models by comparingthem with high s/n galactic globular cluster data. we observe a weak trend ofdecreasing [alpha/fe] with increasing metallicity in the ngc 524 clusters.analysis of the cluster system kinematics reveals that the full sample exhibitsa rotation of 114+/-60 km/s around a position angle of 22+/-27 deg, and avelocity dispersion of 186+/-29 km/s at a mean radius of 89 arcsec from thegalaxy centre. subdividing the clusters into metal-poor and metal-richsubcomponents we find that the metal-poor (17) clusters and metal-rich (11)clusters have similar velocity dispersions (197+/-40 km/s and 169+/-47 km/srespectively). the metal-poor clusters dominate the rotation in our sample with147+/-75 km/s, whilst the metal-rich clusters show no significant rotation(68+/-84 km/s). we derive a virial and projected mass estimation for ngc 524 ofbetween 4 and 13 x 10^11 msun (depending on the assumed orbital distribution)interior to 2 effective radii of this galaxy.

astro-ph;0403160	metal-poor globular clusters and galaxy formation	we demonstrate a significant (&gt; 5-sigma) correlation between the mean colorof metal-poor globular cluster (gc) systems and parent galaxy luminosity. abayesian markov chain monte carlo method is introduced to find the mean color,and is easily generalizable to quantify multimodality in other astronomicaldatasets. we derive a gc color--galaxy luminosity relation of the form z ~ l^(0.15 +/- 0.03). when combined with evidence against a single primordial gcmetallicity--galaxy luminosity relation for protogalactic fragments, theexistence of such a correlation is evidence against both accretion and majormerger scenarios as an explanation of the entire metal-poor gc systems ofluminous galaxies. however, our relation arises naturally in an in situ pictureof gc formation, and is consistent with the truncation of metal-poor gcformation by reionization. a further implication is that the ages of metal-poorgcs in dwarf galaxies constrain the main epoch of galaxy formation inhierarchical models. if the ages of old metal-poor gcs in local group dwarfs (&gt;11 gyr) are typical of those in dwarfs elsewhere, then the bulk of galaxyassembly (at least in clusters and groups) must have occurred at z &gt; 2.5,contrary to the predictions of some structure formation models.

(2) many des have metal-rich gc subpopulations. wealso confirm the gc color--galaxy luminosity relations found previously forboth metal-poor and metal-rich gc subpopulations. (3) there are largedifferences in gc specific frequency among des. over -15 &lt; m_b &lt; -18, there islittle correlation between specific frequency (s_n)and m_b. but we do findevidence for two separate s_n classes of des: those with b-band s_n ~ 2, andothers with populous gc systems that have s_n ranging from ~ 5-20 with medians_n ~ 10. together, these points suggest multiple formation channels for des invirgo. (4) the peak of the gc luminosity function (gclf) is the same for bothges and des. this is contrary to expectations of dynamical friction on massivegcs, unless the primordial gclf varies between ges and des. among ges the gclfturnover varies by a surprising small 0.05 mag, an encouraging result for itsuse as an accurate standard candle. (5) de,ns appear bimodal in their nuclearproperties: there are small bright red nuclei consistent with formation bydynamical friction of gcs, and larger faint blue nuclei which appear to haveformed by a dissipative process with little contribution from gcs. the role ofdynamical evolution in shaping the present-day properties of de gc systems andtheir nuclei remains ambiguous.

astro-ph;0509077	kinematics of globular cluster systems and the formation of early-type  galaxies	we numerically investigate the kinematic properties of globular clustersystems (gcss) in e/s0 galaxies formed from dissipationless merging of spiralgalaxies. the metal-poor globular clusters (mpcs) and metal-rich clusters(mrcs) in the merger progenitors are initially assumed to have spatialdistributions consistent with the milky way gc system. our principal results,which can be tested against observations, are as follows. both mpcs and mrcs inelliptical galaxies formed from major mergers can exhibit significant rotationat large radii ($\sim$20 kpc) due to the conversion of initial orbital angularmomentum into intrinsic angular momentum of the remnant. mpcs show highercentral velocity dispersions than mrcs for most major merger models. $v_{\rmm}/{\sigma}_{0}$ (where $v_{\rm m}$ and ${\sigma}_{0}$, are the gcs maximumrotational velocity and central velocity dispersion of respectively) rangesfrom 0.2--1.0 and 0.1--0.9 for the mpcs and mrcs respectively, within $6r_{\rme}$ for the remnant elliptical. for most merger remnant ellipticals, $v_{\rmm}/{\sigma}_{0}$ of gcss within $6r_{\rm e}$ is greater than that of the fieldstars within $2r_{\rm e}$. the radial profiles of rotational velocities andvelocity dispersions of the gcss depend upon the orbital configuration of themerger progenitors, their mass-ratios, and the viewing angle. for example, moreflattened early-type galaxies, formed through mergers with small mass ratios($\sim$ 0.1), show little rotation in the outer mrcs. two-dimensional (2d)velocity dispersion distributions of the gcss of merger remnant ellipticals aregenerally flattened for both mpcs and mrcs, reflecting the fact that the gcsshave anisotropic velocity dispersions (abridged).

astro-ph;9702146	on the origin of globular cluster systems in elliptical and cd galaxies	perhaps the most noteworthy of recent findings in extragalactic globularcluster (gc) research are the multimodal gc metallicity distributions seen inmassive early-type galaxies. we explore the origin of these distinct gcpopulations, the implications for galaxy formation and evolution, and identifyseveral new properties of gc systems. first, when we separate the metal-richand metal-poor subpopulations, in galaxies with bimodal gc metallicitydistributions, we find that the mean metallicity of the metal-rich gcscorrelates well with parent galaxy luminosity but the mean metallicity of themetal-poor ones does not. this indicates that the metal-rich gcs are closelycoupled to the galaxy and share a common chemical enrichment history with thegalaxy field stars. the mean metallicity of the metal-poor population islargely independent of the galaxy luminosity. second, the slope of the gcsystem radial surface density varies considerably in early-type galaxies.however the galaxies with relatively populous gc systems for their luminosity(called high specific frequency, s_n) only have shallow, extended radialdistributions. a characteristic of high s_n galaxies is that their gcs arepreferentially located in the outer galaxy regions relative to the underlyingstarlight. third, we find that the ratio of metal-rich to metal-poor gcscorrelates with s_n. in other words, high s_n galaxies have proportionatelymore metal-poor gcs, per unit galaxy light, than low s_n galaxies. fourth, wefind steeper metallicity gradients in high s_n galaxies. this is due to thegreater number of metal-poor gcs at large galactocentric radii. we criticallyreview current ideas for the origin of gcs in giant elliptical (ge) and cdgalaxies and conclude that the gaseous merger model of ashman &amp; zepf (1992) is

astro-ph;9908203	the age difference between the globular cluster sub-populations in ngc  4472	the age difference between the two main globular cluster sub-populations inthe virgo giant elliptical galaxy, ngc 4472 (m 49), has been determined usinghst wfpc2 images in the f555w and f814w filters. accurate photometry has beenobtained for several hundred globular clusters in each of the two mainsub-populations, down to more than one magnitude below the turn-over of theirluminosity functions. this allows precise determinations of both the meancolors and the turn-over magnitudes of the two main sub-populations. bycomparing the data with various population synthesis models, theage-metallicity pairs that fit both the observed colors and magnitudes havebeen identified. the metal-poor and the metal-rich globular clusters are foundto be coeval within the errors ($\sim 3$ gyr). if one accepts the validity ofour assumptions, these errors are dominated by model uncertainties. asystematic error of up to 4 gyr could affect this result if the blue and thered clusters have significantly different mass distributions. however, that onesub-population is half as old as the other is excluded at the 99% confidencelevel. the different globular cluster populations are assumed to trace thegalaxy's major star-formation episodes. consequently, the vast majority ofglobular clusters, and by implication the majority of stars, in ngc 4472 formedat high redshifts but by two distinct mechanisms or in two episodes.
