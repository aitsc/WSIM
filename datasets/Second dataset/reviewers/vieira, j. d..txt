0911.2444	sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster profiles measured with the south pole  telescope	we present sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters obtained with the south pole telescope. the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) cluster signals are measured at 150 ghz, and concurrent 220 ghz data areused to reduce astrophysical contamination. radial profiles are computed usinga technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. inseveral clusters, significant sz decrements are detected out to a substantialfraction of the virial radius. the profiles are fit to the beta model and to ageneralized nfw pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe theiraverage behavior. we find model parameters that are consistent with previousstudies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized nfw model. bothmodels fit the spt data comparably well, and both are consistent with theaverage sz profile out to the virial radius. the integrated compton-y parametery_sz is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent andmodel-independent techniques, and the results are compared to x-ray estimatesof cluster parameters. we find that y_sz scales with y_x and gas mass with lowscatter. since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, ourresults point to a tight mass-observable relation for the spt cluster survey.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

0912.2341	a method for individual source brightness estimation in single- and  multi-band data	we present a method of reliably extracting the flux of individual sourcesfrom sky maps in the presence of noise and a source population in which numbercounts are a steeply falling function of flux. the method is an extension of astandard bayesian procedure in the millimeter/submillimeter literature. as inthe standard method, the prior applied to source flux measurements is derivedfrom an estimate of the source counts as a function of flux, dn/ds. the keyfeature of the new method is that it enables reliable extraction of propertiesof individual sources, which previous methods in the literature do not. wefirst present the method for extracting individual source fluxes from data in asingle observing band, then we extend the method to multiple bands, includingprior information about the spectral behavior of the source population(s). themulti-band estimation technique is particularly relevant for classifyingindividual sources into populations according to their spectral behavior. wefind that proper treatment of the correlated prior information betweenobserving bands is key to avoiding significant biases in estimations ofmulti-band fluxes and spectral behavior, biases which lead to significantnumbers of misclassified sources. we test the single- and multi-band versionsof the method using simulated observations with observing parameters similar tothat of the south pole telescope data used in vieira, et al.

0912.4315	angular power spectra of the millimeter wavelength background light from  dusty star-forming galaxies with the south pole telescope	we use data from the first 100 square-degree field observed by the south poletelescope (spt) in 2008 to measure the angular power spectrum of temperatureanisotropies contributed by the background of dusty star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) at millimeter wavelengths. from the auto and cross-correlation of 150and 220 ghz spt maps, we significantly detect both poisson distributed and, forthe first time at millimeter wavelengths, clustered components of power from abackground of dsfgs. the spectral indices between 150 and 220 ghz of thepoisson and clustered components are found to be 3.86 +- 0.23 and 3.8 +- 1.3respectively, implying a steep scaling of the dust emissivity index beta ~ 2.the poisson and clustered power detected in spt, blast (at 600, 860, and 1200ghz), and spitzer (1900 ghz) data can be understood in the context of a simplemodel in which all galaxies have the same graybody spectrum with dustemissivity index of beta = 2 and dust temperature t_d = 34 k. in this model,half of the 150 ghz background light comes from redshifts greater than 3.2. wealso use the spt data to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich power spectrum at l = 3000 of 13 uk^2 at 95% confidence.

0912.4317	measurements of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  the south pole telescope	we report cosmic microwave background (cmb) power spectrum measurements fromthe first 100 sq. deg. field observed by the south pole telescope (spt) at 150and 220 ghz. on angular scales where the primary cmb anisotropy is dominant,ell ~&lt; 3000, the spt power spectrum is consistent with the standard lambdacdmcosmology. on smaller scales, we see strong evidence for a point sourcecontribution, consistent with a population of dusty, star-forming galaxies.after we mask bright point sources, anisotropy power on angular scales of 3000&lt; ell &lt; 9500 is detected with a signal-to-noise &gt; 50 at both frequencies. wecombine the 150 and 220 ghz data to remove the majority of the point sourcepower, and use the point source subtracted spectrum to detectsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) power at 2.6 sigma. at ell=3000, the sz power in thesubtracted bandpowers is 4.2 +/- 1.5 uk^2, which is significantly lower thanthe power predicted by a fiducial model using wmap5 cosmological parameters.this discrepancy may suggest that contemporary galaxy cluster modelsoverestimate the thermal pressure of intracluster gas. alternatively, thisresult can be interpreted as evidence for lower values of sigma8. when combinedwith an estimate of the kinetic sz contribution, the measured sz amplitudeshifts sigma8 from the primary cmb anisotropy derived constraint of 0.794 +/-0.028 down to 0.773 +/- 0.025. the uncertainty in the constraint on sigma8 fromthis analysis is dominated by uncertainties in the theoretical modelingrequired to predict the amplitude of the sz power spectrum for a given set ofcosmological parameters.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1102.2189	south pole telescope detections of the previously unconfirmed planck  early sz clusters in the southern hemisphere	we present south pole telescope (spt) observations of the five galaxy clustercandidates in the southern hemisphere which were reported as unconfirmed in theplanck early sunyaev-zel'dovich (esz) sample. one cluster candidate, plckeszg255.62-46.16, is located in the 2500-square-degree spt sz survey region andwas reported previously as spt-cl j0411-4819. for the remaining fourcandidates, which are located outside of the spt sz survey region, we performedshort, dedicated spt observations. each of these four candidates was stronglydetected in maps made from these observations, with signal-to-noise ratiosranging from 6.3 to 13.8. we have observed these four candidates on themagellan-baade telescope and used these data to estimate cluster redshifts fromthe red sequence. resulting redshifts range from 0.24 to 0.46. we reportmeasurements of y_0.75', the integrated comptonization within a 0.75' radius,for all five candidates. we also report x-ray luminosities calculated fromrosat all-sky survey catalog counts, as well as optical and improved szcoordinates for each candidate. the combination of spt sz measurements, opticalred-sequence measurements, and x-ray luminosity estimates demonstrates thatthese five planck esz cluster candidates do indeed correspond to real galaxyclusters with redshifts and observable properties consistent with the rest ofthe esz sample.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1105.0646	hermes: lyman break galaxies individually detected at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 in  goods-n with herschel/spire	as part of the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey we haveinvestigated the rest-frame far-infrared (fir) properties of a sample of morethan 4800 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the great observatories origins deepsurvey north field. most lbgs are not detected individually, but we do detect asub-sample of 12 objects at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and one object at z ~ 2.0.  the ones detected by herschel spire have redder observed nuv-u and u-r colorsthan the others, while the undetected ones have colors consistent with averagelbgs at z &gt; 2.5. the uv-to-fir spectral energy distributions of the objectsdetected in the rest-frame fir are investigated using the code cigale toestimate physical parameters. we find that lbgs detected by spire are highmass, luminous infrared galaxies.  it appears that lbgs are located in a triangle-shaped region in the a_fuv vs.log l_fuv diagram limited by a_fuv=0 at the bottom and by a diagonal followingthe temporal evolution of the most massive galaxies from the bottom-right tothe top-left of the diagram. this upper envelop can be used as upper limits forthe uv dust attenuation as a function of l_fuv}. the limits of this region arewell explained using a closed-box model, where the chemical evolution ofgalaxies produces metals, which in turn lead to higher dust attenuation whenthe galaxies age.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1111.0932	a measurement of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  two years of south pole telescope observations	we present the first three-frequency south pole telescope (spt) cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) power spectra. the band powers presented here coverangular scales 2000 &lt; ell &lt; 9400 in frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and220 ghz. at these frequencies and angular scales, a combination of the primarycmb anisotropy, thermal and kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effects, radiogalaxies, and cosmic infrared background (cib) contributes to the signal. wecombine planck and spt data at 220 ghz to constrain the amplitude and shape ofthe cib power spectrum and find strong evidence for non-linear clustering. weexplore the sz results using a variety of cosmological models for the cmb andcib anisotropies and find them to be robust with one exception: allowing forspatial correlations between the thermal sz effect and cib significantlydegrades the sz constraints. neglecting this potential correlation, we find thethermal sz power at 150 ghz and ell = 3000 to be 3.65 +/- 0.69 muk^2, and setan upper limit on the kinetic sz power to be less than 2.8 muk^2 at 95%confidence. when a correlation between the thermal sz and cib is allowed, weconstrain a linear combination of thermal and kinetic sz power: d_{3000}^{tsz}+ 0.5 d_{3000}^{ksz} = 4.60 +/- 0.63 muk^2, consistent with earliermeasurements. we use the measured thermal sz power and an analytic, thermal szmodel calibrated with simulations to determine sigma8 = 0.807 +/- 0.016.modeling uncertainties involving the astrophysics of the intracluster mediumrather than the statistical uncertainty in the measured band powers are thedominant source of uncertainty on sigma8 . we also place an upper limit on thekinetic sz power produced by patchy reionization; a companion paper uses theselimits to constrain the reionization history of the universe.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1212.2650	inferring the mass of sub-millimetre galaxies by exploiting their  gravitational magnification of background galaxies	dust emission at sub-millimetre wavelengths allows us to trace the earlyphases of star formation in the universe. in order to understand the physicalprocesses involved in this mode of star formation, it is essential to gainknowledge about the dark matter structures - most importantly their masses -that sub-millimetre galaxies live in. here we use the magnification effect ofgravitational lensing to determine the average mass and dust content ofsub-millimetre galaxies with 250mu flux densities of s_250&gt;15mjy selected usingdata from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey. the positions ofhundreds of sub-millimetre foreground lenses are cross-correlated with thepositions of background lyman-break galaxies at z~3-5 selected using opticaldata from the canada-france hawaii telescope legacy survey. we detect across-correlation signal at the 7-sigma level over a sky area of one squaredegree, with ~80% of this signal being due to magnification, whereas theremaining ~20% comes from dust extinction. adopting some simple assumptions forthe dark matter and dust profiles and the redshift distribution enables us toestimate the average mass of the halos hosting the sub-millimetre galaxies tobe log(m_200/m_sun)=13.17+0.05-0.08(stat.) and their average dust mass fraction(at radii of &gt;10kpc) to be m_dust/m_200~6x10^-5. this supports the picture thatsub-millimetre galaxies are dusty, forming stars at a high rate, reside inmassive group-sized halos, and are a crucial phase in the assembly andevolution of structure in the universe.

1303.3535	a measurement of the secondary-cmb and millimeter-wave-foreground  bispectrum using 800 square degrees of south pole telescope data	we present a measurement of the angular bispectrum of the millimeter-wave skyin observing bands centered at roughly 95, 150, and 220 ghz, on angular scalesof $1^\prime \lesssim \theta \lesssim 10^\prime$ (multipole number $1000\lesssim l \lesssim 10000$). at these frequencies and angular scales, the maincontributions to the bispectrum are expected to be the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and emission from extragalactic sources,predominantly dusty, star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) and active galactic nuclei.we measure the bispectrum in 800 $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of three-band south poletelescope data, and we use a multi-frequency fitting procedure to separate thebispectrum of the tsz effect from the extragalactic source contribution. wesimultaneously detect the bispectrum of the tsz effect at $&gt;$10$\sigma$, theunclustered component of the extragalactic source bispectrum at $&gt;$5$\sigma$ ineach frequency band, and the bispectrum due to the clustering of dsfgs---i.e.,the clustered cosmic infrared background (cib) bispectrum---at $&gt;$5$\sigma$.this is the first reported detection of the clustered cib bispectrum. we usethe measured tsz bispectrum amplitude, compared to model predictions, toconstrain the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be $\sigma_8 =0.787 \pm 0.031$ and to predict the amplitude of the tsz power spectrum at $l =3000$. this prediction improves our ability to separate the thermal andkinematic contributions to the total sz power spectrum. the addition ofbispectrum data improves our constraint on the tsz power spectrum amplitude bya factor of two compared to power spectrum measurements alone and demonstratesa preference for a nonzero kinematic sz (ksz) power spectrum, with a derivedconstraint on the ksz amplitude at $l=3000$ of a_ksz $ = 2.9 \pm 1.6 \\mu$k$^2$, or a_ksz $ = 2.6 \pm 1.8 \ \mu$k$^2$ if the default a_ksz &gt; 0 prioris removed.

1403.1667	the rest-frame submillimeter spectrum of high-redshift, dusty,  star-forming galaxies	we present the average rest-frame spectrum of high-redshift dusty,star-forming galaxies from 250-770ghz. this spectrum was constructed bystacking alma 3mm spectra of 22 such sources discovered by the south poletelescope and spanning z=2.0-5.7. in addition to multiple bright spectralfeatures of 12co, [ci], and h2o, we also detect several faint transitions of13co, hcn, hnc, hco+, and cn, and use the observed line strengths tocharacterize the typical properties of the interstellar medium of thesehigh-redshift starburst galaxies. we find that the 13co brightness in theseobjects is comparable to that of the only other z&gt;2 star-forming galaxy inwhich 13co has been observed. we show that the emission from the high-criticaldensity molecules hcn, hnc, hco+, and cn is consistent with a warm, densemedium with t_kin ~ 55k and n_h2 &gt;~ 10^5.5 cm^-3. high molecular hydrogendensities are required to reproduce the observed line ratios, and wedemonstrate that alternatives to purely collisional excitation are unlikely tobe significant for the bulk of these systems. we quantify the average emissionfrom several species with no individually detected transitions, and findemission from the hydride ch and the linear molecule cch for the first time athigh redshift, indicating that these molecules may be powerful probes ofinterstellar chemistry in high-redshift systems. these observations representthe first constraints on many molecular species with rest-frame transitionsfrom 0.4-1.2mm in star-forming systems at high redshift, and will be invaluablein making effective use of alma in full science operations.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1508.07369	sub-kiloparsec imaging of cool molecular gas in two strongly lensed  dusty, star-forming galaxies	we present spatially-resolved imaging obtained with the australia telescopecompact array (atca) of three co lines in two high-redshift gravitationallylensed dusty star-forming galaxies, discovered by the south pole telescope.strong lensing allows us to probe the structure and dynamics of the moleculargas in these two objects, at z=2.78 and z=5.66, with effective source-planeresolution of less than 1kpc. we model the lensed emission from multiple cotransitions and the dust continuum in a consistent manner, finding that thecold molecular gas as traced by low-j co always has a larger half-light radiusthan the 870um dust continuum emission. this size difference leads to up to 50%differences in the magnification factor for the cold gas compared to dust. inthe z=2.78 galaxy, these co observations confirm that the background source isundergoing a major merger, while the velocity field of the other source is morecomplex. we use the atca co observations and comparable resolution atacamalarge millimeter/submillimeter array dust continuum imaging of the same objectsto constrain the co-h_2 conversion factor with three different procedures,finding good agreement between the methods and values consistent with thosefound for rapidly star-forming systems. we discuss these galaxies in thecontext of the star formation - gas mass surface density relation, noting thatthe change in emitting area with observed co transition must be accounted forwhen comparing high-redshift galaxies to their lower redshift counterparts.

1509.02835	stellar masses and star formation rates of lensed dusty star-forming  galaxies from the spt survey	to understand cosmic mass assembly in the universe at early epochs, weprimarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate ofdistant galaxies. in this paper, we present stellar masses and star formationrates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. thesesources were first discovered by the south pole telescope (spt) at millimeterwavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derivedfrom alma observations. we have conducted follow-up observations, obtainingmulti-wavelength imaging data, using {\it hst}, {\it spitzer}, {\it herschel}and the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex). we use the high-resolution {\ithst}/wfc3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lensin {\it spitzer}/irac data. the detections and upper limits provide importantconstraints on the spectral energy distributions (seds) for these dsfgs,yielding stellar masses, ir luminosities, and star formation rates (sfrs). thesed fits of six spt sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a rangemore than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times10^{10}m_{\sun}$. the intrinsic ir luminosities range from 4$\times10^{12}l_{\sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}l_{\sun}$. they all have prodigiousintrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $m_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.compared to the star-forming main sequence (ms), these six dsfgs have specificsfrs that all lie above the ms, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10higher than the ms. our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoingstrong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

1510.01359	probing star formation in the dense environments of z~1 lensing halos  aligned with dusty star-forming galaxies detected with the south pole  telescope	we probe star formation in the environments of massive$\sim10^{13}\,m_{\odot}$ dark matter halos at redshifts of $z$$\sim$$1$. thisstar formation is linked to a sub-millimetre clustering signal which we detectin maps of the planck high frequency instrument that are stacked at thepositions of a sample of high-redshift ($z$$&gt;$$2$) strongly-lensed dustystar-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected from the south pole telescope (spt) 2500deg$^2$ survey. the clustering signal has sub-millimetre colours which areconsistent with the mean redshift of the foreground lensing halos($z$$\sim$$1$). we report a mean excess of star formation rate (sfr) comparedto the field, of $(2700\pm700)\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$ from all galaxiescontributing to this clustering signal within a radius of 3.5' from the sptdsfgs. the magnitude of the planck excess is in broad agreement withpredictions of a current model of the cosmic infrared background. the modelpredicts that 80$\%$ of the excess emission measured by planck originates fromgalaxies lying in the neighbouring halos of the lensing halo. using herschelmaps of the same fields, we find a clear excess, relative to the field, ofindividual sources which contribute to the planck excess. the mean excess sfrcompared to the field is measured to be ($370\pm40)$$\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$per resolved, clustered source. our findings suggest that the environmentsaround these massive $z$$\sim$$1$ lensing halos host intense star formation outto about $2\,$mpc. the flux enhancement due to clustering should also beconsidered when measuring flux densities of galaxies in planck data.

1512.03062	observation and confirmation of six strong lensing systems in the dark  energy survey science verification data	we report the observation and confirmation of the first group- andcluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems found in dark energy survey(des) data. through visual inspection of data from the science verification(sv) season, we identified 53 candidate systems. we then obtained spectroscopicfollow-up of 21 candidates using the gemini multi-object spectrograph (gmos) atthe gemini south telescope and the inamori-magellan areal camera andspectrograph (imacs) at the magellan/baade telescope. with this follow-up, weconfirmed six candidates as gravitational lenses: three of the systems arenewly discovered, and the remaining three were previously known. of the 21observed candidates, the remaining 15 were either not detected in spectroscopicobservations, were observed and did not exhibit continuum emission (or spectralfeatures), or were ruled out as lensing systems. the confirmed sample consistsof one group-scale and five galaxy cluster-scale lenses. the lensed sourcesrange in redshift z ~ 0.80-3.2, and in i-band surface brightness i_{sb} ~ 23-25mag/sq.-arcsec. (2" aperture). for each of the six systems, we estimate theeinstein radius and the enclosed mass, which have ranges ~ 5.0 - 8.6" and ~ 7.5x 10^{12} - 6.4 x 10^{13} solar masses, respectively.

1512.04120	dust properties of lyman break galaxies at $z\sim3$	we explore from a statistical point of view the far-infrared (far-ir) andsub-millimeter (sub-mm) properties of a large sample of lbgs (22,000) at z~3 inthe cosmos field. the large number of galaxies allows us to split it in severalbins as a function of uv luminosity, uv slope, and stellar mass to bettersample their variety. we perform stacking analysis in pacs (100 and 160 um),spire (250, 350 and 500 um) and aztec (1.1 mm) images. our stacking procedurecorrects the biases induced by galaxy clustering and incompleteness of ourinput catalogue in dense regions. we obtain the full ir spectral energydistributions (sed) of subsamples of lbgs and derive the mean ir luminosity asa function of uv luminosity, uv slope, and stellar mass. the average irx isroughly constant over the uv luminosity range, with a mean of 7.9 (1.8 mag).however, it is correlated with uv slope, and stellar mass. we investigate usinga statistically-controlled stacking analysis as a function of (stellar mass, uvslope) the dispersion of the irx-uvslope and irx-m* plane. our results enableus to study the average relation between star-formation rate (sfr) and stellarmass, and we show that our lbg sample lies on the main sequence of starformation at z~3.

1512.04535	cross-correlation of gravitational lensing from des science verification  data with spt and planck lensing	we measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb). the effects of gravitational lensing ondifferent sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same massfluctuations. we use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the darkenergy survey (des) science verification data and overlapping cmb lensing fromthe south pole telescope (spt) and planck. the des source galaxies have amedian redshift of $z_{\rm med} {\sim} 0.7$, while the cmb lensing kernel isbroad and peaks at $z{\sim}2$. the resulting cross-correlation is maximallysensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\sim}0.44$. assuming the planck 2015best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the des$\times$spt cross-power is found tobe $a = 0.88 \pm 0.30$ and that from des$\times$planck to be $a = 0.86 \pm0.39$, where $a=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. these areconsistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9\sigma$ and $2.2 \sigma$ respectively. we demonstrate that our results arerobust to a number of important systematic effects including the shearmeasurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and cmblensing systematics. significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes wouldincrease the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate avalue of $a = 1.08 \pm 0.36$ for des$\times$spt when we correct theobservations with a simple ia model. with three measurements of thiscross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliableevidence for any deviation from the expected lcdm level of cross-correlation,given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact ofsystematic errors, particularly ias. we provide forecasts for the expectedsignal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year des survey and spt-3g.

0810.1578	galaxy clusters discovered with a sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is conducting a sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effectsurvey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxyclusters to high redshift. in this preliminary study, we focus on a 40square-degree area targeted by the blanco cosmology survey (bcs), which iscentered roughly at right ascension 5h30m, declination -53 degrees. over twoseasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the spt at 95ghz, 150 ghz, and 225 ghz. we report the four most significant spt detectionsof sz clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and,therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an sz survey.the sz clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5-sigmasignificance in the high-sensitivity 150 ghz spt map. the sz spectrum of thesesources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locationsin the 95 ghz spt map and non-detections at those locations in the 225 ghz sptmap. multiband optical images from the bcs survey demonstrate significantconcentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the szdetections. photometric redshift estimates from the bcs data indicate that twoof the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z&gt;~ 0.8). one of the sz detections was previously identified as a galaxy clusterusing x-ray data from the rosat all-sky survey (rass). potential rasscounterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two ofthe new discoveries. these first four galaxy clusters are the most significantsz detections from a subset of the ongoing spt survey. as such, they serve as ademonstration that sz surveys, and the spt in particular, can be an effectivemeans for finding galaxy clusters.
