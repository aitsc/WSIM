0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0906.0312	a compton-thick wind in the high luminosity quasar, pds 456	pds 456 is a nearby (z=0.184), luminous (l_bol ~10^47 erg/s) type i quasar. adeep 190 ks suzaku observation in february 2007 revealed the complex, broadband x-ray spectrum of pds 456. the suzaku spectrum exhibits highlystatistically significant absorption features near 9 kev in the quasarrest--frame. we show that the most plausible origin of the absorption is fromblue-shifted resonance (1s-2p) transitions of hydrogen-like iron (at 6.97 kevin the rest frame). this indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be presentmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). a possible hard x-ray excessis detected above 15 kev with hxd (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise fromhigh column density gas (nh&gt;10^24cm^-2) partially covering the x-ray emission,or through strong compton reflection. here we propose that the iron k-shellabsorption in pds 456 is associated with a thick, possibly clumpy outflow,covering about 20% of $4\pi$ steradian solid angle. the outflow is likelylaunched from the inner accretion disk, within 15-100 gravitational radii ofthe black hole. the kinetic power of the outflow may be similar to thebolometric luminosity of pds 456. such a powerful wind could have a significanteffect on the co-evolution of the host galaxy and its supermassive black hole,through feedback.

0907.2462	a new analysis of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 051103, a  possible extragalactic sgr giant flare	grb 051103 is considered to be a candidate soft gamma repeater (sgr)extragalactic giant magnetar flare by virtue of its proximity on the sky tom81/m82, as well as its time history, localization, and energy spectrum. wehave derived a refined interplanetary network localization for this burst whichreduces the size of the error box by over a factor of two. we examine its timehistory for evidence of a periodic component, which would be one signature ofan sgr giant flare, and conclude that this component is neither detected nordetectable under reasonable assumptions. we analyze the time-resolved energyspectra of this event with improved time- and energy resolution, and concludethat although the spectrum is very hard, its temporal evolution at late timescannot be determined, which further complicates the giant flare association. wealso present new optical observations reaching limiting magnitudes of r &gt; 24.5,about 4 magnitudes deeper than previously reported. in tandem withserendipitous observations of m81 taken immediately before and one month afterthe burst, these place strong constraints on any rapidly variable sources inthe region of the refined error ellipse proximate to m81. we do not find anyconvincing afterglow candidates from either background galaxies or sources inm81, although within the refined error region we do locate two uv bright starforming regions which may host sgrs. a supernova remnant (snr) within the errorellipse could provide further support for an sgr giant flare association, butwe were unable to identify any snr within the error ellipse. these data stilldo not allow strong constraints on the nature of the grb 051103 progenitor, andsuggest that candidate extragalactic sgr giant flares will be difficult,although not impossible, to confirm.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0908.3798	can x-ray emission powered by a spinning-down magnetar explain some grb  light curve features?	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are thought to be produced by thecore-collapse of a rapidly-rotating massive star. this event generates a highlyrelativistic jet and prompt gamma-ray and x-ray emission arises from internalshocks in the jet or magnetised outflows. if the stellar core does notimmediately collapse to a black hole, it may form an unstable, highlymagnetised millisecond pulsar, or magnetar. as it spins down, the magnetarwould inject energy into the jet causing a distinctive bump in the grb lightcurve where the emission becomes fairly constant followed by a steep decay whenthe magnetar collapses. we assume that the collapse of a massive star to amagnetar can launch the initial jet. by automatically fitting the x-raylightcurves of all grbs observed by the swift satellite we identified a subsetof bursts which have a feature in their light curves which we call an internalplateau -- unusually constant emission followed by a steep decay -- which maybe powered by a magnetar. we use the duration and luminosity of this internalplateau to place limits on the magnetar spin period and magnetic field strengthand find that they are consistent with the most extreme predicted values formagnetars.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

0912.1759	the spectral-temporal properties of the prompt pulses and rapid decay  phase of grbs	the prompt emission from grbs is the brightest electromagnetic emission knownyet it's origin is not understood. the flux density of individual prompt pulsesof a grb can be represented by an analytical expression derived assuming theemission is from a thin, ultra-relativistically expanding, uniform, sphericalshell over a finite range of radii. we present the results of fitting thisanalytical expression to the lightcurves from the four standard swift batenergy bands and two standard swift xrt energy bands of 12 bursts. theexpression includes the high latitude emission (hle) component and the fitsprovide a rigourous demonstration that the hle can explain the rapid decayphase (rdp) of the prompt emission. the model also accommodates some aspects ofenergy-dependent lag and energy-dependent pulse width, but there are featuresin the data which are not well represented. some pulses have a hard, narrowpeak which is not well fitted or a rise and decay which is faster than expectedusing the standard indices derived assuming synchrotron emission from internalshocks, although it might be possible to accommodate these features using adifferent emission mechanism within the same overall framework. the luminosityof pulses is correlated with the peak energy of the pulse spectrum, lf ~(epeak(1+z))^1.8, and anti-correlated with the time since ejection of thepulse, lf ~ (tf/(1 + z))^-2.0.

1002.0581	grb 081008: from burst to afterglow and the transition phase in between	we present a multi-wavelength study of grb 081008, at redshift 1.967, byswift, rotse-iii and grond. compared to other swift grbs, grb 081008 has atypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during theprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. theearly x-ray emission seen by the swift/xrt was dominated by the softening tailof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after theswift/bat detections. optical observations that started shortly after the firstactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. we interpretthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the earlyburst activities. a second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-raypulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve andthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. wesuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injectioninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch ofburst activities. these early observations thus provide a potential probe forthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. the later lightcurve of grb081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and x-ray. thetemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral breakwithin optical. however, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.we discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1007.2185	the unusual x-ray emission of the short swift grb 090515: evidence for  the formation of a magnetar?	the majority of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to originate fromthe merger of compact binary systems collapsing directly to form a black hole.however, it has been proposed that both sgrbs and long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)may, on rare occasions, form an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) prior tofinal collapse. grb 090515, detected by the swift satellite was extremelyshort, with a t_90 of 0.036 +/- 0.016 s, and had a very low fluence of 2 x10^-8 erg cm^-2 and faint optical afterglow. despite this, the 0.3 - 10 kevflux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a sgrb by the swift x-raytelescope (xrt). the x-ray light curve showed an unusual plateau and steepdecay, becoming undetectable after ~500 s. this behaviour is similar to thatobserved in some long bursts proposed to have magnetars contributing to theiremission. in this paper, we present the swift observations of grb 090515 andcompare it to other gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the swift sample. additionally,we present optical observations from gemini, which detected an afterglow ofmagnitude 26.4 +/- 0.1 at t+ 1.7 hours after the burst. we discuss potentialcauses of the unusual 0.3 - 10 kev emission and suggest it might be energyinjection from an unstable millisecond pulsar. using the duration and flux ofthe plateau of grb 090515, we place constraints on the millisecond pulsar spinperiod and magnetic field.

0704.2525	a case of mistaken identity? grb 060912a and the nature of the long --  short grb divide	we investigate the origin of the grb 060912a, which has observationalproperties that make its classification as either a long or short burstambiguous. short duration grbs (sgrbs) are thought to have typically lowerenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populationsof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the longduration bursts. however, it has become clear that duration alone isinsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,leading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. grb060912a had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, lowredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been thehost, which would favour it being a short-burst. however, our deep opticalimaging and spectroscopy of the location of grb 060912a using the vlt showsthat grb 060912a more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy atz=0.937, and is most likely a long burst. this demonstrates the risk inidentifying bright, nearby galaxies as the hosts of given grbs without furthersupporting evidence. further, it implies that, in the absence of secureidentifications, "host" type, or more broadly discriminators which rely ongalaxy redshifts, may not be good indicators of the true nature of any givengrb.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

0704.3069	grb 050826: a subluminous event at z = 0.296 finds its place in the  luminosity distribution of gamma-ray burst afterglows	we present the optical identification and spectroscopy of the host galaxy ofgrb 050826 at a redshift z = 0.296 +/- 0.001. image subtraction amongobservations obtained on three consecutive nights, reveals a fading object 5hours after the burst, confirming its identification as the optical afterglowof this event. deep imaging shows that the optical afterglow is offset by 0.4arcseconds (~1.76 kpc) from the center of its irregular host galaxy, which istypical for long-duration gamma-ray bursts. combining these results with x-raymeasurements acquired by the swift xrt instrument, we find that grb 050826falls entirely within the subluminous, subenergetic group of long gamma-raybursts at low redshift (z &lt; 0.3). the results are discussed in the context ofmodels that possibly account for this trend, including the nature of thecentral engine, the evolution of progenitor properties as a function ofredshift, and incompleteness in current gamma-ray burst samples.

0710.3727	a universal grb photon energy-peak luminosity relation	the energetics and emission mechanism of grbs are not well understood. herewe demonstrate that the instantaneous peak flux or equivalent isotropic peakluminosity, l_iso ergs s^-1, rather than the integrated fluence or equivalentisotropic energy, e_iso ergs, underpins the known high-energy correlations.using new spectral/temporal parameters calculated for 101 bursts with redshiftsfrom batse, bepposax, hete-ii and swift we describe a parameter space whichcharacterises the apparently diverse properties of the prompt emission. we showthat a source frame characteristic-photon-energy/peak luminosity ratio, k_z,can be constructed which is constant within a factor of 2 for all burstswhatever their duration, spectrum, luminosity and the instrumentation used todetect them. the new parameterization embodies the amati relation but indicatesthat some correlation between e_peak and e_iso follows as a direct mathematicalinference from the band function and that a simple transformation of e_iso tol_iso yields a universal high energy correlation for grbs. the existence of k_zindicates that the mechanism responsible for the prompt emission from all grbsis probably predominantly thermal.

1201.1292	the origin of the early time optical emission of swift grb 080310	we present broadband multi-wavelength observations of grb 080310 at redshiftz = 2.43. this burst was bright and long-lived, and unusual in having extensiveoptical and near ir follow-up during the prompt phase. using these data weattempt to simultaneously model the gamma-ray, x-ray, optical and ir emissionusing a series of prompt pulses and an afterglow component. initial attempts toextrapolate the high energy model directly to lower energies for each pulsereveal that a spectral break is required between the optical regime and 0.3 kevto avoid over predicting the optical flux. we demonstrate that afterglowemission alone is insufficient to describe all morphology seen in the opticaland ir data. allowing the prompt component to dominate the early-time opticaland ir and permitting each pulse to have an independent low energy spectralindices we produce an alternative scenario which better describes the opticallight curve. this, however, does not describe the spectral shape of grb 080310at early times. the fit statistics for the prompt and afterglow dominatedmodels are nearly identical making it difficult to favour either. however oneenduring result is that both models require a low energy spectral indexconsistent with self absorption for at least some of the pulses identified inthe high energy emission model.

1201.6074	star formation in the early universe: beyond the tip of the iceberg	we present late-time hubble space telescope imaging of the fields of sixswift grbs lying at 5.0&lt;z&lt;9.5. our data includes very deep observations of thefield of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, grb 090423, atz=8.2. using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can placestringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. in one case, thatof grb 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the grbposition which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude j(ab)=28.5. none ofthe others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie belowl\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates sfr&lt;4mo/yr inall cases. indeed, stacking the five fields with wfc3-ir data we conclude amean sfr&lt;0.17mo/yr per galaxy. these results support the proposition that thebulk of star formation, and hence integrated uv luminosity, at high redshiftsarises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.making the reasonable assumption that grb rate is proportional to uv luminosityat early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based ongalaxy luminosity functions derived from the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) andother deep fields. we infer that a luminosity function which is evolvingrapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristicluminosity (l\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with ourobservations, whereas a non-evolving lf shape is ruled out at &gt;90% confidence.although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required forgrb production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the natureof star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supplyof ionizing photons in the early universe.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

0711.3753	swift captures the spectrally evolving prompt emission of grb 070616	the origins of gamma-ray burst prompt emission are currently not wellunderstood and in this context long, well-observed events are particularlyimportant to study. we present the case of grb 070616, analysing theexceptionally long-duration multipeaked prompt emission, and later afterglow,captured by all the instruments on-board swift and by suzaku wam. the highenergy light curve remained generally flat for several hundred seconds beforegoing into a steep decline. spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearlytaking place throughout the prompt emission, beginning at 285 s after thetrigger and extending to 1200 s. we track the movement of the spectral peakenergy, whilst observing a softening of the low energy spectral slope. thesteep decline in flux may be caused by a combination of this strong spectralevolution and the curvature effect. we investigate origins for the spectralevolution, ruling out a superposition of two power laws and considering insteadan additional component dominant during the late prompt emission. we alsodiscuss origins for the early optical emission and the physics of theafterglow. the case of grb 070616 clearly demonstrates that both broadbandcoverage and good time resolution are crucial to pin down the origins of thecomplex prompt emission in grbs.

1301.0629	signatures of magnetar central engines in short grb lightcurves	a significant fraction of the long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) in the swiftsample have a plateau phase showing evidence of ongoing energy injection. wesuggest that many short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) detected by the swiftsatellite also show evidence of energy injection. explaining this observationwithin the typical sgrb progenitor model is challenging as late time accretion,often used to explain plateaus in lgrbs, is likely to be absent from the sgrbpopulation. alternatively, it is predicted that the remnant of ns-ns mergersmay not collapse immediately to a bh (or even collapse at all), forming insteadan unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) which powers a plateau phase in thex-ray lightcurve. by fitting the magnetar model to all of the swift sgrbsobserved until may 2012, we find that about half can be clearly fitted with amagnetar plateau phase while the rest are consistent with forming a magnetarbut the data are insufficient to prove a plateau phase. more data, both atearly times and a larger sample, are required to confirm this. this model canbe tested by detecting the gravitational wave emission from events using thenext generation gravitational wave observatories.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1303.0843	calibration of x-ray absorption in our galaxy	prediction of the soft x-ray absorption along lines of sight through ourgalaxy is crucial for understanding the spectra of extragalactic sources, butrequires a good estimate of the foreground column density of photoelectricabsorbing species. assuming uniform elemental abundances this reduces to havinga good estimate of the total hydrogen column density, n(htot)=n(hi)+2n(h2). theatomic component, n(hi), is reliably provided using the mapped 21 cm radioemission but estimating the molecular hydrogen column density, n(h2), expectedfor any particular direction, is difficult. the x-ray afterglows of grbs areideal sources to probe x-ray absorption in our galaxy because they areextragalactic, numerous, bright, have simple spectra and occur randomly acrossthe entire sky. we describe an empirical method, utilizing 493 afterglowsdetected by the swift xrt, to determine n(htot) through the milky way whichprovides an improved estimate of the x-ray absorption in our galaxy and therebyleads to more reliable measurements of the intrinsic x-ray absorption and,potentially, other spectral parameters, for extragalactic x-ray sources. wederive a simple function, dependent on the product of the atomic hydrogencolumn density, n(hi), and dust extinction, e(b-v), which describes thevariation of the molecular hydrogen column density, n(h2), of our galaxy, overthe sky. using the resulting n(htot) we show that the dust-to-hydrogen ratio iscorrelated with the carbon monoxide emission and use this ratio to estimate thefraction of material which forms interstellar dust grains. our resulting reciperepresents a significant revision in galactic absorption compared to previousstandard methods, particularly at low galactic latitudes.

1303.0844	x-ray absorption evolution in gamma-ray bursts: intergalactic medium or  evolutionary signature of their host galaxies?	the intrinsic x-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is often found to beabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. the extracomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the hostgalaxy of the grb itself. there is an apparent correlation between theequivalent column density of hydrogen, n(h,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at thegrb redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z&gt;6 grbs showing the greatestintrinsic column densities. we investigate the n(h,intrinsic) - z relationusing a large sample of swift grbs, as well as active galactic nuclei (agn) andquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energydistributions of the two highest redshift grbs. various possible sample biasesand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and weconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. this may indicateeither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contributionfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm) orintervening absorbing clouds. employing a more realistic model for igmabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of theobserved opacity at z&gt;~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 k and10^6.5 k, and moderately metal enriched, z~0.2 z_sun. this material couldtherefore constitute the warm hot intergalactic medium. however, a comparablelevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of interveningcold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to saywhich, if either, dominates. at lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in thehost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed x-rayabsorption.

1311.1505	magnetar powered grbs: explaining the extended emission and x-ray  plateau of short grb light curves	extended emission (ee) is a high-energy, early time rebrightening sometimesseen in the light curves of short gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we present the firstcontiguous fits to the ee tail and the later x-ray plateau, unified within asingle model. our central engine is a magnetar surrounded by a fall-backaccretion disc, formed by either the merger of two compact objects or theaccretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf. during the ee phase, material isaccelerated to super-keplarian velocities and ejected from the system by therapidly rotating ($p \approx 1 - 10$ ms) and very strong ($10^{15}$ g) magneticfield in a process known as magnetic propellering. the x-ray plateau ismodelled as magnetic dipole spin-down emission. we first explore the range ofgrb phenomena that the propeller could potentially reproduce, using a series oftemplate light curves to devise a classification scheme based on phenomology.we then obtain fits to the light curves of 9 grbs with ee, simultaneouslyfitting both the propeller and the magnetic dipole spin-down and findingtypical disc masses of a few $10^{-3}$ $m_{\odot}$ to a few $10^{-2}$$m_{\odot}$. this is done for ballistic, viscous disc and exponential accretionrates. we find that the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy to ememission for propellered material needs to be $\gtrsim 10\%$ and that the bestfitting results come from an exponential accretion profile.

1311.4340	new constraints on grb jet geometry and relativistic shock physics	we use high--quality, multi-band observations of swift grb120404a, fromgamma-ray to radio frequencies, together with the new hydrodynamics code of vaneerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1403.4079	grb 130925a: an ultra-long gamma ray burst with a dust-echo afterglow,  and implications for the origin of the ultra-long grbs	grb 130925a was an unusual grb, consisting of 3 distinct episodes ofhigh-energy emission spanning $\sim$20 ks, making it a member of the proposedcategory of `ultra-long' bursts. it was also unusual in that its late-timex-ray emission observed by swift was very soft, and showed a stronghard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. this evolution, rarely seen in grbafterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the promptemission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow(i.e. external shock) emission. we consider and reject the possibility that grb130925a was some form of tidal disruption event, and instead show that if thecircumburst density around grb 130925a is low, the long duration of the burstand faint external shock emission are naturally explained. indeed, we suggestthat the ultra-long grbs as a class can be explained as those with lowcircumburst densities, such that the deceleration time (at which point thematerial ejected from the nascent black hole is decelerated by the circumburstmedium) is $\sim$20 ks, as opposed to a few hundred seconds for the normal longgrbs. the increased deceleration radius means that more of the ejected shellscan interact before reaching the external shock, naturally explaining both theincreased duration of grb 130925a, the duration of its prompt pulses, and thefainter-than-normal afterglow.

0802.3803	on the nature of late x-ray flares in swift gamma-ray bursts	previously detected in only a few gamma-ray bursts (grbs), x-ray flares arenow observed in ~50% of swift grbs, though their origins remain unclear. mostflares are seen early on in the afterglow decay, while some bursts exhibitflares at late times of 10^4 to 10^5 seconds, which may have implications forflare models.we investigate whether a sample of late time (&gt; 10^4s) flares aredifferent from previous samples of early time flares, or whether they aremerely examples on the tail of the early flare distribution. we examine thex-ray light curves of swift bursts for late flares and compare the flare andunderlying temporal power-law properties with those of early flares, and thevalues of these properties predicted by the blast wave model. the burst sampleshows late flare properties consistent with those of early flares, where themajority of the flares can be explained by either internal or external shock,though in a few cases one origin is favoured over the other. the underlyingpower laws are mainly consistent with the normal decay phases of the afterglow.if confirmed by the ever growing sample of late time flares, this would implythat, in some cases, prolonged activity out to a day or a restarting of thecentral engine is required.

1407.1053	constraining properties of grb magnetar central engines using the  observed plateau luminosity and duration correlation	an intrinsic correlation has been identified between the luminosity andduration of plateaus in the x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs;dainotti et al. 2008), suggesting a central engine origin. the magnetar centralengine model predicts an observable plateau phase, with plateau durations andluminosities being determined by the magnetic fields and spin periods of thenewly formed magnetar. this paper analytically shows that the magnetar centralengine model can explain, within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainties, the correlationbetween plateau luminosity and duration. the observed scatter in thecorrelation most likely originates in the spread of initial spin periods of thenewly formed magnetar and provides an estimate of the maximum spin period of~35 ms (assuming a constant mass, efficiency and beaming across the grbsample). additionally, by combining the observed data and simulations, we showthat the magnetar emission is most likely narrowly beamed and has $\lesssim$20%efficiency in conversion of rotational energy from the magnetar into theobserved plateau luminosity. the beaming angles and efficiencies obtained bythis method are fully consistent with both predicted and observed values. wefind that short grbs and short grbs with extended emission lie on the samecorrelation but are statistically inconsistent with being drawn from the samedistribution as long grbs, this is consistent with them having a wider beamingangle than long grbs.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1506.01624	optimisation of the swift x-ray follow-up of advanced ligo and virgo  gravitational wave triggers in 2015--16	one of the most exciting near-term prospects in physics is the potentialdiscovery of gravitational waves by the advanced ligo and virgo detectors. tomaximise both the confidence of the detection and the science return, it isessential to identify an electromagnetic counterpart. this is not trivial, asthe events are expected to be poorly localised, particularly in the near-term,with error regions covering hundreds or even thousands of square degrees. inthis paper we discuss the prospects for finding an x-ray counterpart to agravitational wave trigger with the swift x-ray telescope, using the assumptionthat the trigger is caused by a binary neutron star merger which also producesa short gamma-ray burst. we show that it is beneficial to target galaxieswithin the gw error region, highlighting the need for substantially completegalaxy catalogues out to distances of 300 mpc. we also show that nearby,on-axis short grbs are either extremely rare, or are systematically lessluminous than those detected to date. we consider the prospects for detectingafterglow emission from an an off-axis grb which triggered the gw facilities,finding that the detectability, and the best time to look, are stronglydependent on the characteristics of the burst such as circumburst density andour viewing angle.

1509.08945	late time multi wavelength observations of swift j1644+5734: a luminous  optical/ir bump and quiescent x-ray emission	we present late-time multi-wavelength observations of swift j1644+57,suggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (tdf). our observationsextend to &gt;4 years from discovery, and show that 1.4 years after outburst therelativistic jet switched-off on a timescale less than tens of days,corresponding to a power-law decay faster than $t^{-70}$. beyond this pointweak x-rays continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity of$l_x \sim 5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and are marginally inconsistent witha continuing decay of $t^{-5/3}$, similar to that seen prior to the switch-off.host photometry enables us to infer a black hole mass of $m_{bh}=3 \times 10^6$m$_{\odot}$, consistent with the late time x-ray luminosity arising fromsub-eddington accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an unusuallyoptically faint agn or a slowly varying phase of the transient. optical/irobservations show a clear bump in the light curve at timescales of 30-50 days,with a peak magnitude (corrected for host galaxy extinction) of $m_r \sim-22-23$. the luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in other,non-relativistic tdfs and does not match any re-brightening seen at x-ray orradio wavelengths. its luminosity, light curve shape and spectrum are broadlysimilar to those seen in superluminous sne, although subject to largeuncertainties in the correction of the significant host extinction. we discussthese observations in the context of both tdf and massive star origins forswift j1644+5734 and other candidate relativistic tidal flares.

astro-ph;0010490	xmm-newton observation of an unusual iron line in the quasar markarian  205	xmm-newton observations of the low luminosity, radio-quiet quasar markarian205 have revealed a unique iron k emission line profile. in marked contrast tothe broad and redshifted iron k line commonly seen in asca observations ofseyfert 1 galaxies, we find that a substantial amount of the line flux in mrk205 occurs above the neutral line energy of 6.4 kev. furthermore, we find thatthe iron line emission has two distinct components, a narrow, unresolvedneutral line at 6.4 kev and a broadened line centred at 6.7 kev. we suggestthat the most likely origin of the 6.7 kev line is from x-ray reflection offthe surface of a highly ionised accretion disk, whilst the 6.4 kev componentmay arise from neutral matter distant from the black hole, quite possibly inthe putative molecular torus. overall this observation underlines the potentialof xmm-newton for using the iron k line as a diagnostic of matter in theinnermost regions of agn.

astro-ph;0010646	detection of an x-ray periodicity in the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy  mrk 766 with xmm-newton	we have analyzed the timing properties of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxymrk 766 observed with xmm-newton during the pv phase. the source intensitychanges by a factor of 1.3 over the 29,000 second observation. if the softexcess is modeled by a black body component, as indicated by the epic pn data,the luminosity of the black body component scales with its temperatureaccording to l ~ t^4. this requires a lower limit 'black body size` of about1.3*10^25 cm^2. in addition, we report the detection of a strong periodicsignal with 2.4*10^-4 hz. simulations of light curves with the observed timesequence and phase randomized for a red noise spectrum clearly indicate thatthe periodicity peak is intrinsic to the distant agn. furthermore, itsexistence is confirmed by the epic mos and rgs data. the spectral fittingresults show that the black body temperature and the absorption by neutralhydrogen remain constant during the periodic oscillations. this observationalfact tends to rule out models in which the intensity changes are due to hotspots orbiting the central black hole. precession according to thebardeen-petterson effect or instabilities in the inner accretion disk mayprovide explanations for the periodic signal.

astro-ph;0109346	an xmm-newton observation of the extreme narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy,  mrk 359	we present xmm-newton observations of mrk 359, the first narrow line seyfert1 galaxy discovered. even among nls1s, mrk 359 is an extreme case withextraordinarily narrow optical emission lines. the xmm-newton data show thatmrk 359 has a significant soft x-ray excess which displays only weak absorptionand emission features. the (2-10) kev continuum, including reflection, isflatter than the typical nls1, with gamma approximately 1.84. a strong emissionline of equivalent width approximately 200 ev is also observed, centred near6.4 kev. we fit this emission with two line components of approximately equalstrength: a broad iron-line from an accretion disc and a narrow, unresolvedcore. the unresolved line core has an equivalent width of approximately 120 evand is consistent with fluorescence from neutral iron in distant reprocessinggas, possibly in the form of a `molecular torus'. comparison of the narrow-linestrengths in mrk 359 and other low-moderate luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies withthose in qsos suggests that the solid angle subtended by the distantreprocessing gas decreases with increasing agn luminosity.

astro-ph;0204075	the signature of supernova ejecta measured in the x-ray afterglow of  gamma-ray burst 011211	since their identification with cosmological distances, gamma-ray bursts(grbs) have been recognised as the most energetic phenomena in the universe,with an isotropic burst energy as high as 10^54 ergs. however, the progenitorsresponsible for the bursts remain elusive, favoured models ranging from aneutron star binary merger, to the collapse of a massive star. crucial to ourunderstanding of the origins of grbs is the study of the afterglow emission,where spectroscopy can reveal details of the environment of the burst. here wereport on an xmm-newton observation of the x-ray afterglow of grb 011211. thex-ray spectrum reveals evidence for emission lines of magnesium, silicon,sulphur, argon, calcium, and possibly nickel, arising in enriched material withan outflow velocity of order 0.1c. this is the first direct measurement ofoutflowing matter in a gamma ray burst. the observations strongly favour modelswhere a supernova explosion from a massive stellar progenitor precedes theburst event and is responsible for the outflowing matter.

astro-ph;0210140	serendipitous agn in the xmm-newton fields of markarian 205 and qso  0130-403	the x-ray spectra of serendipitously observed agn in the xmm-newton fields ofmrk 205 and qso 0130-403 are analysed. the sample consists of 23 objects, noneof which is detected at radio frequencies, with a median x-ray luminosity of ~4 x 10^44 erg s^-1 and redshifts ranging from ~0.1 to just over 3. the meanphoton index was found to be 1.89 +/- 0.04. in contrast to past asca and rosatobservations of high-redshift radio-loud quasars, we find little evidence forexcess intrinsic absorption in these radio-quiet objects, with only threesources requiring a column density in excess of the galactic value. comparingthe measured spectral indices over the redshift range, we also find there is nox-ray spectral evolution of qsos with time, up to redshift 3. within the samplethere is no evidence for evolution of the optical to x-ray spectral index,alpha-ox, with redshift, the mean value being -1.66 +/- 0.04. however, uponcomparing the values from the bright quasar survey at low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)and high redshift qsos detected by chandra (z &gt; 4), a slight steepening ofalpha-ox is noted for the more distant objects. in most of the sources there isno significant requirement for a soft excess, although a weak thermal component(&lt; 10% of lx) cannot be excluded. there is an indication of spectral flattening(by delta gamma=0.2) at higher energies (&gt; 3 kev, qso rest frame) for thesample as a whole. this is consistent with the presence of a compton reflectioncomponent in these radio-quiet agn, with the scattering medium (such as anaccretion disc or molecular torus) occupying a solid angle of 2 pi steradiansto the x-ray source.

astro-ph;0302151	fe k emission and absorption features in xmm-newton spectra of mkn 766 -  evidence for reprocessing in flare ejecta	we report on the analysis of a long xmm-newton epic observation in 2001 mayof the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy mkn 766. the 3-11 kev spectrum exhibits amoderately steep power law continuum, with a broad emission line at ~6.7 kev,probably blended with a narrow line at ~6.4 kev, and a broad absorption troughabove ~8.7 kev. we identify both broad spectral features with reprocessing inhe-like fe. an earlier xmm-newton observation of mkn 766 in 2000 may, when thesource was a factor ~2 fainter, shows a similar broad emission line, but with aslightly flatter power law and absorption at a lower energy. in neitherobservation do we find a requirement for the previously reported broad 'redwing' to the line and hence of reflection from the innermost accretion disc.more detailed examination of the longer xmm-newton observation reveals evidencefor rapid spectral variability in the fe k band, apparently linked with theoccurrence of x-ray 'flares'. a reduction in the emission line strength andincreased high energy absorption during the x-ray flaring suggests that thesetransient effects are due to highly ionised ejecta associated with the flares.simple scaling from the flare avalanche model proposed for the luminous qso pds456 (reeves etal. 2002) confirms the feasibility of coherent flaring being thecause of the strong peaks seen in the x-ray light curve of \mkn.

astro-ph;0509144	optical emission from grb 050709: a short/hard grb in a star forming  galaxy	we present optical observations of the short/hard gamma-ray burst grb 050709,the first such event with an identified optical counterpart. the object iscoincident with a weak x-ray source and is located inside a galaxy at redshiftz = 0.1606 +- 0.0002. multiband photometry allowed us to study the broad-bandspectral energy distribution. late-time monitoring places strong limits on anysupernova simultaneous with the grb. the host galaxy is not of early type.spectra show that the dominant stellar population is relatively young (~ 1gyr), and that ongoing star formation is present at a level of 2-3 (l/l*)msun/yr. this is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than that observed inthe elliptical hosts of the short grb 050509b and grb 050724. this shows thatat least some short grbs originate in a young population. short/hard grb modelsbased on the merger of a binary degenerate system are compatible with the hostgalaxy characteristics, although there is still the possibility of a connectionbetween young stars and at least a fraction of such events.

astro-ph;0509164	swift xrt observations of the breaking x-ray afterglow of grb 050318	we report the results of swift x-ray telescope (xrt) observations of grb050318. this event triggered the burst alert telescope (bat) aboard swift andwas followed-up with xrt and uvot for 11 consecutive orbits starting from 54minutes after the trigger. a previously unknown fading x-ray source wasdetected and accurately monitored. the source was found to decrease inintensity with time and a clear temporal break occurring at ~18000 s after thetrigger was observed. the x-ray light curve was found to be consistent with abroken power-law with decay indices -1.17 +/- 0.08 and -2.10 (+0.22) (-0.24)before and after the break. the spectrum of the x-ray afterglow was welldescribed by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with energy index of -1.09+/-0.09. no evidence of spectral evolution was found. we compare these resultswith those obtained with uvot and separately reported and refine the dataanalysis of bat. we discuss our results in the framework of a collimatedfireball model and a synchrotron radiation emission mechanism. assuming the grbredshift derived from the farthest optical absorption complex (z = 1.44), theevent is fully consistent with the e_p-e_iso correlation.

astro-ph;0509477	the soft x-ray blast in the apparently sub-luminous grb 031203	grb031203 was a very low apparent luminosity gamma-ray burst (grb). it wasalso the first grb with a dust-scattered x-ray halo. the observation of thehalo allowed us to infer the presence of a large soft x-ray fluence in thetotal burst output. it has, however, also been claimed that grb031203 wasintrinsically sub-energetic, representative of a class of spectrally hard,low-energy bursts quite different from other grbs. reanalysis of the availabledata confirms our original finding that grb031203 had a very large soft x-raycomponent, the time of which can be constrained to within a few minutes afterthe burst, implying that while grb031203 did indeed have a very low apparentluminosity, it was also very soft. notions propagated in the literatureregarding the uncertainties in the determination of the soft x-ray fluence fromthe halo data and on the available constraints from the hard x-ray data areaddressed: the properties of the scattering dust along the line of sight (grainsizes, precise location and the geometry) are determined directly from the highquality x-ray data so that there is little uncertainty about the scatterer;constraints on the x-ray lightcurve from the integral spacecraft at the time ofthe soft x-ray blast are not complete because of a slew in the spacecraftpointing shortly after the burst. claims that grb031203 was intrinsicallyunder-energetic and that it represents a deviation from the luminosity-peakenergy relation do not appear to be substantiated by the data, regardless ofwhether the soft x-ray component is declared part of the prompt emission or theafterglow. we conclude that the difference between the soft and hard x-rayspectra from xmm-newton and integral indicate that a second soft pulse probablyoccurred in this burst as has been observed in other grbs, notably grb050502b.

astro-ph;0510677	swift observations of the x-ray bright grb 050315	this paper discusses swift observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 050315(z=1.949) from 80 s to 10 days after the onset of the burst. the x-ray lightcurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.however, both the prompt hard x-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the bat)and the first ~ 300 s of x-ray emission (observed by the xrt) can be explainedby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. extrapolating the batlight curve into the xrt band suggests the rapidly decaying, early x-rayemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strongsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray emission may be relatedto the simple temporal and spectral character of this x-ray rich grb. theprompt (bat) spectrum was a steep down to 15 kev, and appeared to continuethrough the xrt bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with theamati relation. following the initial steep decline the x-ray afterglow did notfade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index ofalpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.the apparent `plateau' in the x-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep x-ray lightcurves revealed by swift. if the second afterglow break is identified with ajet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying e_gamma&gt; 10^50 erg.

astro-ph;0511576	discovery of an afterglow extension of the prompt phase of two gamma ray  bursts observed by swift	bat and xrt observations of two recent well-covered grbs observed by swift,grb 050315 and grb 050319, show clearly a prompt component joining the onset ofthe afterglow emission. by fitting a power law form to the gamma-ray spectrum,we extrapolate the time dependent fluxes measured by the bat, in the energyband 15-350 kev, into the spectral regime observed by the xrt 0.2-10 kev, andexamine the functional form of the rate of decay of the two light curves. wefind that the bat and xrt light curves merge to form a unified curve. there isa period of steep decay up to ~300 s, followed by a flatter decay. the durationof the steep decay, ~100 s in the source frame after correcting forcosmological time dilation, agrees roughly with a theoretical estimate for thedeceleration time of the relativistic ejecta as it interacts with circumstellarmaterial. for grb 050315, the steep decay can be characterized by anexponential form, where one e-folding decay time t_e(bat) ~ 24+/-2 s, andt_e(xrt) ~ 35+/-2 s. for grb 050319, a power law decay -(d ln f/d ln t) = n,where n is about 3, provides a reasonable fit. the early time x-ray fluxes areconsistent with representing the lower energy tail of the prompt emission, andprovide our first quantitative measure of the decay of the prompt gamma-rayemission over a large dynamic range in flux. the initial steep decay isexpected due to the delayed high latitude photons from a curved shell ofrelativistic plasma illuminated only for a short interval. the overallconclusion is that the prompt phase of grbs remains observable for hundreds ofseconds longer than previously thought.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;0602142	testing the curvature effect and internal origin of gamma-ray burst  prompt emissions and x-ray flares with swift data	the x-ray light curves of many gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) have a very steep-decay component (tail) following theprompt gamma-rays in the early phase and have some erratic flares occurring ata time from ~10^2 up to ~10^5 seconds. based on the assumption that these tailsand flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors aredominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present aself-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36prompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 grb xrt light curves. our results showthat the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flaresare usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission orthe corresponding x-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation ofthe internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and x-ray flares. ourresults indicate that each x-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of centralengine activity and the grb central engine remains active after the promptemission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the grb trigger (e.g. grb050502b &amp; grb 050724). this challenges the conventional central engine modelsand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. we further show thatthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the grbduration. we also identify a minority group of grbs whose combined bat-xrtlight curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between theprompt emission and the afterglow. these grbs may have an external origin forboth the prompt emission and the afterglow.

astro-ph;0605230	early multi-wavelength emission from gamma-ray bursts: from gamma-ray to  x-ray	the study of the early high-energy emission from both long and shortgamma-ray bursts has been revolutionized by the swift mission. the rapidresponse of swift shows that the non-thermal x-ray emission transitionssmoothly from the prompt phase into a decaying phase whatever the details ofthe light curve. the decay is often categorized by a steep-to-shallowtransition suggesting that the prompt emission and the afterglow are twodistinct emission components. in those grbs with an initially steeply-decayingx-ray light curve we are probably seeing off-axis emission due to terminationof intense central engine activity. this phase is usually followed, within thefirst hour, by a shallow decay, giving the appearance of a late emission hump.the late emission hump can last for up to a day, and hence, although faint, isenergetically very significant. the energy emitted during the late emissionhump is very likely due to the forward shock being constantly refreshed byeither late central engine activity or less relativistic material emittedduring the prompt phase. in other grbs the early x-ray emission decaysgradually following the prompt emission with no evidence for early temporalbreaks, and in these bursts the emission may be dominated by classicalafterglow emission from the external shock as the relativistic jet is slowed byinteraction with the surrounding circum-burst medium. at least half of the grbsobserved by swift also show erratic x-ray flaring behaviour, usually within thefirst few hours. the properties of the x-ray flares suggest that they are dueto central engine activity. overall, the observed wide variety of earlyhigh-energy phenomena pose a major challenge to grb models.

astro-ph;0610635	swift detects a remarkable gamma-ray burst, grb 060614, that introduces  a new classification scheme	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are known to come in two duration classes, separatedat ~2 s. long bursts originate from star forming regions in galaxies, haveaccompanying supernovae (sne) when near enough to observe and are likely causedby massive-star collapsars. recent observations show that short burstsoriginate in regions within their host galaxies with lower star formation ratesconsistent with binary neutron star (ns) or ns - black hole (bh) mergers.moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no sne havebeen so far associated with short grbs. we report here on the bright, nearbygrb 060614 that does not fit in either class. its ~102 s duration groups itwith long grbs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely withinthe short grb subclass. moreover, very deep optical observations exclude anaccompanying supernova, similar to short grbs. this combination of a longduration event without accompanying sn poses a challenge to both a collapsarand merging ns interpretation and opens the door on a new grb classificationscheme that straddles both long and short bursts.

astro-ph;0610660	the remarkable afterglow of grb 061007: implications for optical flashes  and grb fireballs	we present a multiwavelength analysis of swift grb 061007. the 2-m roboticfaulkes telescope south (fts) began observing 137 s after the onset of thegamma-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from r10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hours. these observationsbegin during the final gamma-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long,soft tail of gamma-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-lawdecay identical to that seen at optical and x-ray wavelengths, with temporalslope alpha 1.7 this remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare forswift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. we suggest theafterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with theon-going variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates froma physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. the afterglowcontinues unabated until at least 10^5 s showing no evidence of a break. theobserved multiwavelength evolution of grb 061007 is explained by an expandingfireball whose optical, x-ray and late-time gamma-ray emission is dominated byemission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, nu_m, that isalready below the optical band as early as t=137 s and a cooling frequency,nu_c, above the x-ray band to at least t=10^5 s. in contrast, the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. we suggestthat the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of swiftgrbs may be explained with a low nu_m originating from small microphysicsparameters, epsilon_e and epsilon_b.

astro-ph;0611148	swift discovery of gamma-ray bursts without jet break feature in their  x-ray afterglows	we analyze swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and x-ray afterglows for three grbswith spectroscopic redshift determinations -- grb 050401, xrf 050416a, and grb050525a. we find that the relation between spectral peak energy and isotropicenergy of prompt emissions (the amati relation) is consistent with that for thebursts observed in pre-swift era. however, we find that the x-ray afterglowlightcurves, which extend up to 10-70 days, show no sign of the jet break thatis expected in the standard framework of collimated outflows. we do so byshowing that none of the x-ray afterglow lightcurves in our sample satisfiesthe relation between the spectral and temporal indices that is predicted forthe phase after jet break. the jet break time can be predicted by inverting thetight empirical relation between the peak energy of the spectrum and thecollimation-corrected energy of the prompt emission (the ghirlanda relation).we find that there are no temporal breaks within the predicted time intervalsin x-ray band. this requires either that the ghirlanda relation has a largerscatter than previously thought, that the temporal break in x-rays is masked bysome additional source of x-ray emission, or that it does not happen because ofsome unknown reason.

astro-ph;0612031	testing the standard fireball model of grbs using late x-ray afterglows  measured by swift	we show that all x-ray decay curves of grbs measured by swift can be fittedusing one or two components both of which have exactly the same functional formcomprised of an early falling exponential phase followed by a power law decay.the 1st component contains the prompt gamma-ray emission and the initial x-raydecay. the 2nd component appears later, has a much longer duration and ispresent for ~80% of grbs. it most likely arises from the external shock whicheventually develops into the x-ray afterglow. in the remaining ~20% of grbs theinitial x-ray decay of the 1st component fades more slowly than the 2nd anddominates at late times to form an afterglow but it is not clear what theorigin of this emission is.  the temporal decay parameters and gamma/x-ray spectral indices derived for107 grbs are compared to the expectations of the standard fireball modelincluding a search for possible "jet breaks". for ~50% of grbs the observedafterglow is in accord with the model but for the rest the temporal andspectral indices do not conform to the expected closure relations and aresuggestive of continued, late, energy injection. we identify a few possible jetbreaks but there are many examples where such breaks are predicted but areabsent.  the time, t_a, at which the exponential phase of the 2nd component changes toa final powerlaw decay afterglow is correlated with the peak of the gamma-rayspectrum, e_peak. this is analogous to the ghirlanda relation, indicating thatthis time is in some way related to optically observed break times measured forpre-swift bursts.

astro-ph;0612494	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments and by konus-wind. thanks to theseexceptional circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the promptemission could be studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges (up to 2mev). while the x-ray emission (0.2-10 kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst,the optical component follows a different pattern, likely indicating adifferent origin, possibly the onset of external shocks. the prompt grbspectrum shows significant spectral evolution, with both the peak energy andthe spectral index varying. as observed in several long grbs, significant lagsare measured between the hard- and low-energy components, showing that thisbehaviour extends over 3 decades in energy. the grb peaks are also much broaderat soft energies. this is related to the temporal evolution of the spectrum,and can be accounted for by the softening of the electron spectral index withtime. the burst energy (e_iso~5x10^{53} erg at z=2.297) and average peak energy(e_p~300 kev) make grb 060124 consistent with the amati relation. the x-rayafterglow is characterized by a decay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0701811	using swift observations of prompt and afterglow emission to classify  grbs	we present an analysis of early bat and xrt data for 107 gamma--ray bursts(grbs) observed by the swift satellite. we use these data to examine thebehaviour of the x-ray light curve and propose a classification scheme for grbsbased on this behaviour. as found for previous smaller samples, the earliestx-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential which relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the later emission is well fit usinga similar functional form and we find that these two functions provide a gooddescription of the entire x-ray light curve. for the prompt emission, thetransition time between the exponential and the power law gives a well-definedtimescale, t_p, for the burst duration. we use t_p, the spectral index of theprompt emission, beta_p, and the prompt power law decay index, alpha_p todefine four classes of burst: short, slow, fast and soft. bursts with slowlydeclining emission have spectral and temporal properties similar to the shortbursts despite having longer durations. some of these grbs may therefore arisefrom similar progenitors including several types of binary system. short burststend to decline more gradually than longer duration bursts and hence emit asignificant fraction of their total energy at times greater than t_p. this maybe due to differences in the environment or the progenitor for long, fastbursts.

astro-ph;0702262	grb 050822: detailed analysis of an xrf observed by swift	we report on the temporal and spectral characteristics of the early x-rayemission from the grb 050822 as observed by swift. this burst is likely to bean xrf showing major x-ray flares in its xrt light-curve. the quality of thedata allows a detailed spectral analysis of the early afterglow in the x-rayband. during the x-ray flares, a positive correlation between the count rateand the spectral hardness (i.e. the higher the count rate, the harder thespectrum) is clearly seen for the x-ray flares. this behaviour, similar to thatseen for gamma-ray pulses, indicates that the energy peak of the spectrum is inthe xrt energy band and it moves towards lower energies with time. we showevidence for the possible detection of the emergence of the forward-shockemission, produced at a radius larger than 4x10^16 cm in the case of a cbmafterglow model (a formation region clearly different from that producing theprompt emission). finally, we show that the null detection of a jet break up tot_0 + 4x10^6 s in the x-ray light curve of this xrf can be understood: i) ifthe jet seen on-axis is uniform with a large opening angle theta &gt; 20 degrees);or ii) if the jet is a structured gaussian-like jet with the line-of-sightoutside the bright gaussian core.

astro-ph;0702371	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: temporal properties and morphology	we present the first systematic investigation of the morphological and timingproperties of flares in grbs observed by swift/xrt. we consider a large sampledrawn from all grbs detected by swift, integral and hete-2 prior to 2006 jan31, which had an xrt follow-up and which showed significant flaring. our sampleof 33 grbs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69flares. the strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clearanti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time ofoccurrence. fitting each x-ray flare with a gaussian model, we find that themean ratio of the width and peak time is &lt;delta t / t &gt; = 0.13+/-0.10, albeitwith a large scatter. late flares at times &gt; 2000 seconds have long durations,delta t&gt;300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.we further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulsesdetected in the prompt phase by bat and the number of x-ray flares detected byxrt, finding no correlation. however, we find that the distribution ofintensity ratios between successive bat prompt pulses and that betweensuccessive xrt flares is the same, an indication of a common origin forgamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares. all evidence indicates that flares areindeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standardfireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.while all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flaresmay also be explained by refreshed shocks. however, 10 can only be explained byprolonged activity of the central engine.

astro-ph;9903133	the optical variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy iras  13224-3809	we report on a short optical monitoring programme of the narrow-line seyfert1 galaxy iras 13224-3809. previous x-ray observations of this object have shownpersistent giant variability. the degree of variability at other wavelengthsmay then be used to constrain the conditions and emission processes within thenucleus. optical variability is expected if the electron population responsiblefor the soft x-ray emission is changing rapidly and compton-upscatteringinfrared photons in the nucleus, or if the mechanism responsible for x-rayemission causes all the emission processes to vary together. we find that thereis no significant optical variability with a firm upper limit of 2 per cent andconclude that the primary soft x-ray emission region produces little of theobserved optical emission. the x-ray and optical emission regions must bephysically distinct and any reprocessing of x-rays into the optical wavebandoccurs some distance from the nucleus. the lack of optical variabilityindicates that the energy density of infrared radiation in the nucleus is atmost equal to that of the ultraviolet radiation since little is upscatteredinto the optical waveband. the extremely large x-ray variability of iras13224-3809 may be explained by relativistic boosting of more modest variations.although such boosting enhances x-ray variability over optical variability,this only partially explains the lack of optical variability.

0812.0979	in search of progenitors for supernova-less grbs 060505 and 060614:  re-examination of their afterglows	grb060505 and grb060614 are nearby long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)without accompanying supernovae (sne) down to very strict limits. they therebychallenge the conventional lgrb-sn connection and naturally give rise to thequestion: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which wouldhelp shed light on their progenitors? to answer this question, we combine newobservational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporaland spectral properties of the two afterglows. we find that both afterglows canbe well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shockwave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well withinthe range observed for other lgrbs. hence, from the properties of theafterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have anotherprogenitor than other lgrbs. recently, swift-discovered grb080503 also has thespike + tail structure during its prompt gamma-ray emission seemingly similarto grb060614. we analyse the prompt emission of this burst and find that thisgrb is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of0.8$\pm$0.4 s during its tail emission. thus, the properties of the promptemission of grb060614 and grb080503 are clearly different, motivating furtherthinking of grb classification. finally we note that, whereas the progenitor ofthe two sn-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for thesn-less bursts would be quite certain if a wind-like environment can beobservationally established, e.g, from an optical decay faster than the x-raydecay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.
