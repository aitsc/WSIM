0902.4464	a submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76 in the laboca survey of the extended  chandra deep field south	we report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected sourcecurrently known: lessj033229.4-275619. this source was detected in the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca) extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs)submillimetre survey (less), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mjy rms) of thefull 30'x30' ecdfs with the laboca camera on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. the submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart forwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. we show that thebolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of~1000 msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in this galaxy. thus it has characteristics similar to those ofz~2 submm galaxies (smgs), with a mix of starburst and obscured agn signatures.this demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restrictedto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) qsos at z~5, but was alsooccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the universe was less than10% of its current age. assuming that we are seeing the major phase of starformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as aluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the spacedensity of z&gt;4 smgs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous redgalaxy population at these early times. however, this leaves open thepossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but moreextended star formation events. if the progenitors of all of the luminous redgalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z&gt;4 then the requiredvolume density of z&gt;4 smgs will exceed that predicted by current galaxyformation models by more than an order of magnitude.

0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1009.3504	a detailed study of photometric redshifts for goods-south galaxies	we use the deepest and the most comprehensive photometric data currentlyavailable for goods-south galaxies to measure their photometric redshifts. thephotometry includes vlt/vimos (u-band), hst/acs (f435w, f606w, f775w, andf850lp bands), vlt/isaac (j-, h-, and ks-bands), and four spitzer/irac channels(3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron). the catalog is selected in the z-band (f850lp)and photometry in each band is carried out using the recently completed tfitalgorithm, which performs psf matched photometry uniformly across differentinstruments and filters, despite large variations in psfs and pixel scales.photometric redshifts are derived using the goodz code, which is based on thetemplate fitting method using priors. the code also implements "training" ofthe template sed set, using available spectroscopic redshifts in order tominimize systematic differences between the templates and the seds of theobserved galaxies. our final catalog covers an area of 153 sq. arcmin andincludes photometric redshifts for a total of 32,505 objects. the scatterbetween our estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma=0.040with 3.7% outliers to the full z-band depth of our catalog, decreasing tosigma=0.039 and 2.1% outliers at a magnitude limit m(z)&lt;24.5. this isconsistent with the best results previously published for goods-s galaxies,however, the present catalog is the deepest yet available and providesphotometric redshifts for significantly more objects to deeper flux limits andhigher redshifts than earlier works. furthermore, we show that the photometricredshifts estimated here for galaxies selected as dropouts are consistent withthose expected based on the lyman break technique.

1101.0843	color and stellar population gradients in passively evolving galaxies at  z~2 from hst/wfc3 deep imaging in the hubble ultra deep field	we report the detection of color gradients in six massive (stellar mass &gt;10^{10} m_{sun}) and passively evolving (specific sfr &lt; 10^{-11}/yr) galaxiesat redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.5 identified in the hudf using hst acs and wfc3/ir images.after matching different psfs, we obtain color maps and multi-bandoptical/near-ir photometry (bvizyjh) in concentric annuli, from the smallestresolved radial (~1.7 kpc) up to several times the h-band effective radius. wefind that the inner regions of these galaxies have redder rest-frameuv--optical colors than the outer parts. the slopes of the color gradientsmildly depend on the overall dust obscuration and rest-frame (u-v) color, withmore obscured or redder galaxies having steeper color gradients. the z~2 colorgradients are also steeper than those of local early-types. the gradient of asingle parameter (age, extinction or metallicity) cannot fully explain theobserved color gradients. fitting spatially resolved hst seven-band photometryto stellar population synthesis models, we find that, regardless of assumptionsfor metallicity gradient, the redder inner regions of the galaxies haveslightly higher dust obscuration than the bluer outer regions, although themagnitude depends on the assumed extinction law. the derived age gradientdepends on the assumptions for metallicity gradient. we discuss theimplications of a number of assumptions for metallicity gradient on theformation and evolution of these galaxies. we find that the evolution of themass--size relationship from z~2 to z~0 cannot be driven by in--situ extendedstar formation, implying that accretion or merger is mostly responsible for theevolution. the lack of a correlation between color gradient and stellar massargues against the metallicity gradient predicted by the monolithic collapse,which would require significant major mergers to evolve into the one observedat z~0.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1110.3786	what turns galaxies off? the different morphologies of star-forming and  quiescent galaxies since z~2 from candels	we use hst/wfc3 imaging from the candels multicycle treasury survey, inconjunction with the sloan digital sky survey, to explore the evolution ofgalactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses &gt;3e10m_sun from z=2.2 tothe present epoch, a time span of 10gyr. we explore the relationship betweenrest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity and galaxystructure. we confirm the dramatic increase from z=2.2 to the present day inthe number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3e10m_sun reported byothers. we further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems haveconcentrated light profiles, as parametrized by the sersic index, and thepopulation of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. we examine thejoint distribution of star formation activity, sersic index, stellar mass,inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. quiescencecorrelates poorly with stellar mass at all z&lt;2.2. quiescence correlates wellwith sersic index at all redshifts. quiescence correlates well with `velocitydispersion' and stellar surface density at z&gt;1.3, and somewhat less well atlower redshifts. yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence andgalaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominentbulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominatedgalaxies have significant star formation. noting the rarity of quiescentgalaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (andperhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important conditionfor quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10gyr, inqualitative agreement with the agn feedback paradigm.

1201.1616	clash: precise new constraints on the mass profile of abell 2261	we precisely constrain the inner mass profile of abell 2261 (z=0.225) for thefirst time and determine this cluster is not "over-concentrated" as foundpreviously, implying a formation time in agreement with {\lambda}cdmexpectations. these results are based on strong lensing analyses of new 16-bandhst imaging obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). combining this with revised weak lensing analyses of subaruwide field imaging with 5-band subaru + kpno photometry, we place tight newconstraints on the halo virial mass m_vir = 2.2\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70(within r \approx 3 mpc/h70) and concentration c = 6.2 \pm 0.3 when assuming aspherical halo. this agrees broadly with average c(m,z) predictions from recent{\lambda}cdm simulations which span 5 &lt;~ &lt;c&gt; &lt;~ 8. our most significantsystematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight. to estimatethis, we also derive a mass profile based on archival chandra x-rayobservations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile atr2500 ~ 600 kpc. agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axisratio along our line of sight. for this elongated halo model, we find m_vir =1.7\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70 and c_vir = 4.6\pm0.2, placing rough lowerlimits on these values. the need for halo elongation can be partially obviatedby non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors inthe x-ray mass measurements. we estimate the effect of background structuresbased on mmt/hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find these tend to lowermvir further by ~7% and increase cvir by ~5%.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1204.2552	extended x-ray emission from non-thermal sources in the cosmos field: a  detailed study of a large radio galaxy at z=1.168	x-ray selected galaxy group samples are usually generated by searching forextended x- ray sources that reflect the thermal radiation of the intragroupmedium. on the other hand, large radio galaxies that regularly occupy galaxygroups also emit in the x-ray window, and their contribution to x-ray selectedgroup samples is still not well understood. in order to investigate theirrelative importance, we have carried out a systematic search for non-thermalextended x-ray sources in the cosmos field. based on the morphologicalcoincidence of x-ray and radio extensions, out of 60 radio galaxies, and \sim300 extended x-ray sources, we find only one candidate where the observedextended x-ray emission arises from non- thermal processes related to radiogalaxies. we present a detailed analysis of this source, and its environment.our results yield that external inverse compton emission of the lobes is thedominant process that generates the observed x-ray emission of our extendedx-ray candidate, with a minor contribution from the gas of the galaxy grouphosting the radio galaxy. finally, we show that finding only one potentialcandidate in the cosmos field (in a redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 6 and with radioluminosity between 1025 and 1030 w/hz) is consistent with expected x-ray-countsarising from synchrotron lobes. this implies that these sources are not aprominent source of contamination in samples of x-ray selected clusters/groups,but they could potentially dominate the z &gt; 1 cluster counts at the bright end(s_x &gt; 7 \cdot 10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^2).

1204.3630	clash: mass distribution in and around macs j1206.2-0847 from a full  cluster lensing analysis	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the galaxy cluster macsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.439) from a combined weak-lensing distortion, magnification,and strong-lensing analysis of wide-field subaru bvriz' imaging and our recent16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) program. we find goodagreement in the regions of overlap between several weak and strong lensingmass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuringconsistency. the subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large scalestructure with the major axis running approximately north-west south-east(nw-se), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showingelongation with a \sim 2:1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. our full-lensingmass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln\sigma/dlnr\sim -1 at clusteroutskirts (r&gt;1mpc/h), whereas the mass distribution excluding the nw-se excessregions steepens further out, well described by the navarro-frenk-white form.assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass m_{vir}=(1.1\pm 0.2\pm0.1)\times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h and a halo concentration c_{vir} = 6.9\pm 1.0\pm1.2 (\sim 5.7 when the central 50kpc/h is excluded), which falls in the range4&lt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;7 of average c(m,z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent lambdacold dark matter simulations. our full lensing results are found to be inagreement with x-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and whencombined with chandra gas mass measurements, yield a cumulative gas massfraction of 13.7^{+4.5}_{-3.0}% at 0.7mpc/h (\approx 1.7r_{2500}), a typicalvalue observed for high mass clusters.

1205.3839	a brightest cluster galaxy with an extremely large flat core	hubble space telescope images of the galaxy cluster abell 2261, obtained aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble, show that thebrightest galaxy in the cluster, a2261-bcg, has the largest core yet detectedin any galaxy. the cusp radius of a2261-bcg is 3.2 kpc, twice as big as thenext largest core known, and ~3x bigger than those typically seen in the mostluminous bcgs. the morphology of the core in a2261-bcg is also unusual, havinga flat or even slightly-depressed interior surface brightness profile, ratherthan the typical shallow cusp. this implies that the galaxy has a core withconstant or even centrally decreasing stellar density. interpretation of thecore as an end product of the "scouring" action of a binary supermassive blackhole implies a total black hole mass ~1e+10 m_sun from the extrapolation ofmost relationships between core structure and black hole mass. the core falls1-sigma above the cusp-radius versus galaxy luminosity relation. its large sizein real terms, and the extremely large black hole mass required to generate it,raise the possibility that the core has been enlarged by additional processes,such as the ejection of the black holes that originally generated the core. theflat central stellar density profile is consistent with this hypothesis. thecore is also displaced by 0.7 kpc from the center of the surrounding envelope,consistent with a local dynamical perturbation of the core.

1207.4478	the seds, host galaxies and environments of variability selected agn in  goods-s	variability selection has been proposed as a powerful tool for identifyingboth low-luminosity agn and those with unusual seds. however, a systematicstudy of sources selected in such a way has been lacking. in this paper, wepresent the multi-wavelength properties of the variability selected agn ingoods south. we demonstrate that variability selection indeed reliablyidentifies agn, predominantly of low luminosity. we find contamination fromstars as well as a very small sample of sources that show no sign of agnactivity, their number is consistent with the expected false positive rate. wealso study the host galaxies and environments of the agn in the sample.disturbed host morphologies are relatively common. the host galaxies span awide range in the level of ongoing star-formation. however, massive star-burstsare only present in the hosts of the most luminous agn in the sample. there isno clear environmental preference for the agn sample in general but we findthat the most luminous agn on average avoid dense regions while somelow-luminosity agn hosted by late-type galaxies are found near the centres ofgroups. agn in our sample have closer nearest neighbours than the generalgalaxy population. we find no indications that major mergers are a dominanttriggering process for the moderate to low luminosity agn in this sample. theenvironments and host galaxy properties instead suggest secular processes, inparticular tidal processes at first passage and minor mergers, as likelytriggers for the objects studied. this study demonstrates the strength ofvariability selection for agn and gives first hints at possibly triggeringmechanisms for high-redshift low luminosity agn.

1209.4084	quenching star formation at intermediate redshifts: downsizing of the  mass flux density in the green valley	the bimodality in galaxy properties has been observed at low and highredshift, with a clear distinction between star-forming galaxies in the bluecloud and passively evolving objects in the red sequence; the absence ofgalaxies with intermediate properties indicates that the quenching of starformation and subsequent transition between populations must happen rapidly. inthis paper, we present a study of over 100 transiting galaxies in the so-called"green valley" at intermediate redshifts (z ~ 0.8). by using very deepspectroscopy with the deimos instrument at the keck telescope we are able toinfer the star formation histories of these objects and measure the stellarmass flux density transiting from the blue cloud to the red sequence when theuniverse was half its current age. our results indicate that the processhappened more rapidly and for more massive galaxies in the past, suggesting atop-down scenario in which the massive end of the red sequence is formingfirst. this represent another aspect of downsizing, with the mass flux densitymoving towards smaller galaxies in recent times.

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

1211.6804	the abundance of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 8.5 to 12:  new results from the 2012 hubble ultra deep field campaign	we present the results of the deepest search to date for star-forminggalaxies beyond a redshift z~8.5 utilizing a new sequence of near-infrared widefield camera 3 images of the hubble ultra deep field. this `udf12' campaigncompleted in september 2012 doubles the earlier exposures with wfc3/ir in thisfield and quadruples the exposure in the key f105w filter used to locate suchdistant galaxies. combined with additional imaging in the f140w filter, thefidelity of high redshift candidates is greatly improved. using spectral energydistribution fitting techniques on objects selected from a deep multi-bandnear-infrared stack we find 7 promising z&gt;8.5 candidates. as none of thepreviously claimed udf candidates with 8.5&lt;z&lt;10 is confirmed by our deepermulti-band imaging, our campaign has transformed the measured abundance ofgalaxies in this redshift range. although we recover the candidateudfj-39546284 (previously proposed at z=10.3), it is undetected in the newlyadded f140w image, implying it lies at z=11.9 or is an intense emission linegalaxy at z~2.4. although no physically-plausible model can explain therequired line intensity given the lack of lyman alpha or broad-band uv signal,without an infrared spectrum we cannot rule out an exotic interloper.regardless, our robust z ~ 8.5 - 10 sample demonstrates a luminosity densitythat continues the smooth decline observed over 6 &lt; z &lt; 8. such continuity hasimportant implications for models of cosmic reionization and future searchesfor z&gt;10 galaxies with jwst.

1301.1228	new constraints on cosmic reionization from the 2012 hubble ultra deep  field campaign	understanding cosmic reionization requires the identification andcharacterization of early sources of hydrogen-ionizing photons. the 2012 hubbleultra deep field (udf12) campaign has acquired the deepest infrared images withthe wide field camera 3 aboard hubble space telescope and, for the first time,systematically explored the galaxy population deep into the era when cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) data indicates reionization was underway. the udf12campaign thus provides the best constraints to date on the abundance,luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of early star-forminggalaxies. we synthesize the new udf12 results with the most recent constraintsfrom cmb observations to infer redshift-dependent ultraviolet (uv) luminositydensities, reionization histories, and electron scattering optical depthevolution consistent with the available data. under reasonable assumptionsabout the escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons and the intergalacticmedium clumping factor, we find that to fully reionize the universe by redshiftz~6 the population of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z~7-9 likely mustextend in luminosity below the udf12 limits to absolute uv magnitudes ofm_uv\sim -13 or fainter. moreover, low levels of star formation extending toredshifts z~15-25, as suggested by the normal uv colors of z\simeq7-8 galaxiesand the smooth decline in abundance with redshift observed by udf12 toz\simeq10, are additionally likely required to reproduce the optical depth toelectron scattering inferred from cmb observations.

1306.4980	candels: the correlation between galaxy morphology and star formation  activity at z~2	we discuss the state of the assembly of the hubble sequence in the mix ofbright galaxies at redshift 1.4&lt; z \le 2.5 with a large sample of 1,671galaxies down to h_{ab}~26, selected from the hst/acs and wfc3 images of thegoods--south field obtained as part of the goods and candels observations. weinvestigate the relationship between the star formation properties andmorphology using various parametric diagnostics, such as the sersic lightprofile, gini (g), m_{20}, concentration (c), asymmetry (a) and multiplicityparameters. our sample clearly separates into massive, red and passive galaxiesversus less massive, blue and star forming ones, and this dichotomy correlatesvery well with the galaxies' morphological properties. star--forming galaxiesshow a broad variety of morphological features, including clumpy structures andbulges mixed with faint low surface brightness features, generallycharacterized by disky-type light profiles. passively evolving galaxies, on theother hand, very often have compact light distribution and morphology typicalof today's spheroidal systems. we also find that artificially redshifted localgalaxies have a similar distribution with z~2galaxies in a g-m_{20} plane.visual inspection between the rest-frame optical and uv images show that thereis a generally weak morphological k-correction for galaxies at z~2, but thecomparison with non-parametric measures show that galaxies in the rest-frame uvare somewhat clumpier than rest-frame optical. similar general trends areobserved in the local universe among massive galaxies, suggesting that thebackbone of the hubble sequence was already in place at z~2.

1306.5240	galaxy halo truncation and giant arc surface brightness reconstruction  in the cluster macsj1206.2-0847	in this work we analyze the mass distribution of macsj1206.2-0847, especiallyfocusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. the cluster appearsrelaxed in its x-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intraclusterlight which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scaleinteractions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. the clusterlenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$into a giant arc and its counterimage. the multiple image positions and thesurface brightness distribution (sfb) of the arc which is bent around severalcluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. we modelthe cluster mass distribution with a nfw profile and the galaxy halos with twoparameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assumingscalings with their observed nir--light. we match the multiple image positionsat an r.m.s. level of $0.85\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the sfb distribution ofthe arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this clustermodel. the length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrainedis about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamicaland field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weaklensing results on the other hand. the velocity dispersion and halo size of agalaxy with $m_{\rm 160w,ab}=19.2$ or $m_{\rm b,vega}=-20.7$ are $\sigma=150\rm kms^{-1}$ and $r\approx 26\pm 6 \rm kpc$, indicating that the halos of thecluster galaxies are tidally stripped. we also reconstruct the unlensed source(which is smaller by a factor of $\sim5.8$ in area), demonstrating the increaseof morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy haslikely star--forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1309.6341	to stack or not to stack: spectral energy distribution properties of  lya-emitting galaxies at z=2.1	we use the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey(candels) goods-s multi-wavelength catalog to identify counterparts for 20 lyaemitting (lae) galaxies at z=2.1. we build several types of stacked spectralenergy distributions (seds) of these objects. we combine photometry to formaverage and median flux-stacked seds, and postage stamp images to form averageand median image-stacked seds. we also introduce scaled flux stacks thateliminate the influence of variation in overall brightness. we use the sedfitting code speedymc to constrain the physical properties of individualobjects and stacks. our laes at z = 2.1 have stellar masses ranging from 2x10^7msun - 8x10^9 msun (median = 3x10^8 msun), ages ranging from 4 myr to 500 myr(median =100 myr), and e(b-v) between 0.02 and 0.24 (median = 0.12). we do notobserve strong correlations between lya equivalent width (ew) and stellar mass,age, or e(b-v). the lya radiative transfer (q) factors of our sample arepredominantly close to one and do not correlate strongly with ew or e(b-v),implying that lya radiative transfer prevents lya photons from resonantlyscattering in dusty regions. the sed parameters of the flux stacks match theaverage and median values of the individual objects, with the flux-scaledmedian sed performing best with reduced uncertainties. median image-stackedseds provide a poor representation of the median individual object, and none ofthe stacking methods captures the large dispersion of lae properties.

1310.3819	the progenitors of the compact early-type galaxies at high-redshift	we use goods and candels images to identify progenitors of massive (log m &gt;10 msun) compact "early-type" galaxies (etgs) at z~1.6. since merging andaccretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if theprogenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compactthemselves. we select candidate progenitors among compact lyman-break galaxiesat z~3 based on their mass, sfr and central stellar density and find that theseaccount for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact etgs at z~1.6. wefind that the average far-uv sed of the candidates is redder than that of thenon-candidates, but the optical and mid-ir sed are the same, implying that theredder uv of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration, andconsistent with more evolved (aging) star-formation. this is in line with otherevidence that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity amonghigh-redshift massive galaxies. we also find that the light distribution ofboth the compact etgs and their candidate progenitors does not show anyextended "halos" surrounding the compact "core", both in individual images andin stacks. we argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology ofmerger remnants, even if gas-rich, as predicted by n-body simulations. thissuggests that the compact etgs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseousaccretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected inthe hst images, with their stellar mass assembling in-situ, and that they havenot experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z~1.6.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1405.7876	clash-x: a comparison of lensing and x-ray techniques for measuring the  mass profiles of galaxy clusters	we present profiles of temperature (tx), gas mass, and hydrostatic massestimated from new and archival x-ray observations of clash clusters. wecompare measurements derived from xmm and chandra observations with one anotherand compare both to gravitational lensing mass profiles derived with clash hstand ground-based lensing data. radial profiles of chandra and xmm electrondensity and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differencesin hydrostatic masses inferred from x-ray observations arise from differencesin tx measurements. encouragingly, cluster txs are consistent with one anotherat ~100-200 kpc radii but xmm tx systematically decline relative to chandra txat larger radii. the angular dependence of the discrepancy suggests additionalinvestigation on systematics such as the xmm point spread function correction,vignetting and off-axis responses. we present the clash-x mass-profilecomparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independentcircular-velocity profiles. ratios of chandra hse mass profiles to clashlensing profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 mpc range.however, the mean mass biases inferred from the wl and sawlens data aredifferent. e.g., the weighted-mean value at 0.5 mpc is &lt;b&gt; = 0.12 for the wlcomparison and &lt;b&gt; = -0.11 for the sawlens comparison. the ratios of xmm hsemass profiles to clash lensing profiles show a pronounced radial dependence inthe 0.3-1.0 mpc range, with a weighted mean mass bias of value rising to&lt;b&gt;~0.3 at ~1 mpc for the wl comparison and &lt;b&gt; of 0.25 for sawlens comparison.the enclosed gas mass profiles from both chandra and xmm rise to a value 1/8times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at 0.5 mpc and remainconstant outside of that radius, suggesting that [8xmgas] profiles may be anexcellent proxy for total-mass profiles at &gt;0.5 mpc in massive galaxy clusters.

1407.1834	the interstellar medium and feedback in the progenitors of the compact  passive galaxies at z~2	quenched galaxies at z&gt;2 are nearly all very compact relative to z~0,suggesting a physical connection between high stellar density and efficient,rapid cessation of star-formation. we present restframe uv spectra oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors ofquenched galaxies at z~2 based on their compact restframe optical sizes andhigh surface density of star-formation. we compare their uv properties to thoseof more extended lbgs of similar mass and star formation rate (non-candidates).we find that candidate progenitors have faster ism gas velocities and higherequivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocityspread among absorbing clouds. candidates deviate from the relationship betweenequivalent widths of lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption lines in thattheir lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,possibly indicating that the neutral hi fraction is patchy such thatlyman-alpha photons can escape. we detect stronger civ p-cygni features(emission and absorption) and heii emission in candidates, indicative of largerpopulations of metal rich wolf-rayet stars compared to non-candidates. thefaster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and lyman-alpha propertiesof candidates are consistent with their ism being subject to more energeticfeedback than non-candidates. together with their larger metallicity (implyingmore evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, ifspeculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates,supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them asprogenitors of z~2 passive galaxies. we propose that massive, compact galaxiesundergo more rapid growth of stellar mass content, perhaps because the gasaccretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized lbgsat these early epochs.

1409.5796	evolution of the dust emission of massive galaxies up to z=4 and  constraints on their dominant mode of star formation	we aim to measure the average dust and molecular gas content of massivestar-forming galaxies ($\rm &gt; 3 \times 10^{10}\,m_\odot$) up to z=4 in thecosmos field to determine if the intense star formation observed at highredshift is induced by major mergers or caused by large gas reservoirs.firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributionsas a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of spitzer, herschel,laboca, and aztec data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objectsand strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. wefound that the mean intensity of the radiation field $&lt; u &gt;$ heating the dust(strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshiftup to z$\sim$4 in main-sequence galaxies. we can reproduce this evolution withsimple models that account for the decrease of the gas metallicity withredshift. no evolution of $&lt; u &gt;$ with redshift is found in strong starbursts.we then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as$\rm m_{\rm mol}/(m_{\rm mol}+m_\star)$) with redshift and found a similar,steeply increasing trend for both samples. at z$\sim$4, this fraction reaches$\sim$60%. the average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locusof the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated schmidt-kennicuttdiagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that thebulk of the star formation up to z=4 is dominated by secular processes.

1411.1414	hubble space telescope combined strong and weak lensing analysis of the  clash sample: mass and magnification models and systematic uncertainties	we present results from a comprehensive lensing analysis in hst data, of thecomplete clash cluster sample. we identify new multiple-images previouslyundiscovered allowing improved or first constraints on the cluster inner massdistributions and profiles. we combine these strong-lensing constraints withweak-lensing shape measurements within the hst fov to jointly constrain themass distributions. the analysis is performed in two different commonparameterizations (one adopts light-traces-mass for both galaxies and darkmatter while the other adopts an analytical, elliptical nfw form for the darkmatter), to provide a better assessment of the underlying systematics - whichis most important for deep, cluster-lensing surveys, especially when studyingmagnified high-redshift objects. we find that the typical (median), relativesystematic differences throughout the central fov are $\sim40\%$ in the(dimensionless) mass density, $\kappa$, and $\sim20\%$ in the magnification,$\mu$. we show maps of these differences for each cluster, as well as the massdistributions, critical curves, and 2d integrated mass profiles. for theeinstein radii ($z_{s}=2$) we find that all typically agree within $10\%$between the two models, and einstein masses agree, typically, within$\sim15\%$. at larger radii, the total projected, 2d integrated mass profilesof the two models, within $r\sim2\arcmin$, differ by $\sim30\%$. stacking thesurface-density profiles of the sample from the two methods together, we obtainan average slope of $d\log (\sigma)/d\log(r)\sim-0.64\pm0.1$, in the radialrange [5,350] kpc. lastly, we also characterize the behavior of the averagemagnification, surface density, and shear differences between the two models,as a function of both the radius from the center, and the best-fit values ofthese quantities.

1412.7909	clash: extreme emission line galaxies and their implication on selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we utilize the clash (cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble)observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies(eelgs). the selections are carried out in two central bands: f105w (y105) andf125w (j125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by thepresence of [o iii] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79,respectively. the multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalentwidths of emission lines. thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame[o iii] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. our samples includea number of eelgs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, andthe extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies.these eelgs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshiftgalaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxieswhen the s/n ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. we predictthat the fraction of eelgs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannotbe neglected.

1504.00598	ultraviolet morphologies and star-formation rates of clash brightest  cluster galaxies	brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) are usually quiescent, but many exhibitstar formation. here we exploit the opportunity provided by rest-frame uvimaging of galaxy clusters in the clash (cluster lensing and supernovae withhubble) multi-cycle treasury project to reveal the diversity of uv morphologiesin bcgs and to compare them with recent simulations of the cool, star-forminggas structures produced by precipitation-driven feedback. all of the clash bcgsare detected in the rest-frame uv (280 nm), regardless of their star-formationactivity, because evolved stellar populations produce a modest amount of uvlight that traces the relatively smooth, symmetric, and centrally peakedstellar distribution seen in the near infrared. ultraviolet morphologies amongthe bcgs with strong uv excesses exhibit distinctive knots, multiple elongatedclumps, and extended filaments of emission that distinctly differ from thesmooth profiles of the uv-quiet bcgs. these structures, which are similar tothose seen in the few star-forming bcgs observed in the uv at low redshift, aresuggestive of bi-polar streams of clumpy star formation, but not of spiral armsor large, kpc-scale disks. based on the number of streams and lack of culpritcompanion galaxies, these streams are unlikely to have arisen from multiplecollisions with gas-rich galaxies. these star-forming uv structures aremorphologically similar to the cold-gas structures produced in simulations ofprecipitation-driven agn feedback in which jets uplift low-entropy gas togreater altitudes, causing it to condense. unobscured star-formation ratesestimated from clash uv images using the kennicutt relation range up to 80solar masses per year in the most extended and highly structured systems. thecircumgalactic gas-entropy threshold for star formation in clash bcgs atz~0.2-0.5 is indistinguishable from that for clusters at z &lt; 0.2.

1507.06508	the projected gravitational potential of the galaxy cluster macs~j1206  derived from galaxy kinematics	we reconstruct the radial profile of the projected gravitational potential ofthe galaxy cluster macs-j1206 from 592 spectroscopic measurements of velocitiesof cluster members. for doing so, we use a method we have developed recentlybased on the richardson-lucy deprojection algorithm and an inversion of thespherically-symmetric jeans equation. we find that, within the uncertainties,our reconstruction agrees very well with a potential reconstruction from weakand strong gravitational lensing as well as with a potential obtained fromx-ray measurements. in addition, our reconstruction is in good agreement withseveral common analytic profiles of the lensing potential. varying theanisotropy parameter in the jeans equation, we find that isotropy parameterswhich are either small, $\beta\lesssim0.2$, or decrease with radius yieldpotential profiles which strongly disagree with that obtained fromgravitational lensing. we achieve the best agreement between our potentialprofile and the profile from gravitational lensing if the anisotropy parameterrises quite steeply to $\beta\approx0. 6$ within $\approx0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}$ andstays constant further out.

1508.01294	evolution of star-formation properties of high-redshift cluster galaxies  since $z = 2$	using a stellar mass limited sample of $\sim 46,600$ galaxies ($m_* &gt;10^{9.1}\,m_{\odot}$) at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2$, we show that the tellar mass, ratherthan the environment, is the main parameter controlling quenching of starformation in galaxies with $m_* &gt; 10^{10}\,m_{\odot}$ out to $z=2$. on theother hand, the environmental quenching becomes efficient at $z &lt; 1$ regardlessof galaxy mass, and it serves as a main star formation quenching mechanism forlower mass galaxies. our result is based on deep optical and near-infraredimaging data over 2800 arcmin$^2$, enabling us to negate cosmic variance andidentify 46 galaxy cluster candidates with $m \sim 10^{14}\,m_{\odot}$. from$m_* \sim 10^{9.5}$ to $10^{10.5}\,m_{\odot}$, the fraction of quiescentgalaxies increases by a factor of $\sim 10$ over the entire redshift range, butthe difference between cluster and field environment is negligible. rapidevolution in the quiescent fraction is seen from $z=2$ to $z=1.3$ for massivegalaxies suggesting a build-up of massive quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 1.3$. forgalaxies with $m_* &lt; 10^{10}\,m_{\odot}$ at $z &lt; 1.0$, the quiescent fractionis found to be as much as a factor of 2 larger in clusters than in field,showing the importance of environmental quenching in low mass galaxies at lowredshift. most high mass galaxies are already quenched at $z &gt; 1$, thereforeenvironmental quenching does not play a significant role for them, although theenvironmental quenching efficiency is nearly identical between high and lowmass galaxies.

1511.04002	the detection and statistics of giant arcs behind clash clusters	we developed an algorithm to find and characterize gravitationally lensedgalaxies (arcs) to perform a comparison of the observed and simulated arcabundance. observations are from the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). simulated clash images are created using the moka package andalso clusters selected from the high resolution, hydrodynamical simulations,music, over the same mass and redshift range as the clash sample. thealgorithm' s arc elongation accuracy, completeness and false positive rate aredetermined and used to compute an estimate of the true arc abundance. we derivea lensing efficiency of $4 \pm 1$ arcs (with length $\ge 6"$ andlength-to-width ratio $\ge 7$) per cluster for the x-ray selected clash sample,$4 \pm 1$ arcs per cluster for the moka simulated sample and $3 \pm 1$ arcs percluster for the music simulated sample. the observed and simulated arcstatistics are in full agreement. we measure the photometric redshifts of alldetected arcs and find a median redshift $z_s = 1.9$ with 33% of the detectedarcs having $z_s &gt; 3$. we find that the arc abundance does not depend stronglyon the source redshift distribution but is sensitive to the mass distributionof the dark matter halos (e.g. the $c-m$ relation). our results show thatconsistency between the observed and simulated distributions of lensed arcsizes and axial ratios can be achieved by using cluster-lensing simulationsthat are carefully matched to the selection criteria used in the observations.

astro-ph;0701594	dark matter maps reveal cosmic scaffolding	ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for onlyone-sixth of the total matter in the universe. the remainder is a mysterious"dark matter" component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thusneither emits nor reflects light. as dark matter cannot be seen directly usingtraditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties.it does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed throughgravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by thegravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. this is a purelygeometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive toall matter -- whether baryonic or dark. here we show high fidelity maps of thelarge-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. wefind a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect inmassive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. our results areconsistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, inwhich the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filamentsthen into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas canaccumulate, and stars can be built.

(1998) is detectedin the [feii] 1.64mic line and presents a morphology similar to that observedin pa alpha with a [feii]/pa alpha ratio typical of low ionization seyfertgalaxies and liners. nicmos 3 pa alpha observations in a 50"x50" circumnuclearregion suggest enhanced star formation (~0.3msun/yr) at the edges of theputative bar seen with iso, perhaps due to shocks driven into the gas.  the light profile, reconstructed from v, h and k observations, shows thatcentaurus a has a core profile with a resolved break at ~4" and suggests ablack--hole mass of ~10^9 msun. a linear blue structure aligned with theradio/x-ray jet may indicate a channel of relatively low reddening in whichdust has been swept away by the jet.
