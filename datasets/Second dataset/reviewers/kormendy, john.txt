0901.3778	correlations between supermassive black holes, velocity dispersions, and  mass deficits in elliptical galaxies with cores	high-dynamic-range surface photometry in a companion paper makes possibleaccurate measurement of the stellar light deficits l_def and mass deficitsm_def associated with the cores of elliptical galaxies. we show that l_defcorrelates with the velocity dispersion sigma of the host galaxy bulge averagedoutside the central region that may be affected by a supermassive black hole(bh). we confirm that l_def correlates with bh mass mbh. also, the fractionallight deficit l_def/l correlates with mbh/m, the ratio of bh mass to the galaxystellar mass. all three correlations have scatter similar to or smaller thanthe scatter in the well known correlation between mbh and sigma. the newcorrelations are remarkable in view of the dichotomy between ellipticals withcores and those with central extra light. core light deficit correlates closelywith mbh and sigma, but extra light does not. this supports the suggestion thatextra light es are made in wet mergers with starbursts whereas core es are madein dry mergers. after dry mergers, cores are believed to be scoured by bhbinaries that fling stars away as their orbits decay or by bhs that sink backto the center after recoiling from anisotropic gravitational radiation emittedwhen they merge. direct evidence has been elusive. we interpret the newcorrelations as the "smoking gun" that connects cores with bhs. together, thembh - sigma and mbh - l_def correlations give us two independent ways toestimate bh masses in core ellipticals.

0901.4162	a quintet of black hole mass determinations	we report five new measurements of central black hole masses based on stisand wfpc2 observations with the hubble space telescope and on axisymmetric,three-integral, schwarzschild orbit-library kinematic models. we selected asample of galaxies within a narrow range in velocity dispersion that cover arange of galaxy parameters (including hubble type and core/power-law surfacedensity profile) where we expected to be able to resolve the galaxy's sphere ofinfluence based on the predicted value of the black hole mass from the m-sigmarelation. we find masses in units of 10^8 solar masses for the followinggalaxies:  ngc 3585, m_bh = 3.4 (+1.5, -0.6);  ngc 3607, m_bh = 1.2 (+0.4, -0.4);  ngc 4026, m_bh = 2.1 (+0.7, -0.4); and  ngc 5576, m_bh = 1.8 (+0.3, -0.4), all significantly excluding m_bh = 0. for  ngc 3945, m_bh = 0.09 (+0.17, -0.21), which is significantly belowpredictions from m-sigma and m-l relations and consistent with m_bh = 0, thoughthe presence of a double bar in this galaxy may present problems for ouraxisymmetric code.

0902.0017	detection of a distinct pseudobulge hidden inside the "box-shaped bulge"  of ngc 4565	n-body simulations show that "box-shaped bulges" of edge-on galaxies are notbulges at all: they are bars seen side-on. the two components that we readilysee in edge-on sb galaxies like ngc 4565 are a disk and a bar, but face-on sbbgalaxies always show a disk, a bar, and a (pseudo)bulge. where is the(pseudo)bulge in ngc 4565? we use archival hubble space telescope k-band andspitzer space telescope 3.6 um images to penetrate the dust in ngc 4565. wefind a high surface brightness, central stellar component, distinct from theboxy bar and from the galaxy's disk. its minor-axis profile has a sersic indexof 1.33+/-0.12, so it is a pseudobulge. the pseudobulge has the smallest scaleheight (~90 pc) of any component in the galaxy, in contrast to ~740 pc for theboxy bar plus thin disk. the disky pseudobulge is also much less luminous thanthe boxy bar, so the true (pseudo)bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the galaxyis much less than previously thought. we infer that the pseudobulge-to-totalluminosity ratios of edge-on galaxies with box-shaped bulges have generallybeen overestimated. therefore more galaxies than we have recognized containlittle or no evidence of a merger-built classical bulge. this challenges ourpicture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering, because it is difficultto grow big galaxies without also making a big classical bulge. solving thepuzzle of the "missing pseudobulge" in ngc 4565 further increases ourconfidence that we understand box-shaped bulges correctly as edge-on bars. thissupports our developing picture of the formation of pseudobulges -- bothedge-on bars and disky central components -- by secular evolution in isolatedgalaxies.

0903.4897	the m-sigma and m-l relations in galactic bulges and determinations of  their intrinsic scatter	we derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black holemass (m_bh) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity(l) (the m-sigma and m-l relations), based on 49 m_bh measurements and 19 upperlimits. particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter(epsilon_0) in both relations. we find log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta *log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/-0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.23 +/-0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. the results forellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatterrecovered for spirals is significantly larger. the scatter inferred reinforcesthe need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass functionbased on the m-sigma relation, and further implies that there may besubstantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the m-sigma relation.we estimate the m-l relationship as log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta * log(l_v/ 10^11 l_sun,v) of (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18,0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. these results appear to beinsensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and thedistribution of intrinsic scatter. we show that culling the sample according tothe resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations tolarger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

0907.1652	an improved black hole mass - bulge luminosity relationship for agns	two effects have substantially increased the scatter in the agn black holemass - host galaxy bulge luminosity relationship derived from sdss spectra. thefirst is that at a fixed black hole mass, the sdss spectrum depends strongly onredshift because an sdss fiber sees a larger fraction of the total light ofmore distant galaxies. the second is that at a given redshift, the fraction ofhost-galaxy light in the fiber increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity. weillustrate the latter effect using the kormendy et al. (2009) light profiles ofvirgo ellipticals. with allowance for the two effects, we obtain a black holemass - bulge luminosity relationship for agns which has a scatter of only +/-0.23 dex in mass. this is less than the scatter found for inactive galaxies,and is consistent with the measuring errors. we show that there is acorrespondingly tight linear relationship between the fraction of host galaxylight in agn spectra and the eddington ratio. this linearity implies that at agiven black hole mass, the host luminosities of high-accretion-rate agns(nls1s) and low-accretion-rate agns are similar. the relationship between thefraction of host galaxy light and the eddington ratio provides a simple meansof estimating the fraction of host galaxy light in agn spectra. this means thatthe real amplitude of variability of low-accretion-rate agns is increasedrelative to nls1s.

0908.1109	kinematics at the edge of the galactic bulge: evidence for cylindrical  rotation	we present new results from brava, a large scale radial velocity survey ofthe galactic bulge, using m giant stars selected from the two micron all skysurvey catalogue as targets for the cerro tololo inter-american observatory 4mhydra multi-object spectrograph. the purpose of this survey is to construct anew generation of self-consistent bar models that conform to theseobservations. we report the dynamics for fields at the edge of the galacticbulge at latitudes b=-8 deg. and compare to the dynamics at b=-4 deg. we findthat the rotation curve v(r) is the same at b=-8 deg. as at b=-4 deg. that is,the galactic boxy bulge rotates cylindrically, as do boxy bulges of othergalaxies. the summed line of sight velocity distribution at b=-8 deg. isgaussian, and the binned longitude-velocity plot shows no evidence for either a(disk) population with cold dynamics or for a (classical bulge) population withhot dynamics. the observed kinematics are well modeled by an edge-on n-bodybar, in agreement with published structural evidence. our kinematicobservations indicate that the galactic bulge is a prototypical product ofsecular evolution in galaxy disks, in contrast with stellar population resultsthat are most easily understood if major mergers were the dominant formationprocess.

1005.0385	our milky way as a pure-disk galaxy -- a challenge for galaxy formation	bulges are commonly believed to form in the dynamical violence of galaxycollisions and mergers. here we model the stellar kinematics of the bulgeradial velocity assay (brava), and find no sign that the milky way contains aclassical bulge formed by scrambling pre-existing disks of stars in majormergers. rather, the bulge appears to be a bar, seen somewhat end-on, as hintedfrom its asymmetric boxy shape. we construct a simple but realistic n-bodymodel of the galaxy that self-consistently develops a bar. the bar immediatelybuckles and thickens in the vertical direction. as seen from the sun, theresult resembles the boxy bulge of our galaxy. the model fits the brava stellarkinematic data covering the whole bulge strikingly well with no need for amerger-made classical bulge. the bar in our best fit model has a half-length of~ 4kpc and extends 20 degrees from the sun-galactic center line. we use the newkinematic constraints to show that any classical bulge contribution cannot belarger than ~ 8% of the disk mass. thus the galactic bulge is a part of thedisk and not a separate component made in a prior merger. giant, pure-diskgalaxies like our own present a major challenge to the standard picture inwhich galaxy formation is dominated by hierarchical clustering and galaxymergers.

1005.1647	detection of a pseudobulge hidden inside the "box-shaped bulge" of ngc  4565	numerical simulations show that box-shaped bulges of edge-on galaxies are notbulges: they are bars seen side-on. therefore the two components that are seenin edge-on sb galaxies such as ngc 4565 are a disk and a bar. but face-on sbbgalaxies always show a disk, a bar, and a (pseudo)bulge. where is the(pseudo)bulge in ngc 4565? we use archival hubble space telescope h-band imagesand spitzer space telescope 3.6 micron wavelength images, both calibrated to2mass k_s band, to penetrate the prominent dust lane in ngc 4565. we find ahigh surface brightness, central stellar component that is clearly distinctfrom the boxy bar and from the disk. its brightness profile is a sersicfunction with index n = 1.55 +- 0.07 along the major axis and 1.33 +- 0.12along the minor axis. therefore it is a pseudobulge. it is much less luminousthan the boxy bar, so the true pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio of thegalaxy is pb/t = 0.06 +- 0.01, much less than the previously believed value ofb/t = 0.4 for the boxy bulge. we infer that published b/t luminosity ratios ofedge-on galaxies with boxy bulges have been overestimated. therefore, moregalaxies than we thought contain little or no evidence of a merger-builtclassical bulge. from a formation point of view, ngc 4565 is a giant, pure-diskgalaxy. this presents a challenge to our picture of galaxy formation byhierarchical clustering: it is difficult to grow galaxies as big as ngc 4565without also making big classical bulges.

0708.2104	internal secular evolution in disk galaxies: the growth of pseudobulges	observational and theoretical evidence that internal, slow ("secular")evolution reshapes galaxy disks is reviewed in kormendy &amp; kennicutt (2004,araa, 42, 603). this update has three aims. first, i emphasize that thisevolution is very general -- it is as fundamental to the evolution of galaxydisks as (e.g.) core collapse is to globular clusters, as the production of hotjupiters is to the evolution of protoplanetary disks, and as evolution to redgiants containing proto-white-dwarfs is to stellar evolution. one consequencefor disk galaxies is the buildup of dense central components that get mistakenfor classical (i.e., merger-built) bulges but that were grown out of disk starsand gas. we call these pseudobulges. second, i review new results onpseudobulge star formation and structure and on the distinction between boxyand disky pseudobulges. finally, i highlight how these results make a galaxyformation problem more acute. how can hierarchical clustering produce so manypure disk galaxies with no evidence for merger-built bulges?

1009.3015	bulgeless giant galaxies challenge our picture of galaxy formation by  hierarchical clustering	we dissect giant sc-scd galaxies with hubble space telescope photometry andhobby-eberly telescope spectroscopy. we use het's high resolution spectrograph(resolution = 15,000) to measure stellar velocity dispersions in the nuclearstar clusters and pseudobulges of the pure-disk galaxies m33, m101, ngc 3338,ngc 3810, ngc 6503, and ngc 6946. we conclude: (1) upper limits on the massesof any supermassive black holes are mbh &lt;= (2.6+-0.5) * 10**6 m_sun in m101 andmbh &lt;= (2.0+-0.6) * 10**6 m_sun in ngc 6503. (2) hst photometry shows that theabove galaxies contain tiny pseudobulges that make up &lt;~ 3 % of the stellarmass but no classical bulges. we inventory a sphere of radius 8 mpc centered onour galaxy to see whether giant, pure-disk galaxies are common or rare. in thisvolume, 11 of 19 galaxies with rotation velocity &gt; 150 km/s show no evidencefor a classical bulge. four may contain small classical bulges that contribute5-12% of the galaxy light. only 4 of the 19 giant galaxies are ellipticals orhave classical bulges that contribute 1/3 of the galaxy light. so pure-diskgalaxies are far from rare. it is hard to understand how they could form as thequiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories. recognition ofpseudobulges makes the biggest problem with cold dark matter galaxy formationmore acute: how can hierarchical clustering make so many giant, pure-diskgalaxies with no evidence for merger-built bulges? this problem dependsstrongly on environment: the virgo cluster is not a puzzle, because &gt;2/3 of itsstellar mass is in merger remnants.

0709.0585	the black hole mass and extreme orbital structure in ngc1399	the largest galaxies, and in particular central galaxies in clusters, offerunique insight into understanding the mechanism for the growth of nuclear blackholes. we present hubble space telescope kinematics for ngc1399, the centralgalaxy in fornax. we find the best-fit model contains a black hole of 5.1 +-0.7x 10^8 msun (at a distance of 21.1 mpc), a factor of over 2 below thecorrelation of black hole mass and velocity dispersion. we also find a dramaticsignature for central tangential anisotropy. the velocity profiles on adjacentsides 0.5" away from the nucleus show strong bimodality, and the centralspectrum shows a large drop in the dispersion. both of these observations pointto an orbital distribution that is tangentially biased. the best-fit orbitalmodel suggests a ratio of the tangential to radial internal velocitydispersions of three. this ratio is the largest seen in any galaxy to date andwill provide an important measure for the mode by which the central black holehas grown.

1101.3781	supermassive black holes do not correlate with galaxy disks or  pseudobulges	the masses of supermassive black holes are known to correlate with theproperties of the bulge components of their host galaxies. in contrast, theyappear not to correlate with galaxy disks. disk-grown pseudobulges areintermediate in properties between bulges and disks. it has been unclearwhether they do or do not correlate with black holes in the same way thatbulges do, because too few pseudobulges were classified to provide a clearresult. at stake are conclusions about which parts of galaxies coevolve withblack holes, possibly by being regulated by energy feedback from black holes.here we report pseudobulge classifications for galaxies with dynamicallydetected black holes and combine them with recent measurements of velocitydispersions in the biggest bulgeless galaxies. these data confirm that blackholes do not correlate with disks and show that they correlate little or not atall with pseudobulges. we suggest that there are two different modes of blackhole feeding. black holes in bulges grow rapidly to high masses when mergersdrive gas infall that feeds quasar-like events. in contrast, small black holesin bulgeless galaxies and galaxies with pseudobulges grow as low-levelseyferts. growth of the former is driven by global processes, so the biggestblack holes coevolve with bulges, but growth of the latter is driven locallyand stochastically, and they do not coevolve with disks and pseudobulges.

1101.4650	supermassive black holes do not correlate with dark matter halos of  galaxies	supermassive black holes have been detected in all galaxies that containbulge components when the galaxies observed were close enough so that thesearches were feasible. together with the observation that bigger black holeslive in bigger bulges, this has led to the belief that black hole growth andbulge formation regulate each other. that is, black holes and bulges"coevolve". therefore, reports of a similar correlation between black holes andthe dark matter halos in which visible galaxies are embedded have profoundimplications. dark matter is likely to be nonbaryonic, so these reports suggestthat unknown, exotic physics controls black hole growth. here we show - basedin part on recent measurements of bulgeless galaxies - that there is almost nocorrelation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unlessthe galaxy also contains a bulge. we conclude that black holes do not correlatedirectly with dark matter. they do not correlate with galaxy disks, either.therefore black holes coevolve only with bulges. this simplifies the puzzle oftheir coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in thegalaxy mergers that make bulges.

1107.1238	orbit-based dynamical models of the sombrero galaxy (ngc 4594)	we present axisymmetric, orbit-based models to study the central black hole,stellar mass-to-light ratio, and dark matter halo of ngc 4594 (m104, thesombrero galaxy). for stellar kinematics, we use published high-resolutionkinematics of the central region taken with the hubble space telescope, newlyobtained gemini long-slit spectra of the major axis, and integral fieldkinematics from the sauron instrument. at large radii, we use globular clusterkinematics to trace the mass profile and apply extra leverage to recovering thedark matter halo parameters. we find a black hole of mass m_{\bullet}=(6.6 +/-0.4) x 10^8 m_{\odot}, and determine the stellar m/l_i=3.4 +/- 0.05(uncertainties are the 68% confidence band marginalized over the otherparameters). our best fit dark matter halo is a cored logarithmic model withasymptotic circular speed v_c=376 +/- 12 km/s and core radius r_c= 4.7 +/- 0.6kpc. the fraction of dark to total mass contained within the half-light radiusis 0.52. taking the bulge and disk components into account in our calculationof \sigma_e puts ngc 4594 squarely on the m-\sigma relation. we also determinethat ngc 4594 lies directly on the m-l relation.

1110.4384	a revised parallel-sequence morphological classification of galaxies:  structure and formation of s0 and spheroidal galaxies	we update van den bergh's parallel sequence galaxy classification in which s0galaxies form a sequence s0a-s0b-s0c that parallels the sequence sa-sb-sc ofspiral galaxies. the ratio b/t of bulge to total light defines the position ofa galaxy in each sequence. our classification makes one improvement. we extendthe s0a-s0b-s0c sequence to spheroidal ("sph'") galaxies that are positioned inparallel to irregular galaxies in a similarly extended sa-sb-sc-im sequence.this provides a natural "home" for spheroidals, which previously were omittedfrom galaxy classifications. to motivate our juxtaposition of sph and irregulargalaxies, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of virgo s0s,including late-type s0s that bridge the gap between s0b and sph galaxies. ngc4762 is a sb0bc with b/t = 0.13. ngc 4452 is a sb0c galaxy with an even tinierpseudobulge. vcc 2048 and ngc 4638 have properties of both s0cs and sphs. weupdate the structural parameter correlations sphs, irregulars, bulges, anddisks. we show that spheroidals of increasing luminosity form a continuoussequence with the disks (but not bulges) of s0c-s0b-s0a galaxies. remarkably,the sph--s0-disk sequence is almost identical to that of irregular galaxies andspiral galaxy disks. we review published observations for galaxy transformationprocesses, particularly ram-pressure stripping of cold gas. we suggest that sphgalaxies are transformed, "red and dead" scd--im galaxies in the same way thatmany s0 galaxies are transformed, red and dead sa-sc spiral galaxies

1112.1419	the cluster of blue stars surrounding the m31 nuclear black hole	we obtained u_330 and b band images of the m31 nucleus using the highresolution camera of the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble spacetelescope (hst). the spatial resolution in the u_330-band, 0.03" fwhm, or 0.1pc at m31, is sufficient to resolve the outskirts of the compact cluster (p3)of uv-bright stars surrounding the m31 black hole. the center of the cluster ismarked by an extended source that is both brighter and redder than the otherpoint sources within p3; it is likely to be a blend of several bright stars. wehypothesize that it marks the location of the m31 black hole. both stellarphotometry and a surface brightness fluctuation analysis, show that the p3stellar population is consistent with early-type main sequence stars formed ina ~100 - ~200 myr old starburst population. evolutionary tracks of post earlyasymptotic giant-branch stars, associated with late-stage evolution of an oldpopulation, also traverse the u and u-b domain occupied by the p3 stars; but weargue that only a few stars could be accounted for that way. peagb evolution isvery rapid, and there is no progenitor population of red giants associated withp3. the result that p3 comprises young stars is consistent with inferences fromearlier hst observations of the integrated light of the cluster. like the milkyway, m31 harbors a black hole closely surrounded by apparently young stars.

1205.6876	two pseudobulges in the "boxy bulge" galaxy ngc 5746	galaxy formation and growth under the {\lambda}cdm paradigm is expected toproceed in a hierarchical, bottom-up fashion by which small galaxies grow intolarge galaxies; this mechanism leaves behind large "classical bulges"kinematically distinct from "pseudobulges" grown by internal, secularprocesses. we use archival data (spitzer 3.6 \mum wavelength, hubble spacetelescope h-band, two micron all sky survey ks-band, and sloan digital skysurvey gri-band) to measure composite minor- and major-axis surface brightnessprofiles of the almost-edgeon spiral galaxy ngc 5746. these light profiles spana large range of radii and surface brightnesses to reveal an inner, highsurface brightness stellar component that is distinct from the well-known boxybulge. it is well fitted by s\'ersic functions with indices n = 0.99 \pm 0.08and 1.17 \pm 0.24 along the minor and major axes, respectively. since n &lt; 2, weconclude that this innermost component is a secularly-evolved pseudobulge thatis distinct from the boxy pseudobulge. this inner pseduobulge makes up 0.136\pm 0.019 of the total light of the galaxy. it is therefore considerably lessluminous than the boxy structure, which is now understood to be a bar seennearly end-on. the infrared imagery shows further evidence for secularevolution in the form of a bright inner ring of inner radius 9.1 kpc and width1.6 kpc. ngc 5746 is therefore a giant, pure-disk sb(r)bc galaxy with no signof a merger-built bulge. we do not understand how such galaxies form in a{\lambda}cdm universe.

1304.7762	coevolution (or not) of supermassive black holes and host galaxies	we review the observed demographics and inferred evolution of supermassiveblack holes (bhs) found by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics.most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between bh mass andthe velocity dispersion of the host-galaxy bulge. it and other correlations ledto the belief that bhs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth.new results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and moreplausible picture in which bhs correlate differently with different galaxycomponents. bhs are found in pure-disk galaxies, so classical(elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary to grow bhs. but bhs do notcorrelate with galaxy disks. and any correlations with disk-grown pseudobulgesor halo dark matter are so weak as to imply no close coevolution. we suggestthat there are four regimes of bh feedback. 1- local, stochastic feeding ofsmall bhs in mainly bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result incoevolution. 2- global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers grows giant bhs inshort, quasar-like "agn" events whose feedback does affect galaxies. this makesclassical bulges and coreless-rotating ellipticals. 3- at the highest bhmasses, maintenance-mode feedback into x-ray gas has the negative effect ofhelping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas. this happens in giant,core-nonrotating ellipticals. they inherit coevolution magic from smallerprogenitors. 4- independent of any feedback physics, the averaging that resultsfrom successive mergers helps to engineer tight bh correlations.

1311.2609	secular evolution in disk galaxies	self-gravitating systems evolve toward the most tightly bound configurationthat is reachable via available evolution processes. the inner parts shrink andthe outer parts expand, provided that some physical process transports energyor angular momentum outward. the evolution of stars, star clusters,protostellar and protoplanetary disks, black hole accretion disks, and galaxydisks are all fundamentally similar. these processes for galaxy disks are thesubjects of my lectures and of this canary islands winter school. part 1discusses formation, growth, and death of bars. part 2 details the slow("secular") rearrangement of angular momentum that results from interactionsbetween stars or gas and nonaxisymmetries such as bars. we have a heuristicunderstanding of how this forms outer rings, inner rings, and stuff dumped intothe center. observations show that barred galaxies have central concentrationsof gas and star formation. timescales imply that they grow central"pseudobulges" that get mistaken for elliptical-galaxy-like classical bulgesbut that formed gently out of disks. part 3 shows how we distinguish betweenclassical and pseudo bulges. part 4 reviews how environmental secular evolutiontransforms gas-rich, star-forming spirals and irregulars into gas-poor, red anddead s0 and spheroidal ("sph") galaxies. sphs are not ellipticals; they havestructural parameters like those of low-luminosity s+im galaxies. so sphs arebulgeless s0s. part 5 combines hierarchical clustering and secular evolutioninto a comprehensive picture.

1405.1421	structure and evolution of dwarf galaxies	different structural parameter correlations show how classical bulgecomponents and elliptical galaxies are different from spiral and s0 galaxydisks, irregular (im) galaxies, and spheroidal (sph) galaxies. in contrast, thelatter, apparently diverse galaxies or galaxy components have almost identicalparameter correlations. this shows that they are related. a review of galaxytransformation processes suggests that s0 and spheroidal galaxies arestar-formation-quenched, "red and dead" versions of spiral and im galaxies. inparticular, sph galaxies are bulgeless s0s. this motivates a parallel sequencegalaxy classification in which an s0a-s0b-s0c-sph sequence of decreasingbulge-to-total ratios is juxtaposed to an sa-sb-sc-im sequence of star-forminggalaxies. all parameter sequences show a complete continuity from giantgalaxies to the tiniest dwarfs. dwarfs are not a new or different class ofgalaxies. rather, they are the extreme products of transformation processesthat get more important as gravitational potential wells get more shallow.smaller sph and s+im galaxies have lower stellar densities because they retainfewer baryons. comparison of the baryonic parameter correlations with those fordark matter halos allows us to estimate baryon loss as a function of galaxymass. extreme dwarfs are almost completely dominated by dark matter.

(1) we show that spiral, im, and sphgalaxies with absolute magnitudes m_v &gt; -18 form a sequence of decreasingbaryon-to-dm surface density with decreasing luminosity. we suggest that thisis a sequence of decreasing baryon retention vs. supernova-driven losses ordecreasing baryon capture after cosmological reionization. (2) the structuraldifferences between s+im and sph galaxies are small. both are affected mostlyby the physics that controls baryon depletion. (3) there is a linearcorrelation between the maximum rotation velocities of baryonic disks and theouter circular velocities v_circ of test particles in their dm halos. baryonsbecome unimportant at v_circ = 42+-4 km/s. smaller galaxies are dim or dark.(4) we find that, before baryon "loss", dsph galaxies were brighter by ~4 magand dim galaxies were brighter by ~3.5 mag. both have dm halos that are massiveenough to help to solve the "too big to fail" problem with dm galaxy formation.(5) we suggest that there exist many galaxies that are too dark to bediscovered by current techniques, as required by cold dm theory.

1503.03873	the event horizon of m87	the 6 billion solar mass supermassive black hole at the center of the giantelliptical galaxy m87 powers a relativistic jet. observations at millimeterwavelengths with the event horizon telescope have localized the emission fromthe base of this jet to angular scales comparable to the putative black holehorizon. the jet might be powered directly by an accretion disk or byelectromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole. however,even the latter mechanism requires a confining thick accretion disk to maintainthe required magnetic flux near the black hole. therefore, regardless of thejet mechanism, the observed jet power in m87 implies a certain minimum massaccretion rate. if the central compact object in m87 were not a black hole buthad a surface, this accretion would result in considerable thermalnear-infrared and optical emission from the surface. current flux limits on thenucleus of m87 strongly constrain any such surface emission. this rules out thepresence of a surface and thereby provides indirect evidence for an eventhorizon.

1504.03330	elliptical galaxies and bulges of disk galaxies: summary of progress and  outstanding issues	this is the summary chapter of a review book on galaxy bulges. bulgeproperties and formation histories are more varied than those of ellipticals. iemphasize two advances: 1 - "classical bulges" are observationallyindistinguishable from ellipticals, and like them, are thought to form by majorgalaxy mergers. "disky pseudobulges" are diskier and more actively star-forming(except in s0s) than are ellipticals. theys are products of the slow("secular") evolution of galaxy disks: bars and other nonaxisymmetries movedisk gas toward the center, where it starbursts and builds relatively flat,rapidly rotating components. this secular evolution is a new area of galaxyevolution work that complements hierarchical clustering. 2 - disks ofhigh-redshift galaxies are unstable to the formation of mass clumps that sinkto the center and merge - an alternative channel for the formation of classicalbulges. i review successes and unsolved problems in the formation ofbulges+ellipticals and their coevolution (or not) with supermassive blackholes. i present an observer's perspective on simulations of dark matter galaxyformation including baryons. i review how our picture of the quenching of starformation is becoming general and secure at redshifts z &lt; 1. the biggestchallenge is to produce realistic bulges+ellipticals and disks that overlapover a factor of 10**3 in mass but that differ from each other as observed overthat whole range. second, how does hierarchical clustering make so many giant,bulgeless galaxies in field but not cluster environments? i argue that we relytoo much on agn and star-formation feedback to solve these challenges.

0805.3533	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: ii. 'cusp' ellipticals	we study the origin and properties of 'extra' or 'excess' central light inthe surface brightness profiles of cusp or power-law ellipticals. dissipationalmergers give rise to two-component profiles: an outer profile established byviolent relaxation acting on stars present in the progenitors prior to thefinal merger, and an inner stellar population comprising the extra light,formed in a compact starburst. combining a large set of hydrodynamicalsimulations with data that span a broad range of profiles and masses, we showthat this picture is borne out -- cusp ellipticals are indeed 'extra light'ellipticals -- and examine how the properties of this component scale withglobal galaxy properties. we show how to robustly separate the 'extra' light,and demonstrate that observed cusps are reliable tracers of the degree ofdissipation in the spheroid-forming merger. we show that the typical degree ofdissipation is a strong function of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gasfractions at each mass. we demonstrate a correlation between extra lightcontent and effective radius at fixed mass: systems with more dissipation aremore compact. the outer shape of the light profile does not depend on mass,with a mean outer sersic index ~2.5. we explore how this relates to shapes,kinematics, and stellar population gradients. simulations with the gas contentneeded to match observed profiles also reproduce observed age, metallicity, andcolor gradients, and we show how these can be used as tracers of the degree ofdissipation in spheroid formation.

0806.2325	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: iii. 'core' ellipticals  and 'missing' light	we investigate how 'extra' central light in the surface brightness profilesof cusp ellipticals relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. cuspelliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting onstars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipationalstarbursts. core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)cusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve acompact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).comparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how toobservationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals. wedemonstrate that these survive re-mergers and reliably trace the dissipation inthe initial gas-rich merger(s). the typical degree of dissipation is a strongfunction of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions. we find acorrelation between dissipation and effective radius: systems with moredissipation are more compact. the survival of this component and scattering ofstars into the envelope naturally explain high-sersic index profilescharacteristic of massive core ellipticals. this is also closely related to thekinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst componentsfrom their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/coreellipticals. we show that it is critical to adopt physically motivated profileswhen attempting to quantify how much mass has been 'scoured' or scattered outof the inner regions by binary black holes. estimates of scoured mass ignoringmulti-component structure can be strongly biased, potentially explainingobserved systems with large inferred core masses in apparent conflict withcore-scouring models.

0807.0040	bulge n and b/t in high mass galaxies: constraints on the origin of  bulges in hierarchical models	we use the bulge sersic index n and bulge-to-total ratio (b/t) to explore thefundamental question of how bulges form. we perform 2d bulge-disk-bardecomposition on h-band images of 143 bright, high stellar mass (&gt;1.0e10 solarmasses) low-to-moderately inclined (i&lt;70 degrees) spirals. our results are: (1)our h-band bar fraction (~58%) is consistent with that from ellipse fits. (2)70% of the stellar mass is in disks, 10% in bars, and 20% in bulges. (3) alarge fraction (~69%) of bright spirals have b/t&lt;0.2, and ~76% have low n&lt;2bulges. these bulges exist in barred and unbarred galaxies across a wide rangeof hubble types. (4) about 65% (68%) of bright spirals with n&lt;2 (b/t&lt;0.2)bulges host bars, suggesting a possible link between bars and bulges. (5) wecompare the results with predictions from a set of lcdm models. in the models,a high mass spiral can have a bulge with a present-day low b/t&lt;0.2 only if itdid not undergo a major merger since z&lt;2. the predicted fraction (~1.6%) ofhigh mass spirals, which have undergone a major merger since z&lt;4 and host abulge with a present-day low b/t&lt;0.2, is a factor of over thirty smaller thanthe observed fraction (~66%) of high mass spirals with b/t&lt;0.2. thus, contraryto common perception, bulges built via major mergers since z&lt;4 seriously failto account for the bulges present in ~66% of high mass spirals. most of thesepresent-day low b/t&lt;0.2 bulges are likely to have been built by a combinationof minor mergers and/or secular processes since z&lt;4.

astro-ph;0606739	the masses of nuclear black holes in luminous elliptical galaxies and  implications for the space density of the most massive black holes	black hole masses predicted from the mbh-sigma relationship conflict withthose predicted from the mbh-l relationship for the most luminous galaxies,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). this is because stellar velocitydispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with l for bcgs and other giantellipticals. the mbh-l relationship predicts that the most luminous bcgs mayhave mbh approaching 10^{10}m_sol, while the m-sigma relationship alwayspredicts mbh&lt;3x10^9m_sol. we argue that the mbh-l relationship is a plausibleor even preferred description for bcgs and other galaxies of similarluminosity. if cores in central stellar density are formed by binary bhs, thenthe inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of mbh.using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxiesobserved by hst, we argue that l is superior to sigma as an indicator ofr_gamma in luminous galaxies. the observed r_gamma-mbh relationship for 11 coregalaxies with measured mbh appears to be consistent with the mbh-l relationshipfor bcgs. bcgs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities thatmay be difficult to generate with the modest bh masses inferred from thembh-sigma relationship. mbh~l may be expected to hold for bcgs, if they wereformed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of bh to stellarmass. this picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigmawith l and the more rapid increase in effective radii with l seen in bcgs. ifbcgs have large bhs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local bhmass function for mbh&gt;3x10^9m_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richerthan that inferred from the mbh-sigma relationship. the volume density of qsosat earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the mbh-l relationship.

astro-ph;9604092	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst iii: non-parametric recovery  of stellar luminosity distributions	we have non-parametrically determined the luminosity density profiles andtheir logarithmic slopes for 42 early-type galaxies observed with hst. assumingthat the isodensity contours are spheroidal, then the luminosity density isuniquely determined from the surface brightness data through the abel equation.for nearly all the galaxies in our sample, the logarithmic slope of theluminosity density measured at 0.1" (the innermost reliable measurement withthe uncorrected hst) is significantly different from zero; i.e. most ellipticalgalaxies have cusps. there are only two galaxies for which an analytic corecannot be excluded. the distribution of logarithmic slopes at 0.1" appears tobe bimodal, confirming the conclusion of lauer et al. (1995) that early-typegalaxies can be divided into two types based on their surface-brightnessprofiles; i.e., those with cuspy cores and those whose steep power-law profilescontinue essentially unchanged in to the resolution limit. the peaks in theslope distribution occur at -0.8 and -1.9. more than half of the galaxies haveslopes steeper than -1.0. taken together with the recent theoretical work ofmerritt &amp; fridman, these results suggest that many (and maybe most) ellipticalgalaxies are either nearly axisymmetric or spherical near the center, or slowlyevolve due to the influence of stochastic orbits.

astro-ph;9610055	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst. iv. central parameter  relations	we analyze hubble space telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hot galaxies). luminous hot galaxieshave cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r ~ r_b toshallow inner profiles with logslope less than 0.3. faint hot galaxies showsteep, largely featureless power-law profiles at all radii and lack cores. thecenters of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass andluminosity than the cores of large galaxies at a limiting radius of 10 pc. atintermediate magnitudes (-22.0 &lt; m_v &lt; -20.5), core and power-law galaxiescoexist, and there is a range in r_b at a given luminosity of at least twoorders of magnitude. central properties correlate with global rotation andshape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-lawgalaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. the dense power-law centers ofdisky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-richmergers. the parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products ofgas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. for example, core galaxies accretesmall, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-densitycores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. an alternative modelfor core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (bhs): thebh may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any existsand scouring out a core. an average bh mass per spheroid of 0.002 times thestellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii ofobserved cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of agns andkinematic detections of bhs in nearby galaxies.
