1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1203.5828	connecting stellar mass and star-formation rate to dark matter halo mass  out to z ~ 2	we have constructed an extended halo model (ehm) which relates the totalstellar mass and star-formation rate (sfr) to halo mass (m_h). an empiricalrelation between the distribution functions of total stellar mass of galaxiesand host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial density of galaxies over 0&lt;z&lt;2and the clustering properties at z~0, is extended to include two differentscenarios describing the variation of sfr on m_h. we also present newmeasurements of the redshift evolution of the average sfr for star-forminggalaxies of different stellar mass up to z=2, using data from the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) for infrared-bright galaxies.  combining the ehm with the halo accretion histories from numericalsimulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history inhalos spanning a range of masses. we find that: (1) the intensity of thestar-forming activity in halos in the probed mass range has steadily decreasedfrom z~2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, halos in the mass range between a fewtimes 10^{11} m_sun and a few times 10^{12} m_sun are the most efficient athosting star formation; (3) the peak of sfr density shifts to lower mass halosover time; (4) galaxies that are forming stars most actively at z~2 evolve intoquiescent galaxies in today's group environments, strongly supporting previousclaims that the most powerful starbursts at z~2 are progenitors of today'selliptical galaxies.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1304.4593	far-ir emission from dust-obscured galaxies	dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) are a uv-faint, ir-bright galaxy populationthat reside at z~2 and are believed to be in a phase of dusty star-forming andagn activity. we present far-ir observations of a complete sample of dogs inthe 2 deg2 of cosmos. the 3077 dogs have &lt;z&gt;=1.9+/-0.3 and are selected from24um and r+ observations using a color cut of r+ - [24]&gt;=7.5 (ab mag) ands24&gt;=100ujy. based on the near-ir seds, 47% are star-formation dominated and10% are agn-dominated. we use spire far-ir photometry from hermes to calculatethe ir luminosity and characteristic dust temperature for the 1572 (51%) dogsthat are detected at 250um (&gt;=3{\sigma}). for the remaining 1505 (49%) that areundetected, we perform a median stacking analysis to probe fainterluminosities. detected and undetected dogs have average ir luminosities of(2.8+/-0.4) x 1012 lsun and (0.77+-0.08)x10^12lsun, and dust temperatures of34+/-7 k and 37+/-3 k, respectively. the ir luminosity function of dogs withs24&gt;=100ujy is calculated, using far-ir observations and stacking. dogscontribute 10-30% to the total star formation rate density of the universe atz=1.5-2.5, dominated by 250um detected and bump dogs. for comparison, dogscontribute 30% to the star-formation rate density of the universe for allgalaxies at z=1.5-2.5 with s24&gt;=100ujy. dogs have a large scatter about thestar-formation main sequence and their specific star-formation rates show thatthe observed phase of star-formation could be responsible for their observedstellar mass at z~2.

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1311.5758	hermes: clusters of dusty galaxies uncovered by herschel and planck	the potential for planck to detect clusters of dusty, star-forming galaxiesat z greater than 1 is tested by examining the herschel-spire images of planckearly release compact source catalog (ercsc) sources lying in fields observedby the hermes survey. of the 16 planck sources that lie in the roughly 90 sq.deg. examined, we find that twelve are associated with single bright herschelsources. the remaining four are associated with overdensities of herschelsources, making them candidate clusters of dusty, starforming galaxies. we usecomplementary optical and nir data for these clumps to test this idea, and findevidence for the presence of galaxy clusters in all four cases. we usephotometric redshifts and red sequence galaxies to estimate the redshifts ofthese clusters, finding that they range from 0.8 to 2.3. these redshifts implythat the herschel sources in these clusters, which contribute to the detectedplanck flux, are forming stars very rapidly, with typical total cluster starformation rates greater than 1000msun per yr. the high redshift clustersdiscovered in these observations are used to constrain the epoch of clustergalaxy formation, finding that the galaxies in our clusters are 1 to 1.5 gy oldat z about 1 to 2. prospects for the discovery of further clusters of dustygalaxies are discussed, using not only all sky planck surveys, but also deeper,smaller area, herschel surveys.

1312.5347	cosmic star formation probed via parametric stack-fitting of known  sources to radio imaging	the promise of multi-wavelength astronomy has been tempered by the largedisparity in sensitivity and resolution between different wavelength regimes.here we present a statistical approach which attempts to overcome this byfitting parametric models directly to image data. specifically, we fit a modelfor the radio luminosity function (lf) of star-forming galaxies to pixelintensity distributions at 1.4 ghz coincident with near-ir selected sources incosmos. taking a mass-limited sample in redshift bins across the range $0&lt;z&lt;4$we are able to fit the radio lf with ~0.2 dex precision in the key parameters(e.g. phi*,l*). good agreement is seen between our results and those usingstandard methods at radio and other wavelengths. integrating our luminosityfunctions to get the star formation rate density we find that galaxies with astellar mass greater than $10^{9.5}\,$m$_{\odot}$ contribute at least 50 percent of cosmic star formation at since $z=4$. the scalability of our approachis empirically estimated, with the precision in lf parameter estimates found toscale with the number of sources in the stack as $\sqrt{n}$. this type ofapproach will be invaluable in the multi-wavelength analysis of upcomingsurveys with the ska pathfinder facilities; lofar, askap and meerkat.

1407.4511	linking the x-ray and infrared properties of star-forming galaxies at  z&lt;1.5	we present the most complete study to date of the x-ray emission fromstar-formation in high redshift (median z=0.7; z&lt;1.5), ir-luminous(l_ir=10^10-10^13 l_sun) galaxies detected by herschel's pacs and spireinstruments. for our purpose we take advantage of the deepest x-ray data todate, the chandra deep fields (north and south). sources which host agn areremoved from our analysis by means of multiple agn indicators. we find an agnfraction of 18+/-2 per cent amongst our sample and note that agn entirelydominate at values of log[l_x/l_ir]&gt;-3 in both hard and soft x-ray bands. fromthe sources which are star-formation dominated, only a small fraction areindividually x-ray detected and for the bulk of the sample we calculate averagex-ray luminosities through stacking. we find an average soft x-ray to infraredratio of log[l_sx/l_ir]=-4.3 and an average hard x-ray to infrared ratio oflog[l_hx/l_ir]=-3.8. we report that the x-ray/ir correlation is approximatelylinear through the entire range of l_ir and z probed and, although broadlyconsistent with the local (z&lt;0.1) one, it does display some discrepancies. wesuggest that these discrepancies are unlikely to be physical, i.e. due to anintrinsic change in the x-ray properties of star-forming galaxies with cosmictime, as there is no significant evidence for evolution of the l_x/l_ir ratiowith redshift. instead they are possibly due to selection effects and remainingagn contamination. we also examine whether dust obscuration in the galaxy playsa role in attenuating x-rays from star-formation, by investigating changes inthe l_x/l_ir ratio as a function of the average dust temperature. we concludethat x-rays do not suffer any measurable attenuation in the host galaxy.

1504.05256	hermes: alma imaging of herschel-selected dusty star-forming galaxies	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) has identified largenumbers of dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) over a wide range in redshift. adetailed understanding of these dsfgs is hampered by the limited spatialresolution of herschel. we present 870um 0.45" resolution imaging from theatacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) of 29 hermes dsfgs withfar-infrared (fir) flux densities in between the brightest of sources found byherschel and fainter dsfgs found in ground-based sub-millimeter (sub-mm)surveys. we identify 62 sources down to the 5-sigma point-source sensitivitylimit in our alma sample (sigma~0.2mjy), of which 6 are strongly lensed(showing multiple images) and 36 experience significant amplification (mu&gt;1.1).to characterize the properties of the alma sources, we introduce and make useof uvmcmcfit, a publicly available markov chain monte carlo analysis tool forinterferometric observations of lensed galaxies. our lens models tentativelyfavor intrinsic number counts for dsfgs with a steep fall off above 8mjy at880um. nearly 70% of the herschel sources comprise multiple alma counterparts,consistent with previous research indicating that the multiplicity rate is highin bright sub-mm sources. our alma sources are located significantly closer toeach other than expected based on results from theoretical models as well asfainter dsfgs identified in the laboca ecdfs submillimeter survey. the highmultiplicity rate and low projected separations argue in favor of interactionsand mergers driving the prodigious emission from the brightest dsfgs as well asthe sharp downturn above s_880=8mjy.

1507.07044	hermes: disentangling active galactic nuclei and star formation in the  radio source population	we separate the extragalactic radio source population above ~50 ujy intoactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star-forming sources. the primary method ofour approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed using spitzer/irac and mips and herschel/spire photometry, of 380radio sources in the extended chandra deep field-south. from the fitted seds,we determine the relative agn and star-forming contributions to their infraredemission. with the inclusion of other agn diagnostics such as x-ray luminosity,spitzer/irac colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming totalinfrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 ghz flux density, qir, we determine whetherthe radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an agn.the majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an agnat some wavelength. of the sources with agn signatures, 58 per cent are hybridsystems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. thisimplies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their starformation have a high agn fraction. below a 1.4 ghz flux density of 1 mjy,along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from purestar-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20-65 per cent ofthe sources. this result suggests that hybrid sources have a significantcontribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable agn, to theobserved flattening of the source counts at ~1mjy for the extragalactic radiosource population.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0607629	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the luminosity function of  luminous red galaxies to z=0.6	we present new measurements of the luminosity function (lf) of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the 2df-sdss lrgand quasar (2slaq) survey. we have carefully quantified, and corrected for,uncertainties in the k and evolutionary corrections, differences in the colourselection methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus ensuring we arestudying the same galaxy population in both surveys. using a limited subset of6326 sdss lrgs (with 0.17&lt;z&lt;0.24) and 1725 2slaq lrgs (with 0.5 &lt;z&lt;0.6), forwhich the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence forany additional evolution in the lrg lf, over this redshift range, beyond thatexpected from a simple passive evolution model. this lack of additionalevolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of sdss and 2slaqlrgs, brighter than m_r - 5logh = -22.5, which are 2.51+/-0.03 x 10^-7 l_sunmpc^-3 and 2.44+/-0.15 x 10^-7 l_sun mpc^-3 respectively (&lt;10% uncertainty). wecompare our lfs to the combo-17 data and find excellent agreement over the sameredshift range. together, these surveys show no evidence for additionalevolution (beyond passive) in the lf of lrgs brighter than m_r - 5logh = -21(or brighter than l*). we test our sdss and 2slaq lfs against a simple ``drymerger'' model for the evolution of massive red galaxies and find that at leasthalf of the lrgs at z=0.2 must already have been well-assembled (with more thanhalf their stellar mass) by z=0.6. this limit is barely consistent with recentresults from semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.
