0901.2171	a weno algorithm for radiative transfer with resonant scattering: the  time scale of the wouthuysen-field coupling	we develop a numerical solver for the integral-differential equations, whichdescribes the radiative transfer of photon distribution in the frequency spacewith resonant scattering of lyalpha photons by hydrogen gas in the earlyuniverse. the time-dependent solutions of this equation is crucial to theestimation of the effect of the wouthuysen-field (wf) coupling in relation tothe 21 cm emission and absorption at the epoch of reionization. the resonantscattering leads to the photon distribution in the frequency space to bepiecewise smooth containing sharp changes. the weighted essentiallynonoscillatory (weno) scheme is suitable to handle this problem, as thisalgorithm has been found to be highly stable and robust for solving boltzmannequation. we test this numerical solver against analytic solutions of theevolution of the photon distribution in rest background, analytic solution inexpanding background without resonant scattering and formation of localboltzmann distribution around the resonant frequency with the temperature sameas that of atom for recoil. we find that evolution of photon distributionundergoes three phases; profile is similar to the initial one, a flat plateau(without recoil) or local boltzmann distribution (with recoil) forms around theresonant frequency, and finally the distribution around the resonant frequencyis saturated when the photons from the source is balanced by the redshift ofthe expansion. this result indicates that the onset of the w-f coupling shouldnot be determined by the third phase, but by the time scale of the secondphase. we found that the time scale of the w-f coupling is equal to about a fewhundreds of the mean free flight time of photons with resonant frequency, andis independent of the sobolev parameter if this parameter is much less than 1.

0910.4697	a wavelet-galerkin algorithm of the e/b decomposition of cmb  polarization maps	we develop an algorithm of separating the $e$ and $b$ modes of the cmbpolarization from the noisy and discretized maps of stokes parameter $q$ and$u$ in a finite area. a key step of the algorithm is to take a wavelet-galerkindiscretization of the differential relation between the $e$, $b$ and $q$, $u$fields. this discretization allows derivative operator to be represented by amatrix, which is exactly diagonal in scale space, and narrowly banded inspatial space. we show that the effect of boundary can be eliminated bydropping a few dwt modes located on or nearby the boundary. this method revealsthat the derivative operators will cause large errors in the $e$ and $b$ powerspectra on small scales if the $q$ and $u$ maps contain gaussian noise. it alsoreveals that if the $q$ and $u$ maps are random, these fields lead to themixing of the $e$ and $b$ modes. consequently, the $b$ mode will becontaminated if the powers of $e$ modes are much larger than that of $b$ modes.nevertheless, numerical tests show that the power spectra of both $e$ and $b$on scales larger than the finest scale by a factor of 4 and higher canreasonably be recovered, even when the power ratio of $e$- to $b$-modes is aslarge as about 10$^2$, and the signal-to-noise ratio is equal to 10 and higher.this is because the galerkin discretization is free of false correlations, andkeeps the contamination under control. as wavelet variables contain informationof both spatial and scale spaces, the developed method is also effective torecover the spatial structures of the $e$ and $b$ mode fields.

0707.2620	non-gaussianity of the cosmic baryon fluid: log-poisson hierarchy model	in the nonlinear regime of cosmic clustering, the mass density field of thecosmic baryon fluid is highly non-gaussian. it shows different dynamicalbehavior from collisionless dark matter. nevertheless, the evolved field ofbaryon fluid is scale-covariant in the range from the jeans length to a few tenh^{-1} mpc, in which the dynamical equations and initial perturbations arescale free. we show that in the scale-free range, the non-gaussian features ofthe cosmic baryon fluid, governed by the navier-stokes equation in an expandinguniverse, can be well described by a log-poisson hierarchical cascade. thelog-poisson scheme is a random multiplicative process (rmp), which causesnon-gaussianity and intermittency even when the original field is gaussian. thelog-poisson rmp contains two dimensionless parameters: $\beta$ for theintermittency and $\gamma$ for the most singular structure. all the predictionsgiven by the log-poisson rmp model, including the hierarchical relation, theorder dependence of the intermittent exponent, the moments, and the scale-scalecorrelation, are in good agreement with the results given by hydrodynamicsimulations of the standard cold dark matter model. the intermittent parameter$\beta$ decreases slightly at low redshift and indicates that the density fieldof baryon fluid contains more singular structures at lower redshifts. theapplicability of the model is addressed.

1001.4127	vorticity of igm velocity field on large scales	we investigate the vorticity of the igm velocity field on large scales withcosmological hydrodynamic simulation of the concordance model of lcdm. we showthat the vorticity field is significantly increasing with time as it caneffectively be generated by shocks and complex structures in the igm.therefore, the vorticity field is an effective tool to reveal the nonlinearbehavior of the igm, especially the formation and evolution of turbulence inthe igm. we find that the vorticity field does not follow the filaments andsheets structures of underlying dark matter density field and shows highly non-gaussian and intermittent features. the power spectrum of the vorticity fieldis used to measure the development of turbulence in fourier space. we show thatthe relation between the power spectra of vorticity and velocity fields isperfectly in agreement with the prediction of a fully developed homogeneous andisotropic turbulence from 0.2 to 3 h^{-1} mpc at z~0. this indicates thatcosmic baryonic field is in the state of fully developed turbulence on scalesless than about 3 h^{-1} mpc. the random field of the turbulent fluid yieldsturbulent pressure to prevent the gravitational collapsing of the igm. thevorticity and turbulent pressure are strong inside and even outside of highdensity regions. in igm regions with 10 times mean overdensity, the turbulentpressure can be on an average equivalent to the thermal pressure of thebaryonic gas with a temperature of 10^5 k. the fully developed turbulence wouldprevent the baryons in the igm from falling into the gravitational well of darkmatter halos. moreover, turbulent pressure is dynamical and non-thermal, whichmakes it different from pre-heating mechanism as it does not affect the thermalstate and ionizing process of hydrogen in the igm.

1005.0338	resonant scattering and ly-alpha radiation emergent from neutral  hydrogen halos	with a state-of-the-art numerical method for solving theintegral-differential equation of radiative transfer, we investigate the fluxof the ly$\alpha$ photon $\nu_0$ emergent from an optically thick halocontaining a central light source. our focus is on the time-dependent effectsof the resonant scattering. we first show that the frequency distribution ofphotons in the halo are quickly approaching to a locally thermalized statearound the resonant frequency, even when the mean intensity of the radiation ishighly time-dependent. since initial conditions are forgotten during thethermalization, some features of the flux, such as the two peak structure ofits profile, actually are independent of the intrinsic width and time behaviorof the central source, if the emergent photons are mainly from photons in thethermalized state. in this case, the difference $|\nu_{\pm}-\nu_0|$, where$\nu_{\pm}$ are the frequencies of the two peaks of the flux, cannot be lessthan $2$ times of doppler broadening. we then study the radiative transfer inthe case where the light emitted from the central source is a flash. wecalculate the light curves of the flux from the halo. it shows that the flux isstill a flash. the time duration of the flash for the flux, however, isindependent of the original time duration of the light source but depends onthe optical depth of the halo. therefore, the spatial transfer of resonantphotons is a diffusion process, even though it is not a purely browniandiffusion. this property enables an optically thick halo to trap and storethermalized photons around $\nu_0$ for a long time after the cease of thecentral source emission. the photons trapped in the halo can yield delayedemission, of which the profile also shows typical two peak structure as thatfrom locally thermalized photons. possible applications of these results areaddressed.

1006.1933	log-poisson non-gaussianity of ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux fluctuations  at high redshift	we investigate the non-gaussian features of the igm at redshift $z\sim 5 - 6$using ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux of quasar absorption spectra and cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulation of the concordance $\lambda$cdm universe. we show thatthe neutral hydrogen mass density field and ly$\alpha$ transmitted fluxfluctuations possess all the non-gaussian features predicted by the log-poissonhierarchy, which depends only on two dimensionless parameters $\beta$ and$\gamma$, describing, respectively, the intermittence and singularity of therandom fields. we find that the non-gaussianity of the ly$\alpha$ transmittedflux of quasars from $z=4.9$ to $z=6.3$ can be well reconstructed by thehydrodynamical simulation samples. although the gunn-peterson optical depth andits variance underwent a significant evolution in the redshift range of $5 -6$, the intermittency measured by $\beta$ is almost redshift-independent inthis range. more interesting, the intermittency of quasar's absorption spectraon physical scales $0.1-1$ h$^{-1}$mpc in redshift $5 - 6$ are found to beabout the same as that on physical scales $1-10$ h$^{-1}$mpc at redshifts $2 -4$. considering the jeans length is less than 0.1 h$^{-1}$mpc at $z\sim 5$, and$1$ h$^{-1}$mpc at $z\sim 2$, these results imply that the nonlinear evolutionin high and low redshifts will lead the cosmic baryon fluid to a state similarto fully developed turbulence. the log-poisson high order behavior of currenthigh redshift data of quasar's spectrum can be explained by uniform uvbackground in the redshift range considered. we also studied the log-poissonnon-gaussianity by considering inhomogeneous background. with severalsimplified models of inhomogeneous background, we found the effect of theinhomogeneous background on the log-poisson non-gaussianity is not larger than1-sigma.

1008.1449	statistical and dynamical decoupling of the igm from dark matter	the mean mass densities of cosmic dark matter is larger than that of baryonicmatter by a factor of about 5 in the $\lambda$cdm universe. therefore, thegravity on large scales should be dominant by the distribution of dark matterin the universe. however, a series of observations incontrovertibly show thatthe velocity and density fields of baryonic matter are decoupling fromunderlying dark matter field. this paper shows our attemps to unveil thephysics behind this puzzle. in linear approximation, the dynamics of the baryonfluid is completely governed by the gravity of the dark matter. consequently,the mass density field of baryon matter $\rho_b({\bf r},t)$ will beproportional to that of dark matter $\rho_{\rm dm}({\bf r},t)$, even thoughthey are different from each other initially. in weak and moderate nonlinearregime, the dynamics of the baryon fluid can be sketched by burgers equation. abasic feature of the burgers dynamics is to yield shocks. when the reynoldsnumber is large, the burgers fluid will be in the state of burgers turbulence,which consists of shocks and complex structures. on the other hand, thecollisionless dark matter may not show such shock, but a multivalued velocityfield. therefore, the weak and moderate nonlinear evolution leads to theigm-dark matter deviation. yet, the velocity field of burgers fluid is stillirrotational, as gravity is curl-free. in fully nonlinear regime, the vorticityof velocity field developed, and the cosmic baryonic fluid will no longer bepotential, as the dynamics of vorticity is independent of gravity and can beself maintained by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics. in this case, the cosmicbaryon fluid is in the state of fully developed turbulence, which isstatistically and dynamically decoupling from dark matter. this scenarioprovides a mechanism of cohenent explanation of observations.

1107.1804	effect of dust on lyman-alpha photon transfer in optically thick halo	we investigate the effects of dust on ly{\alpha} photons emergent from anoptically thick medium by solving the integro-differential equation of theradiative transfer of resonant photons. to solve the differential equationsnumerically we use the weighted essentially non-oscillatory method (weno).although the effects of dust on radia-tive transfer is well known, the resonantscattering of ly{\alpha} photons makes the problem non-trivial. for instance,if the medium has the optical depth of dust absorption and scattering to be{\tau}a&gt;&gt;1, {\tau}&gt;&gt;1, and {\tau}&gt;&gt;{\tau}a, the effective absorption opticaldepth in a random walk scenario would be equal to \surd{\tau}a({\tau}a+{\tau}). we show, however, that for a resonant scattering atfrequency {\nu}0, the effective absorption optical depth would be even largerthan {\tau}({\nu}0). if the cross section of dust scattering and absorption isfrequency-independent, the double-peaked structure of the frequency profilegiven by the resonant scattering is basically dust-independent. that is, dustcauses neither narrowing nor widening of the width of the double peakedprofile. one more result is that the time scales of the ly{\alpha} photontransfer in the optically thick halo are also basically independent of the dustscattering, even when the scattering is anisotropic. this is because those timescales are mainly determined by the transfer in the frequency space, while dustscattering, either isotropic or anisotropic, does not affect the behavior ofthe transfer in the frequency space when the cross section of scattering iswavelength-independent. this result does not support the speculation that dustwill lead to the smoothing of the brightness distribution of ly{\alpha} photonsource with optical thick halo.

1108.4162	time-dependent behavior of lyman$\alpha$ photon transfer in high  redshift optically thick medium	with monte carlo simulation method, we investigate the time dependentbehavior of ly$\alpha$ photon transfer in optically thick medium of theconcordance $\lambda$cdm universe. at high redshift, the ly$\alpha$ photonescaping from optically thick medium has a time scale as long as the age of theluminous object, or even comparable to the age of the universe. in this case,time-independent, or stationary solutions of the ly$\alpha$ photon transferwith resonant scattering will overlook important features of the escapedly$\alpha$ photons in physical and frequency spaces. more seriously, theexpansion of the universe leads to that the time-independent solutions of thely$\alpha$ photon transfer may not exist. we show that time-dependent solutionssometimes are essential for understanding the ly$\alpha$ emission andabsorption at high redshifts. for ly\alpha photons from sources at redshift1+z=10 and being surrounded by neutral hydrogen igm of the $\lambda$cdmuniverse, the escape coefficient is found to be always less, or much less thanone, regardless of the age or life time of the sources. under such environment,we also find that even when the ly$\alpha$ photon luminosity of the sources isstable, the mean surface brightness is gradually increasing in the first 10^6years, and then decreasing with a power law of time, but never approaches astable, time-independent state. that is, all 1+z=10 sources in a neutral hubbleexpanding igm with ly$\alpha$ luminosity l have their maximum of mean surfacebrightness ~ 10^{-21}(l/(10^{43}erg/s)) erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} arcsec^{-2} at theage of about 10^6 years. the time-dependent effects on the red damping wingprofile are also addressed.

0710.5476	ly$\alpha$ leaks and reionization	ly$\alpha$ absorption spectra of qsos at redshifts $z\simeq6$ show completegunn-peterson absorption troughs (dark gaps) separated by tiny leaks. the darkgaps are from the intergalactic medium (igm) where the density of neutralhydrogen are high enough to produce almost saturated absorptions, however,where the transmitted leaks come from is still unclear so far. we demonstratethat leaking can originate from the lowest density voids in the igm as well asthe ionized patches around ionizing sources using semi-analytical simulations.if leaks were produced in lowest density voids, the igm might already be highlyionized, and the ionizing background should be almost uniform; in contrast, ifleaks come from ionized patches, the neutral fraction of igm would be stillhigh, and the ionizing background is significantly inhomogeneous. therefore,the origin of leaking is crucial to determining the epoch ofinhomogeneous-to-uniform transition of the the ionizing photon background. weshow that the origin could be studied with the statistical features of leaks.actually, ly$\alpha$ leaks can be well defined and described by the equivalentwidth $w$ and the full width of half area $w_{\rm h}$, both of which are lesscontaminated by instrumental resolution and noise. it is found that thedistribution of $w$ and $w_{\rm h}$ of ly$\alpha$ leaks are sensitive to themodeling of the ionizing background. we consider four representativereionization models. it is concluded that the leak statistics provides aneffective tool to probe the evolutionary history of reionization at$z\simeq5-6.5$. similar statistics would also be applicable to the reionizationof he ii at $z \simeq 3$(abridged)

0711.0773	ly$\alpha$ leaks in the absorption spectra of high redshift qsos	spectra of high redshift qsos show deep gunn-peterson absorptions on the bluesides of the \lya emissions lines. they can be decomposed into componentscalled \lya leaks, defined to be emissive regions in complementary to otherwisezero-fluxed absorption gaps. just like \lya absorption forests at lowredshifts, \lya leaks are both easy to find in observations and containing richsets of statistical properties that can be used to study the early evolution ofthe igm. among all properties of a leak profile, we investigate its equivalentwidth in this paper, since it is weakly affected by instrumental resolution andnoise. using 10 keck qso spectra at $z\sim6$, we have measured the numberdensity distribution function $n(w,z)$, defined to be the number of leaks perequivalent width $w$ and per redshift $z$, in the redshift range $5.4 - 6.0$.these new observational statistics, in both the differential and cumulativeforms, fit well to hydro numerical simulations of uniform ionizing backgroundin the $\lambda$cdm cosmology. in this model, ly $\alpha$ leaks are mainly dueto low density voids. it supports the early studies that the igm at $z\simeq6$would still be in a highly ionized state with neutral hydrogen fraction $\simeq10^{-4}$. measurements of $n(w,z)$ at $z&gt;6$ would be effective to probe thereionization of the igm.

1308.4654	turbulence in the inter-galactic medium: solenoidal and dilatational  motions, and the impact of numerical viscosity	we use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, run by two fixedgrid codes, to investigate the properties of solenoidal and dilatationalmotions of the intergalactic medium (igm), and the impact of numericalviscosity on turbulence in a lcdm universe. the codes differ only in thespatial difference discretization. we find that (1) the vortical motion growsrapidly since $z=2$, and reaches $\sim 10 km/s -90 km/s$ at $z=0$. meanwhile,the small-scale compressive ratio $r_{cs}$ drops from 0.84 to 0.47, indicatingcomparable vortical and compressive motions at present. (2) power spectra ofthe solenoidal velocity possess two regimes, $\propto k^{-0.89}$ and $\proptok^{-2.02}$, while the total and dilatational velocity follow the scaling$k^{-1.88}$ and $k^{-2.20}$ respectively in the turbulent range. the igmturbulence may contain two distinct phases, the supersonic and post-supersonicphases. (3) the non-thermal pressure support, measured by the vortical kineticenergy, is comparable with the thermal pressure for $\rho_b \simeq 10-100$, or$t &lt;10^{5.5} k$ at $z=0.0$. the deviation of the baryon fraction from thecosmic mean shows a preliminary positive correlation with the turbulencepressure support. (4) a relatively higher numerical viscosity would dissipateboth the compressive and vortical motions of the igm into thermal energy moreeffectively, resulting in less developed vorticity, remarkably shortenedinertial range, and leading to non-negligible uncertainty in the thermalhistory of gas accretion. shocks in regions outside of clusters aresignificantly suppressed by numerical viscosity since $z=2$, which may directlycause the different levels of turbulence between two codes.

0807.4043	scaling relation between sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray luminosity  and scale-free evolution of cosmic baryon field	it has been revealed recently that, in the scale free range, i.e. from thescale of the onset of nonlinear evolution to the scale of dissipation, thevelocity and mass density fields of cosmic baryon fluid are extremely welldescribed by the self-similar log-poisson hierarchy. as a consequence of thisevolution, the relations among various physical quantities of cosmic baryonfluid should be scale invariant, if the physical quantities are measured incells on scales larger than the dissipation scale, regardless the baryon fluidis in virialized dark halo, or in pre-virialized state. we examine thisproperty with the relation between the compton parameter of the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich effect, $y(r)$, and x-ray luminosity, $l_{\rm x}(r)$, where$r$ being the scale of regions in which $y$ and $l_{\rm x}$ are measured.according to the self-similar hierarchical scenario of nonlinear evolution, oneshould expect that 1.) in the $y(r)$-$l_x(r)$ relation, $y(r)=10^{a(r)}[l_{\rmx}(r)]^{\alpha(r)}$, the coefficients $a(r)$ and $\alpha(r)$ arescale-invariant; 2.) the relation $y(r)=10^{a(r)}[l_{\rm x}(r)]^{\alpha(r)}$given by cells containing collapsed objects is also available for cells withoutcollapsed objects, only if $r$ is larger than the dissipation scale. these twopredictions are well established with a scale decomposition analysis ofobserved data, and a comparison of observed $y(r)$-$l_x(r)$ relation withhydrodynamic simulation samples. the implication of this result on thecharacteristic scales of non-gravitational heating is also addressed.

astro-ph;0001348	non-gaussianity and the recovery of the mass power spectrum from the  ly$\alpha$ forest	we investigate the effect of non-gaussianity on the reconstruction of theinitial mass field from the ly$\alpha$ forest. we show that the transmittedflux of qso absorption spectra are highly non-gaussian in terms of thestatistics, the kurtosis spectrum and scale-scale correlation. thesenon-gaussianities can not be completely removed by the conventional algorithmof gaussianization, and the scale-scale correlations are largely retained inthe mass field recovered by the gaussian mapping. therefore, the mass powerspectrum recovered by the conventional algorithm is systematically lower thanthe initial mass spectrum on scales at which the local scale-scale correlationis substantial. to reduce the non-gaussian contamination, we present twomethods. the first is to perform the gaussianization scale-by-scale using thediscrete wavelet transform (dwt) decomposition. we show that the non-gaussianfeatures of the ly$\alpha$ forest basically will no longer exist in thescale-by-scale gaussianized mass field. the second method is to choose a properorthonormal basis (representation) to suppress the effect of the non-gaussiancorrelations. in the quasilinear regime of cosmic structure formation, the dwtpower spectrum is efficient for suppressing the non-gaussian contamination.these two methods significantly improve the recovery of the mass power spectrumfrom the ly$\alpha$ forest.

astro-ph;0102160	measuring the galaxy power spectrum with multiresolution decomposition  -- ii. diagonal and off-diagonal power spectra of the lcrs galaxies	the power spectrum estimator based on the discrete wavelet transform (dwt)for 3-dimensional samples has been studied. the dwt estimator formulti-dimensional samples provides two types of spectra with respect todiagonal and off-diagonal modes, which are very flexible to deal withconfiguration-related problems in the power spectrum detection. with simulationsamples and mock catalogues of the las campanas redshift survey (lcrs), we show(1) the slice-like geometry of the lcrs doesn't affect the off-diagonal powerspectrum with ``slice-like'' mode; (2) the poisson sampling with the lcrsselection function doesn't cause more than 1-$\sigma$ error in the dwt powerspectrum; and (3) the powers of peculiar velocity fluctuations, which cause theredshift distortion, are approximately scale-independent. these results insurethat the uncertainties of the power spectrum measurement are under control. thescatter of the dwt power spectra of the six strips of the lcrs survey is foundto be rather small. it is less than 1-$\sigma$ of the cosmic variance of mocksamples in the wavenumber range $0.1 &lt; k &lt; 2$ h mpc$^{-1}$. to fit the detectedlcrs diagonal dwt power spectrum with cdm models, we find that the best-fittingredshift distortion parameter $\beta$ is about the same as that obtained fromthe fourier power spectrum. the velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$ for scdm and$\lambda$cdm models are also consistent with other $\sigma_v$ detections withthe lcrs. a systematic difference between the best-fitting parameters ofdiagonal and off-diagonal power spectra has been significantly measured. thisindicates that the off-diagonal power spectra are capable of providinginformation about the power spectrum of galaxy velocity field.

astro-ph;0103053	the local power spectrum and correlation hierarchy of the cosmic mass  field	we analyze the power spectrum of a qso's ly_alpha transmitted flux in thediscrete wavelet transform (dwt) representation. although the mean dwt powerspectrum is consistent with its counterpart in fourier representation, thespatial distribution of the local power varies greatly, i.e. the local dwtpower spectra show remarkably spiky structures on small scales. to measurethese spiky features, we introduce the quantities, roughness, of the localpower spectrum, and the correlation between spikes on different scales. we thentest the predictions made by the correlation hierarchy model on the roughnessand the scale-scale correlations of the local power spectrum. using thely_alpha transmitted flux of the qso hs1700, we find that the underlying cosmicmass field of the transmitted flux at redshift around z ~ 2.2 can be describedby the hierarchical clustering model on physical scales from 2.5 h^{-1} mpc tofew tens h^{-1} kpc in an einstein-de sitter universe. however, the non-linearfeatures of the clustering show differences on different scale ranges; 1. onphysical scales larger than ~ 1.3 h^{-1} mpc, the field is almost gaussian. 2.on scales 1.3 h^{-1} mpc - 0.3 h^{-1} mpc, the field is consistent with thecorrelation hierarchy with a constant value for the coefficient q_4. 3. onscales less than 300 h^{-1} kpc, the field is no longer gaussian, butessentially intermittent. in this case, the field can still be fitted by thecorrelation hierarchy, but the coefficient, q_4, should be scale-dependent.these three points are strongly supported by the following result: the scaledependencies of q_4 given by two statistically independent measures, i.e. q_4^rby the roughness and q_4^c by scale-scale correlation, are the same in theentire scale range considered.

astro-ph;0107083	measuring the galaxy power spectrum with multiresolution decomposition  -- iii. velocity field analysis	in this paper, we develop the method of analyzing the velocity field ofcosmic matter with a multiresolution decomposition. this is necessary incalculating the redshift distortion of power spectrum in the discrete wavelettransform (dwt) representation. we show that, in the dwt analysis, the velocityfield can be described by discrete variables, which are given by assignment ofthe number density and velocity into the dwt modes. these dwt variables arecomplete and not redundant. in this scheme, the peculiar velocity and pairwisevelocity of galaxies or particles are given by field variables. as aconsequence, the velocity dispersion (vd) and pairwise velocity dispersion(pvd) are no longer measured by number-counting or pair-counting statistic, butwith the ensemble of the field variables, and therefore, they are free from thebias due to the number-counting and pair-counting. we analyzed the vd and pvdof the velocity fields given by the n-body simulation for models of the scdm,$\tau$cdm and $\lambda$cdm. the spectrum (scale-dependence) of the vd and pvdshow that the length scale of the two-point correlation of the velocity fieldis as large as few tens h$^{-1}$ mpc. although the vd and pvd show similarbehavior in some aspects, they are substantially different from each other. thevd-to-pvd ratio shows the difference between the scale-dependencies of the vdand pvd. more prominent difference between the vd and pvd is shown byprobability distribution function. the one-point distribution of peculiarvelocity is approximately exponential, while the pairwise velocity's islognormal, i.e. of long tail. this difference indicates that the cosmicvelocity field is typically intermittent.

astro-ph;0107185	on the normalization of the qso's lyman alpha forest power spectrum	the calculation of the transmission power spectrum of qso's lyman alphaabsorption requires two parameters for the normalization: the continuum fc andmean transmission, i.e. average of e^{-tau}. traditionally, the continuum isobtained by a polynomial fitting truncating it at a lower order, and the meantransmission is calculated over the entire wavelength range considered. theflux f is then normalized by the average of fc e^{-tau}. however, thefluctuations in the transmitted flux are significantly correlated with thelocal background flux on scales for which the field is intermittent. in thispaper, we develop a self-normalization algorithm of the transmission powerspectrum based on a multiresolution analysis. this self-normalized powerspectrum estimator needs neither a continuum fitting, nor pre-determining themean transmission. with simulated samples, we show that the self-normalizationalgorithm can perfectly recover the transmission power spectrum from the fluxregardless of how the continuum varies with wavelength. we also show that theself-normalized power spectrum is also properly normalized by the meantransmission. moreover, this power spectrum estimator is sensitive to thenon-linear behavior of the field. that is, the self-normalized power spectrumestimator can distinguish between fields with or without thefluctuation-background correlation. this cannot be accomplished by the powerspectrum with the normalization by an overall mean transmission. therefore, theself-normalized power spectrum would be useful for the discrimination amongmodels without the uncertainties caused by free (or fitting) parameters.

astro-ph;0110152	the large-scale rms bulk velocity estimated from qsos' ly$\alpha$  forests	we propose a method for estimating the large-scale rms bulk velocity of thecosmic mass field from the transmitted fluxes of ly$\alpha$ forests. it isbased on two linear relationships on large scales: 1) the relation between thefluctuations of the transmission and the underlying density field, and 2) therelation between the density fluctuations and the peculiar velocity field. weshow that, with a multiscale decomposition, the two relations can beeffectively employed for predicting the rms bulk velocity. since qso'sly$\alpha$ forest is due to the absorptions of diffusely distributed andphotoionized igm, this method provides an independent estimate of the rms bulkvelocity at high redshifts, on large scales, and free from the bias ofgalaxies. using the transmitted flux of 60 moderate-resolution qso spectra, therms bulk velocity is found to be 230$\pm$50 km s$^{-1}$ around redshift$z=2.25$ on scale 23 h$^{-1}$mpc, and down to 110$\pm$45 km s$^{-1}$ around$z=3.25$ on scale 92 h$^{-1}$mpc for an lcdm universe ($\omega=0.3$ and$\lambda=0.7$). the results are basically consistent with the linear evolutiontheory.

astro-ph;0110530	measuring the galaxy power spectrum with multiresolution decomposition  -- iv. redshift distortion	in this paper, we develop a theory of redshift distortion of the galaxy powerspectrum in the discrete wavelet transform (dwt) representation. because thedwt power spectrum is dependent of both the scale and shape (configuration) ofthe decomposition modes, it is sensitive to distortion of shape of the field.on the other hand, the redshift distortion causes a shape distortion ofdistributions in real space with respect to redshift space. therefore, theshape-dependent dwt power spectrum is useful to detect the effect of redshiftdistortion. we first established the mapping between the dwt power spectra inredshift and real space. the mapping depends on the redshift distortion effectsof (1) bulk velocity, (2) selection function and (3) pairwise peculiarvelocity. we then proposed $\beta$-estimators using the dwt off-diagonal powerspectra. these $\beta$-estimators are model-free even when the non-linearredshift distortion effect is not negligible. moreover, these estimators do notrely on the assumption of whether the pairwise velocity dispersion beingscale-dependent. the tests with n-body simulation samples show that theproposed $\beta$-estimators can yield reliable measurements of $\beta$ withabout 20% uncertainty for all popular dark matter models. we also develop analgorithm for reconstruction of the power spectrum in real space from theredshift distorted power spectrum. the numerical test also shows that the realpower spectrum can be well recovered from the redshift distorted powerspectrum.

astro-ph;0211159	one-point statistics of the cosmic density field in real and redshift  spaces with a multiresolutional decomposition	in this paper, we develop a method of performing the one-point statistics ofa perturbed density field with a multiresolutional decomposition based on thediscrete wavelet transform (dwt). we establish the algorithm of the one-pointvariable and its moments in considering the effects of poisson sampling andselection function. we also establish the mapping between the dwt one-pointstatistics in redshift space and real space, i.e. the algorithm for recoveringthe dwt one-point statistics from the redshift distortion of bulk velocity,velocity dispersion, and selection function. numerical tests on n-bodysimulation samples show that this algorithm works well on scales from a fewhundreds to a few mpc/h for four popular cold dark matter models.  taking the advantage that the dwt one-point variable is dependent on both thescale and the shape (configuration) of decomposition modes, one can designestimators of the redshift distortion parameter (beta) from combinations of dwtmodes. when the non-linear redshift distortion is not negligible, the betaestimator from quadrupole-to-monopole ratio is a function of scale. thisestimator would not work without adding information about the scale-dependence,such as the power-spectrum index or the real-space correlation function of therandom field. the dwt beta estimators, however, do not need such extrainformation. numerical tests show that the proposed dwt estimators are able todetermine beta robustly with less than 15% uncertainty in the redshift range 0&lt; z &lt; 3.

astro-ph;0301018	intermittent features of the qso ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux: results  from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations	it has been recently found that the local fluctuations of the qso'sly$\alpha$ absorption spectrum transmitted flux show spiky structures. thisimplies that the mass fields of the intergalactic medium (igm) is intermittent.this feature cannot be explained by the clustering evolution of cosmic massfield in the linear regimes and is also difficult to incorporate into thehierarchical clustering scenario. we calculate the structure functions andintermittent exponent of the igm and hi for full hydrodynamical simulationsamples. the result shows the intermittent features of the ly$\alpha$transmitted flux fluctuations as well as the mass field of the igm. we findthat within the error bars of current data, all the intermittent behavior ofthe simulation samples are consistent with the observation. this result isdifferent from our earlier result (pando et al 2002), which shows that theintermittent behavior of samples generated by pseudo-hydro simulation cannot befitted with observed data. one difference between the pseudo-hydro and fullhydro simulations is in treating the dynamical relation between the igm (or hi)and dark matter fields. the former assumes that the igm density distributiontraces the underlying dark matter point-by-point on scales larger than thejeans length in either the linear or nonlinear regimes. however, hydrodynamicstudies have found that a statistical discrepancy between the igm field andunderlying dark matter in nonlinear regime is possible. we find that thepoint-by-point correlation between the igm density perturbations and darkmatter become weaker on comoving scales less than 2 h$^{-1}$ mpc (in lcdmmodel), which is larger than the igm jeans length.

astro-ph;0303649	power spectrum and intermittency of the transmitted flux of qsos  ly-alpha absorption spectra	using a set of 28 high resolution, high signal to noise ratio (s/n) qsoly-alpha absorption spectra, we investigate the non-gaussian features of thetransmitted flux fluctuations, and their effect upon the power spectrum of thisfield. we find that the spatial distribution of the local power of thetransmitted flux on scales k &gt;= 0.05 s/km is highly spiky or intermittent. theprobability distribution functions (pdfs) of the local power are long-tailed.the power on small scales is dominated by small probability events, andconsequently, the uncertainty in the power spectrum of the transmitted fluxfield is generally large. this uncertainty arises due to the slow convergenceof an intermittent field to a gaussian limit required by the central limittheorem (clt). to reduce this uncertainty, it is common to estimate the errorof the power spectrum by selecting subsamples with an "optimal" size. we showthat this conventional method actually does not calculate the variance of theoriginal intermittent field but of a gaussian field. based on the analysis ofintermittency, we propose an algorithm to calculate the error. it is based on abootstrap re-sampling among all independent local power modes. this estimationdoesn't require any extra parameter like the size of the subsamples, and issensitive to the intermittency of the fields. this method effectively reducesthe uncertainty in the power spectrum when the number of independent modesmatches the condition of the clt convergence.

astro-ph;0310327	quasi-local evolution of the cosmic gravitational clustering in halo  model	we show that the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic gravitational clusteringis approximately spatial local in the $x$-$k$ (position-scale) phase space ifthe initial perturbations are gaussian. that is, if viewing the mass field withmodes in the phase space, the nonlinear evolution will cause strong couplingamong modes with different scale $k$, but at the same spatial area $x$, whilethe modes at different area $x$ remain uncorrelated, or very weakly correlated.we first study the quasi-local clustering behavior with the halo model, anddemonstrate that the quasi-local evolution in the phase space is essentiallydue to the self-similar and hierarchical features of the cosmic gravitationalclustering. the scaling of mass density profile of halos insures that thecoupling between $(x-k)$ modes at different physical positions is substantiallysuppressed. using high resolution n-body simulation samples in the lcdm model,we justify the quasi-locality with the correlation function between the dwt(discrete wavelet transform) variables of the cosmic mass field. although themass field underwent a highly non-linear evolution, and the dwt variablesdisplay significantly non-gaussian features, there are almost no correlationsamong the dwt variables at different spatial positions. possible applicationsof the quasi-locality have been discussed.

astro-ph;0310856	correlated hybrid fluctuations from inflation with thermal dissipation	we investigate the primordial scalar perturbations in the thermal dissipativeinflation where the radiation component (thermal bath) persists and the densityfluctuations are thermally originated. the perturbation generated in this modelis hybrid, i.e. it consists of both adiabatic and isocurvature components. wecalculate the fractional power ratio ($s$) and the correlation coefficient($\cos\delta$) between the adiabatic and the isocurvature perturbations at thecommencing of the radiation regime. since the adiabatic/isocurvaturedecomposition of hybrid perturbations generally is gauge-dependent atsuper-horizon scales when there is substantial energy exchange between theinflaton and the thermal bath, we carefully perform a proper decomposition ofthe perturbations. we find that the adiabatic and the isocurvatureperturbations are correlated, even though the fluctuations of the radiationcomponent is considered uncorrelated with that of the inflaton. we also showthat both $s$ and $\cos \delta$ depend mainly on the ratio between thedissipation coefficient $\gamma$ and the hubble parameter $h$ during inflation.the correlation is positive ($\cos\delta &gt; 0$) for strong dissipation caseswhere $\gamma/h &gt;0.2$, and is negative for weak dissipation instances where$\gamma/h &lt;0.2$. moreover, $s$ and $\cos \delta$ in this model are notindependent of each other. the predicted relation between $s$ and $\cos\delta$is consistent with the wmap observation. other testable predictions are alsodiscussed.

astro-ph;0312653	the reionization history in the lognormal model	we study the evolution of baryonic gas before the reionization in thelognormal (ln) model of cosmic clustering. we show that the thermal history ofthe universe around the reionization can roughly be divided into three epochs:1) cold dark age $z&gt;z_r$, in which baryon gas is neutral, and opaque toly$\alpha$ photons; 2) hot dark age $z_r &gt; z&gt; z_{gp}$, in which a predominantpart of baryon gas is ionized and hot, but it is still opaque to ly$\alpha$photons; 3) bright age $z&lt;z_{gp}$, in which the universe is ionized highlyenough to be transparent to ly$\alpha$ photons. in the flat cold dark mattercosmological models given by wmap and cobe, the difference of the two redshifts$z_r - z_{gp}$ is found to be as large as $\sim 10$ with $z_r\sim 17$ and$z_{gp}\sim 7$. this reionization history naturally yields a high optical depthto the cmb $\tau_e \simeq 0.12 - 0.19$ observed by the te polarization of thewmap, and a low redshift $z_{gp}$ of the appearance of the ly$\alpha$gunn-peterson trough $z_{gp} \simeq 6 - 8$ in qso's absorption spectra. thereason why the universe stays long in an ionized, yet ly$\alpha$ opaque, stageis because the first photo-ionization heats the intergalactic gas effectivelyand has balanced the gravitational clustering a long period of time. therefore,the result of a high $\tau_e$ and low $z_{gp}$ is a common feature of all themodels considered. besides the cosmological parameters, the only free parameterwe used in the calculation is $n_{ion}$, the mean ionization photons producedby each baryon in collapsed objects. we take it to be 40 - 80 in thecalculation.

astro-ph;0401269	off-equilibrium dynamics of the primordial perturbations in the  inflationary universe: the o(n) model	using the o(n) model as an example, we investigate the self-interactioneffects of inflaton on the dynamics of the primordial perturbations. whentaking interactions into account, it is essential to employ a self-consistentoff-equilibrium formalism to study the evolution of the inflationary backgroundfield and its fluctuations with the back-reaction effects. within the hartreefactorization scheme, we show that the o(n) model has at least two observableremains left behind the off-equilibrium processes: the running spectral indexof primordial density perturbations and the correlations between perturbationmodes in phase space. we find that the running of the spectral index is fullydetermined by the rate of the energy transfer from the inflationary backgroundfield to its fluctuations via particle creation processes as well as thedynamics of the background field itself. furthermore, the amplitude of thefield fluctuations turns out to be scale-dependent due to the off-equilibriumevolution. as a consequence, the scale-dependence of fluctuations yields acorrelation between the phase space modes of energy density perturbations,while the one-point function of the fluctuations in each hartree mode is stillgaussian. more importantly, the mode-mode correlation of the primordialperturbations depends upon the dynamics of the self-interaction {\it as wellas} the initial conditions of the inflation. hence, we propose that the runningspectral index and the correlation between phase-space modes would be twoobservable fossils to probe the epoch of inflation, even beyond.

astro-ph;0403658	spatial locality of galaxy correlation function in phase space: samples  from the 2mass extended source catalog	we analyze the statistical properties and dynamical implications of galaxydistributions in phase space for samples selected from the 2mass extendedsource catalog. the galaxy distribution is decomposed into modes $\delta({\bfk, x})$ which describe the number density perturbations of galaxies in phasespace cell given by scale band $\bf k$ to ${\bf k}+\delta {\bf k}$ and spatialrange $\bf x$ to ${\bf x}+\delta {\bf x}$. in the nonlinear regime,$\delta({\bf k, x})$ is highly non-gaussian. we find, however, that thecorrelations between $\delta({\bf k, x})$ and $\delta({\bf k', x'})$ are alwaysvery weak if the spatial ranges (${\bf x}$, ${\bf x}+\delta {\bf x}$) and(${\bf x'}$, ${\bf x'}+\delta {\bf x'}$) don't overlap. this feature is due tothe fact that the spatial locality of the initial perturbations is memorizedduring hierarchical clustering. the highly spatial locality of the 2mass galaxycorrelations is a strong evidence for the initial perturbations of the cosmicmass field being spatially localized, and therefore, consistent with a gaussianinitial perturbations on scales as small as about 0.1 h$^{-1}$ mpc. moreover,the 2mass galaxy spatial locality indicates that the relationship betweendensity perturbations of galaxies and the underlying dark matter should belocalized in phase space. that is, for a structure consisting of perturbationson scales from $k$ to $ k+\delta {k}$, the nonlocal range in the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter should {\it not} be larger than $|{\delta {\bfx}}|=2\pi/|\delta {\bf k}|$. the stochasticity and nonlocality of the biasrelation between galaxies and dark matter fields should be no more than theallowed range given by the uncertainty relation $|{\delta {\bf x}|| \delta{\bfk}}|=2\pi$.

astro-ph;0405508	the statistical discrepancy between the igm and dark matter fields:  one-point statistics	we investigate the relationship between the mass and velocity fields of theintergalactic medium (igm) and dark matter. although the evolution of the igmis dynamically governed by the gravity of the underlying dark matter field,some statistical properties of the igm inevitably decouple from those of thedark matter once the nonlinearity of the dynamical equations and the stochasticnature of the field is considered. with simulation samples produced by a hybridcosmological hydrodynamic/n-body code, which is effective in capturing shocksand complicated structures with high precision, we find that the one-pointdistributions of the igm field are systematically different from that of darkmatter as follows: 1.) the one-point distribution of the igm peculiar velocityfield is exponential at least at redshifts less than 2, while the dark mattervelocity field is close to a gaussian field; 2.) although the one-pointdistributions of the igm and dark matter are similar, the point-by-pointcorrelation between the igm and dark matter density fields significantlydiffers on all scales and redshifts analyzed; 3.) the one-point densitydistributions of the difference between igm and dark matter fields are highlynon-gaussian and long tailed. these discrepancies violate the similaritybetween the igm and dark matter and cannot be explained simply as jeanssmoothing of the igm. however, these statistical discrepancies are consistentwith the fluids described by stochastic-force driven nonlinear dynamics.

astro-ph;0406544	statistical features of 21-cm emission from the epoch between  reionization and gunn-peterson transparency	we investigate the 21 cm emission from the epoch between reionization z_r andgunn-peterson transparency z_{gp}. according to the lognormal model of thethermal history around reionization, hydrogen clouds in z_r &gt; z &gt; z_{gp} arehot and a predominant part of baryonic gas is ionized, but still opaque toly-alpha photons. therefore, 21 cm emission is a distinctive characteristic ofthis epoch. we show that the 21 cm emission comes from both uncollapsed andcollapsing hydrogen clouds. the spatial distribution of the brightnesstemperature excess $\delta t_b$ is highly non-gaussian. it consists of spikeswith high $\delta t_b$ and a low $\delta t_b$ area between the spikes. thefield has the following statistical features: (1) the one-point distributionsof $\delta t_b$ are described approximately by power-law tailed probabilitydistribution functions; (2) the nth-order moment of $\delta t_b$ is increasingmuch faster with n than that of a gaussian field, but slower than that of alognormal field; (3) the scale-scale correlation of the $\delta t_b$ field issignificant for all scales larger than the jeans length of the gas. thesefeatures would be useful for distinguishing the 21 cm emission of the earlyclustering from the noise of foreground contamination.

astro-ph;0501404	distributions of the baryon fraction on large scales in the universe	(abridged) the nonlinear evolution of a system consisting of baryons and darkmatter is generally characterized by strong shocks and discontinuities. thebaryons slow down significantly at postshock areas of gravitational strongshocks, which can occur in high overdense as well as low overdense regions.consequently, the baryon fraction would be nonuniform on large scales. westudied these phenomena with simulation samples produced by the weno hybridcosmological hydrodynamic/n-body code. we find that the baryon fraction in highmass density regions is lower on average than the cosmic baryon fraction, andmany baryons accumulate in the regions with moderate mass density to form ahigh baryon fraction phase (hbfp). in dense regions with rho&gt;100, which are thepossible hosts for galaxy clusters, the baryon fraction can be lower than thecosmic baryon fraction by about 10%--20% at z ~ 0. our simulation samples showthat about 3% of the cosmic baryon budget was hidden in the hbfp at redshiftz=3, while this percentage increases to about 14% at the present day. the gasin the hbfp cannot be detected either by ly-alpha forests of qso absorptionspectra or by soft x-ray background. that is, the hbfp would be missed in thebaryon budget given by current observations.

astro-ph;0502175	the velocity field of baryonic gas in the universe	the dynamic evolution of the baryonic intergalactic medium (igm) caused bythe underlying dark matter gravity is governed by the navier-stokes equationsin which many cooling and heating processes are involved. however, it has longbeen recognized that the growth mode dynamics of cosmic matter clustering canbe sketched by a random force driven burgers' equation if cooling and heatingare ignored. just how well the dynamics of the igm can be described as aburgers fluid has not been fully investigated probably because cooling andheating are essential for a detailed understanding of the igm. using igmsamples produced by a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in which heating andcooling processes are properly accounted for, we show that the igm velocityfield in the nonlinear regime shows the features of a burgers fluid, that is,when the reynolds number is high, the velocity field consists of an ensemble ofshocks. consequently, (1) the igm velocity $v$ is generally smaller than thatof dark matter; (2) for the smoothed field, the igm velocity shows tightcorrelation with dark matter given by $v \simeq s v_{dm}$, with $s&lt;1$, suchthat the lower the redshift, the smaller $s$; (3) the velocity pdfs areasymmetric between acceleration and deceleration events; (4) the pdf ofvelocity difference $\delta v=v(x+r)-v(x)$ satisfies the scaling relation for aburgers fluid, i.e., $p(\delta v)=(1 r^y)f(\delta v/r^y)$. we find the scalingfunction and parameters for the igm which are applicable to the entire scalerange of the samples (0.26 - 8 h$^{-1}$ mpc). these properties show that thesimilarity mapping between the igm and dark matter is violated on scales muchlarger than the jeans length of the igm.

astro-ph;0609411	the dwt power spectrum of the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey	the power spectrum of the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs)sample is estimated with the discrete wavelet transform (dwt) method. the dwtpower spectra within $0.04 &lt;k&lt; 2.3 h$mpc$^{-1}$ are measured for threevolume-limited samples defined in connective absolute magnitude bins $-19 \sim-18$, $-20 \sim -19$ and $-21 \sim -20$. we show that the dwt power spectrumcan effectively distinguish $\lambda$cdm models of $\sigma_8=0.84$ and$\sigma_8=0.74$. we adopt maximum likelihood method to perform three-parameterfitting with bias parameter $b$, pairwise velocity dispersion $\sigma_{pv}$ andredshift distortion parameter $\beta=\omega_m^{0.6}/b$ to the measured dwtpower spectrum. fitting results denotes that in a $\sigma_8=0.84$ universe thebest fitted $\omega_m$ given by the three samples are consistent in the range$0.28 \sim 0.36$, and the best fitted $\sigma_{pv}$ are $398^{+35}_{-27}$,$475^{+37}_{-29}$ and $550 \pm 20$km/s for the three samples, respectively.however in the model of $\sigma_8=0.74$, our three samples give very differentvalues of $\omega_m$. we repeat the fitting by using empirical formula ofredshift distortion. the result of the model of low $\sigma_8$ is still poor,especially, one of the best value $\sigma_{pv}$ is as large as $10^3$km/s. thepower spectrum of 2dfgrs seems in disfavor of models with low amplitude ofdensity fluctuations.

astro-ph;9504061	a simulation of ly-alpha absorption forests in linear approximation in  cold and cold+hot dark matter models	our goal in this paper is to test some popular dark matter models by ly-alphaforest in qso spectra. recent observations of the size and velocity of ly-alphaforest clouds have indicated that the ly-alpha absorption is probably not givenby collapsed objects, but pre-collapsed regions in the baryonic density field.therefore, a linear approximation description would be able to provide valuableinformation. we developed a technique to simulate ly-alpha forest as theabsorption of such pre-collapsed regions under linear approximation regime. thesimulated ly-alpha forests in models of the standard cold dark matter (scdm),the cold plus hot dark matter (chdm), and the low-density flat cold dark matter(lcdm) have been confronted with observational features, including 1) thenumber density of ly-alpha lines and its dependencies on redshift andequivalent width; 2) the distribution of equivalent widths and its redshiftdependence; 3) clustering; and 4) the gunn-peterson effect. the "standard" chdmmodel, i.e. 60% cold and 30% hot dark matters and 10\% baryons, is found to bedifficult to pass the ly-alpha forest test, probably because it producesstructures too late and favors to form structures on large scales instead ofsmall scale objects like ly-alpha clouds. within a reasonable range of j_nu,the uv background radiation at high redshift, and delta_th, the threshold ofthe onset of gravitational collapse of the baryonic matter, the lcdm model isconsistent with observational data in all above-mentioned four aspects. themodel of scdm can also fit with observation, but it requires a smaller j_nu anda higher delta_th. this suggests that whether a significant part of thely-alpha forest lines is located in the halos of collapsed objects would becrucial to the success of scdm.

astro-ph;9806361	scale invariance of rich cluster abundance: a possible test for models  of structure formation	we investigate the dependence of cluster abundance $n(&gt;m,r_{cl})$, i.e., thenumber density of clusters with mass larger than $m$ within radius $r_{cl}$, onscale parameter $r_{cl}$. using numerical simulations of clusters in the cdmcosmogonic theories, we notice that the abundance of rich clusters shows asimple scale invariance such that $n[&gt;(r_{cl}/r_0)^{\alpha}m, r_{cl}]=n(&gt;m,r_0)$, in which the scaling index $\alpha$ remains constant in a scalerange where halo clustering is fully developed. the abundances of scale$r_{cl}$ clusters identified from iras are found basically to follow thisscaling, and yield $\alpha \sim 0.5$ in the range $1.5 &lt; r_{cl} &lt; 4 h^{-1}$mpc.the scaling gains further supports from independent measurements of the index$\alpha$ using samples of x-ray and gravitational lensing mass estimates. wefind that all the results agree within error limit as: $\alpha \sim 0.5 - 0.7$in the range of $1.5 &lt; r_{cl} &lt; 4 h^{-1}$mpc. these numbers are in goodconsistency with the predictions of ocdm ($\omega_m=0.3$) and lcdm($\omega_m+\omega_{\lambda} =1$), while the standard cdm model has differentbehavior. the current result seems to favor models with a low mass density.

astro-ph;9808179	a comparison of different cluster mass estimates: consistency or  discrepancy ?	rich and massive clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshift are capable ofmagnifying and distorting the images of background galaxies. a comparison ofdifferent mass estimators among these clusters can provide useful informationabout the distribution and composition of cluster matter and their dynamicalevolution. using a hitherto largest sample of lensing clusters drawn fromliterature, we compare the gravitating masses of clusters derived from thestrong/weak gravitational lensing phenomena, from the x-ray measurements basedon the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, and from the conventionalisothermal sphere model for the dark matter profile characterized by thevelocity dispersion and core radius of galaxy distributions in clusters. whilethere is an excellent agreement between the weak lensing, x-ray and isothermalsphere model determined cluster masses, these methods are likely tounderestimate the gravitating masses enclosed within the central cores ofclusters by a factor of 2--4 as compared with the strong lensing results. sucha mass discrepancy has probably arisen from the inappropriate applications ofthe weak lensing technique and the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis to thecentral regions of clusters as well as an unreasonably large core radius forboth luminous and dark matter profiles. nevertheless, it is pointed out thatthese cluster mass estimators may be safely applied on scales greater than thecore sizes. namely, the overall clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshiftcan still be regarded as the dynamically relaxed systems, in which the velocitydispersion of galaxies and the temperature of x-ray emitting gas are goodindicators of the underlying gravitational potentials of clusters.

astro-ph;9905156	abundances and correlations of structures beyond galaxy clusters	we investigated the structures on scales beyond the typical clusters ofgalaxies. these structures are crucial to understand the cosmic gravitationalclustering in the pre-virialized stage, or quasilinear r\`egime. based on themulti-resolution analysis of the discrete wavelet transformation, we gotstatistical available ensembles of $r_{cl}$-clusters, i.e. the structures onscale $r_{cl}$, in the range $1 \leq r_{cl} \leq 24 h^{-1}$ mpc for both n-bodysimulation and the iras 1.2 jy galaxy survey samples. if the mass-to-lightratio on scales larger than clusters asymptotically reaches a constant, wefound that the abundances and correlations of these iras $r_{cl}$-clusters tobe basically consistent with the predictions of the flat low-density cdm model(lcdm) and the open cdm model (ocdm), except the model-predicted abundance of$r_{cl} = 24 h^{-1}$ mpc clusters seems to be higher than iras data. thestandard cdm (scdm) gives too much power, and too weak correlations on all thescales. for a given $r_{cl}$, the amplitude of two-point correlation functionof $r_{cl}$-clusters is increasing with their richness. however, for a givenrichness (defined by the mean separation of neighbor objects), the clusteringstrengths of both simulation and observation sample are found to be decliningwith $r_{cl}$ when $r_{cl}$ is larger than 3 - 4 $h^{-1}$ mpc. therefore, the``universal'' increase of the correlation amplitude with the scale of objectsfrom galaxies, groups, to poor, rich clusters is broken down for structures of$r_{cl} &gt; 3 - 4 h^{-1}$ mpc. supercluster should not be a member of the``universal'' increase family.

astro-ph;9905171	cosmological constraints on the host halos of grbs	the recently observed bright optical transients(ot) of high redshift grbsindicate that they are in a violent dynamical state. we think it is reasonableto assume that the grbs form in the environment of gravitationally collapsedhalos of the cosmic matter field, and we investigate the basic parameters ofthe halos which are favored to host grbs. if the harboring coefficient $f$ ofgrbs per halo is weakly dependent on the mass of the halo, the redshift data ofgrb ots can yield significant constraints on the massive halos hosting grbs. weshow that, in the framework of popular cold dark matter (cdm) models, thegrb-favored environments are newly collapsed halos (i.e. their ages less thanabout $2 \times 10^9$ yr) with masses around $10^9$ $h^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. inthis scenario, low redshift grbs, if they exist, could not have the same cosmicorigin as the high redshift ones. to fit with the observed rate of grbs, weconclude that each grb halo can host probably no more than one grb event onaverage. this result implies that grbs may be related to the merging of thehalos.

astro-ph;9907141	the flatness of mass-to-light ratio on large scales	it has been suggested that the mass-to-light ($m/l$) ratio of gravitationallyclustering objects is scale-independent on scales beyond galaxy clusters, andmay also be independent of the mass of the objects. in this paper, we show thatthe scale behavior of $m/l$ ratio is closely related to the scaling of cosmicstructures larger than clusters. the scale dependence of the $m/l$ ratio can bedetermined by comparing the observed scaling of richness function (rf) ofmulti-scale identified objects with the model-predicted scaling of massfunction (mf) of large scale structures. using the multi-scale identifiedclusters from iras 1.2 jy galaxy survey, we have made comparisons of theobserved rf scaling of iras $r_{cl}$-clusters with the mf scalings given bysimulations of three popular models scdm, lcdm and ocdm. we find that, the m/lratio basically is scale-independent from the abell radius up to about 24$h^{-1}$mpc, while it seems to show a slight, but systematical, increase overthis scale range. this result is weakly dependent on the cosmologicalparameters.

astro-ph;9908332	breaking degeneracy of dark matter models by the scale-scale  correlations of galaxies	recently, scale-scale correlations have been detected in the distributions ofquasar's ly$\alpha$ absorption lines and the maps of cosmic temperaturefluctuations. in this paper, we investigate the scale-scale correlations ingalaxy distributions. using samples of mass field given by n-body simulation,we first show that the scale-scale correlation of 2-d and 3-d massdistributions at present day is capable of breaking the degeneracy between thescdm (standard cold dark matter model) and ocdm (open cdm model) or lcdm (flatcdm model), and even show the difference between the ocdm and lcdm. usingbiased galaxy samples produced in an appropriate bias model, we show that thescale-scale correlation of galaxy distribution at zero redshift is still apowerful tool to break the degeneracy in the parameter space, including bothcosmological and biasing parameters. we analyze the scale-scale correlations ofthe apm bright galaxy catalog, and compare it with the mock catalog in thescdm, ocdm and lcdm models. we find that all the spectra of local and non-localscale-scale correlations predicted by the ocdm model are in excellent agreementwith those of the apm-bgc sample, while the scdm and lcdm mock catalog appearto have somewhat weaker scale-scale correlations than the observation.

astro-ph;9910528	virialization of galaxy clusters and beyond	using samples of structures identified by a multi-scale decomposition fromnumerical simulation, we analyze the scale-dependence of the virialization ofclusters. we find that beyond the scale of full virialization there exists aradius range over which clusters are quasi-virialized, i.e. while the internalstructure of an {\it individual} cluster is at substantial departure fromdynamical relaxation, some {\it statistical} properties of the multi-scaleidentified clusters are approximately the same as those for the virializedsystems. the dynamical reason of the existence of quasi-virialization is thatsome of the scaling properties of dynamically relaxed systems of cosmicgravitational clustering approximately hold beyond the full virializationregime. the "individual-statistical" duality of the quasi-virializationprovides an explanation of the observed puzzle that the total masses ofclusters derived from virial theorem are statistically the same as thegravitational lensing determined masses, in spite of the presence of irregularconfiguration and substructures in individual clusters. it also explains thetight correlation between the velocity dispersion of optical galaxies and thetemperature of x-ray emitting gas. consequently, the virial mass estimatorsbased on the assumptions of isothermal and hydrostatic model are statisticallyapplicable to scales on which the clusters are quasi-virialized. in thequasi-virialization regime, the temperature functions of clusters also showscaling. this feature is a useful discriminator among cosmological models.

0706.0326	a weno algorithm for the growth of ionized regions at the reionization  epoch	we investigate the volume growth of ionized regions around uv photon sourceswith the weno algorithm, which is an effective solver of photon kinetics in thephase space described by the radiative transfer equation. we show that thevolume growth rate, either of isolated ionized regions or of clustered regionsin merging, generally consists of three phases: fast or relativistic growthphase at the early stage, slow growth phase at the later stage, and atransition phase between the fast and slow phases. we also show that the volumegrowth of ionized regions around clustered sources with intensity $\dot{e}_i$($i=1, 2, ...$) would have the same behavior as a single source with intensity$\dot{e}=\sum_i\dot{e}_i$, if all the distances between nearest neighborsources $i$ and $j$ are smaller than $c(t^i_c+t^j_c)$, $t^i_c$ being the timescale $t_c$ of source $i$. therefore, a tightly clustered uv photon sourceswould lead to a slow growth of ionized volume. this effect would be importantfor studying the redshift-dependence of 21cm signals from the reionizationepoch.
