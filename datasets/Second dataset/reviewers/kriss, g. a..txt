1006.2027	xmm-newton rgs observation of the warm absorber in mrk 279	the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279 was observed by xmm-newton in november 2005 inthree consecutive orbits, showing significant short-scale variability (averagesoft band variation in flux ~20%). the source is known to host a two-componentwarm absorber with distinct ionisation states from a previous chandraobservation. we aim to study the warm absorber in mrk 279 and investigate anypossible response to the short-term variations of the ionising flux, and toassess whether it has varied on a long-term time scale with respect to thechandra observation. we find no significant changes in the warm absorber onneither short time scales (~2 days) nor at longer time scales (two and a halfyears), as the variations in the ionic column densities of the most relevantelements are below the 90% confidence level. the variations could still bepresent but are statistically undetected given the signal-to-noise ratio of thedata. starting from reasonable standard assumptions we estimate the location ofthe absorbing gas, which is likely to be associated with the putative dustytorus rather than with the broad line region if the outflowing gas is moving atthe escape velocity or larger.

1107.0656	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509. i. variability and spectral energy  distribution	(abridged) active galactic nuclei show a wealth of interesting physicalprocesses, some of which are poorly understood. we want to address a number ofopen questions, including the location and physics of the outflow from agn, thenature of the continuum emission, the geometry and physical state of the x-raybroad emission line region, the fe-k line complex, the metal abundances of thenucleus and finally the interstellar medium of our own galaxy. we study one ofthe best targets for these aims, the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 509 with amultiwavelength campaign using five satellites (xmm-newton, integral, chandra,hst and swift) and two ground-based facilities (wht and pairitel). ourobservations cover more than five decades in frequency, from 2 um to 200 kev.the combination of high-resolution spectroscopy and time variability allows usto disentangle and study the different components. our campaign covers 100 daysfrom september to december 2009, and is centred on a simultaneous set of deepxmm-newton and integral observations with regular time intervals, spanningseven weeks. we obtain a continuous light curve in the x-ray and uv band,showing a strong, up to 60% flux increase in the soft x-ray band during thethree weeks in the middle of our deepest monitoring campaign, and which iscorrelated with an enhancement of the uv flux. this allows us to study the timeevolution of the continuum and the outflow. by stacking the observations, wehave also obtained one of the best x-ray and uv spectra of a seyfert galaxyever obtained. in this paper we also study the effects of the spectral energydistribution (sed) that we obtained on the photo-ionisation equilibrium. thanksto our broad-band coverage, uncertainties on the sed do not strongly affect thedetermination of this equilibrium.

1201.1024	characterizing the uv and x-ray outflow in mrk 509	we observed mrk 509 during the fall of 2009 during a multiwavelength campaignusing xmm-newton, chandra, hst/cos, swift, and integral. the 600-ks xmm/rgsspectrum finds two kinematic components and a discrete distribution of ionizedabsorbers. our high s/n cos spectrum detects additional complexity in the knownuv absorption troughs from a variety of sources in mrk 509, including theoutflow from the active nucleus, the ism and halo of the host galaxy, andinfalling clouds or stripped gas from a merger that are illuminated by the agn.the uv absorption only partially covers the emission from the agn nucleus withcovering fractions lower than those previously seen with stis, and arecomparable to those seen with fuse. given the larger apertures of cos and fusecompared to stis, we favor scattered light from an extended region near the agnas the explanation for the partial covering. as observed in prior x-ray and uvspectra, the uv absorption has velocities comparable to the x-ray absorption,but the bulk of the ultraviolet absorption is in a lower ionization state withlower total column density than the gas responsible for the x-ray absorption.variability compared to prior uv spectra lets us set limits on the location,density, mass flux, and kinetic energy of the outflowing gas. for component 1at $-400 \rm km s^{-1}$, the kinetic energy flux of both the uv and the x-rayoutflow is insufficient to have a significant impact on further evolution ofthe host galaxy.

1205.2559	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 x. lower limit on the distance of  the absorber from hst cos and stis spectroscopy	active galactic nuclei often show evidence of photoionized outflows. a majoruncertainty in models for these outflows is the distance ($r$) to the gas fromthe central black hole. in this paper we use the hst/cos data from a massivemulti-wavelength monitoring campaign on the bright seyfert i galaxy mrk 509, incombination with archival hst/stis data, to constrain the location of thevarious kinematic components of the outflow. we compare the expected responseof the photoionized gas to changes in ionizing flux with the changes measuredin the data using the following steps: 1) we compare the column densities ofeach kinematic component measured in the 2001 stis data with those measured inthe 2009 cos data; 2) we use time-dependent photionization calculations with aset of simulated lightcurves to put statistical upper limits on the hydrogennumber density that are consistent with the observed small changes in the ioniccolumn densities; 3) from the upper limit on the number density, we calculate alower limit on the distance to the absorber from the central source via theprior determination of the ionization parameter. our method offers twoimprovements on traditional timescale analysis. first, we account for thephysical behavior of agn lightcurves. second, our analysis accounts for thequality of measurement in cases where no changes are observed in the absorptiontroughs. the very small variations in trough ionic column densities (mostlyconsistent with no change) between the 2001 and 2009 epochs allow us to putstatistical lower limits on the distance between 100--200 pc for all the majoruv absorption components at a confidence level of 99%. these results are mainlyconsistent with the independent distance estimates derived for the warmabsorbers from the simultaneous x-ray spectra.

1209.6438	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 xii. broad band spectral analysis	(abridged) the simultaneous uv to x-rays/gamma rays data obtained during themulti-wavelength xmm/integral campaign on the seyfert 1 mrk 509 are used inthis paper and tested against physically motivated broad band models. eachobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model forthe continuum emission. prompted by the correlation between the uv and softx-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft x-rayexcess. the uv to x-rays/gamma-rays emission of mrk 509 can be well fitted bythese components. the presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum pointsto the existence of a hot (kt~100 kev), optically-thin (tau~0.5) coronaproducing the primary continuum. on the contrary, the soft x-ray componentrequires a warm (kt~1 kev), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. estimates of theamplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the"theoretical" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. aninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, apossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft x-rayexcess seen in agns. the temperature (~ 3 ev) and flux of the soft-photon fieldentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion diskdown to a transition radius $r_{tr}$ of 10-20 $r_g$. this plasma could be thewarm upper layer of the accretion disk. on the contrary the hot corona has amore photon-starved geometry. the high temperature ($\sim$ 100 ev) of thesoft-photon field entering and cooling it favors a localization of the hotcorona in the inner flow. this soft-photon field could be part of thecomptonised emission produced by the warm plasma. in this framework, the changein the geometry (i.e. $r_{tr}$) could explain most of the observed flux andspectral variability.

1308.1555	the x-ray/uv absorber in ngc 4593	we present the results of a recent (march 2011) 160 ks chandra-letgsobservation of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4593, and the analysis of archival x-rayand uv spectra taken with xmm-newton and hst/stis in 2002. we find evidence ofa multi-component warm absorber (wa) in the x-rays with four distinctionisation degrees (log xi = 1.0, log xi = 1.7, log xi = 2.4, and log xi = 3.0)outflowing at several hundreds of km/s. in the uv we detect 15 kinematiccomponents in the absorbers, blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocityof the source, ranging from -60 km/s to -1520 km/s. although the predicted civand nv column densities from the low-ionisation x-ray outflow are in agreementwith those measured for some components in the stis spectrum, there arekinematic discrepancies that may prevent both the x-ray and uv absorbers fromoriginating in the same intervening gas. we derive upper limits on the locationof the absorbers finding that the high-ionisation gas lie within ~6 - 29 pcfrom the central ionising source, while the low-ionisation gas is located atseveral hundreds of pc. this is consistent with our line of sight passingthrough different parts of a stratified wind. the total kinetic energy of theoutflows injected into the surroundings of the host galaxy only accounts for atiny fraction of the bolometric luminosity of the source, and it is thereforeunlikely that they may cause a significant impact in the interstellar medium ofngc 4593 in a given single episode of activity.

1404.3863	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509. xiii. testing ionized-reflection  models on mrk 509	active galactic nuclei (agn) are the most luminous persistent objects in theuniverse. an excess of x-ray emission below about 2 kev, called soft-excess, isvery common in type 1 agn spectra. the origin of this feature remains debated.originally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities tomodel the soft-excess, including warm comptonization and blurred ionizedreflection. in this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on mrk 509, abright seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order todetermine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. we use tensimultaneous xmm-newton and integral observations performed every four days. wepresent here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of theparameters and the variability properties of the x-ray emission. theapplication of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strongreflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-bandspectrum of mrk 509. two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection arediscussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. in both cases we findthat the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating thatthe model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. alarge, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard x-rayscould be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. however, such achange does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.warm comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in thisobject. nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warmcomptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, onedominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk andthe corona.

1412.2935	modeling warm absorption in hst/cos spectrum of mrk 290 with xstar	we present a new method to model a hst/cos spectrum, aimed to analyzeintrinsic uv absorption from the outflow of mrk 290, a seyfert i galaxy. we usenewly updated xstar to generate photoionization models for the intrinsicabsorption from the agn outflow, the line emission from the agn broad andnarrow line regions, and the local absorption from high velocity clouds andgalactic interstellar medium. the combination of these physical modelsaccurately fit the cos spectrum. three intrinsic absorbers outflowing withvelocities ~500 km/s are identified, two of which are found directly from twovelocity components of the n v and c iv doublets, while the third is requiredby the extra absorption in the lyman alpha. their outflow velocities,ionization states and column densities are consistent with the lowest andmoderately ionization warm absorbers (was) in the x-ray domain found by chandraobservations, suggesting an one-to-one correspondence between the absorbing gasin the uv and x-ray bands. the small turbulent velocities of the was(v_turb~&lt;100 km/s) support our previous argument from the x-ray study that theabsorbers originate from the inner side of the torus due to thermalevaporation. given the covering fractions of ~65% for the three was, we deducethat the lengths and the thicknesses of the was are comparable, which indicatesthat the geometry of was are more likely clouds rather than flat and thinlayers. in addition, the modeling of the broad line emission suggests a highercovering fraction of clouds when they are very closer to the black hole.

1503.06741	characteristics of he ii proximity profiles	the proximity profile in the spectra of z~3 quasars, where fluxes extendblueward of the he ii lya wavelength 304 (1+z) a, is one of the most importantspectral features in the study of the intergalactic medium. based on the hstspectra of 24 he ii quasars, we find that the majority of them display aproximity profile, corresponding to an ionization radius as large as 20 mpc inthe source's rest frame. in comparison with those in the h i spectra of thequasars at z~6, the he ii proximity effect is more prominent and is observedover a considerably longer period of reionization. the he ii proximity zonesizes decrease at higher redshifts, particularly at z &gt; 3.3. this trend issimilar to that for h i, signaling an onset of he ii reionization at z~4.  for quasar sdss1253+6817 (z=3.48), the he ii absorption trough displays agradual decline and serves a good case for modeling the he ii reionization. tomodel such a broad profile requires a quasar radiation field whose distributionbetween 4 and 1 rydberg is considerably harder than normally assumed. the uvcontinuum of this quasar is indeed exceptionally steep, and the he iiionization level in the quasar vicinity is higher than the average level in theintergalactic medium. these results are evidence that a very hard euv continuumfrom this quasar produces a large ionized zone around it.  distinct exceptions are the two brightest he ii quasars at z~2.8, for whichno significant proximity profile is present, possibly implying that they areyoung.

1505.02562	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548 iv. the short-term variability of the  outflows	during an extensive multiwavelength campaign that we performed in 2013-14 theprototypical seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 has been found in an unusual conditionof heavy and persistent obscuration. the newly discovered "obscurer" absorbsmost of the soft x-ray continuum along our line of sight and lowers theionizing luminosity received by the classical warm absorber. here we presentthe analysis of the high resolution x-ray spectra collected with xmm-newton andchandra throughout the campaign, which are suitable to investigate thevariability of both the obscurer and the classical warm absorber. the timeseparation between these x-ray observations range from 2 days to 8 months. onthese timescales the obscurer is variable both in column density and incovering fraction. this is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. themost significant variation occurred in september 2013 when the sourcebrightened for two weeks. a higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lowerobscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shapeduring the flare. we suggest that a geometrical change of the soft x-ray sourcebehind the obscurer cause the observed drop in the covering fraction. due tothe higher soft x-ray continuum level the september 2013 chandra spectrum isthe only x ray spectrum of the campaign where individual features of the warmabsorber could be detected. the spectrum shows absorption from fe-uta,\ion{o}{iv}, and \ion{o}{v}, consistent to belong to the lower-ionizationcounterpart of the historical ngc 5548 warm absorber. hence, we confirm thatthe warm absorber has responded to the drop in the ionizing luminosity causedby the obscurer.

1509.00274	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548: v. a clear view of the x-ray narrow  emission lines	context. our consortium performed an extensive multi-wavelength campaign ofthe nearby seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 in 2013-14. the source appeared unusuallyheavily absorbed in the soft x-rays, and signatures of outflowing absorptionwere also present in the uv. he-like triplets of neon, oxygen and nitrogen, andradiative recombination continuum (rrc) features were found to dominate thesoft x-ray spectrum due to the low continuum flux.  aims. here we focus on characterising these narrow emission features usingdata obtained from the xmm-newton rgs (770 ks stacked spectrum).  methods. we use spex for our initial analysis of these features.self-consistent photoionisation models from cloudy are then compared with thedata to characterise the physical conditions of the emitting region.  results. outflow velocity discrepancies within the o vii triplet lines can beexplained if the x-ray narrow-line region (nlr) in ngc 5548 is absorbed by atleast one of the six warm absorber components found by previous analyses. therrcs allow us to directly calculate a temperature of the emitting gas of a fewev ($\sim10^{4}$ k), favouring photoionised conditions. we fit the data with acloudy model of log $\xi = 1.45 \pm 0.05$ erg cm s$^{-1}$, log $n_h = 22.9 \pm0.4$ cm$^{-2}$ and log v$_{turb} = 2.25 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ for the emittinggas; this is the first time the x-ray nlr gas in this source has been modelledso comprehensively. this allows us to estimate the distance from the centralsource to the illuminated face of the emitting clouds as $13.9 \pm 0.6$ pc,consistent with previous work.

1511.07169	discovery of a fast, broad, transient outflow in ngc 985	we observed the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 985 on multiple occasions to search forvariability in its uv and x-ray absorption features in order to establish theirlocation and physical properties. we use xmm-newton to obtain x-ray spectrausing the epic-pn camera, and the cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) on thehubble space telescope (hst) to obtain uv spectra. our observations aresimultaneous and span timescales of days to years. we find that the soft x-rayobscuration that absorbed the low energy continuum of ngc 985 in august 2013diminished greatly by january 2015. the total x-ray column density decreasedfrom 2.1 x 10^22 cm^-2 to ~6 x 10^21 cm^-2. we also detect broad, fast uvabsorption lines in cos spectra obtained during the 2013 obscuration event.lines of c iii*, ly alpha, si iv and c iv with outflow velocities of -5970 km/sand a full-width at half-maximum of 1420 km/s are prominent in the 2013spectrum, but have disappeared in all but ly alpha in the 2015 spectra. theionization state and the column density of the uv absorbing gas is compatiblewith arising in the same gas as that causing the x-ray obscuration. the highvelocity of the uv-absorbing gas suggests that the x-ray obscurer and theassociated uv outflow are manifestations of an accretion disk wind.

astro-ph;0406199	x-ray/uv campaign on the mrk 279 outflow: density diagnostics in active  galactic nuclei using o v k-shell absorption lines	one of the main problems in modeling the ionised outflows in active galacticnuclei is the unknown distance of the outflowing wind to the central source.only if the density is known this distance can be determined through theionisation parameter. here we study density diagnostics based upon o vtransitions. o v is known to have metastable levels that are density dependent.we study the population of those levels under photoionisation equilibriumconditions and determine for which parameter range they can have a significantpopulation. we find that resonance line trapping plays an important role inreducing the critical densities above which the metastable population becomesimportant. we investigate the k-shell absorption lines from these metastablelevels. provided that there is a sufficient population of the metastablelevels, the corresponding k-shell absorption lines are detectable and are wellseparated from the main absorption line originating from the ground state. wethen present the chandra letgs spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279 thatmay show for the first time the presence of these metastable level absorptionlines. a firm identification is not yet possible due to both uncertainties inthe observed wavelength of the strongest line as well as uncertainties in thepredicted wavelength. if the line is indeed due to absorption from o v, then wededuce a distance to the central source of one light week to a few lightmonths, depending upon the importance of additional heating processes.

astro-ph;0506323	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783 v. variability and  modeling of the intrinsic ultraviolet absorption	we present results on the location, physical conditions, and geometry of theoutflow in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 from a study of the variable intrinsicuv absorption. based on 18 observations with hst/stis and 6 observations withfuse, we find: 1) the absorption from the lowest-ionization species in each ofthe three strong kinematic components varied inversely with the continuum flux,indicating the ionization structure responded to changes in the photoionizingflux over the weekly timescales sampled by our observations. 2) a multi-component model with an unocculted nlr and separate blr and continuumline-of-sight covering factors predicts saturation in several lines, consistentwith the lack of observed variability. 3) column densities for the individualmetastable levels are measured from the resolved c iii *1175 absorption complexobserved in one component. based on our computed metastable level populations,the electron density of this absorber is ~3x10^4 cm^-3. photoionizationmodeling results place it at ~25 pc from the central source. 4) usingtime-dependent calculations, we are able to reproduce the detailed variabilityobserved in this absorber, and derive upper limits on the distances for theother components of 25-50 pc. 5) the ionization parameters derived for thehigher ionization uv absorbers are consistent with the modeling results for thelowest-ionization x-ray component, but with smaller total column density. theyhave similar pressures as the three x-ray ionization components. these resultsare consistent with an inhomogeneous wind model for the outflow in ngc 3783. 6)based on the predicted emission-line luminosities, global covering factorconstraints, and distances derived for the uv absorbers, they may be identifiedwith emission- line gas observed in the inner nlr of agns.

astro-ph;0507354	simultaneous ultraviolet and x-ray observations of the seyfert galaxy  ngc 4151. i. physical conditions in the x-ray absorbers	we present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic x-ray absorption in theseyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151 using chandra/hetgs data obtained 2002 may, as partof a program which included simultaneous uv spectra using hst/stis and fuse.ngc 4151 was in a relatively low flux state during the observations reportedhere, although roughly 2.5 times as bright in the 2 --10 kev band as during achandra observation in 2000. the soft x-ray band was dominated by emissionlines, which show no discernible variation in flux between the twoobservations. the 2002 data show the presence of a very highly ionizedabsorber, in the form of h-like and he-like mg, si, and s lines, as well aslower ionization gas via the presence of inner-shell absorption lines fromlower-ionization species of these elements. the former is too highly ionized tobe radiatively accelerated in a sub-eddington source such as ngc 4151. we findthat the lower ionization gas had a column density a factor of ~ 3 higherduring the 2000 observation. if due to bulk motion, we estimate that thiscomponent must have a velocity of more than 1250 km/sec transverse to ourline-of-sight. we suggest that these results are consistent with amagneto-hydrodynamic flow.

astro-ph;0609385	x-ray/ultraviolet observing campaign of the markarian 279 active  galactic nucleus outflow: a close look at the absorbing/emitting gas with  chandra-letgs	we present a chandra-letgs observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279. thisobservation was carried out simultaneously with hst-stis and fuse, in thecontext of a multiwavelength study of this source. the chandra pointings werespread over ten days for a total exposure time of ~360 ks. the spectrum ofmrk279 shows evidence of broad emission features, especially at the wavelengthof the ovii triplet. we quantitatively explore the possibility that thisemission is produced in the broad line region (blr). we modeled the broad uvemission lines seen in the fuse and hst-stis spectra following the ``locallyoptimally emitting cloud" approach. we find that the x-ray lines luminosityderived from the best fit blr model can match the x-ray features, suggestingthat the gas producing the uv lines is sufficient to account also for the x-rayemission. the spectrum is absorbed by ionized gas whose total column density is~5x10^{20} cm^{-2}. the absorption spectrum can be modeled by two distinct gascomponents (log xi ~ 0.47 and 2.49, respectively) both showing a significantoutflow velocity. however, the data allow also the presence of intermediateionization components. the distribution of the column densities of such extracomponents as a function of the ionization parameter is not consistent with acontinuous, power law-like, absorber, suggesting a complex structure for thegas outflow for mrk 279 (abridged).

astro-ph;0702311	the mass-energy budget of the ionised outflow in ngc 7469	although agn feedback through ionised winds is of great importance in modelsof agn/galaxy coevolution, the mass and energy output via these winds, even inthe nearby universe, is poorly understood. the issue is complicated by the widerange of ionisation in the winds, which means that multiwavelengthobservational campaigns are required to obtain the complete picture. in thispaper, we use a ~ 160 ks xmm-newton rgs spectrum to get the most accurate viewyet of the ionised outflow (warm absorber) in ngc 7469 as seen in x-rays,finding that there is a wide range of ionisation, with log xi in the range ~0.5-3.5 erg cm s^-1, and two main velocity regimes, at 580-720 and 2300 kms^-1, with the highest velocity gas being the least ionised. the totalabsorbing column density in the x-rays is of order 3 x 10^21 cm^-2. we findthat the lowest ionisation phase of the absorber is probably identical with oneof the phases of the uv absorber discovered in previous studies. we show thatboth x-ray and uv absorbers are consistent with an origin near the base of atorus wind, where matter is being launched and accelerated. calculating themass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of all the absorber phases, wedemonstrate that the x-ray absorbing gas carries respectively ~ 90% and 95% ofthe mass and kinetic energy output of the ionised outflow.

astro-ph;9603055	far-ultraviolet observations of ngc 3516 using the hopkins ultraviolet  telescope	we observed the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516 twice during the flight of astro-2using the hopkins ultraviolet telescope in march 1995. simultaneous x-rayobservations were performed with asca. our far-ultraviolet spectra cover thespectral range 820-1840 a with a resolution of 2-4 a. no significant variationswere found between the two observations. the total spectrum shows a redcontinuum, $f_\nu \sim \nu^{-1.89}$, with an observed flux of $\rm 2.2 \times10^{-14}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~\aa^{-1}$ at 1450 a, slightly above the historicalmean. intrinsic absorption in lyman $\beta$ is visible as well as absorptionfrom o~vi 1032,1038, n~v 1239,1243, si~iv 1394,1403, and c~iv 1548,1551. the uvabsorption lines are far weaker than is usual for ngc~3516, and also lie closerto the emission line redshift rather than showing the blueshift typical ofthese lines when they are strong. the neutral hydrogen absorption, however, isblueshifted by $400~\rm km~s^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity, and it isopaque at the lyman limit. the sharpness of the cutoff indicates a loweffective doppler parameter, $b &lt; \rm 20~km~s^{-1}$. for $b = \rm 10~km~s^{-1}$the derived intrinsic column is $\rm 3.5 \times 10^{17}~cm^{-2}$. as inngc~4151, a single warm absorber cannot produce the strong absorption visibleover the wide range of observed ionization states. matching both the uv andx-ray absorption simultaneously requires absorbers spanning a range of $10^3$in both ionization parameter and column density.

astro-ph;9603057	asca observations of the composite warm absorber in ngc 3516	we obtained x-ray spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc~3516 in march 1995using asca. simultaneous far-uv observations were obtained with hut on theastro-2 shuttle mission. the asca spectrum shows a lightly absorbed power lawof energy index 0.78. the low energy absorbing column is significantly lessthan previously seen. prominent o~vii and o~viii absorption edges are visible,but, consistent with the much lower total absorbing column, no fe k absorptionedge is detectable. a weak, narrow fe~k$\alpha$ emission line from coldmaterial is present as well as a broad fe~k$\alpha$ line. these features aresimilar to those reported in other seyfert 1 galaxies. a single warm absorbermodel provides only an imperfect description of the low energy absorption. inaddition to a highly ionized absorber with ionization parameter $u = 1.66$ anda total column density of $1.4 \times 10^{22}~\rm cm^{-2}$, adding a lowerionization absorber with $u = 0.32$ and a total column of $6.9 \times10^{21}~\rm cm^{-2}$ significantly improves the fit. the contribution ofresonant line scattering to our warm absorber models limits the dopplerparameter to $&lt; 160~\rm km~s^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence. turbulence at the soundspeed of the photoionized gas provides the best fit. none of the warm absorbermodels fit to the x-ray spectrum can match the observed equivalent widths ofall the uv absorption lines. accounting for the x-ray and uv absorptionsimultaneously requires an absorbing region with a broad range of ionizationparameters and column densities.

astro-ph;9712288	far-uv observations of ngc 4151 during the orfeus-spas ii mission	we observed the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151 on eleven occasions at 1-2 dayintervals using the berkeley spectrometer during the orfeus-spas ii mission in1996 november. the mean spectrum covers 912-1220 a at ~0.3 a resolution with atotal exposure of 15,658 seconds. the mean flux at 1000 a was 4.7e-13erg/cm^2/s/a. we identify the neutral hydrogen absorption with a number ofcomponents that correspond to the velocity distribution of \ion{h}{1} seen inour own galaxy as well as features identified in the civ 1549 absorptionprofile by weymann et al. the main component of neutral hydrogen in ngc 4151has a total column density of log n_hi = 18.7 +/- 1.5 cm^{-2} for a dopplerparameter b=250 +/- 50 km/s, and it covers 84 +/- 6% of the source. this isconsistent with previous results obtained with the hopkins ultraviolettelescope. other intrinsic far-uv absorption features are not resolved, but theciii* 1176 absorption line has a significantly higher blueshift relative to ngc4151 than the ciii 977 resonance line. this implies that the highest velocityregion of the outflowing gas has the highest density. variations in theequivalent width of the ciii* 1176 absorption line anticorrelate with continuumvariations on timescales of days. for an ionization timescale &lt;1 day, we set anupper limit of 25 pc on the distance of the absorbing gas from the centralsource. the ovi 1034 and heii 1085 emission lines also vary on timescales of1-2 days, but their response to the continuum variations is complex. for somecontinuum variations they show no response, while for others the response isinstantaneous to the limit of our sampling interval.

astro-ph;9801037	the nuclear spectrum of m87	the nuclear spectrum of m87 covering the ly_a-h_a wavelength range wasobtained with the hst faint object spectrograph (fos) trough a 0.21 arcsecaperture. contrary to some previous claims, a single power law (f(nu)~nu^(-a))can not reproduce the observed continuum shape and at least a broken power lawis require for a good fit (a = 1.75 and 1.41 shortward and longward of thebreak at ~4500 a). we detect a set of broad (fwhm ~ 400 km/s) absorption linesarising in the gas associated with m87. these are only lines from neutral andvery low ionization species blueshifted by ~150 km/s relative to the m87systemic velocity, indicating a net gas outflow and turbulence. the excitationsensitive emission line ratios suggest that shocks may be the dominant energysupplier.  the nuclear source in m87 is significantly variable. from the fos targetacquisition data, we have established that the flux from the optical nucleusvaries by a factor ~2 on time scales of ~2.5 months and by as much as 25% over3 weeks, and remains unchanged (&lt;2.5%) on time scales of ~1 day. thesetimescales limit the physical size of the emitting region to a few hundredgravitational radii. the variability, combined with other observed spectralproperties, strongly suggest that m87 is intrinsically of bl lac type but isviewed at an angle too large to reveal the classical bl lac properties.
