0902.1094	effective area calibration of the reflection grating spectrometers of  xmm-newton. i. x-ray spectroscopy of the crab nebula	the crab nebula and pulsar have been widely used as a calibration source forx-ray instruments. the in-flight effective area calibration of the reflectiongrating spectrometers (rgs) of xmm-newton depend upon the availability ofreliable calibration sources. we investigate how the absolute effective areacalibration of rgs can be obtained using crab as a standard candle. we haveanalysed rgs observations of the crab using different instrument configurationsand spatial offsets, and made use of previous determinations of the continuumspectrum of the nebula plus pulsar. due to the high spectral resolution of thergs, we resolve the main absorption edges and detect the strong 1s-2pabsorption lines of neutral oxygen. we get an excellent fit to the crabspectrum using this fixed continuum and the absorption spectrum determined byrgs. we get accurate column densities for the neutral atoms of h, n, o, ne, mg,and fe, as well as a clear detection of fe ii and firm upper limits for otherions. our data are in good agreement with earlier optical and uv spectroscopicmeasurements of some of these ions. we find solar abundances for n and o, whilene is overabundant by a factor of 1.7 and fe is underabundant by a factor of0.8. we confirm that there is less dust in the line of sight compared to theprediction based on the absorption column. our spectra suggest a more prominentrole of ferric iron in the dust compared to ferrous iron. our high-resolutionobservations confirm that crab can be used as an x-ray calibration source. rgsspectra have determined the absorption spectrum towards crab with unprecedenteddetail.

0902.4470	properties of the ionised plasma in the vicinity of the neutron-star  x-ray binary exo 0748-676	we present the spectral analysis of a large set of xmm-newton observations ofexo 0748-676, a bright dipping lmxb. in particular, we focus on the dippingphenomenon as a result of changes in the properties of the ionised gas close tothe source. using the high-resolution spectra collected with the rgs, weexplored two simple geometrical scenarios for which we derived physicalquantities of the absorbing material like the density, size, and mass. we findthat the continuum is absorbed by a neutral gas, and by both a collisionally(temperature t~70 ev) and photoionised (ionisation parameter log\xi~2.5)absorbers. emission lines from ovii and oviii are also detected. this is thefirst time that evidence of a collisionally ionised absorber has been found ina low-mass x-ray binary. the collisionally ionised absorber may be in the formof dense (n&gt;10^14 cm^-3) filaments, located at a distance r&gt;10^11 cm. duringdips, the photoionised absorber significantly increases its column density(factor 2--4) while becoming less ionised. this strengthens the idea that thecolder material of the accretion stream impinging the disc is passing on ourline of sight during dips. we find that the distance from the neutron star tothe impact region (~ 5x10^10 cm) is similar to the size of the neutron star'sroche lobe. the gas observed during the persistent state may have a flattenedgeometry. finally, we explore the possibility of the existence of materialforming an initial, hotter portion of a circumbinary disc.

0902.4671	solid state astrophysics: probing interstellar dust and gas properties  with x-rays	the abundances of gas and dust (solids and complex molecules) in theinterstellar medium (ism) as well as their composition and structures impactpractically all of astrophysics. fundamental processes from star formation tostellar winds to galaxy formation all scale with the number of metals. however,significant uncertainties remain in both absolute and relative abundances, aswell as how these vary with environment, e.g., stellar photospheres versus theinterstellar medium (ism). while uv, optical, ir, and radio studies haveconsiderably advanced our understanding of ism gas and dust, they cannotprovide uniform results over the entire range of column densities needed. incontrast, x-rays will penetrate gas and dust in the cold (3k) to hot(100,000,000k) universe over a wide range of column densities (log nh=20-24cm^-2), imprinting spectral signatures that reflect the individual atoms whichmake up the gas, molecule or solid. *x-rays therefore are a powerful and viableresource for delving into a relatively unexplored regime for determining gasabundances and dust properties such as composition, charge state, structure,and quantity via absorption studies, and distribution via scattering halos.*

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

0911.3153	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the seyfert 1 mrk841: insights  into the warm absorber and warm emitter	the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk841 was observed five times between 2001 and 2005 bythe xmm-newton x-ray observatory. the source is well known for showing spectralcomplexity in the variable iron line and in the soft x-ray excess. this paperreports on the first study of mrk841 soft x-ray spectrum at high spectralresolution. the availability of multiple exposures obtained by the reflectiongrating spectrometer (rgs) cameras allows a thorough study of the complexabsorption and emission spectral features in the soft x-ray band.the threecombined exposures obtained in january 2001 and the two obtained in january andjuly 2005 were analysed using the spex software. we detect a two-phase warmabsorber: a medium ionisation component (logxi~1.5-2.2 ergs s cm^{-1}) isresponsible for a deep absorption feature in the unresolved transition array ofthe fe m-shell and for several absorption lines in the ovi-viii band; a higherionisation phase with logxi~3 ergs s cm^{-1} is required to fit absorption inthe neix-x band. the ionisation state and the column density of the gas presentmoderate variation from 2001 to 2005 for both phases. the high ionisationcomponent of the warm absorber has no effect in the fe k band. no significantvelocity shift of the absorption lines is measured in the rgs data. remarkably,the 2005 spectra show emission features consistent with photoionisation in ahigh density (n_e&gt;10^{11} cm^{-3}) gas: a prominent ovii line triplet isclearly observed in january 2005 and narrow radiative recombination continua(rrc) of ovii and cvi are observed in both 2005 data sets. a broad gaussianline around 21.7 angstrom is also required to fit all the data sets. thederived radial distance for the emission lines seems to suggest that thephotoionisation takes place within the optical broad line region of the source.

1001.2712	xmm-newton unveils the complex iron k alpha region of mrk 279	we present the results of a ~160 ks-long xmm-newton observation of theseyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279. the spectrum shows evidence of both broad and narrowemission features. the fe k alpha line may be equally well explained by asingle broad gaussian (fwhm~10,000 km/s) or by two components: an unresolvedcore plus a very broad profile (fwhm~14,000 km/s). for the first time wequantified, via the "locally optimally emitting cloud" model, the contributionof the broad line region (blr) to the absolute luminosity of the broadcomponent of the fe k alpha at 6.4 kev. we find that the contribution of theblr is only ~3%. in the two-line component scenario, we also evaluated thecontribution of the highly ionized gas component, which produces the fexxviline in the iron k region. this contribution to the narrow core of the fe kalpha line is marginal &lt;0.1%. most of the luminosity of the unresolved,component of fe k alpha may come from the obscuring torus, while the very-broadassociated component may come from the accretion disk. however, models ofreflection by cold gas are difficult to test because of the limited energyband. the fexxvi line at 6.9 kev is consistent to be produced in a high columndensity (n_h~10^23 cm^{-2}), extremely ionized (log\xi~5.5-7) gas. this gas maybe a highly ionized outer layer of the torus.

1107.0656	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509. i. variability and spectral energy  distribution	(abridged) active galactic nuclei show a wealth of interesting physicalprocesses, some of which are poorly understood. we want to address a number ofopen questions, including the location and physics of the outflow from agn, thenature of the continuum emission, the geometry and physical state of the x-raybroad emission line region, the fe-k line complex, the metal abundances of thenucleus and finally the interstellar medium of our own galaxy. we study one ofthe best targets for these aims, the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 509 with amultiwavelength campaign using five satellites (xmm-newton, integral, chandra,hst and swift) and two ground-based facilities (wht and pairitel). ourobservations cover more than five decades in frequency, from 2 um to 200 kev.the combination of high-resolution spectroscopy and time variability allows usto disentangle and study the different components. our campaign covers 100 daysfrom september to december 2009, and is centred on a simultaneous set of deepxmm-newton and integral observations with regular time intervals, spanningseven weeks. we obtain a continuous light curve in the x-ray and uv band,showing a strong, up to 60% flux increase in the soft x-ray band during thethree weeks in the middle of our deepest monitoring campaign, and which iscorrelated with an enhancement of the uv flux. this allows us to study the timeevolution of the continuum and the outflow. by stacking the observations, wehave also obtained one of the best x-ray and uv spectra of a seyfert galaxyever obtained. in this paper we also study the effects of the spectral energydistribution (sed) that we obtained on the photo-ionisation equilibrium. thanksto our broad-band coverage, uncertainties on the sed do not strongly affect thedetermination of this equilibrium.

1201.1024	characterizing the uv and x-ray outflow in mrk 509	we observed mrk 509 during the fall of 2009 during a multiwavelength campaignusing xmm-newton, chandra, hst/cos, swift, and integral. the 600-ks xmm/rgsspectrum finds two kinematic components and a discrete distribution of ionizedabsorbers. our high s/n cos spectrum detects additional complexity in the knownuv absorption troughs from a variety of sources in mrk 509, including theoutflow from the active nucleus, the ism and halo of the host galaxy, andinfalling clouds or stripped gas from a merger that are illuminated by the agn.the uv absorption only partially covers the emission from the agn nucleus withcovering fractions lower than those previously seen with stis, and arecomparable to those seen with fuse. given the larger apertures of cos and fusecompared to stis, we favor scattered light from an extended region near the agnas the explanation for the partial covering. as observed in prior x-ray and uvspectra, the uv absorption has velocities comparable to the x-ray absorption,but the bulk of the ultraviolet absorption is in a lower ionization state withlower total column density than the gas responsible for the x-ray absorption.variability compared to prior uv spectra lets us set limits on the location,density, mass flux, and kinetic energy of the outflowing gas. for component 1at $-400 \rm km s^{-1}$, the kinetic energy flux of both the uv and the x-rayoutflow is insufficient to have a significant impact on further evolution ofthe host galaxy.

1205.2559	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 x. lower limit on the distance of  the absorber from hst cos and stis spectroscopy	active galactic nuclei often show evidence of photoionized outflows. a majoruncertainty in models for these outflows is the distance ($r$) to the gas fromthe central black hole. in this paper we use the hst/cos data from a massivemulti-wavelength monitoring campaign on the bright seyfert i galaxy mrk 509, incombination with archival hst/stis data, to constrain the location of thevarious kinematic components of the outflow. we compare the expected responseof the photoionized gas to changes in ionizing flux with the changes measuredin the data using the following steps: 1) we compare the column densities ofeach kinematic component measured in the 2001 stis data with those measured inthe 2009 cos data; 2) we use time-dependent photionization calculations with aset of simulated lightcurves to put statistical upper limits on the hydrogennumber density that are consistent with the observed small changes in the ioniccolumn densities; 3) from the upper limit on the number density, we calculate alower limit on the distance to the absorber from the central source via theprior determination of the ionization parameter. our method offers twoimprovements on traditional timescale analysis. first, we account for thephysical behavior of agn lightcurves. second, our analysis accounts for thequality of measurement in cases where no changes are observed in the absorptiontroughs. the very small variations in trough ionic column densities (mostlyconsistent with no change) between the 2001 and 2009 epochs allow us to putstatistical lower limits on the distance between 100--200 pc for all the majoruv absorption components at a confidence level of 99%. these results are mainlyconsistent with the independent distance estimates derived for the warmabsorbers from the simultaneous x-ray spectra.

1209.6438	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 xii. broad band spectral analysis	(abridged) the simultaneous uv to x-rays/gamma rays data obtained during themulti-wavelength xmm/integral campaign on the seyfert 1 mrk 509 are used inthis paper and tested against physically motivated broad band models. eachobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model forthe continuum emission. prompted by the correlation between the uv and softx-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft x-rayexcess. the uv to x-rays/gamma-rays emission of mrk 509 can be well fitted bythese components. the presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum pointsto the existence of a hot (kt~100 kev), optically-thin (tau~0.5) coronaproducing the primary continuum. on the contrary, the soft x-ray componentrequires a warm (kt~1 kev), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. estimates of theamplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the"theoretical" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. aninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, apossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft x-rayexcess seen in agns. the temperature (~ 3 ev) and flux of the soft-photon fieldentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion diskdown to a transition radius $r_{tr}$ of 10-20 $r_g$. this plasma could be thewarm upper layer of the accretion disk. on the contrary the hot corona has amore photon-starved geometry. the high temperature ($\sim$ 100 ev) of thesoft-photon field entering and cooling it favors a localization of the hotcorona in the inner flow. this soft-photon field could be part of thecomptonised emission produced by the warm plasma. in this framework, the changein the geometry (i.e. $r_{tr}$) could explain most of the observed flux andspectral variability.

1301.1612	ism composition through x-ray spectroscopy of lmxbs	the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) is an integral part of the evolution ofthe entire galaxy. metals are produced by stars and their abundances are thedirect testimony of the history of stellar evolution. however, the interstellardust composition is not well known and the total abundances are yet to beaccurately determined. we probe ism dust composition, total abundances, andabundance gradients through the study of interstellar absorption features inthe high-resolution x-ray spectra of galactic low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs).we use high-quality grating spectra of nine lmxbs taken with xmm-newton. wemeasure the column densities of o, ne, mg, and fe with an empirical model andestimate the galactic abundance gradients. the column densities of the neutralgas species are in agreement with those found in the literature. solids are asignificant reservoir of metals like oxygen and iron. respectively, 15-25 % and65-90 % of the total amount of o i and fe i is found in dust. the dust amountand mixture seem to be consistent along all the lines-of-sight (los). ourestimates of abundance gradients and predictions of local interstellarabundances are in agreement with those measured at longer wavelengths. our workshows that x-ray spectroscopy is a very powerful method to probe the ism. forinstance, on a large scale the ism appears to be chemically homogeneous showingsimilar gas ionization ratios and dust mixtures. the agreement between theabundances of the ism and the stellar objects suggests that the local galaxy isalso chemically homogeneous.

1306.2330	the hot and energetic universe: astrophysics of feedback in local agn	understanding the astrophysics of feedback in active galactic nuclei (agn) iskey to understanding the growth and co-evolution of supermassive black holesand galaxies. agn-driven winds/outflows are potentially the most effective wayof transporting energy and momentum from the nuclear scales to the host galaxy,quenching star formation by sweeping away the gas reservoir. key questions inthis field are: 1) how do accretion disks around black holes launchwinds/outflows, and how much energy do these carry? 2) how are the energy andmetals accelerated in winds/outflows transferred and deposited into thecircumgalactic medium? x-ray observations are a unique way to address thesequestions because they probe the phase of the outflows which carries most ofthe kinetic energy. we show how a high throughput, high spectral resolutioninstrument like the x-ray integral field unit (x-ifu) on athena+ will allow usto address these questions by determining the physical parameters (ionizationstate, density, temperature, abundances, velocities, geometry, etc.) of theoutflows on a dynamical time-scale, in a broad sample of nearby bright agn. thex-ifu will also allow direct spectral imaging of the impact of these winds onthe host galaxy for local agn, forming a template for understanding agn athigher redshifts where wind shocks cannot be resolved.

1308.1555	the x-ray/uv absorber in ngc 4593	we present the results of a recent (march 2011) 160 ks chandra-letgsobservation of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4593, and the analysis of archival x-rayand uv spectra taken with xmm-newton and hst/stis in 2002. we find evidence ofa multi-component warm absorber (wa) in the x-rays with four distinctionisation degrees (log xi = 1.0, log xi = 1.7, log xi = 2.4, and log xi = 3.0)outflowing at several hundreds of km/s. in the uv we detect 15 kinematiccomponents in the absorbers, blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocityof the source, ranging from -60 km/s to -1520 km/s. although the predicted civand nv column densities from the low-ionisation x-ray outflow are in agreementwith those measured for some components in the stis spectrum, there arekinematic discrepancies that may prevent both the x-ray and uv absorbers fromoriginating in the same intervening gas. we derive upper limits on the locationof the absorbers finding that the high-ionisation gas lie within ~6 - 29 pcfrom the central ionising source, while the low-ionisation gas is located atseveral hundreds of pc. this is consistent with our line of sight passingthrough different parts of a stratified wind. the total kinetic energy of theoutflows injected into the surroundings of the host galaxy only accounts for atiny fraction of the bolometric luminosity of the source, and it is thereforeunlikely that they may cause a significant impact in the interstellar medium ofngc 4593 in a given single episode of activity.

1404.3863	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509. xiii. testing ionized-reflection  models on mrk 509	active galactic nuclei (agn) are the most luminous persistent objects in theuniverse. an excess of x-ray emission below about 2 kev, called soft-excess, isvery common in type 1 agn spectra. the origin of this feature remains debated.originally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities tomodel the soft-excess, including warm comptonization and blurred ionizedreflection. in this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on mrk 509, abright seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order todetermine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. we use tensimultaneous xmm-newton and integral observations performed every four days. wepresent here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of theparameters and the variability properties of the x-ray emission. theapplication of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strongreflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-bandspectrum of mrk 509. two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection arediscussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. in both cases we findthat the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating thatthe model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. alarge, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard x-rayscould be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. however, such achange does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.warm comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in thisobject. nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warmcomptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, onedominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk andthe corona.

1412.1171	astro-h white paper - agn winds	in this white paper we describe the prospects for astro-h for the study ofoutflows from active galactic nuclei. the most important breakthroughs in thisfield are expected to arise from the high spectral resolution and sensitivityin the fe-k band, combined with broad-band sensitivity over the full x-ray bandand spectral capabilities also at lower energies. the sensitivity in the fe-kregion allows to extend the absorption measure distribution of the outflow outto the highest ionisation states accessible, where observations with currentx-ray missions indicate that most of the outflowing gas is to be found. due tothe high-resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitiveproof for the existence of ultra-fast outflows, and if so, characterise theirphysical properties in great detail. these ultra-fast outflows carry very largeamounts of energy and momentum, and are of fundamental importance for feedbackstudies. we show how the astro-h observations in general can help to constrainnumerical models for outflows. the link to reflection and emission processes isalso discussed, as well as the possible relation between outflows andrelativistic emission lines. finally, we discuss the prospects for otherrelated categories of objects like bal quasars, partially covered sources andcompton thick outflows.

astro-ph;0307326	xmm-newton observation of the ulirg ngc 6240: the physical nature of the  complex fe k line emission	we report on an xmm-newton observation of the ultraluminous infrared galaxyngc 6240. the 0.3-10 kev spectrum can be successfully modelled with: (i) threecollisionally ionized plasma components with temperatures of about 0.7, 1.4,and 5.5 kev; (ii) a highly absorbed direct power-law component; and (iii) aneutral fe k_alpha and k_beta line. we detect a significant neutral columndensity gradient which is correlated with the temperature of the three plasmacomponents. combining the xmm-newton spectral model with the high spatialresolution chandra image we find that the temperatures and the column densitiesincrease towards the center.  with high significance, the fe k line complex is resolved into three distinctnarrow lines: (i) the neutral fe k_alpha line at 6.4 kev; (ii) an ionized lineat about 6.7 kev; and (iii) a higher ionized line at 7.0 kev (a blend of the fexxvi and the fe k_beta line). while the neutral fe k line is most probably dueto reflection from optically thick material, the fe xxv and fe xxvi emissionarises from the highest temperature ionized plasma component.  we have compared the plasma parameters of the ultraluminous infrared galaxyngc 6240 with those found in the local starburst galaxy ngc 253. we find astriking similarity in the plasma temperatures and column density gradients,suggesting a similar underlying physical process at work in both galaxies.

astro-ph;0410458	integral field spectroscopy of the ultraluminous x-ray source holmberg  ii x-1	we present optical integral field observations of the h ii region containingthe ultraluminous x-ray source holmberg ii x-1. we confirm the existence of anx-ray ionized nebula as the counterpart of the source due to the detection ofan extended he ii (4686a) region (21 x 47 pc) at the chandra acis-s position.an extended blue objects with a size of 11 x 14 pc is coincident with thex-ray/he ii region, which could indicate either a young stellar complex or acluster. we have derived an x-ray to optical luminosity ratio of lx/lb&gt;170, andpresumable it is lx/lb~300-400 using the recent hst acs data. we find a complexvelocity dispersion at the position of the ulx. in addition, there is a radialvelocity variation in the x-ray ionized region found in the he ii emission of+-50 km/s on spatial scales of 2-3 arcsec. we believe that the putative blackhole not only ionizes the surrounding hii gas, but also perturbs it dynamically(via jets or the accretion disk wind). the spatial analysis of the publicchandra acis-s data reveals a point-like x-ray source and marginal indicationof an extended component (&lt;&lt;15 % of the total flux). the xmm-newton epic-pnspectrum of hoii x-1 is best fitted with an absorbed power-law in addition toeither a thermal thick plasma or a thermal thin plasma or a multi-colour diskblack body (mcd). in all cases, the thermal component shows relatively lowtemperatures (kt~0.14-0.22 kev). finally we discuss the optical/x-rayproperties of hoii x-1 with regards to the possible nature of the source.

astro-ph;0508129	absorption and scattering by interstellar dust: xmm-newton observation  of cyg x-2	we present results of the xmm-newton observation on the bright x-ray binarycyg x-2. in our analysis we focus upon the absorption and scattering of thex-ray emission by interstellar dust. the scattering halo around cyg x-2,observed with the ccd detector epic-pn, is well detected up to ~7 arcmin andcontributes ~5-7% to the total source emission at 1 kev, depending on the dustsize distribution model considered. for the first time spatially resolvedspectroscopy of a scattering halo is performed. in the halo spectrum we clearlydetect the signature of the interstellar dust elements: o, mg, and si. thespectral modeling of the halo shows a major contribution of silicates (olivineand pyroxene). the spatial analysis of the halo shows that the dust is smoothlydistributed toward cyg x-2 at least for ~60% of the path to the source. withinthe instrumental limits, the data do not show preference for a specific dustsize distribution; namely the mathis, rumpl &amp; nordsieck (1977) or theweingartner &amp; draine (2001) model. we used the mie theory to compute thedifferential scattering cross section. the rgs data were used to investigatethe ism absorption, in particular the region of the oxygen edge. combining thergs results with the information on dust grains provided by the epic-pnspectrum of the halo we estimate a column density for dust absorption byoxygen, provided that it is locked in silicate grains (abridged).

astro-ph;0510552	an x-ray view of mrk 705: a borderline narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy	mrk 705 exhibits optical properties of both narrow- and broad-line seyfert 1galaxies. we examine the x-ray properties of this borderline object utilisingproprietary and public data from chandra, asca, rosat and rxte, spanning morethan twelve years. though long-term flux variability from the pointedobservations appears rather modest (about 3 times), we do find examples of rarelarge amplitude outbursts in the rxte monitoring data. there is very littleevidence of long-term spectral variability as the low- and high-energy spectraappear constant with time. a 6.4 kev emission line is detected in the ascaspectra of mrk 705, but not during the later, higher flux state chandraobservation. however, the upper limit on the equivalent width of a line in thechandra spectrum is consistent with a constant-flux emission line and abrighter continuum, suggesting that the line is emitted from distant materialsuch as the putative torus. overall, the x-ray properties of mrk 705 appeartypical of bls1 activity.

astro-ph;0606021	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy  ngc 4051 with chandra letgs	we study the absorption and emission properties of the photoionised gas nearone of the brightest and most variable agn, the seyfert galaxy ngc 4051, inorder to constrain the geometry, dynamics and ionisation structure of theoutflow. we analyse two observations taken with the low energy transmissiongrating spectrometer (letgs) of chandra. we study the spectra of bothobservations and investigate the spectral response to a sudden, long-lastingflux decrease of a factor of 5 that occurred during the second observation. weconfirm the preliminary detection of a highly ionised component with an outflowvelocity of -4500 km/s, one of the highest velocity outflow components seen ina seyfert 1 galaxy. the sudden drop in intensity by a factor of five during thesecond observation causes a drop in ionisation parameter of a similar magnitudein the strongest and main ionisation component (v = -610 km/s), allowing us forthe first time to determine the recombination time of this component andthereby its distance in a robust way. we find an upper limit to the distance of10^15 m, ruling out an origin in the narrow emission line region. in addition,an emission component producing strong radiative recombination continua of c viand c v appears during the low state. this can be explained by emission from anionised skin of the accretion disk at a distance of only ~4x10^12 m from theblack hole. finally, the spectra contain a broad relativistic o viii line withproperties similar to what was found before in this source with xmm-newton;this line has disappeared during the low flux state, consistent with thedisappearance of the inner part of the accretion disk during that low fluxstate.

astro-ph;0609385	x-ray/ultraviolet observing campaign of the markarian 279 active  galactic nucleus outflow: a close look at the absorbing/emitting gas with  chandra-letgs	we present a chandra-letgs observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279. thisobservation was carried out simultaneously with hst-stis and fuse, in thecontext of a multiwavelength study of this source. the chandra pointings werespread over ten days for a total exposure time of ~360 ks. the spectrum ofmrk279 shows evidence of broad emission features, especially at the wavelengthof the ovii triplet. we quantitatively explore the possibility that thisemission is produced in the broad line region (blr). we modeled the broad uvemission lines seen in the fuse and hst-stis spectra following the ``locallyoptimally emitting cloud" approach. we find that the x-ray lines luminosityderived from the best fit blr model can match the x-ray features, suggestingthat the gas producing the uv lines is sufficient to account also for the x-rayemission. the spectrum is absorbed by ionized gas whose total column density is~5x10^{20} cm^{-2}. the absorption spectrum can be modeled by two distinct gascomponents (log xi ~ 0.47 and 2.49, respectively) both showing a significantoutflow velocity. however, the data allow also the presence of intermediateionization components. the distribution of the column densities of such extracomponents as a function of the ionization parameter is not consistent with acontinuous, power law-like, absorber, suggesting a complex structure for thegas outflow for mrk 279 (abridged).

astro-ph;0610283	a longer xmm-newton look at i zwicky 1: variability of the x-ray  continuum, absorption, and iron kalpha line	we present the second xmm-newton observation (85 ks) of the narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) i zw 1 and describe its mean spectral and timingcharacteristics. on average, i zw 1 is ~35 per cent dimmer in 2005 than in theshorter (20 ks) 2002 observation. between the two epochs the intrinsicabsorption column density diminished, but there were also subtle changes in thecontinuum shape. considering the blurred ionised reflection model, thelong-term changes can be associated with a varying contribution of the powerlaw component relative to the total spectrum. examination of normalised lightcurves indicates that the high-energy variations are quite structured and thatthere are delays, but only in some parts of the light curve. interestingly, ahard x-ray lag first appears during the most-distinct structure in the meanlight curve, a flux dip ~25 ks into the observation. the previously discoveredbroad, ionised fe ka line shows significant variations over the course of the2005 observation. the amplitude of the variations is 25-45 per cent and theyare unlikely due to changes in the fe ka-producing region, but perhaps arisefrom orbital motion around the black hole or obscuration in the broad ironline-emitting region. the 2002 data are re-examined for variability of the feka line at that epoch. there is evidence of energy and flux variations that areassociated with a hard x-ray flare that occurred during that observation.

astro-ph;0702553	a longer xmm-newton look at i zwicky 1: physical conditions and  variability of the ionised absorbers	we present a spectral analysis of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy i zwicky1, focusing on the characteristics of the ionised absorbers as observed withxmm-newton in 2005. the soft x-ray spectrum shows absorption by two componentsof ionised gas with a similar column density (n_h~10^{21} cm^{-2}) andionisation parameters log\xi~0 and 2.5. comparing this observation with a 2002xmm-newton data set, we see a clear anti-correlation between the x-rayionisation parameter xi_x and the 0.1-10 kev luminosity. viable explanationsfor this effect include transient clouds or filaments crossing the line ofsight in a complex geometry or a gas observed in non-equilibrium. the outflowvelocity of the x-ray low-ionisation absorber is consistent with the outflow ofthe uv absorber detected in a past hubble space telescope observation. inaddition, the ionic column densities of civ and nv derived from the x-ray modelare consistent with the uv values. this suggests that the low-ionisationoutflowing gas may survive for many years, despite large changes in flux, andthat there is a tight connection between the x-ray and uv absorbers that canonly be confirmed with a simultaneous uv and x-ray observation.

astro-ph;0703360	a longer xmm-newton look at i zwicky 1: distinct modes of x-ray spectral  variability	the short-term spectral variability of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy izwicky 1 (i zw 1) as observed in an 85 ks xmm-newton observation is discussedin detail. i zw 1 shows distinct modes of variability prior to and after a fluxdip in the broad-band light curve. before the dip the variability can bedescribed as arising from changes in shape and normalisation of the spectralcomponents. only changes in normalisation are manifested after the dip. thechange in the mode of behaviour occurs on dynamically short timescales in i zw1. the data suggest that the accretion-disc corona in i zw 1 could have twocomponents that are co-existing. the first, a uniform, physically diffuseplasma responsible for the "typical'' long-term (e.g. years) behaviour; and asecond compact, centrally located component causing the rapid flux and spectralchanges. this compact component could be the base of a short or aborted jet assometimes proposed for radio-quiet active galaxies. modelling of the averageand time-resolved rms spectra demonstrate that a blurred compton-reflectionmodel can describe the spectral variability if we allow for pivoting of thecontinuum component prior to the dip.
