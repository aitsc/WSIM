0903.2072	a lack of close binaries among hot horizontal branch stars in globular  clusters - m80 and ngc5986	recent investigations have revealed a surprising lack of close binaries amongextreme horizontal branch (ehb) stars in the globular cluster ngc6752, atvariance with the analogous sdb field stars. another puzzling result concernsthe derived spectroscopic masses for some ehb stars. the present paper extendsour study of ngc6752 to m80 and ngc5986. twenty-one horizontal branch stars(out of which 5 ehbs) in ngc5986 and 31 in m80 (11 ehbs) were observed duringfour consecutive nights. we measured radial velocity variations, temperatures,gravities, and helium abundances. by means of a statistical analysis, wedetected one ehb close binary candidate per cluster. in m80, the best estimateof the close binary ehb fraction is f=12%, and even the lowest estimate of thebinary fraction among field sdb stars can be ruled out within a 90% confidencelevel. because of the small observed sample, no strong conclusions can be drawnon the close ehb binary fraction for ngc5986, although our best estimate israther low (f=25%). for the discrepancy in spectroscopic derived masses withtheoretical models observed in ngc6752, our analysis of m80 ehb stars shows asimilar trend. for the first time, we report a clear trend in surface heliumabundance with temperature. our results show that the deficiency of closebinaries among ehb stars is now confirmed in two, and possibly three, globularclusters. this feature is therefore not a peculiarity of ngc6752. our analysisalso proves that the strangely high spectroscopic masses among ehb stars arenow confirmed in at least a second cluster. our results confirm that f could bea function of the age of the sdb star population, but we find that recentmodels have some problem reproducing all observations.

0903.5182	a high resolution study of isotopic composition and chemical abundances  of blue horizontal branch stars in the globular clusters ngc6397 and ngc6752	large abundance anomalies have been previously detected in horizontal branchb-type stars. we present the first high resolution study of isotopic anomaliesand chemical abundances in six horizontal branch b-type stars in globularclusters ngc6397 and ngc6752 and compare them to those observed in hgmn stars.  we obtained high-resolution (up to r~115000) uves spectra of a representativesample of six b-type stars (t183, t191, t193, b652, b2151, b2206).  it is the first time an abundance analysis is performed for all elements forwhich spectral lines were detected in uves spectra of horizontal branch b-typestars. our study of these stars revealed no signs of he isotopic anomalieswhich would produce a ^3he/^4he ratio different from the solar one. theisotopic anomaly of ca is detected in all six studied stars. the chemicalabundance analysis reveals an overabundance over the solar values of p, ti, mn,fe, and y and an overabundance over the cluster metallicity of mg, ca, and cr.this behaviour is very similar in all six studied stars of both clusters with afew exceptions: the na abundance is by more than 1.4dex larger than the clustermetallicity in b652, and by more than 0.8dex larger than the clustermetallicity in b2206; the co abundance is 1.0dex over the solar abundance fort191, while zr is overabundant over the solar abundance by 0.4dex in b2206. nolines of hg or other heavy elements were observed in the spectra. weak emissionlines of ti ii, similar to those frequently observed in hgmn stars werediscovered in one horizontal branch b-type star t191. further, we detected aradial velocity change of 0.9km s^-1 from one night to the next for t183 and0.4km s^-1 for b2151.

0704.1430	the blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: genuine blue  stragglers or young stellar population?	abridged... blue stragglers (bss) are thought to be the product of eitherprimordial or collisional binary systems. in the context of dwarf spheroidalgalaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine bss population from youngmain sequence (ms) stars tracing a ~1-2 gyr old star forming episode. assumingthat their blue plume populations are made of bss, we estimate the bssfrequency for 8 local group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using acompilation of ground and space based photometry.  our results can be summarized as follows: (i) the bss frequency in dwarfgalaxies, at any given mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters ofsimilar luminosities; (ii) the bss frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarfgalaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the milky way halo;and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significantanti-correlation between the bss frequency and the galaxy mv.  the low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxysample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) anegligible production of collisional bss; and consequently (iii) that theirblue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. the dwarf galaxiesanti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying theanti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial bss rather thanyoung main sequence stars.

0909.2938	na-o anticorrelation and hb. vii. the chemical composition of first and  second-generation stars in 15 globular clusters from giraffe spectra	we present abundances of fe, na, and o for 1409 red giant stars in 15galactic globular clusters, derived from the homogeneous analysis of highresolution flames/giraffe spectra. combining the present data with previousresults, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largestand most homogeneous database of this kind to date. our gcs have [fe/h] from-2.4 to -0.4, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of thehorizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc). for all clusters we find the na-oanticorrelation, the classical signature of proton-capture reactions inh-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,now extinct. using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension ofthe na-o anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar populationin gcs: a primordial component (p) of first-generation stars, and 2 componentsof second-generation stars (intermediate i and extreme e populations from theirdifferent chemical composition). the p component is present in all gcs, and itsfraction is almost constant at about one third. the i component represents thebulk of the cluster population. the e component is not present in all gcs, andit is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. wediscuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in oursample and in two additional clusters (m3 and m13) from the literature. we alsofind that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum o andmaximum na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that isrepresented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity.this second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of pollutersand cluster mass.

0909.4785	radial distribution of the multiple stellar populations in omega  centauri	we present a detailed study of the radial distribution of the multiplepopulations identified in the galactic globular cluster omega cen. we used bothspace-based images (acs/wfc and wfpc2) and ground-based images (fors1@vlt andwfi@2.2m eso telescopes) to map the cluster from the inner core to theoutskirts (~20 arcmin). these data sets have been used to extract high-accuracyphotometry for the construction of color-magnitude diagrams and astrometricpositions of ~900 000 stars. we find that in the inner ~2 core radii the bluemain sequence (bms) stars slightly dominate the red main sequence (rms) innumber. at greater distances from the cluster center, the relative numbers ofbms stars with respect to rms drop steeply, out to ~8 arcmin, and then remainconstant out to the limit of our observations. we also find that the dispersionof the gaussian that best fits the color distribution within the bms issignificantly greater than the dispersion of the gaussian that best fits thecolor distribution within the rms. in addition, the relative number ofintermediate-metallicity red-giant-branch stars which includes the progeny ofthe bms) with respect to the metal-poor component (the progeny of the rms)follows a trend similar to that of the main-sequence star-count ration_bms/n_rms. the most metal-rich component of the red-giant branch follows thesame distribution as the intermediate-metallicity component. we briefly discussthe possible implications of the observed radial distribution of the differentstellar components in omega cen.

0704.1668	a new search for planet transits in ngc 6791	context. searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study theeffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.  aims. considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster ngc 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique.  methods. a ten-night observational campaign was performed using thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (3.6m), the san pedro m\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the loiano telescope (1.5m). to increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  results. should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in ngc 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by bruntt et al. (2003). theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  conclusions. possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. more extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in ngc 6791.

0707.4440	reaffirming the connection between the galactic stellar warp and the  canis major overdensity	we perform a critical re-analysis and discussion of recent results presentedin the literature which interpret the cma overdensity as the signature of anaccreting dwarf galaxy or a new substructure within the galaxy. several issuesare addressed. we show that arguments against the ``warp'' interpretation arebased on an erroneous perception of the milky way. there is nothing anomalouswith colour--magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp mid-planebeing different. we witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population,first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discardedas a normal disc population. similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outerthin+thick disc metallicities being low (-1&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.5), and spiral arms (aspart of the thin disc) should, and do, warp. most importantly, we showunambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellaroverdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in cma.the cmaover-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by galacticmodels without new substructures. given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerningthe properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction anddegeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough tosupport the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure withinthe milky way disc.

0708.1521	spectroscopy of horizontal branch stars in ngc6752 - anomalous results  on atmospheric parameters and masses	we used the eso vlt-fors2 facility to collect low-resolution spectra of 51targets distributed along the horizontal branch. we determined atmosphericparameters by comparison with theoretical models through standard fittingroutines, and masses by basic equations. results are in general in goodagreement with previous works, although not always with theoreticalexpectations for cooler stars (teff&lt;15000 k). the calculated color excess issystematically lower than literature values, pointing towards a possibleunderestimation of effective temperatures. moreover, we find two groups ofstars at teff=14000 k and at teff=27000$ k that present anomalies with respectto the general trend and expectations. we suppose that the three peculiarbright stars at teff=14000 k are probably affected by an enhanced stellar wind.for the eight extreme horizontal branch stars at teff=27000 k which showunusually high masses we find no plausible explanation. while most of ourresults agree well with the predictions of standard horizontal branchevolution, we still have problems with the low masses we derive in certaintemperature ranges. we believe that kurucz atlas9 lte model atmospheres withsolar-scaled abundances are probably inadequate for these temperature ranges.concerning the group of anomalous stars at teff=27000 k, a kolmogorov-smirnovtest indicates that there is only an 8.4% probability that these stars arerandomly drawn from the general distribution in the color-magnitude diagram.this is not conclusive but points out that these stars could be both (andindependently) spectroscopically and photometrically peculiar with respect tothe general extreme horizontal branch population.

1006.5866	detailed abundances of a large sample of giant stars in m 54 and in the  sagittarius nucleus	homogeneous abundances of light elements, alpha and fe-group elements fromhigh-resolution flames spectra are presented for 76 red giant stars in m54, amassive globular cluster (gc) lying in the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy. we also derived detailed abundances for 27 red giants belonging to thesgr nucleus. our abundances assess the intrinsic metallicity dispersion (~0.19dex, rms scatter) of m54, with the bulk of stars peaking at [fe/h]~-1.6 and along tail extending to higher metallicities, similar to omega cen. the spreadin these probable nuclear star clusters exceeds those of most gcs: thesemassive clusters are located in a region intermediate between normal gcs anddwarf galaxies. m54 shows the na-o anticorrelation, typical signature of gcs,which is instead absent in the sgr nucleus. the light elements (mg, al, si)participating to the high temperature mg-al cycle show that the pattern of(anti)correlations produced by proton-capture reactions in h-burning is clearlydifferent between the most metal-rich and most metal-poor components in the twomost massive gcs in the galaxy, confirming early result based on the na-oanticorrelation. as in omega cen, stars affected by most extreme processing,i.e. showing the signature of more massive polluters, are those of themetal-rich component. this can be understood if the burst of star formationgiving birth to the metal-rich component was delayed by as much as 10-30 myrwith respect to the metal-poor one. the evolution of these massive gcs can bereconciled in the general scenario for the formation of gcs sketched incarretta et al.(2010a) taking into account that omega cen could have alreadyincorporated the surrounding nucleus of its progenitor and lost the rest of thehosting galaxy while the two are still observable as distinct components in m54and the surrounding field.

1007.5301	abundances for a large sample of red giants in ngc 1851: hints for a  merger of two clusters?	we present the abundance analysis of a sample of more than 120 red giants inthe globular cluster (gc) ngc 1851, based on flames spectra. we find a smallbut detectable metallicity spread. this spread is compatible with the presenceof two different groups of stars with a metallicity difference of 0.06-0.08dex, in agreement with earlier photometric studies. if stars are divided intothese two groups according to their metallicity, both components show a na-oanticorrelation (signature of a genuine gc nature) of moderate extension. themetal-poor stars are more concentrated than the metal-rich ones. we tentativelypropose the hypothesis that ngc 1851 formed from a merger of two individual gcswith a slightly different fe and alpha-element content, and possibly an agedifference up to 1 gyr. this is supported also by number ratios of stars on thesplit subgiant and on the bimodal horizontal branches. the distribution ofn-capture process elements in the two components also supports the idea thatthe enrichment must have occurred in each of the structures separately, and notas a continuum of events in a single gc. the most probable explanation is thatthe proto-clusters formed into a (now dissolved) dwarf galaxy and later mergedto produce the present gc.

1102.1699	a lack of close binaries among hot horizontal branch stars in globular  clusters. ii. ngc\,2808	models based on their binary origin have been very successful in reproducingthe properties of field subdwarf-b stars, but the observations of theiranalogues in globular clusters has posed new problems, while the discovery ofmultiple populations offered an appealing alternative scenario for theformation of these stars. we search for binaries of period p&lt;200 days among asample of blue horizontal branch stars (teff=12000-22000 k) in ngc2808, acluster known to host three distinct stellar populations and a multimodalhorizontal branch. the final sample consists of 64 targets. the radial velocityof the targets was measured in fourteen epochs, spanning a temporal interval ofabout 75 days. we detect no rv variable object among stars cooler than thephotometric g1 gap at 17000 k, while two close (p&lt;10 days) and twointermediate-period (p=10-50 days) systems are found among hotter targets. theclose and intermediate-period binary fraction for stars cooler than the gap arefc&lt;5% and fip&lt;10%, respectively, with 95% confidence. the most probable valuesamong hotter stars are fc~20% and fip~30%, but the 90%- confidence levelintervals are large (6-42% and 11-72%, respectively). the g1 gap appears as adiscontinuity in the binary faction, with a higher incidence of binaries amonghotter stars, but a constant increase in f with temperature rather than adiscontinuity cannot be excluded from our observations. we find thatintermediate-period binaries, never investigated before among cluster hb stars,could play an important role, being more than ~15-20% of the hottest stars ofour sample. our results indicate that fc among hot hb stars is most probablyhigher for younger clusters, confirming the recently proposed age-fc relation.however, the large observed difference in binary fraction between clusters(e.g. ngc2808 and ngc6752) is still not reproduced by binary populationsynthesis models.

1307.4085	ngc 362: another globular cluster with a split red giant branch	we obtained flames giraffe+uves spectra for both first and second-generationred giant branch (rgb) stars in the globular cluster (gc) ngc 362 and used themto derive abundances of 21 atomic species for a sample of 92 stars. thesurveyed elements include proton-capture (o, na, mg, al, si), alpha-capture(ca, ti), fe-peak (sc, v, mn, co, ni, cu), and neutron-capture elements (y, zr,ba, la, ce, nd, eu, dy). the analysis is fully consistent with that presentedfor twenty gcs in previous papers of this series. stars in ngc 362 seem to beclustered into two discrete groups along the na-o anti-correlation, with a gapat [o/na] 0 dex. na-rich, second generation stars show a trend to be morecentrally concentrated, although the level of confidence is not very high. whencompared to the classical second-parameter twin ngc 288, with similarmetallicity, but different horizontal branch type and much lower total mass,the proton-capture processing in stars of ngc 362 seems to be more extreme,confirming previous analysis. we discovered the presence of a secondary rgbsequence, redder than the bulk of the rgb: a preliminary estimate shows thatthis sequence comprises about 6% of rgb stars. our spectroscopic data andliterature photometry indicate that this sequence is populated almostexclusively by giants rich in ba, and probably rich in all s-process elements,as found in other clusters. in this regards, ngc 362 joins previously studiedgcs like ngc 1851, ngc 6656 (m 22), and ngc 7089 (m 2).

0801.4661	the embedded cluster dbsb48 in the nebula hoffleit18: comparison with  trumpler14	we derive fundamental parameters of the embedded cluster dbsb48 in thesouthern nebula hoffleit18 and the very young open cluster trumpler14, by meansof deep jhks infrared photometry. we build colour-magnitude and colour-colourdiagrams to derive reddening and age, based on main sequence and pre-mainsequence distributions. radial stellar density profiles are used to studycluster structure and guide photometric diagram extractions. field-stardecontamination is applied to uncover the intrinsic cluster sequences in thediagrams. ages are inferred from k-excess fractions. a prominentpre-main-sequence population is present in dbsb48, and the k-excess fractionf_k=55+/-6% gives an age of 1.1+/-0.5myr. a mean reddening of a_k_s=0.9+/-0.03was found, corresponding to $a_v=8.2\pm0.3$. the cluster cmd is consistent withthe far kinematic distance of 5 kpc for hoffleit 18. for trumpler 14 we derivedsimilar parameters as in previous studies in the optical, in particular an ageof $1.7\pm0.7$ myr. the fraction of stars with infrared excess in trumpler 14is $f_k=28\pm4%$. despite the young ages, both clusters are described by a kingprofile with core radii $\rc=0.46\pm0.05$ pc and $\rc=0.35\pm0.04$ pc,respectively for dbsb 48 and trumpler 14. such cores are smaller than those oftypical open clusters. small cores are probably related to the clusterformation and/or parent molecular cloud fragmentation. in dbsb 48, themagnitude extent of the upper main sequence is $\delta \ks\approx2$ mag, whilein trumpler 14 it is $\delta \ks\approx5$ mag, consistent with the estimatedages.

1401.7109	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. iv. m22	we obtained high-resolution spectra for 94 candidate stars belonging to thehb of m22 with flames. the hb stars we observed span a restricted temperaturerange (7,800&lt;teff&lt;11,000 k), where about 60% of the hb stars of m22 are. withinour sample, we can distinguish three groups of stars segregated (thoughcontiguous) in colours: group 1 (49 stars) is metal-poor, n-normal, na-poor ando-rich with abundances that match those determined for the primordial group ofrgb stars from previous studies. group 2 (23 stars) is still metal-poor, but itis n- and na-rich, though only very mildly depleted in o. we can identify thisintermediate group as the progeny of the metal-poor rgb stars that occupy anintermediate location along the na-o anti-correlation. the third group (20stars) is metal-rich, na-rich, and o-rich and likely corresponds to the mosto-rich component of the previously found metal-rich rgb population. we did notobserve any severely o-depleted stars and we think that the progeny of thesestars falls on the hotter part of the hb. the metal-rich population is alsoover-abundant in sr, in agreement with results for corresponding rgb and sgbstars. however, we do not find any significant variation in the ratio betweenthe sum of n and o abundances to fe. there is some evidence of an enhancementof he content for groups 2 and 3 stars (y=0.338\pm 0.014\pm 0.05). our resultsagree with the proposition that chemical composition drives the location ofstars along the hb of a gc. furthermore, we found a number of fast rotators.they are concentrated in a restricted temperature range along the hb of m22.

1408.5754	on the hi-hole and agb stellar population of the sagittarius dwarf  irregular galaxy	using two hst/acs data-sets that are separated by ~2 years has allowed us toderive the relative proper-motion for the sagittarius dwarf irregular (sagdig)and reduce the heavy foreground galactic contamination. the proper-motiondecontaminated sagdig catalog provides a much clearer view of the youngred-supergiant and intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch populations. wereport the identification of 3 milky way carbon-rich dwarf stars, probablybelonging to the thin disk, and pointing to the high incidence of this class atlow galactic latitudes. a sub-group of 4 oxygen-rich candidate stars depicts afaint, red extension of the well-defined sagdig carbon-rich sequence. theorigin of these oxygen-rich candidate stars remains unclear, reflecting theuncertainty in the ratio of carbon/oxygen rich stars. sagdig is also a gas-richgalaxy characterized by a single large cavity in the gas disk (hi-hole), whichis offset by ~360 pc from the optical centre of the galaxy. we nonethelessinvestigate the stellar feedback hypothesis by comparing the proper-motioncleaned stellar populations within the hi-hole with appropriately selectedcomparison regions, having higher hi densities external to the hole. thecomparison shows no significant differences. in particular, the centre of thehi-hole (and the comparison regions) lack stellar populations younger than ~400myr, which are otherwise abundant in the inner body of the galaxy. we concludethat there is no convincing evidence that the sagdig hi-hole is the result ofstellar feedback, and that gravitational and thermal instabilities in the gasare the most likely mechanism for its formation.

1503.05925	lithium abundances in globular cluster giants: ngc 1904, ngc 2808, and  ngc 362	the presence of multiple populations in globular clusters has been wellestablished thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy. it is widely accepted thatdistinct populations are a consequence of different stellar generations:intra-cluster pollution episodes are required to produce the peculiar chemistryobserved in almost all clusters. unfortunately, the progenitors responsiblehave left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. toconstrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminiumabundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: ngc~1904, ngc~2808,and ngc~362. the present investigation along with our previous analysis of m12and m5 affords us the largest database of simultaneous determinations of li andal abundances. our results indicate that li production has occurred in each ofthe three clusters. in ngc~362 we detected an m12-like behaviour, with firstand second-generation stars sharing very similar li abundances favouring aprogenitor that is able to produce li, such as agb stars. multiple progenitortypes are possible in ngc~1904 and ngc~2808, as they possess both anintermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars andalso an extreme population, that is enriched in al but depleted in li. a simpledilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. finally, the internalli variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element isa function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relativelymetal-rich clusters are more adept at producing li.

astro-ph;0201159	the sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy: metallicity and stellar  populations	we present deep $bvi$ observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy uks1927-177in sagittarius. statistically cleaned $v$, $(b-i)$ cmds clearly display the keyevolutionary features in this galaxy. previously detected c stars are locatedin the cmds and shown to be variable, thus confirming the presence of asignificant upper-agb intermediate age population. a group of likely redsupergiants is also identified, whose magnitude and color is consistent with a30 myr old burst of star formation. the observed colors of both blue and redstars in sagdig are best explained by introducing a differential reddeningscenario in which internal dust extinction affects the star forming regions.adopting a low reddening for the red giants, $e(b-v) = 0.07 \pm 0.02$, gives[fe/h]=$-2.1 \pm 0.2$ for the mean stellar metallicity, a value consistent withthe [o/h] abundance measured in the hii regions. this revised metallicity,which is in accord with the trend of metallicity against luminosity for dwarfirregular galaxies, is indicative of a ``normal'', although metal-poor, dirrgalaxy. a quantitative description is given of the spatial distribution ofstars in different age intervals, in comparison with the distribution of theneutral hydrogen. we find that the youngest stars are located near the majorpeaks of emission on the hi shell, whereas the red giants and intermediate-agec stars define an extended halo or disk with scale length comparable to thesize of the hydrogen cloud. the relationship between the distribution of ismand star formation is briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0505201	precise reddening and metallicity of ngc6752 from flames spectra	(abridged) accurate reddenings for globular clusters could be obtained bycomparing the colour-temperature obtained using temperatures fromreddening-free indicator (halpha), with that given by standardcolour-temperature calibrations. from a single 1300 seconds exposure withflames at vlt2 we obtained spectra centred on halpha (r=6000, 5&lt;s/n&lt;50) for 120stars near the turn-off of ngc6752. this set of spectra was used to deriveeffective temperatures from fittings of halpha profiles with typical errors ofabout +/- 200 k and reddening estimates with individual errors of 0.05 mag.averaging all individual reddenings, a high precision reddening estimate hasbeen obtained for the cluster: e(b-v)=0.046 +/- 0.005. the same exposureprovided uves spectra of seven stars near the red giant branch bump (r=40000,20&lt;s/n&lt;40) that provided fe abundances with internal errors of 0.026 dex, andwith average metallicity [fe/h]= -1.48 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.06 dex (random +systematic). abundances were obtained for several other elements, allowing e.g.an accurate estimate of the ratio between the alpha-elements and fe([alpha/fe]=+0.27 +/- 0.01). the o-na anticorrelation is evident from our uvesdata, in agreement with past results. this analysis shows the power of flamesfor analysis of globular clusters: the accurate reddenings and metal abundancesobtained by a procedure like that described here, combined with distancedeterminations from cluster dynamics or main sequence fitting, and high qualitycolour-magnitude diagrams, could allow derivation of ages with errors below 1gyr for individual globular clusters.

astro-ph;0505399	hst/acs observations of the old and metal-poor sagittarius dwarf  irregular galaxy	we have obtained deep color-magnitude diagrams of the sagittarius dwarfirregular galaxy with the hst/acs. the new diagrams unveil for the first timethe star formation history of sagdig.  we identify a small population of red horizontal branch stars, which sets thefirst epoch of star formation in sagdig back to ~9-10 gyr ago. this shows thatsagdig has been able to maintain a very low mean metallicity (-2.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-1.9)over a 10 gyr life time, and most importantly, that all local group dwarfgalaxies share an ancient (~10 gyr) initial episode of star formation. thus, atthe moment, izw18 remains the only exception to this general trend, favoringthe so-called ``young galaxy'' scenario. however, a re-analysis of acsobservations of izw18 suggests that an older rgb population may be present alsoin izw18.  we also compare the distribution of atomic hydrogen with that of stellarpopulations of various ages. we find little correlation between stellarpopulations older than ~1 gyr and the hi. in particular we fail to find anygeneration of stars that preferentially lie within the large hi hole. wetherefore exclude the possibility that the sagdig ring-like hi distribution isthe result of multiple supernova events. alternative scenarios have to beexplored.

astro-ph;0512539	spectroscopic search for binaries among ehb stars in globular clusters	we performed a spectroscopic search for binaries among hot horizontal branchstars in globular clusters. we present final results for a sample of 51 starsin ngc6752, and preliminary results for the first 15 stars analyzed in m80. theobserved stars are distributed along all the hbs in the range 8000 &lt; teff &lt;32000 k, and have been observed during four nights. radial velocity variationshave been measured with the cross-correlation technique. we carefully analyzedthe statistical and systematic errors associated with the measurements in orderto evaluate the statistical significance of the observed variations. no closebinary system has been detected, neither among cooler stars nor among thesample of hot ehb stars (18 stars with teff &gt; 22000 k in ngc6752). the datacorrected for instrumental effects indicate that the radial velocity variationsare always below the 3sigma level of ~15 km/s. these results are in sharpcontrast with those found for field hot subdwarfs, and open new questions aboutthe formation of ehb stars in globular clusters, and possibly of the fieldsubdwarfs.

astro-ph;0602629	abundance anomalies in ngc 2808	we present metallicity measurements of 25 stars in the blue horizontal branchof the galactic globular cluster ngc 2808. our measurements are based onmoderate-resolution spectra taken with the multi-object fiber facilityflames-uves, mounted on kueyen at the very large telescope. we confirm thatstars hotter than a threshold temperature have super-solar abundance, while thecooler ones respect the nominal metallicity of the cluster, i.e. [fe/h] ~ -1.1.the threshold temperature is estimated to be about 12000 k, corresponding tothe so called u-jump, and coincides with the sudden departure of the clusterhorizontal branch from the models. the metallicity increases with temperaturefor star hotter than the jump, confirming the hypothesis that the processresponsible for this abrupt metallic enhancement is the levitation due to thestrong radiation field in absence of a significative convective envelope. ametallicity dependence of the abundance enhancement is also suggested, withmore metal poor clusters having a higher increase in metal content. the slopein the temperature vs. abundance diagram is higher than the errors involved,and the metal content of the cluster plays possibly a role in determining theamplitude of the jump (more metal poor clusters show more enhancement after thejump), although other parameters, such as clusters' characteristics and eventhe atomic species involved, may also someway contribute.

astro-ph;0603385	outer structure of the galactic warp and flare: explaining the canis  major over-density	(abridged) we derive the structure of the galactic stellar warp and flareusing 2mass rc and rgb stars, selected at mean heliocentric distances of 3, 7and 17 kpc.  our results are: (i) a clear stellar warp signature is derived for the 3selected rings; (ii) the derived stellar warp is consistent (both in amplitudeand phase-angle) with that for the galactic interstellar dust and hi gas; (iii)the sun seems not to fall on the line of nodes. the stellar warp phase-angleorientation (+15 degrees) is close to the orientation angle of the galactic barand this produces an asymmetric warp for the inner rings; (iv) anorthern/southern warp symmetry is observed only for the ring at 17 kpc; (v)treating a mixture of thin and thick disk populations we trace the disk flaringand derive a constant scale-height (~0.65 kpc) within r(gc)~15 kpc. furtherout, the disk flaring increase gradually reaching a mean scale-height of ~1.5kpc at r(gc)~23 kpc; and (vi) these results provide further robust evidencethat there is no disk radial truncation at r(gc)~14 kpc.  in the particular case of the canis major over-density we confirm itscoincidence with the southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l=240. wepresent evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density,radial velocities, proper motion etc) of cma are consistent with it being anormal milky way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for amore complex interpretations of its origin. the present analysis does notprovide a conclusive test of the structure or origin of the monoceros ring.nevertheless, we show that a warped flared milky way contributes significantlyat the locations of the monoceros ring.
