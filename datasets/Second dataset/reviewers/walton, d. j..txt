1008.2157	a reflection origin for the soft and hard x-ray excess of ark 120	over the last few years several models have been proposed to interpret thewidespread soft excess observed in the x-ray spectra of type 1 active galacticnuclei (agn). in particular, reflection from the photoionized accretion discblurred by relativistic effects has proven to be successful in reproducing boththe spectral shape and the variability pattern of many sources. as a furthertest to this scenario we present the analysis of a recent ~100 ks long suzakuobservation of arakelian 120, a prototypical 'bare' seyfert 1 galaxy in whichno complex absorption system is expected to mimic a soft excess or mask theintrinsic properties of this key component. we show that a reflection modelallowing for both warm/blurred and cold/distant reprocessing provides aself-consistent and convincing interpretation of the broadband x-ray emissionof ark 120, also characterized by a structured iron feature and a high-energyhump. although warm absorbers, winds/outflows and multiple comptonizing regionsmay play significant roles in sources with more spectral complexity, this casestudy adds evidence to the presence of blurred disc reflection as a basiccomponent of the x-ray spectra of type 1 agn.

1101.4541	comparing spectral models for ulxs with ngc 4517 ulx1	we present the previously unanalysed high quality xmm-newton spectrum of anultraluminous x-ray source candidate in ngc 4517. as with other high qualityulx spectra, a downturn in the spectrum is observed at ~6 kev. both of therecent disc reflection and comptonisation interpretations of this feature areapplied, in order to present a direct comparison, and are found to providestatistically equivalent representations of the current data. we find that thereflection model requires the accretion disc to have a highly super-solar ironabundance, while the comptonisation model requires low temperature comptonisingelectrons, and for the corona to be optically thick. these physicalrequirements are discussed in detail, and physically motivated scenarios arehighlighted in which each model can be considered a viable explanation for theobserved emission. by extending our consideration of these two interpretationsto high energies, we demonstrate that observations of ulxs at energies above~10 kev should be extremely useful when attempting to distinguish between them.with current instrumentation, it is only viable to perform these observationsfor m82 x-1, but future high angular resolution hard x-ray imagingspectrometers, such as the hard x-ray imaging system due to fly on astro-h,should go a long way to resolving this issue.

1106.0197	2xmm ultraluminous x-ray source candidates in nearby galaxies	ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) are some of the most enigmatic x-raybright sources known to date. it is generally accepted that they cannot hostblack holes as large as those associated with active galaxies, but they appearto be significantly more luminous than their better understood galactic x-raybinary (xrb) cousins, while displaying an intriguing combination of differencesand similarities with them. through studying large, representative samples ofthese sources we may hope to enhance our understanding of them. to this end, wederive a large catalogue of 650 x-ray detections of 470 ulx candidates, locatedin 238 nearby galaxies, by cross correlating the 2xmm serendipitous survey withthe third reference catalogue of bright galaxies. the presented dedicatedcatalogue offers a significant improvement over those previously published bothin terms of number and the contribution of background contaminants, e.g.distant quasars, which we estimate to be at most 24 per cent, but more likely~17 per cent. to undertake population studies, we define a `complete'sub-sample of sources compiled from observations of galaxies with sensitivitylimits below 10^39 erg/s. the luminosity function of this sample is consistentwith a simple power-law. although we do not find any statistical requirementfor a high luminosity cut-off, as has been reported previously, we are not ableto rule out its presence. also, we find that the number of ulxs per unit galaxymass decreases with increasing galaxy mass for ulxs associated with spiralgalaxies, in broad agreement with previous results, but is consistent withbeing constant with galaxy mass for sources associated with ellipticalgalaxies.

1110.6226	x-ray spectral variability in ngc 3783	ngc 3783 was observed for approximately 210ks by suzaku and in this timeshowed significant spectral and flux variability at both short (20ks) and long(100ks) time scales. the full observation is found to consist of approximatelysix "spectral periods" where the behaviour of the soft (0.3-1.0kev) and hard(2-10kev) bands are somewhat distinct. using a variety of methods we find thatthe strong warm absorber present in this source does not change on these timescales, confirming that the broad-band variability is intrinsic to the centralsource. the time resolved difference-spectra are well modelled with an absorbedpowerlaw below 10kev, but show an additional hard excess at ~20kev in thelatter stages of the observation. this suggests that, in addition to thevariable powerlaw, there is a further variable component that varies with timebut not monotonically with flux. we show that a likely interpretation is thatthis further component is associated with variations in the reflection fractionor possibly ionization state of the accretion disk a few gravitational radiifrom the black hole.

1202.5193	the similarity of broad iron lines in x-ray binaries and active galactic  nuclei	we have compared the 2001 xmm-newton spectra of the stellar mass black holebinary xte j1650-500 and the active galaxy mgc-6-30-15, focusing on the broad,excess emission features at ~4--7 kev displayed by both sources. such featuresare frequently observed in both low mass x-ray binaries and active galacticnuclei. for the former case it is generally accepted that the excess arises dueto iron emission, but there is some controversy over whether their width ispartially enhanced by instrumental processes, and hence also over the intrinsicbroadening mechanism. meanwhile, in the latter case, the origin of this featureis still subject to debate; physically motivated reflection and absorptioninterpretations are both able to reproduce the observed spectra. in this workwe make use of the contemporaneous bepposax data to demonstrate that thebreadth of the excess observed in xte j1650-500 is astrophysical rather thaninstrumental, and proceed to highlight the similarity of the excesses presentin this source and mgc-6-30-15. both optically thick accretion discs andoptically thin coronae, which in combination naturally give rise torelativistically-broadened iron lines when the disc extends close to the blackhole, are commonly observed in both class of object. the simplest solution isthat the broad emission features present arise from a common process, which weargue must be reflection from the inner regions of an accretion disc around arapidly rotating black hole; for xte j1650-500 we find spin constraints of 0.84&lt; a* &lt; 0.98 at the 90 per cent confidence level. other interpretations proposedfor agn add potentially unnecessary complexities to the theoretical frameworkof accretion in strong gravity.

1204.4451	investigating the reflection contribution to the x-ray emission of ton  s180	there is now growing evidence that the soft x-ray excess is almost ubiquitousamong unobscured active galaxies. in spite of the various interpretations thathave been considered in the last years, the nature of this foremost spectralfeature is not firmly established yet. in this context, we review from areflection perspective the three highest-quality x-ray observations of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy tonantzintla s180, obtained by xmm-newton andsuzaku. the x-ray spectrum of ton s180 shows only moderate variations over atime span of several years, suggesting that the same physical process accountsfor the bulk of the broad-band x-ray emission at the different epochs, and thatthe properties of the x-ray source are fairly stable. we have successfullyapplied in our spectral analysis a dual-reflector model, consisting of twoseparate components: one arises from the surface of the accretion disc, ishighly ionized and blurred by relativistic effects; the other is cold, quitefaint, and can be associated with a distant reprocessor. due to the strengthand the nearly power-law shape of its soft excess emission, ton s180 is one ofthe most challenging sources to test the x-ray reflection scenario. in thiswork we provide a clear illustration of the great potential and spectralflexibility of blurred reflection models, while discussing some of theircurrent limitations and possible shortcomings.

(2011) using a variety of phenomenological models. were-examine the spectrum with a self-consistent relativistic reflection model. anarrow absorption line near 7.2 kev may be present, which if real is likely thefe xxvi absorption line arising from highly ionised, rapidly outflowing discwind. the blue shift of this feature corresponds to a velocity of about 11100km/s, which is much larger than the typical values seen in stellar-mass blackholes. given that we also find the source to have a low inclination (i &lt; 32degrees; close to face-on), we would therefore be seeing through the very baseof outflow. this could be a possible explanation for the unusually highvelocity. we use a reflection model combined with a relativistic convolutionkernel which allows for both prograde and retrograde black hole spin, and treatthe potential absorption feature with a physical model for a photo-ionisedplasma. in this manner, assuming the disc is not truncated, we could onlyconstrain the spin of the black hole in xte j1652-453 to be less than ~ 0.5jc/gm^{2} at the 90% confidence limit.

1207.3839	searching for massive outflows in holmberg ix x-1 and ngc 1313 x-1: the  iron k band	we have analysed all the good quality xmm-newton data publicly available forthe bright ulxs holmberg ix x-1 and ngc 1313 x-1, with the aim of searching fordiscrete emission or absorption features in the fe k band that could provideobservational evidence for the massive outflows predicted if these sources areaccreting at substantially super-eddington rates. we do not find statisticallycompelling evidence for any atomic lines, and the limits that are obtained haveinteresting consequences. any features in the immediate fe k energy band (6-7kev) must have equivalent widths weaker than ~30 ev for holmberg ix x-1, andweaker than ~50 ev for ngc 1313 x-1 (at 99 per cent confidence). in comparisonto the sub-eddington outflows observed in grs 1915+105, which imprint ironabsorption features with equivalent widths of ~30 ev, the limits obtained hereappear quite stringent, particularly when holmberg ix x-1 and ngc 1313 x-1 mustbe expelling at least 5-10 times as much material if they host black holes ofsimilar masses. the difficulty in reconciling these observational limits withthe presence of strong line-of-sight outflows suggests that either thesesources are not launching such outflows, or that they must be directed awayfrom our viewing angle.

1208.3277	evidence of light-bending effects and its implication for spectral state  transitions	it has long been speculated that the nature of the hard x-ray corona may bean important second driver of black hole state transitions, in addition to themass accretion rate through the disk. however, a clear physical picture ofcoronal changes has not yet emerged. we present results from a systematicanalysis of rossi x-ray timing explorer observations of the stellar mass blackhole binary xte j1650-500. all spectra with significant hard x-ray detectionswere fit using a self-consistent, relativistically-blurred disk reflectionmodel suited to high ionization regimes. importantly, we find evidence thatboth the spectral and timing properties of black hole states may be partiallydriven by the height of the x-ray corona above the disk, and related changes inhow gravitational light bending affects the corona--disk interaction.specifically, the evolution of the power-law, thermal disk, andrelativistically--convolved reflection components in our spectral analysisindicate that: (1) the disk inner radius remains constant at \rin$=1.65\pm0.08gm/c^2$ (consistent with values found for the isco of xte j1650-500 in otherworks) throughout the transition from the \textit{brighter} phases of thelow-hard state to the intermediate states (both the hard-intermediate andsoft-intermediate), through to the soft state and back; (2) the ratio betweenthe observed reflected x-ray flux and power-law continuum (the "reflectionfraction", r) increases sharply at the transition between the hard-intermediateand soft-intermediate states ("ballistic" jets are sometimes launched at thistransition); (3) both the frequency and coherence of the high-frequencyquasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) observed in xte j1650-500 increase with r.we discuss our results in terms of black hole states and the nature of blackhole accretion flows across the mass scale.

1208.4502	the nature of the bright ulx x-2 in ngc3921: a chandra position and hst  candidate counterpart	we report on chandra observations of the bright ultra-luminous x-ray (ulx)source in ngc3921. previous xmm observations reported in the literature showthe presence of a bright ulx at a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 2x10^40 erg/s. ourchandra observation finds the source at a lower luminosity of ~8x10^39 erg/s,furthermore, we provide a chandra position of the ulx accurate to 0.7" at 90%confidence. the x-ray variability makes it unlikely that the high luminosity iscaused by several separate x-ray sources. in 3 epochs of archival hubble spacetelescope (hst) observations we find a candidate counterpart to the ulx. thereis direct evidence for variability between the two epochs of wfpc2 f814wobservations with the observation obtained in 2000 showing a brighter source.furthermore, converting the 1994 f336w and 2000 f300w wfpc2 and the 2010 f336wwfc3 observations to the johnson u-band filter assuming a spectral type of o7iwe find evidence for a brightening of the u-band light in 2000. using thehigher resolution wfc3 observations the candidate counterpart is resolved intotwo sources of similar color. we discuss the nature of the ulx and the probableassociation with the optical counterpart(s). finally, we investigate apotential new explanation for some (bright) ulxs as the decaying stages offlares caused by the tidal disruption of a star by a recoiled supermassiveblack hole. however, we find that there should be at most only 1 of suchsystems within z=0.08.

1210.0855	a blurred reflection interpretation for the intermediate flux state in  mrk 335	as part of a long term monitoring campaign of mrk 335, deep xmm-newtonobservations catch the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) in a complex,intermediate flux interval as the active galaxy is transiting from low- tohigh-flux. other works on these same data examined the general behaviour of thenls1 (grupe et al.) and the conditions of its warm absorber (longinotti etal.). the analysis presented here demonstrates the x-ray continuum and timingproperties can be described in a self-consistent manner adopting a blurredreflection model with no need to invoke partial covering. the rapid spectralvariability appears to be driven by changes in the shape of the primary emitterthat is illuminating the inner accretion disc around a rapidly spinning blackhole (a &gt; 0.7). while light bending is certainly prominent, the rather constantemissivity profile and break radius obtained in our spectral fitting suggestthat the blurring parameters are not changing as would be expected if theprimary source is varying its distance from the disc. instead changes could beintrinsic to the power law component. one possibility is that material in anunresolved jet above the disc falls to combine with material at the base of thejet producing the changes in the primary emitter (spectral slope and flux)without changing its distance from the disc.

1210.4593	suzaku observations of 'bare' active galactic nuclei	we present a x-ray spectral analysis of a large sample of 25 'bare' activegalactic nuclei, sources with little or no complicating intrinsic absorption,observed with suzaku. our work focuses on studying the potential contributionfrom relativistic disc reflection, and examining the implications of thisinterpretation for the intrinsic spectral complexities frequently displayed byagn in the x-ray bandpass. during the analysis, we take the unique approach ofattempting to simultaneously undertake a systematic analysis of the wholesample, as well as a detailed treatment of each individual source, and findthat disc reflection has the required flexibility to successfully reproduce thebroadband spectrum observed for all of the sources considered. where possible,we use the reflected emission to place constraints on the black hole spin forthis sample of sources. our analysis suggests a general preference for rapidlyrotating black holes, which if taken at face value is most consistent with thescenario in which smbh growth is dominated by prolonged, ordered accretion.however, there may be observational biases towards agn with high spin in thecompiled sample, limiting our ability to draw strong conclusions for thegeneral population at this stage. finally, contrary to popular belief, ouranalysis also implies that the dichotomy between radio loud/radio quiet agn isnot solely related to black hole spin.

1302.7002	a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole at the centre of ngc 1365	broad x-ray emission lines from neutral and partially ionized iron observedin active galaxies have been interpreted as fluorescence produced by thereflection of hard x-rays off the inner edge of an accretion disk. in thismodel, line broadening and distortion result from rapid rotation andrelativistic effects near the black hole, the line shape being sensitive to itsspin. alternative models in which the distortions result from absorption byintervening structures provide an equally good description of the data, andthere has been no general agreement on which is correct. recent claims that theblack hole (2e6 solar masses) at the centre of the galaxy ngc 1365 is rotatingat close to its maximum possible speed rest on the assumption of relativisticreflection. here we report x-ray observations of ngc 1365 that reveal therelativistic disk features through broadened fe line emission and an associatedcompton scattering excess of 10-30 kev. using temporal and spectral analyses,we disentangle continuum changes due to time-variable absorption fromreflection, which we find arises from a region within 2.5 gravitational radiiof the rapidly spinning black hole. absorption-dominated models that do notinclude relativistic disk reflection can be ruled out both statistically and onphysical grounds.

1306.2317	x-ray outflows and super-eddington accretion in the ultraluminous x-ray  source holmberg ix x-1	studies of x-ray continuum emission and flux variability have notconclusively revealed the nature of ultra-luminous x-ray sources (ulxs) at thehigh-luminosity end of the distribution (those with lx &gt; 1e40 erg/s). these areof particular interest because the luminosity requires either super-eddingtonaccretion onto a black hole of mass ~10 msun, or more standard accretion ontoan intermediate-mass black hole. super-eddington accretion models predictstrong outflowing winds, making atomic absorption lines a key diagnostic of thenature of extreme ulxs. to search for such features, we have undertaken a long,500 ks observing campaign on holmberg ix x-1 with suzaku. this is the mostsensitive dataset in the iron k bandpass for a bright, isolated ulx to date,yet we find no statistically significant atomic features in either emission orabsorption; any undetected narrow features must have equivalent widths lessthan 15-20 ev at 99% confidence. these limits are far below the &gt;150 ev linesexpected if observed trends between mass inflow and outflow rates extend intothe super-eddington regime, and in fact rule out the line strengths observedfrom disk winds in a variety of sub-eddington black holes. we therefore cannotbe viewing the central regions of holmberg ix x-1 through any substantialcolumn of material, ruling out models of spherical super-eddington accretion.if holmberg ix x-1 is a super-eddington source, any associated outflow musthave an anisotropic geometry. finally, the lack of iron emission suggests thatthe stellar companion cannot be launching a strong wind, and that holmberg ixx-1 must primarily accrete via roche-lobe overflow.

1306.3500	weak hard x-ray emission from two broad absorption line quasars observed  with nustar: compton-thick absorption or intrinsic x-ray weakness?	we present nustar hard x-ray observations of two x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars, pg 1004+130 (radio loud) and pg 1700+518 (radio quiet).many bal quasars appear x-ray weak, probably due to absorption by the shieldinggas between the nucleus and the accretion-disk wind. the two targets are amongthe optically brightest bal quasars, yet they are known to be significantlyx-ray weak at rest-frame 2-10 kev (16-120 times fainter than typical quasars).we would expect to obtain ~400-600 hard x-ray (&gt;10 kev) photons with nustar,provided that these photons are not significantly absorbed (nh&lt;1e24 cm^{-2}).however, both bal quasars are only detected in the softer nustar bands (e.g.,4-20 kev) but not in its harder bands (e.g., 20-30 kev), suggesting that eitherthe shielding gas is highly compton-thick or the two targets are intrinsicallyx-ray weak. we constrain the column densities for both to be nh~7e24 cm^{-2} ifthe weak hard x-ray emission is caused by obscuration from the shielding gas.we discuss a few possibilities for how pg 1004+130 could have compton-thickshielding gas without strong fe k? line emission; dilution from jet-linkedx-ray emission is one likely explanation. we also discuss the intrinsic x-rayweakness scenario based on a coronal-quenching model relevant to the shieldinggas and disk wind of bal quasars. motivated by our nustar results, we perform achandra stacking analysis with the large bright quasar survey bal quasar sampleand place statistical constraints upon the fraction of intrinsically x-ray weakbal quasars; this fraction is likely 17-40%.

1309.4350	revisiting putative cool accretion disks in ultraluminous x-ray sources	soft, potentially thermal spectral components observed in some ulxs can befit with models for emission from cool, optically-thick accretion disks. ifthat description is correct, the low temperatures that are observed implyaccretion onto "intermediate-mass" black holes. subsequent work has found thatthese components may follow an inverse relationship between luminosity andtemperature, implying a non-blackbody origin for this emission. we havere-analyzed numerous xmm-newton spectra of extreme ulxs. crucially,observations wherein the source fell on a chip gap were excluded owing to theiruncertain flux calibration, and the neutral column density along the line ofsight to a given source was jointly determined by multiple spectra. theluminosity of the soft component is found to be positively correlated withtemperature, and to be broadly consistent with l ~ t^4 in the measured bandpass, as per blackbody emission from a standard thin disk. these results arenominally consistent with accretion onto black holes with masses above therange currently known in galactic x-ray binaries, though there are importantcaveats. emission from inhomogeneous or super-eddington disks may also beconsistent with the data.

1310.0822	hard x-ray lags in active galactic nuclei: testing the distant  reverberation hypothesis with ngc 6814	we present an x-ray spectral and temporal analysis of the variable activegalaxy ngc 6814, observed with suzaku during november 2011. remarkably, thex-ray spectrum shows no evidence for the soft excess commonly observed amongstother active galaxies, despite its relatively low level of obscuration, and isdominated across the whole suzaku bandpass by the intrinsic powerlaw-likecontinuum. despite this, we clearly detect the presence of a low frequency hardlag of ~1600s between the 0.5-2.0 and 2.0-5.0 kev energy bands at greater than6-sigma significance, similar to those reported in the literature for a varietyof other agn. at these energies, any additional emission from e.g. a very weak,undetected soft excess, or from distant reflection must contribute less than 3%of the observed countrates (at 90% confidence). given the lack of anysignificant continuum emission component other than the powerlaw, we can ruleout models that invoke distant reprocessing for the observed lag behavior,which must instead be associated with this continuum emission. these resultsare fully consistent with a propagating fluctuation origin for the lowfrequency hard lags, and with the interpretation of the high frequency softlags - a common feature seen in the highest quality agn data with strong softexcesses - as reverberation from the inner accretion disk.

1402.4811	{\it nustar} reveals an intrinsically x-ray weak broad absorption line  quasar in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy markarian 231	we present high-energy (3--30 kev) {\it nustar} observations of the nearestquasar, the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) markarian 231 (mrk 231),supplemented with new and simultaneous low-energy (0.5--8 kev) data from {\itchandra}. the source was detected, though at much fainter levels thanpreviously reported, likely due to contamination in the large apertures ofprevious non-focusing hard x-ray telescopes. the full band (0.5--30 kev) x-rayspectrum suggests the active galactic nucleus (agn) in mrk 231 is absorbed by apatchy and compton-thin (n$_{\rm h} \sim1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\times10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$) column. the intrinsic x-ray luminosity (l$_{\rm 0.5-30kev}\sim1.0\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{1}$) is extremely weak relative to thebolometric luminosity where the 2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity ratio is$\sim$0.03% compared to the typical values of 2--15%. additionally, mrk 231 hasa low x-ray-to-optical power law slope ($\alpha_{\rm ox}\sim-1.7$). it is alocal example of a low-ionization broad absorption line (lobal) quasar that isintrinsically x-ray weak. the weak ionizing continuum may explain the lack ofmid-infrared [o iv], [ne v], and [ne vi] fine-structure emission lines whichare present in sources with otherwise similar agn properties. we argue that theintrinsic x-ray weakness may be a result of the super-eddington accretionoccurring in the nucleus of this ulirg, and may also be naturally related tothe powerful wind event seen in mrk 231, a merger remnant escaping from itsdusty cocoon.

1402.7245	simultaneous nustar and xmm-newton 0.5-80 kev spectroscopy of the narrow  line seyfert 1 galaxy swift j2127.4+5654	we present a broad band spectral analysis of the joint xmm-newton and nustarobservational campaign of the narrow line seyfert 1 swift j2127.4+5654,consisting of 300 ks performed during three xmm-newton orbits. we detect arelativistic broadened iron k$\alpha$ line originating from the innermostregions of the accretion disc surrounding the central black hole, from which weinfer an intermediate spin of $a$=$0.58^{+0.11}_{-0.17}$. the intrinsicspectrum is steep ($\gamma=2.08\pm0.01$) as commonly found in narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxies, while the cutoff energy (e$_{\rm c}=108^{+11}_{-10}$ kev)falls within the range observed in broad line seyfert 1 galaxies. we measure alow-frequency lag that increases steadily with energy, while at highfrequencies, there is a clear lag following the shape of the broad fe kemission line. interestingly, the observed fe k lag in swift j2127.4+5654 isnot as broad as in other sources that have maximally spinning black holes. thelag amplitude suggests a continuum-to-reprocessor distance of about $ 10-20\r_{\mathrm{g}}$. these timing results independently support an intermediateblack hole spin and a compact corona.

1403.1769	patchy accretion disks in ultraluminous x-ray sources	the x-ray spectra of the most extreme ultra-luminous x-ray sources -- thosewith l &gt; 1 e+40 erg/s -- remain something of a mystery. spectral roll-over inthe 5-10 kev band was originally detected in in the deepest xmm-newtonobservations of the brightest sources; this is confirmed in subsequent nustarspectra. this emission can be modeled via comptonization, but with low electrontemperatures (kt_e ~ 2 kev) and high optical depths (tau ~ 10) that posenumerous difficulties. moreover, evidence of cooler thermal emission that canbe fit with thin disk models persists, even in fits to joint xmm-newton andnustar observations. using ngc 1313 x-1 as a test case, we show that a patchydisk with a multiple temperature profile may provide an excellent descriptionof such spectra. in principle, a number of patches within a cool disk mightemit over a range of temperatures, but the data only require a two-temperatureprofile plus standard comptonization, or three distinct blackbody components. amechanism such as the photon bubble instability may naturally give rise to apatchy disk profile, and could give rise to super-eddington luminosities. it ispossible, then, that a patchy disk (rather than a disk with a standardsingle-temperature profile) might be a hallmark of accretion disks close to orabove the eddington limit. we discuss further tests of this picture, andpotential implications for sources such as narrow-line seyfert-1 galaxies(nlsy1s) and other low-mass active galactic nuclei (agn).

1403.3078	nustar and xmm-newton observations of luminous, heavily obscured,  wise-selected quasars at z ~ 2	we report on a nustar and xmm-newton program that has observed a sample ofthree extremely luminous, heavily obscured wise-selected agn at z~2 in a broadx-ray band (0.1 - 79 kev). the parent sample, selected to be faint orundetected in the wise 3.4um (w1) and 4.6um (w2) bands but bright at 12um (w3)and 22um (w4), are extremely rare, with only ~1000 so-called w1w2-dropoutsacross the extragalactic sky. optical spectroscopy reveals typical redshifts ofz~2 for this population, implying rest-frame mid-ir luminosities of l(6um)~6e46erg/s and bolometric luminosities that can exceed l(bol)~1e14 l(sun). thecorresponding intrinsic, unobscured hard x-ray luminosities are l(2-10)~4e45erg/s for typical quasar templates. these are amongst the most luminous agnknown, though the optical spectra rarely show evidence of a broad-line regionand the selection criteria imply heavy obscuration even at rest-frame 1.5um. wedesigned our x-ray observations to obtain robust detections for gas columndensities n(h)&lt;1e24 /cm2. in fact, the sources prove to be fainter than thesepredictions. two of the sources were observed by both nustar and xmm-newton,with neither being detected by nustar and one being faintly detected byxmm-newton. a third source was observed only with xmm-newton, yielding a faintdetection. the x-ray data require gas column densities n(h)&gt;1e24 /cm2, implyingthe sources are extremely obscured, consistent with compton-thick, luminousquasars. the discovery of a significant population of heavily obscured,extremely luminous agn does not conform to the standard paradigm of a recedingtorus, in which more luminous quasars are less likely to be obscured. if alarger sample conforms with this finding, then this suggests an additionalsource of obscuration for these extreme sources.

1404.2611	pca of pca: principal component analysis of partial covering absorption  in ngc 1365	we analyse 400 ks of xmm-newton data on the active galactic nucleus ngc 1365using principal component analysis (pca) to identify model independent spectralcomponents. we find two significant components and demonstrate that they arequalitatively different from those found in mcg?6-30-15 using the same method.as the variability in ngc 1365 is known to be due to changes in the parametersof a partial covering neutral absorber, this shows that the same mechanismcannot be the driver of variability in mcg-6-30-15. by examining intervalswhere the spectrum shows relatively low absorption we separate the effects ofintrinsic source variability, including signatures of relativistic reflection,from variations in the intervening absorption. we simulate the principalcomponents produced by different physical variations, and show that pcaprovides a clear distinction between absorption and reflection as the driversof variability in agn spectra. the simulations are shown to reproduce the pcaspectra of both ngc 1365 and mcg-6-30-15, and further demonstrate that thedominant cause of spectral variability in these two sources requires aqualitatively different mechanism.

1404.3561	the broad band spectral variability of mcg-6-30-15 observed by nustar  and xmm-newton	mcg-6-30-15, at a distance of 37 mpc (z=0.008), is the archetypical seyfert 1galaxy showing very broad fe k$\alpha$ emission. we present results from ajoint nustar and xmm-newton observational campaign that, for the first time,allows a sensitive, time-resolved spectral analysis from 0.35 kev up to 80 kev.the strong variability of the source is best explained in terms of intrinsicx-ray flux variations and in the context of the light bending model: theprimary, variable emission is reprocessed by the accretion disk, which producessecondary, less variable, reflected emission. the broad fe k$\alpha$ profileis, as usual for this source, well explained by relativistic effects occurringin the innermost regions of the accretion disk around a rapidly rotating blackhole. we also discuss the alternative model in which the broadening of the fek$\alpha$ is due to the complex nature of the circumnuclear absorbingstructure. even if this model cannot be ruled out, it is disfavored onstatistical grounds. we also detected an occultation event likely caused by blrclouds crossing the line of sight.

1404.5620	nustar and xmm-newton observations of ngc 1365: extreme absorption  variability and a constant inner accretion disk	we present a spectral analysis of four coordinated nustar+xmm-newtonobservations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. these exhibit an extreme level ofspectral variability, which is primarily due to variable line-of-sightabsorption, revealing relatively unobscured states in this source for the firsttime. despite the diverse range of absorption states, each of the observationsdisplays the same characteristic signatures of relativistic reflection from theinner accretion disk. through time-resolved spectroscopy we find that thestrength of the relativistic iron line and the compton reflection hump relativeto the intrinsic continuum are well correlated, as expected if they are twoaspects of the same broadband reflection spectrum. we apply self-consistentdisk reflection models to these time-resolved spectra in order to constrain theinner disk parameters, allowing for variable, partially covering absorption toaccount for the vastly different absorption states observed. each of the fourobservations is treated independently to test the consistency of the resultsobtained for the black hole spin and the disk inclination, which should notvary on observable timescales. we find both the spin and the inclinationdetermined from the reflection spectrum to be consistent, confirming ngc 1365hosts a rapidly rotating black hole; in all cases the dimensionless spinparameter is constrained to be a* &gt; 0.97 (at 90% statistical confidence orbetter).

1404.7486	the broad-band x-ray spectrum of ic 4329a from a joint nustar/suzaku  observation	we have obtained a deep, simultaneous observation of the bright, nearbyseyfert galaxy ic 4329a with suzaku and nustar. through a detailed spectralanalysis, we are able to robustly separate the continuum, absorption anddistant reflection components in the spectrum. the absorbing column is found tobe modest at $n_h = 6 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^2$, and does not introduce anysignificant curvature in the fe k band. we are able to place a strongconstraint on the presence of a broadened fe k{\alpha} line: $e =6.46^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ kev rest frame with ${\sigma} = 0.33^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ kevand $ew = 34^{+8}_{-7}$ ev, though we are not able to constrain any of theparameters of a relativistic reflection model. these results highlight therange in broad fe k{\alpha} line strengths observed in nearby, bright agn(roughly an order of magnitude), and imply a corresponding range in thephysical properties of the inner accretion disk in these sources. we have alsoupdated our previously reported measurement of the high-energy cutoff of thehard x-ray emission using both observatories rather than just nustar alone:$e_{cut} = 186 \pm 14$ kev. this high-energy cutoff acts as a proxy for thetemperature of the coronal electron plasma, enabling us to further separatethis parameter from the optical depth of the plasma and to update our resultsfor these parameters as well. we derive $kt = 50^{+6}_{-3}$ kev with ${\tau} =2.34^{+0.16}_{-0.11}$ using a spherical geometry, $kt = 61 \pm 1$ kev with${\tau} = 0.68 \pm 0.02$ for a slab geometry, with both having an equivalentgoodness-of-fit.

1405.1733	near-infrared counterparts of ultraluminous x-ray sources	in this paper we present the results of the first systematic search forcounterparts to nearby ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) in the near-infrared(nir). we observed 62 ulxs in 37 galaxies within 10 mpc and discovered 17candidate nir counterparts. the detection of 17 out of 62 ulx candidates pointsto intrinsic differences between systems that show and those that do not showinfrared emission. for six counterparts we conclude from the absolutemagnitudes and - - in some cases - additional information such as morphologyand previously reported photometric or spectroscopic observations, that theyare likely background active galactic nuclei or ulxs residing in star clusters.eleven counterparts have absolute magnitudes consistent with them being singlered supergiant stars. alternatively, these systems may have larger accretiondiscs that emit more nir light than the systems that we do not detect. otherscenarios such as emission from a surrounding nebula or from a compact radiojet are also possible, although for holmberg ii x-1 the nir luminosity farexceeds the expected jet contribution. the eleven possible red supergiantcounterparts are excellent candidates for spectroscopic follow-up observations.this may enable us to measure the mass function in these systems if they areindeed red supergiant donor stars where we can observe absorption lines.

1406.3345	the 2-79 kev x-ray spectrum of the circinus galaxy with nustar,  xmm-newton and chandra: a fully compton-thick agn	the circinus galaxy is one of the nearest obscured agn, making it an idealtarget for detailed study. combining archival chandra and xmm-newton data withnew nustar observations, we model the 2-79 kev spectrum to constrain theprimary agn continuum and to derive physical parameters for the obscuringmaterial. chandra's high angular resolution allows a separation of nuclear andoff-nuclear galactic emission. in the off-nuclear diffuse emission we findsignatures of strong cold reflection, including high equivalent-width neutralfe lines. this compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts to 18% of thenuclear flux in the fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclearemission above 30 kev. the new analysis no longer supports a prominenttransmitted agn component in the observed band. we find that the nuclearspectrum is consistent with compton-scattering by an optically-thick torus,where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\gamma = 2.2-2.4$,the torus has an equatorial column density of $n_{\rm h} =(6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic agn $2-10$ kev luminosity is$(2.3-5.1)\times 10^{42}$ erg/s. these values place circinus along the samerelations as unobscured agn in accretion rate-vs-$\gamma$ and $l_x$-vs-$l_{ir}$phase space. nustar's high sensitivity and low background allow us to study theshort time-scale variability of circinus at x-ray energies above 10 kev for thefirst time. the lack of detected variability favors a compton-thick absorber,in line with the the spectral fitting results.

1407.1844	nustar unveils a compton-thick type 2 quasar in mrk 34	we present nustar 3-40 kev observations of the optically selected type 2quasar (qso2) sdss j1034+6001 or mrk 34. the high-quality hard x-ray spectrumand archival xmm-newton data can be fitted self-consistently with areflection-dominated continuum and strong fe kalpha fluorescence line withequivalent-width &gt;1 kev. prior x-ray spectral fitting below 10 kev showed thesource to be consistent with being obscured by compton-thin column densities ofgas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns frommultiwavelength data. nustar now enables a direct measurement of this column,and shows that nh lies in the compton-thick (ct) regime. the new data also showa high intrinsic 2-10 kev luminosity of l_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast toprevious low-energy x-ray measurements for which l_{2-10}&lt;~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.x-ray selection below 10 kev does not pick up this source as an intrinsicallyluminous obscured quasar). both the obscuring column and the intrinsic powerare about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-nustarx-ray spectral fitting. mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' ct qso2 and is thenearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local ctquasar ngc6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strongstar-formation. for typical x-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretionluminosity of mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infraredluminosity. x-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related tostar-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3kev, favoring photionization instead.

1407.8223	the nustar spectrum of mrk 335: extreme relativistic effects within 2  gravitational radii of the event horizon?	we present 3-50 kev nustar observations of the agn mrk 335 in a very low fluxstate. the spectrum is dominated by very strong features at the energies of theiron line at 5-7 kev and compton hump from 10-30 kev. the source is variableduring the observation, with the variability concentrated at low energies,which suggesting either a relativistic reflection or a variable absorptionscenario. in this work we focus on the reflection interpretation, making use ofnew relativistic reflection models that self consistently calculate thereflection fraction, relativistic blurring and angle-dependent reflectionspectrum for different coronal heights to model the spectra. we find that thespectra can be well fit with relativistic reflection, and that the lowest fluxstate spectrum is described by reflection alone, suggesting the effects ofextreme light-bending occurring within ~2 gravitational radii of the eventhorizon. the reflection fraction decreases sharply with increasing flux,consistent with a point source moving up to above 10 rg as the sourcebrightens. we constrain the spin parameter to greater than 0.9 at the 3 sigmaconfidence level. by adding a spin-dependent upper limit on the reflectionfraction to our models, we demonstrate that this can be a powerful way ofconstraining the spin parameter, particularly in reflection dominated states.we also calculate a detailed emissivity profile for the iron line, and findthat it closely matches theoretical predictions for a compact source within afew rg of the black hole.

1408.3633	weak hard x-ray emission from broad absorption line quasars: evidence  for intrinsic x-ray weakness	we report nustar observations of a sample of six x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars. these targets, at z=0.148-1.223, are among the opticallybrightest and most luminous bal quasars known at z&lt;1.3. however, theirrest-frame 2 kev luminosities are 14 to &gt;330 times weaker than expected fortypical quasars. our results from a pilot nustar study of two low-redshift balquasars, a chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift bal quasars,and a nustar spectral analysis of the local bal quasar mrk 231 have alreadysuggested the existence of intrinsically x-ray weak bal quasars, i.e., quasarsnot emitting x-rays at the level expected from their optical/uv emission. theaim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinaryobjects. three of the six new targets are weakly detected by nustar with &lt;45counts in the 3-24 kev band, and the other three are not detected. the hardx-ray (8-24 kev) weakness observed by nustar requires compton-thick absorptionif these objects have nominal underlying x-ray emission. however, a softstacked effective photon index ({\gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavorscompton-thick absorption in general. the uniform hard x-ray weakness observedby nustar for this and the pilot samples selected with &lt;10 kev weakness alsosuggests that the x-ray weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets.we conclude that the nustar observations have likely discovered a significantpopulation (&gt;33%) of intrinsically x-ray weak objects among the bal quasarswith significantly weak &lt;10 kev emission. we suggest that intrinsically x-rayweak quasars might be preferentially observed as bal quasars.

1408.5281	nustar reveals the comptonizing corona of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c  382	broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs) are active galactic nuclei that producepowerful, large-scale radio jets, but appear as seyfert 1 galaxies in theiroptical spectra. in the x-ray band, blrgs also appear like seyfert galaxies,but with flatter spectra and weaker reflection features. one explanation forthese properties is that the x-ray continuum is diluted by emission from thejet. here, we present two nustar observations of the blrg 3c 382 that showclear evidence that the continuum of this source is dominated by thermalcomptonization, as in seyfert 1 galaxies. the two observations were separatedby over a year and found 3c 382 in different states separated by a factor of1.7 in flux. the lower flux spectrum has a photon-index of$\gamma=1.68^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, while the photon-index of the higher fluxspectrum is $\gamma=1.78^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. thermal and anisotropiccomptonization models provide an excellent fit to both spectra and show thatthe coronal plasma cooled from $kt_e=330\pm 30$ kev in the low flux data to$231^{+50}_{-88}$ kev in the high flux observation. this cooling behavior istypical of comptonizing corona in seyfert galaxies and is distinct from thevariations observed in jet-dominated sources. in the high flux observation,simultaneous swift data are leveraged to obtain a broadband spectral energydistribution and indicates that the corona intercepts $\sim 10$% of the opticaland ultraviolet emitting accretion disk. 3c 382 exhibits very weak reflectionfeatures, with no detectable relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line, that may be bestexplained by an outflowing corona combined with an ionized inner accretiondisk.

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1411.5151	the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 2110: hard x-ray emission observed by nustar  and variability of the iron k$\alpha$ line	we present nustar observations of the bright seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 2110obtained in 2012, when the source was at the highest flux level ever observed,and in 2013, when the source was at a more typical flux level. we includearchival observations from other x-ray satellites, namely xmm-newton, suzaku,bepposax, chandra and swift. simultaneous nustar and swift broad band spectra(in the 3-80 kev range) indicate a cutoff energy $e_{\rm c}&gt;210$ kev, with nodetectable contribution from compton reflection. ngc 2110 is one of the veryfew sources where no evidence for distant compton thick scattering is foundand, by using temporal information collected over more than a decade, weinvestigate variations of the iron k$\alpha$ line on time scales of years. thefe k$\alpha$ line is likely the sum of two components: one constant(originating from distant compton-thick material) and the other one variableand linearly correlated with the source flux (possibly arising fromcompton-thin material much closer to the black hole).

1411.5974	nustar and xmm-newton observations of the extreme ultraluminous x-ray  source ngc 5907 ulx1: a vanishing act	we present results obtained from two broadband x-ray observations of theextreme ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) ngc5907 ulx1, known to have a peakx-ray luminosity of ~5e40 erg/s. these xmm-newton and nustar observations,separated by only ~4 days, revealed an extreme level of short-term fluxvariability. in the first epoch, ngc5907 ulx1 was undetected by nustar, andonly weakly detected (if at all) with xmm-newton, while in the second ngc5907ulx1 was clearly detected at high luminosity by both missions. this implies anincrease in flux of ~2 orders of magnitude or more during this ~4 day window.we argue that this is likely due to a rapid rise in the mass accretion rate,rather than to a transition from an extremely obscured to an unobscured state.during the second epoch we observed the broadband 0.3-20.0 kev x-ray luminosityto be (1.55+/-0.06)e40 erg/s, similar to the majority of the archival x-rayobservations. the broadband x-ray spectrum obtained from the second epoch isinconsistent with the low/hard accretion state observed in galactic black holebinaries, but is well modeled with a simple accretion disk model incorporatingthe effects of photon advection. this strongly suggests that, when bright,ngc5907 ulx1 is a high-eddington accretor.

1412.5978	coronal properties of the seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 determined  from hard x-ray spectroscopy with nustar	measurements of the high-energy cut-off in the coronal continuum of activegalactic nuclei have long been elusive for all but a small number of thebrightest examples. we present a direct measurement of the cut-off energy inthe nuclear continuum of the nearby seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 withunprecedented precision. the high sensitivity of nustar up to 79 kev allows usto clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum fromthat of its reflection component. using a simple phenomenological model for thehard x-ray spectrum, we constrain the cut-off energy to $116_{-5}^{+6}$ kevwith 90% confidence. testing for more complex models and nuisance parametersthat could potentially influence the measurement, we find that the cut-off isdetected robustly. we further use simple comptonized plasma models to provideindependent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons inthe corona and its optical depth. at the 90% confidence level, we find$kt_e=29\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=1.23\pm0.08$ assuming a slab (disk-like)geometry, and $kt_e=25\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=3.5\pm0.2$ assuming a sphericalgeometry. both geometries are found to fit the data equally well and their twoprincipal physical parameters are correlated in both cases. with the opticaldepth in the optically thick regime, the data are pushing the currentlyavailable theoretical models of the comptonized plasma to the limits of theirvalidity. since the spectral features and variability arising from the inneraccretion disk have been observed previously in mcg -05-23-016, the inferredhigh optical depth implies that a spherical or disk-like corona cannot behomogeneous.

1501.01188	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548: i. a global model for the broadband  spectral energy distribution	an extensive multi-satellite campaign on ngc 5548 has revealed thisarchetypal seyfert-1 galaxy to be in an exceptional state of persistent heavyabsorption. our observations taken in 2013-2014 with xmm-newton, swift, nustar,integral, chandra, hst and two ground-based observatories have together enabledus to establish that this unexpected phenomenon is caused by an outflowingstream of weakly ionised gas (called the obscurer), extending from the vicinityof the accretion disk to the broad-line region. in this work we present thedetails of our campaign and the data obtained by all the observatories. wedetermine the spectral energy distribution of ngc 5548 from near-infrared tohard x-rays by establishing the contribution of various emission and absorptionprocesses taking place along our line of sight towards the central engine. wethus uncover the intrinsic emission and produce a broadband continuum model forboth obscured (average summer 2013 data) and unobscured ($&lt;$ 2011) epochs ofngc 5548. our results suggest that the intrinsic nir/optical/uv continuum is asingle comptonised component with its higher energy tail creating the 'softx-ray excess'. this component is compatible with emission from a warm,optically-thick corona as part of the inner accretion disk. we then investigatethe effects of the continuum on the ionisation balance and thermal stability ofphotoionised gas for unobscured and obscured epochs.

1501.03426	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548: iii. the high-energy view with nustar  and integral	we describe the analysis of the seven broad-band x-ray continuum observationsof the archetypal seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 that were obtained with xmm-newtonor chandra, simultaneously with high-energy (&gt; 10 kev) observations with nustarand integral. these data were obtained as part of a multiwavelength campaignundertaken from the summer of 2013 till early 2014. we find evidence of ahigh-energy cut-off in at least one observation, which we attribute to thermalcomptonization, and a constant reflected component that is likely due toneutral material at least a few light months away from the continuum source. weconfirm the presence of strong, partial covering x-ray absorption as theexplanation for the sharp decrease in flux through the soft x-ray band. theobscurers appear to be variable in column density and covering fraction on timescales as short as weeks. a fit of the average spectrum over the range 0.3-400kev with a realistic comptonization model indicates the presence of a hotcorona with a temperature of 40(+40,-10) kev and an optical depth of2.7(+0.7,-1.2) if a spherical geometry is assumed.

1501.06849	the compton hump and variable blue wing in the extreme low-flux nustar  observations of 1h0707-495	the narrow-line seyfert i galaxy, 1h0707-495, has been well observed in the0.3-10 kev band, revealing a dramatic drop in flux in the iron k alpha band, astrong soft excess, and short timescale reverberation lags associated withthese spectral features. in this paper, we present the first results of a deep250 ks nustar observation of 1h0707-495, which includes the first sensitiveobservations above 10 kev. even though the nustar observations caught thesource in an extreme low-flux state, the compton hump is still significantlydetected. nustar, with its high effective area above 7 kev, clearly detects thedrop in flux in the iron k alpha band, and by comparing these observations witharchival xmm-newton observations, we find that the energy of this dropincreases with increasing flux. we discuss possible explanations for this, themost likely of which is that the drop in flux is the blue wing of therelativistically broadened iron k alpha emission line. when the flux is low,the coronal source height is low, thus enhancing the most gravitationallyredshifted emission.

1502.07353	determining the covering factor of compton-thick active galactic nuclei  with nustar	the covering factor of compton-thick obscuring material associated with thetorus in active galactic nuclei (agn) is at present best understood through thefraction of sources exhibiting compton-thick absorption along the line of sight($n_{h}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the x-ray band, which reveals theaverage covering factor. determining this compton-thick fraction is difficulthowever, due to the extreme obscuration. with its spectral coverage at hardx-rays ($&gt;$10 kev), nustar is sensitive to the agn covering factor sincecompton scattering of x-rays off optically thick material dominates at theseenergies. we present a spectral analysis of 10 agn observed with nustar wherethe obscuring medium is optically thick to compton scattering, so calledcompton-thick (ct) agn. we use the torus models of brightman &amp; nandra whichpredict the x-ray spectrum from reprocessing in a torus and include the torusopening angle as a free parameter and aim to determine the covering factor ofthe compton-thick gas in these sources individually. across the sample we findmild to heavy compton-thick columns, with $n_{h}$ measured from$10^{24}-10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a wide range of covering factors, whereindividual measurements range from 0.2-0.9. we find that the covering factor,$f_{c}$, is a strongly decreasing function of the intrinsic 2-10 kevluminosity, $l_{x}$, where $f_{c}=(-0.41\pm0.13)$log$_{10}$($l_{x}$/ergs$^{-1}$)$+18.31\pm5.33$, across more than two orders of magnitude in $l_{x}$(10$^{41.5}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). the covering factors measured here agreewell with the obscured fraction as a function of $l_{x}$ as determined bystudies of local agn with $l_{x}&gt;10^{42.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

(2014) tosimultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronalheight in a self-consistent manner. detailed fits to the iron line profileindicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and alow source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitationalradii at the 3{\sigma} confidence level. in addition, we find that the lineprofile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, andthat the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflectionspectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. we find that the blurringparameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line or the entirebroad-band spectrum, which is well modelled with a comptonized continuum plusreflection model.
