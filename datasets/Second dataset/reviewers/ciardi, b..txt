0904.0404	foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line: i. first  westerbork measurements of galactic emission at 150 mhz in a low latitude  field	we present the first results from a series of observations conducted with thewesterbork telescope in the 140--160 mhz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimedat characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionizationexperiments. for the first time we have detected fluctuations in the galacticdiffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 mhz, in the lowgalactic latitude area known as fan region. those fluctuations have an $rms$ of14 k. the total intensity power spectrum shows a power--law behaviour down to$\ell \sim 900$ with slope $\beta^i_\ell = -2.2 \pm 0.3$. the detection ofdiffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual pointsources. we measured an $rms$ confusion noise of $\sim$3 mjy beam$^{-1}$.diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at thisfrequency. the polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially andalong the line of sight. the polarization power spectrum shows a power--lawbehaviour down to $\ell \sim 2700$ with slope $\beta^p_\ell = -1.65 \pm 0.15$.the $rms$ of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 k on 4 arcmin scales. byextrapolating the measured spectrum of total intensity emission, we find acontamination on the cosmological signal of $\delta t= \sqrt{\ell (\ell+1)c^i_\ell / 2\pi} \sim 5.7$ k on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding $rms$ valueof $\sim$18.3 k at the same angular scale. the level of the polarization powerspectrum is $\delta t \sim 3.3$ k on 5 arcmin scales. given its exceptionallybright polarized signal, the fan region is likely to represent an upper limiton the sky brightness at moderate and high galactic latitude.

1002.4177	foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line: ii.  westerbork observations of the fields around 3c196 and the north celestial  pole	in the coming years a new insight into galaxy formation and the thermalhistory of the universe is expected to come from the detection of the highlyredshifted cosmological 21 cm line. the cosmological 21 cm line signal isburied under galactic and extragalactic foregrounds which are likely to be afew orders of magnitude brighter. strategies and techniques for effectivesubtraction of these foreground sources require a detailed knowledge of theirstructure in both intensity and polarization on the relevant angular scales of1-30 arcmin. we present results from observations conducted with the westerborktelescope in the 140-160 mhz range with 2 arcmin resolution in two fieldslocated at intermediate galactic latitude, centred around the bright quasar3c196 and the north celestial pole. they were observed with the purpose ofcharacterizing the foreground properties in sky areas where actual observationsof the cosmological 21 cm line could be carried out. the polarization data wereanalysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. we have computedtotal intensity and polarization angular power spectra. total intensity mapswere carefully calibrated, reaching a high dynamic range, 150000:1 in the caseof the 3c196 field.

1104.1577	observing pulsars and fast transients with lofar	low frequency radio waves, while challenging to observe, are a rich source ofinformation about pulsars. the low frequency array (lofar) is a new radiointerferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric "radiowindow": 10-240mhz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radiofrequencies. through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexibledigital hardware, it is expected that lofar will revolutionize radio astronomyat the lowest frequencies visible from earth. lofar is a next-generation radiotelescope and a pathfinder to the square kilometre array (ska), in that itincorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individualelements. we discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations ingeneral and the potential of lofar in addressing these science goals. wepresent lofar as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations ofpulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observingmodes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implementedto facilitate these observations. a number of results obtained fromcommissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potentialof the telescope. this paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsarobservations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcomingpulsar/fast transient science papers with lofar.

1106.1439	population iii stars and the long gamma ray burst rate	because massive, low-metallicity population iii (popiii) stars may producevery powerful long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), high-redshift grb observationscould probe the properties of the first stars. we analyze the correlationbetween early popiii stars and lgrbs by using cosmologicaln-body/hydrodynamical simulations, which include detailed chemical evolution,cooling, star formation, feedback effects and the transition between popiii andmore standard population i/ii (popii/i) stars. from the swift observed rate oflgrbs, we estimate the fraction of black holes that will produce a grb frompopii/i stars to be in the range 0.028&lt;f_{grb}&lt;0.140, depending on the assumedupper metallicity of the progenitor. assuming that as of today no grb event hasbeen associated to a popiii star, we estimate the upper limit for the fractionof lgrbs produced by popiii stars to be in the range 0.006&lt;f_{grb}&lt;0.022. whenwe apply a detection threshold compatible with the bat instrument, we find thatthe expected fraction of popiii grbs (grb3) is ~10% of the full lgrb populationat z&gt;6, becoming as high has 40% at z&gt;10. finally, we study the properties ofthe galaxies hosting our sample of grb3. we find that the average metallicityof the galaxies hosting a grb3 is typically higher than the criticalmetallicity used to select the popiii stars, due to the efficiency in pollutingthe gas above such low values. we also find that the highest probability offinding a grb3 is within galaxies with a stellar mass &lt;10^7 msun, independentlyfrom the redshift.

1112.4646	the effect of intergalactic helium on hydrogen reionisation:  implications for the sources of ionising photons at z &gt; 6	we investigate the effect of helium on hydrogen reionisation using ahydrodynamical simulation combined with the cosmological radiative transfercode crash. the simulations are run in a 35.12/h comoving mpc box using avariety of assumptions for the amplitude and power-law extreme-uv (euv)spectral index, alpha, of the ionising emissivity. we use an empiricallymotivated prescription for ionising sources which ensures all of the models areconsistent with constraints on the thomson scattering optical depth and thehydrogen photo-ionisation rate at z=6. the inclusion of helium slightly delaysreionisation due to the small number of ionising photons which reionise neutralhelium instead of hydrogen. however, helium has a significant impact on thethermal state of the igm. models with alpha=3 produce igm temperatures at themean density at z=6 which are about 20 % higher compared to models withouthelium photo-heating. harder euv indices produce even larger igm temperatureboosts. a comparison to recent observational estimates of the igm temperatureat z=5 - 6 suggests that hydrogen reionisation was primarily driven by pop-iistellar sources with a soft euv index, alpha&lt;3. we also find that faint, as yetundetected galaxies, characterised by a luminosity function with a steepeningfaint-end slope and an increasing lyman continuum escape fraction (fesc=0.5),are required to reproduce the ionising emissivity used in our simulations atz&gt;6. finally, we note there is some tension between recent observationalconstraints which indicate the igm is &gt; 10% neutral by volume z=7, andestimates of the ionising emissivity at z=6 which indicate only between 1 and 3ionising photons are emitted per hydrogen atom over a hubble time. this tensionmay be alleviated by either a lower neutral fraction at z=7 or an igm whichstill remains a few % neutral by volume at z=6.

1205.3449	imaging neutral hydrogen on large-scales during the epoch of  reionization with lofar	the first generation of redshifted 21 cm detection experiments, carried outwith arrays like lofar, mwa and gmrt, will have a very low signal-to-noiseratio per resolution element (\sim 0.2). in addition, whereas the variance ofthe cosmological signal decreases on scales larger than the typical size ofionization bubbles, the variance of the formidable galactic foregroundsincreases, making it hard to disentangle the two on such large scales. the poorsensitivity on small scales on the one hand, and the foregrounds effect onlarge scales on the other hand, make direct imaging of the epoch ofreionization of the universe very difficult, and detection of the signaltherefore is expected to be statistical.despite these hurdles, in this paper weargue that for many reionization scenarios low resolution images could beobtained from the expected data. this is because at the later stages of theprocess one still finds very large pockets of neutral regions in the igm,reflecting the clustering of the large-scale structure, which stays strong upto scales of \sim 120 comoving mpc/h (\sim 1 degree). the coherence of theemission on those scales allows us to reach sufficient s/n (\sim 3) so as toobtain reionization 21 cm images. such images will be extremely valuable foranswering many cosmological questions but above all they will be a verypowerful tool to test our control of the systematics in the data. the existenceof this typical scale (\sim 120 comoving mpc/h) also argues for designingfuture eor experiments, e.g., with ska, with a field of view of at least 4degree.

1209.2615	prospects for detecting the 21cm forest from the diffuse intergalactic  medium with lofar	we discuss the feasibility of the detection of the 21cm forest in the diffuseigm with the radio telescope lofar. the optical depth to the 21cm line has beenderived using simulations of reionization which include detailed radiativetransfer of ionizing photons. we find that the spectra from reionization modelswith similar total comoving hydrogen ionizing emissivity but differentfrequency distribution look remarkably similar. thus, unless the reionizationhistories are very different from each other (e.g. a predominance of uv vs.x-ray heating) we do not expect to distinguish them by means of observations ofthe 21cm forest. because the presence of a strong x-ray background would makethe detection of 21cm line absorption impossible, the lack of absorption couldbe used as a probe of the presence/intensity of the x-ray background and thethermal history of the universe. along a random line of sight lofar coulddetect a global suppression of the spectrum from z&gt;12, when the igm is stillmostly neutral and cold, in contrast with the more well-defined, albeit broad,absorption features visible at lower redshift. sharp, strong absorptionfeatures associated with rare, high density pockets of gas could be detectedalso at z~7 along preferential lines of sight.

1209.5727	lofar insights into the epoch of reionization from the cross power  spectrum of 21cm emission and galaxies	using a combination of n-body simulations, semi-analytic models and radiativetransfer calculations, we have estimated the theoretical cross power spectrumbetween galaxies and the 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epochof reionization. in accordance with previous studies, we find that the 21cmemission is initially correlated with halos on large scales (&gt; 30 mpc),anti-correlated on intermediate (~ 5 mpc), and uncorrelated on small (&lt; 3 mpc)scales. this picture quickly changes as reionization proceeds and the twofields become anti-correlated on large scales. the normalization of the crosspower spectrum can be used to set constraints on the average neutral fractionin the intergalactic medium and its shape can be a tool to study the topologyof reionization. when we apply a drop-out technique to select galaxies and addto the 21cm signal the noise expected from the lofar telescope, we find thatwhile the normalization of the cross power spectrum remains a useful tool forprobing reionization, its shape becomes too noisy to be informative. on theother hand, for a lyalpha emitter (lae) survey both the normalization and theshape of the cross power spectrum are suitable probes of reionization. a closerlook at a specific planned lae observing program using subaru hyper-suprime camreveals concerns about the strength of the 21cm signal at the plannedredshifts. if the ionized fraction at z ~ 7 is lower that the one estimatedhere, then using the cross power spectrum may be a useful exercise given thatat higher redshifts and neutral fractions it is able to distinguish between twotoy models with different topologies.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

0712.1159	crash_alpha: coupling continuum and line radiative transfer	in this paper we present crash_alpha, the first radiative transfer code forcosmological application that follows the parallel propagation of ly_alpha andionizing photons. crash_alpha is a version of the continuum radiative transfercode crash with a new algorithm to follow the propagation of ly_alpha photonsthrough a gas configuration whose ionization structure is evolving. theimplementation introduces the time evolution for ly_alpha photons (a featurecommonly neglected in line radiative transfer codes) and, to reduce thecomputational time needed to follow each scattering, adopts a statisticalapproach to the ly_alpha treatment by making extensive use of pre-compiledtables. with this statistical approach we experience a drastic increase of thecomputational speed and, at the same time, an excellent agreement with the fullly_alpha radiative transfer computations of the code mcly_alpha. we find thatthe emerging spectra keep memory of the ionization history which generates agiven ionization configuration of the gas and, to properly account for thiseffect, a self-consistent joint evolution of line and ionizing continuumradiation as implemented in crash_alpha is necessary. a comparison between theresults from our code and from ly_alpha scattering alone on a fixed hi densityfield shows that the extent of the difference between the emerging spectradepends on the particular configuration considered, but it can be substantialand can thus affect the physical interpretation of the problem at hand. thesedifferences should furthermore be taken into account when computing the impactof the ly_alpha radiation on e.g. the observability of the 21 cm line fromneutral hydrogen at epochs preceeding complete reionization.

1301.1630	initial deep lofar observations of epoch of reionization windows: i. the  north celestial pole	the aim of the lofar epoch of reionization (eor) project is to detect thespectral fluctuations of the redshifted hi 21cm signal. this signal is weakerby several orders of magnitude than the astrophysical foreground signals andhence, in order to achieve this, very long integrations, accurate calibrationfor stations and ionosphere and reliable foreground removal are essential. oneof the prospective observing windows for the lofar eor project will be centeredat the north celestial pole (ncp). we present results from observations of thencp window using the lofar highband antenna (hba) array in the frequency range115 mhz to 163 mhz. the data were obtained in april 2011 during thecommissioning phase of lofar. we used baselines up to about 30 km. with about 3nights, of 6 hours each, effective integration we have achieved a noise levelof about 100 microjy/psf in the ncp window. close to the ncp, the noise levelincreases to about 180 microjy/psf, mainly due to additional contamination fromunsubtracted nearby sources. we estimate that in our best night, we havereached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by thenoise from our galaxy and the receivers. our continuum images are several timesdeeper than have been achieved previously using the wsrt and gmrt arrays. wederive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to bemainly due to sources at large angular separation from the ncp.

1303.5627	probing reionization with lofar using 21-cm redshift space distortions	one of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (eor) isthrough radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutralhydrogen. these observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping ofredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities ofthe gas. such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properlyunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale $n$-body and radiative transfersimulations. we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrumby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionizationprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. we go on to study theeffects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations, taking instrumentnoise and foreground subtraction into account. we find that lofar should beable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift spacedistortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$1000 hours of integration time. at larger scales, sample errors become alimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds makethe extraction of the signal problematic. finally, we show how theastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations, and how it canbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

1307.5580	the brightness and spatial distributions of terrestrial radio sources	faint undetected sources of radio-frequency interference (rfi) might becomevisible in long radio observations when they are consistently present overtime. thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomicalsignals of interest. this issue is especially important for epoch ofreionisation (eor) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted hi signalsfrom the time of the earliest structures in the universe. we explore the rfisituation at 30-163 mhz by studying brightness histograms of visibility dataobserved with lofar, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used incosmology. an empirical rfi distribution model is derived that allows thesimulation of rfi in radio observations. the brightness histograms show an rfidistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponentaround -1.5. with several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniformdistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existingpropagation models. extrapolation of the power law implies that the currentlofar eor observations should be severely rfi limited if the strength of rfisources remains strong after time integration. this is in contrast with actualobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to belimited by rfi. therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there areundetected rfi sources that will become visible in long observations.consequently, there is no indication that rfi will prevent an eor detectionwith lofar.

1308.2804	studying galactic interstellar turbulence through fluctuations in  synchrotron emission: first lofar galactic foreground detection	the characteristic outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of the random toordered components of the magnetic field are key parameters to characterisemagnetic turbulence in the interstellar gas, which affects the propagation ofcosmic rays within the galaxy. we provide new constraints to those twoparameters. we use the low frequency array (lofar) to image the diffusecontinuum emission in the fan region at (l,b) (137.0,+7.0) at 80"x70"resolution in the range [146,174] mhz. we detect multi-scale fluctuations inthe galactic synchrotron emission and compute their power spectrum. applyingtheoretical estimates and derivations from the literature for the first time,we derive the outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of random to orderedmagnetic field from the characteristics of these fluctuations . we obtain thedeepest image of the fan region to date and find diffuse continuum emissionwithin the primary beam. the power spectrum of the foreground synchrotronfluctuations displays a power law behaviour for scales between 100 and 8 arcminwith a slope of (-1.84+/-0.19). we find an upper limit of about 20 pc for theouter scale of the magnetic interstellar turbulence toward the fan region. wealso find a variation of the ratio of random to ordered field as a function ofgalactic coordinates, supporting different turbulent regimes. we use powerspectra fluctuations from lofar as well as earlier gmrt and wsrt observationsto constrain the outer scale of turbulence of the galactic synchrotronforeground, finding a range of plausible values of 10-20 pc. then, we use thisinformation to deduce lower limits of the ratio of ordered to random magneticfield strength. these are found to be 0.3, 0.3, and 0.5 for the lofar, wsrt andgmrt fields considered respectively. both these constraints are in agreementwith previous estimates.

1308.6009	robust pca and mic statistics of baryons in early mini-haloes	we present a novel approach, based on robust principal components analysis(rpca) and maximal information coefficient (mic), to study the redshiftdependence of halo baryonic properties. our data are composed of a set ofdifferent physical quantities for primordial minihaloes: dark-matter mass($m_{\mathrm{dm}}$), gas mass ($m_{\mathrm{gas}}$), stellar mass($m_{\mathrm{star}}$), molecular fraction (${\mathrm{x_{mol}}}$), metallicity($z$), star formation rate (sfr) and temperature. we find that$m_{\mathrm{dm}}$ and $m_{\mathrm{gas}}$ are dominant factors for variance,particularly at high redshift. nonetheless, with the emergence of the firststars and subsequent feedback mechanisms, ${\mathrm{x_{mol}}}$, sfr and $z$start to have a more dominant role. standard pca gives three principalcomponents (pcs) capable to explain more than 97 per cent of the data varianceat any redshift (two pcs usually accounting for no less than 92 per cent),whilst the first pc from the rpca analysis explains no less than 84 per cent ofthe total variance in the entire redshift range (with two pcs explaining $\gtrsim 95$ per cent anytime). our analysis also suggests that all the gaseousproperties have a stronger correlation with $m_{\mathrm{gas}}$ than with$m_{\mathrm{dm}}$, while $m_{\mathrm{gas}}$ has a deeper correlation with${\mathrm{x_{mol}}}$ than with $z$ or sfr. this indicates the crucial role ofgas molecular content to initiate star formation and consequent metal pollutionfrom population iii and population ii/i regimes in primordial galaxies.finally, a comparison between mic and spearman correlation coefficient showsthat the former is a more reliable indicator when halo properties are weaklycorrelated.

1404.3907	the shape of the radio wavefront of extensive air showers as measured  with lofar	extensive air showers, induced by high energy cosmic rays impinging on theearth's atmosphere, produce radio emission that is measured with the lofarradio telescope. as the emission comes from a finite distance of a fewkilometers, the incident wavefront is non-planar. a spherical, conical orhyperbolic shape of the wavefront has been proposed, but measurements ofindividual air showers have been inconclusive so far. for a selectedhigh-quality sample of 161 measured extensive air showers, we havereconstructed the wavefront by measuring pulse arrival times to sub-nanosecondprecision in 200 to 350 individual antennas. for each measured air shower, wehave fitted a conical, spherical, and hyperboloid shape to the arrival times.the fit quality and a likelihood analysis show that a hyperboloid is the bestparametrization. using a non-planar wavefront shape gives an improved angularresolution, when reconstructing the shower arrival direction. furthermore, adependence of the wavefront shape on the shower geometry can be seen. thissuggests that it will be possible to use a wavefront shape analysis to get anadditional handle on the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, which issensitive to the mass of the primary particle.

1406.7242	lofar sparse image reconstruction	context. the low frequency array (lofar) radio telescope is a giant digitalphased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in europe. itprovides discrete sets of fourier components of the sky brightness. recoveringthe original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverseproblem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methodsaims. recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete natureof radio interferometry measurement and the "compressed sensing" (cs) theory,which supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measuredvisibilities. empowered by proximal theory, cs offers a sound framework forefficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fastalgorithms. combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (dde) in thescope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based onthis framework methods. we implemented a sparse reconstruction method in thestandard lofar imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolutionperformance of this new imager with that of clean-based methods (clean andms-clean) with simulated and real lofar data results. we show that i) sparsereconstruction performs as well as clean in recovering the flux of pointsources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean squareerror is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with aneffective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the clean images.conclusions. sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic andwide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (ofsimulated and real lofar datasets). this sparse reconstruction method iscompatible with modern interferometric imagers that handle dde corrections (a-and w-projections) required for current and future instruments such as lofarand ska

1407.4385	lofar tied-array imaging of type iii solar radio bursts	the sun is an active source of radio emission which is often associated withenergetic phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (cmes). atlow radio frequencies (&lt;100 mhz), the sun has not been imaged extensivelybecause of the instrumental limitations of previous radio telescopes. here, thecombined high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution of the low frequencyarray (lofar) was used to study solar type iii radio bursts at 30-90 mhz andtheir association with cmes. the sun was imaged with 126 simultaneoustied-array beams within 5 solar radii of the solar centre. this method offersbenefits over standard interferometric imaging since each beam produces hightemporal (83 ms) and spectral resolution (12.5 khz) dynamic spectra at an arrayof spatial locations centred on the sun. lofar's standard interferometricoutput is currently limited to one image per second. over a period of 30minutes, multiple type iii radio bursts were observed, a number of which werefound to be located at high altitudes (4 solar radii from the solar center at30 mhz) and to have non-radial trajectories. these bursts occurred at altitudesin excess of values predicted by 1d radial electron density models. thenon-radial high altitude type iii bursts were found to be associated with theexpanding flank of a cme. the cme may have compressed neighbouring streamerplasma producing larger electron densities at high altitudes, while thenon-radial burst trajectories can be explained by the deflection of radialmagnetic fields as the cme expanded in the low corona.

1508.06650	linear polarization structures in lofar observations of the interstellar  medium in the 3c196 field	this study aims to characterize linear polarization structures in lofarobservations of the interstellar medium (ism) in the 3c196 field, one of theprimary fields of the lofar-epoch of reionization key science project. we haveused the high band antennas (hba) of lofar to image this region and rotationmeasure (rm) synthesis to unravel the distribution of polarized structures infaraday depth. the brightness temperature of the detected galactic emission is$5-15~{\rm k}$ in polarized intensity and covers the range from -3 to +8 ${\rmrad~m^{-2}}$ in faraday depth. the most interesting morphological feature is astrikingly straight filament at a faraday depth of $+0.5~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$running from north to south, right through the centre of the field and parallelto the galactic plane. there is also an interesting system of lineardepolarization canals conspicuous in an image showing the peaks of faradayspectra. we used the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) at 350 mhz toimage the same region. for the first time, we see some common morphology in therm cubes made at 150 and 350~{\rm mhz}. there is no indication of diffuseemission in total intensity in the interferometric data, in line with resultsat higher frequencies and previous lofar observations. based on our results, wedetermined physical parameters of the ism and proposed a simple model that mayexplain the observed distribution of the intervening magneto-ionic medium. themean line-of-sight magnetic field component, $b_\parallel$, is determined to be$0.3\pm0.1~{\rm \mu g}$ and its spatial variation across the 3c196 field is$0.1~{\rm \mu g}$. the filamentary structure is probably an ionized filament inthe ism, located somewhere within the local bubble. this filamentary structureshows an excess in thermal electron density ($n_e b_\parallel&gt;6.2~{\rmcm^{-3}\mu g}$) compared to its surroundings.

1509.01257	the lofar multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss) i. survey  description and first results	we present the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss), the firstnorthern-sky lofar imaging survey. in this introductory paper, we firstdescribe in detail the motivation and design of the survey. compared toprevious radio surveys, msss is exceptional due to its intrinsic multifrequencynature providing information about the spectral properties of the detectedsources over more than two octaves (from 30 to 160 mhz). the broadbandfrequency coverage, together with the fast survey speed generated by lofar'smultibeaming capabilities, make msss the first survey of the sort anticipatedto be carried out with the forthcoming square kilometre array (ska). two of thesixteen frequency bands included in the survey were chosen to exactly overlapthe frequency coverage of large-area very large array (vla) and giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) surveys at 74 mhz and 151 mhz respectively. the surveyperformance is illustrated within the "msss verification field" (mvf), a regionof 100 square degrees centered at j2000 (ra,dec)=(15h,69deg). the msss resultsfrom the mvf are compared with previous radio survey catalogs. we assess theflux and astrometric uncertainties in the catalog, as well as the completenessand reliability considering our source finding strategy. we determine the 90%completeness levels within the mvf to be 100 mjy at 135 mhz with 108"resolution, and 550 mjy at 50 mhz with 166" resolution. images and catalogs forthe full survey, expected to contain 150,000-200,000 sources, will be releasedto a public web server. we outline the plans for the ongoing production of thefinal survey products, and the ultimate public release of images and sourcecatalogs.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1512.00014	lofar msss: detection of a low-frequency radio transient in 400 hrs of  monitoring of the north celestial pole	we present the results of a four-month campaign searching for low-frequencyradio transients near the north celestial pole with the low-frequency array(lofar), as part of the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss). the datawere recorded between 2011 december and 2012 april and comprised 2149 11-minutesnapshots, each covering 175 deg^2. we have found one convincing candidateastrophysical transient, with a duration of a few minutes and a flux density at60 mhz of 15-25 jy. the transient does not repeat and has no obvious optical orhigh-energy counterpart, as a result of which its nature is unclear. thedetection of this event implies a transient rate at 60 mhz of 3.9 (+14.7, -3.7)x 10^-4 day^-1 deg^-2, and a transient surface density of 1.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2,at a 7.9-jy limiting flux density and ~10-minute time-scale. the campaign datawere also searched for transients at a range of other time-scales, from 0.5 to297 min, which allowed us to place a range of limits on transient rates at 60mhz as a function of observation duration.

astro-ph;0005181	cosmological reionization around the first stars: monte carlo radiative  transfer	we study the evolution of ionization fronts around the first proto-galaxiesby using high resolution numerical cosmological (lambda+cdm model) simulationsand monte carlo radiative transfer methods. we present the numerical scheme indetail and show the results of test runs from which we conclude that the schemeis both fast and accurate. as an example of interesting cosmologicalapplication, we study the reionization produced by a stellar source of totalmass m=2 10^8 m_\odot turning on at z=12, located at a node of the cosmic web.the study includes a spectral energy distribution of a zero-metallicity stellarpopulation, and two initial mass functions (salpeter/larson). the expansion ofthe i-front is followed as it breaks out from the galaxy and it is channeled bythe filaments into the voids, assuming, in a 2d representation, acharacteristic butterfly shape. the ionization evolution is very well trackedby our scheme, as realized by the correct treatment of the channeling andshadowing effects due to overdensities. we confirm previous claims that boththe shape of the imf and the ionizing power metallicity dependence areimportant to correctly determine the reionization of the universe.

astro-ph;0111532	lyman continuum escape from inhomogeneous ism	we have studied the effects of gas density inhomogeneities on the escape ofionising lyman continuum (lyc) photons from milky way-type galaxies via 3dnumerical simulations using the monte carlo radiative transfer code crash(ciardi et al. 2001). to this aim a comparison between a smooth gaussiandistribution (gdd) and an inhomogeneous, fractal one (fdd) has been made withrealistic assumptions for the ionising stellar sources based on available datain the solar neighborhood. in both cases the escape fraction f_esc increaseswith ionisation rate n_gamma (although for the fdd with a flatter slope) andthey become equal at n_gamma = 2*10^50 s^-1 where f_esc = 0.11. fdd allowsescape fractions of the same order also at lower n_gamma, when lyc photonescape is sharply suppressed by gdd. values of the escape fraction as high as0.6 can be reached (gdd) for n_gamma ~ 9*10^50 s^-1, corresponding to a starformation rate (sfr) of roughly 2 m_o yr^-1; at this ionising luminosity thefdd is less transparent (f_esc ~ 0.28). if high redshift galaxies have gascolumn densities similar to local ones, are characterized by such high sfrs andby a predominantly smooth (i.e.turbulence free) interstellar medium, ourresults suggest that they should considerably contribute to - and possiblydominate - the cosmic uv background.

astro-ph;0301293	simulating igm reionization	we have studied the igm reionization process in its full cosmological contextincluding structure evolution and a realistic galaxy population. we have used acombination of high-resolution n-body simulations (to describe the dark matterand diffuse gas component), a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation (to trackthe evolution of the sources of ionizing radiation) and the monte carloradiative transfer code crash (to follow the propagation of ionizing photonsinto the igm). the process has been followed in the largest volume ever usedfor this kind of study, a field region of the universe with a comoving lengthof l~20/h mpc, embedded in a much larger cosmological simulation. to assess theeffect of environment on the reionization process, the same radiative transfersimulations have been performed on a 10/h mpc comoving box, centered on aclustered region. we find that, to account for the all ionizing radiation,objects with total masses of m~10^9 msun must be resolved. in this case, thesimulated stellar population produces a volume averaged ionization fractionx_v=0.999 by z~8, consistent with observations without requiring any additionalsources of ionization. we also find that environment substantially affects thereionization process. in fact, although the simulated proto-cluster occupies asmaller volume and produces a higher number of ionizing photons, it getstotally ionized later. this is because high density regions, which are morecommon in the proto-cluster, are difficult to ionize because of their highrecombination rates.

astro-ph;0302451	early reionization by the first galaxies	large-scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background measured by thewmap satellite requires a mean optical depth to thomson scattering, tau_e ~0.17. the reionization of the universe must therefore have begun at relativelyhigh redshift. we have studied the reionization process using supercomputersimulations of a large and representative region of a universe which hascosmological parameters consistent with the wmap results. our simulationsfollow both the radiative transfer of ionizing photons and the formation andevolution of the galaxy population which produces them. a previously publishedmodel with a standard stellar imf, with a moderate photon escape fraction fromgalaxies and with ionizing photon production as expected for zero metallicitystars produces tau_e = 0.104, which is within 1.0 to 1.5-sigma of the ``best''wmap value. values up to 0.16 can be produced by taking larger escape fractionsor a top heavy imf. the data do not require a separate populations of``miniquasars'' or of stars forming in objects with total masses below 10^9m_sun. reconciling such early reionization with the observed gunn-petersontroughs in z&gt;6 quasars may be challenging. possible resolutions of this problemare discussed.

astro-ph;0307117	crash: a radiative transfer scheme	we present a largely improved version of crash, a 3-d radiative transfer codethat treats the effects of ionizing radiation propagating through a giveninhomogeneous h/he cosmological density field, on the physical conditions ofthe gas. the code, based on a monte carlo technique, self-consistentlycalculates the time evolution of gas temperature and ionization fractions dueto an arbitrary number of point/extended sources and/or diffuse backgroundradiation with given spectra. in addition, the effects of diffuse ionizingradiation following recombinations of ionized atoms have been included. after acomplete description of the numerical scheme, to demonstrate the performances,accuracy, convergency and robustness of the code we present four different testcases designed to investigate specific aspects of radiative transfer: (i) purehydrogen isothermal stromgren sphere; (ii) realistic stromgren spheres; (iii)multiple overlapping point sources, and (iv) shadowing of background radiationby an intervening optically thick layer. when possible, detailed quantitativecomparison of the results against either analytical solutions or 1-d standardphotoionization codes has been made showing a good level of agreement. for morecomplicated tests the code yields physically plausible results, which could beeventually checked only by comparison with other similar codes. finally, webriefly discuss future possible developments and cosmological applications ofthe code.

astro-ph;0511623	the effect of minihaloes on cosmic reionization	one of the most debated issues in the theoretical modeling of cosmicreionization is the impact of small-mass gravitationally-bound structures. wecarry out the first numerical investigation of the role of such sterile`minihaloes', which serve as self-shielding screens of ionizing photons.minihaloes are too small to be properly resolved in current large-scalecosmological simulations, and thus we estimate their effects using a sub-gridmodel, considering two cases that bracket their effect within this framework.in the `extreme suppression' case in which minihalo formation ceases once aregion is partially ionized, their effect on cosmic reionization is modest,reducing the volume-averaged ionization fraction by an overall factor of lessthan 15%. in the other extreme, in which minihalo formation is neversuppressed, they delay complete reionization as much as delta z~2, in roughagreement with the results from a previous semi-analytical study by theauthors. thus, depending on the details of the minihalo formation process,their effect on the overall progress of reionization can range from modest tosignificant, but the minihalo photon consumption is by itself insufficient toforce an extended reionization epoch.

astro-ph;9907189	inhomogeneous reionization regulated by radiative and stellar feedbacks	we study the inhomogeneous reionization in a critical density cdm universedue to stellar sources, including population iii objects. the spatialdistribution of the sources is obtained from high resolution numerical n-bodysimulations. we calculate the source properties taking into account aself-consistent treatment of both radiative (ie ionizing and h2-photodissociating photons) and stellar (ie sn explosions) feedbacks regulatedby massive stars. this allows us to describe the topology of the ionized anddissociated regions at various cosmic epochs and derive the evolution of h, he,and h2 filling factors, soft uv background, cosmic star formation rate and thefinal fate of ionizing objects. the main results are: (i) galaxies reionize theigm by z~10 (with some uncertainty related to the gas clumping factor), whereash2 is completely dissociated already by z~25; (ii) reionization is mostly dueto the relatively massive objects which collapse via h line cooling, whileobjects whose formation relies on h2 cooling alone are insufficient to thisaim; (iii) the diffuse soft uv background is the major source of radiativefeedback effects for z&lt;15; at higher z direct flux from neighboring objectsdominates; (iv) the match of the calculated cosmic star formation history withthe one observed at lower redshifts suggests that the conversion efficiency ofbaryons into stars is ~1%; (v) we find that a very large population of darkobjects which failed to form stars is present by z~8. we discuss and compareour results with similar previous studies.

astro-ph;9911467	cmb anisotropies due to feedback-regulated inhomogeneous reionization	we calculate the secondary anisotropies in the cmb produced by inhomogeneousreionization from simulations in which the effects of radiative and stellarfeedback effects on galaxy formation have been included. this allows toself-consistently determine the beginning ($z_i\approx 30$), the duration ($\delta z\approx 20$) and the (nonlinear) evolution of the reionization processfor a critical density cdm model. in addition, from the simulated spatialdistribution of ionized regions, we are able to calculate the evolution of thetwo-point ionization correlation function, $c_\chi$, and obtain the powerspectrum of the anisotropies, $c_\ell$, in the range $5000 &lt; \ell &lt; 10^6$. thepower spectrum has a broad maximum around $\ell \approx 30000$, where itreaches the value $2\times 10^{-12}$. we also show that the angular correlationfunction $c(\theta)$ is not gaussian, but at separation angles $% \theta\lower.5ex\hbox{\ltsima} 10^{-4}$ rad it can be approximated by a modifiedlorentzian shape; at larger separations an anticorrelation signal is predicted.detection of signals as above will be possible with future mm-wavelengthinterferometers like alma, which appears as an optimum instrument to search forsignatures of inhomogeneous reionization.
