0903.2760	non-parametric foreground subtraction for 21cm epoch of reionization  experiments	an obstacle to the detection of redshifted 21cm emission from the epoch ofreionization (eor) is the presence of foregrounds which exceed the cosmologicalsignal in intensity by orders of magnitude. we argue that in principle it wouldbe better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data todetermine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advanceand then fitting its parameters. non-parametric fits often suffer from otherproblems, however. we discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,wp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. after outlining the principlesof wp smoothing we describe an algorithm used to implement it. we then apply wpsmoothing to a synthetic data cube for the lofar eor experiment. theperformance of wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able torecover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids leakageof power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and toanother non-parametric method (smoothing splines). we find that wp smoothing issuperior to smoothing splines for our application, and is competitive withparametric methods even though in the latter case we may choose the functionalform of the fit with advance knowledge of the simulated foregrounds. finally,we discuss how the quality of the fit is affected by the frequency resolutionand range, by the characteristics of the cosmological signal and by edgeeffects.

0904.0404	foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line: i. first  westerbork measurements of galactic emission at 150 mhz in a low latitude  field	we present the first results from a series of observations conducted with thewesterbork telescope in the 140--160 mhz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimedat characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionizationexperiments. for the first time we have detected fluctuations in the galacticdiffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 mhz, in the lowgalactic latitude area known as fan region. those fluctuations have an $rms$ of14 k. the total intensity power spectrum shows a power--law behaviour down to$\ell \sim 900$ with slope $\beta^i_\ell = -2.2 \pm 0.3$. the detection ofdiffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual pointsources. we measured an $rms$ confusion noise of $\sim$3 mjy beam$^{-1}$.diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at thisfrequency. the polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially andalong the line of sight. the polarization power spectrum shows a power--lawbehaviour down to $\ell \sim 2700$ with slope $\beta^p_\ell = -1.65 \pm 0.15$.the $rms$ of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 k on 4 arcmin scales. byextrapolating the measured spectrum of total intensity emission, we find acontamination on the cosmological signal of $\delta t= \sqrt{\ell (\ell+1)c^i_\ell / 2\pi} \sim 5.7$ k on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding $rms$ valueof $\sim$18.3 k at the same angular scale. the level of the polarization powerspectrum is $\delta t \sim 3.3$ k on 5 arcmin scales. given its exceptionallybright polarized signal, the fan region is likely to represent an upper limiton the sky brightness at moderate and high galactic latitude.

0909.5198	radio spectral study of the cluster of galaxies abell 2255	spectral index studies of halos, relics, and radio galaxies provide usefulinformation on their origin and connection with merger processes. we presentwsrt multi-wavelength observations of the galaxy cluster abell 2255 at 25 cm,85 cm, and 2 m. the spectral index images allowed us to study the integratedspectrum of halo and relic and to investigate the physical properties of thebeaver head-tail radio galaxy belonging to the cluster. in the radio halo, thespectral index is steeper at the center and flatter at the locations of theradio filaments, clearly detected at 25 cm. in the relics, the spectral indexflattens, moving away from the cluster center. for the beaver radio galaxy, thespectrum severely steepens from the head towards the end of the tail, becauseof the energy losses suffered by the relativistic particles. in the 2 m map,which is the first high-sensitivity image presented in the literature at such along wavelength, a new mpc-size emission region is detected between the knownradio halo and the nw relic. not detecting this feature in the more sensitive85 cm observations implies that it must have a very steep spectrum (alpha &lt;=-2.6). the observational properties of the radio halo suggest that either weare looking at a superposition of different structures (filaments in theforeground plus real halo in the background) seen in projection across thecluster center or that the halo is intrinsically peculiar. the newly detectedextended region to the nw of the halo could be considered as an asymmetricextension of the halo itself. however, since radio halos are known in theliterature as structures showing a regular morphology, the new feature couldrepresent the first example of steep mpc-size diffuse structures (mds),detected around clusters at very low frequencies.

1002.1957	post-correlation radio frequency interference classification methods	we describe and compare several post-correlation radio frequency interferenceclassification methods. as data sizes of observations grow with new andimproved telescopes, the need for completely automated, robust methods forradio frequency interference mitigation is pressing. we investigated severalclassification methods and find that, for the data sets we used, the mostaccurate among them is the sumthreshold method. this is a new method formedfrom a combination of existing techniques, including a new way of thresholding.this iterative method estimates the astronomical signal by carrying out asurface fit in the time-frequency plane. with a theoretical accuracy of 95%recognition and an approximately 0.1% false probability rate in simplesimulated cases, the method is in practice as good as the human eye in findingrfi. in addition it is fast, robust, does not need a data model before it canbe executed and works in almost all configurations with its default parameters.the method has been compared using simulated data with several other mitigationtechniques, including one based upon the singular value decomposition of thetime-frequency matrix, and has shown better results than the rest.

1002.4177	foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line: ii.  westerbork observations of the fields around 3c196 and the north celestial  pole	in the coming years a new insight into galaxy formation and the thermalhistory of the universe is expected to come from the detection of the highlyredshifted cosmological 21 cm line. the cosmological 21 cm line signal isburied under galactic and extragalactic foregrounds which are likely to be afew orders of magnitude brighter. strategies and techniques for effectivesubtraction of these foreground sources require a detailed knowledge of theirstructure in both intensity and polarization on the relevant angular scales of1-30 arcmin. we present results from observations conducted with the westerborktelescope in the 140-160 mhz range with 2 arcmin resolution in two fieldslocated at intermediate galactic latitude, centred around the bright quasar3c196 and the north celestial pole. they were observed with the purpose ofcharacterizing the foreground properties in sky areas where actual observationsof the cosmological 21 cm line could be carried out. the polarization data wereanalysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. we have computedtotal intensity and polarization angular power spectra. total intensity mapswere carefully calibrated, reaching a high dynamic range, 150000:1 in the caseof the 3c196 field.

1003.0965	power spectrum extraction for redshifted 21-cm epoch of reionization  experiments: the lofar case	one of the aims of the low frequency array (lofar) epoch of reionization(eor) project is to measure the power spectrum of variations in the intensityof redshifted 21-cm radiation from the eor. the sensitivity with which thispower spectrum can be estimated depends on the level of thermal noise andsample variance, and also on the systematic errors arising from the extractionprocess, in particular from the subtraction of foreground contamination. wemodel the extraction process using realistic simulations of the cosmologicalsignal, the foregrounds and noise, and so estimate the sensitivity of the lofareor experiment to the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum. detection of emissionfrom the eor should be possible within 360 hours of observation with a singlestation beam. integrating for longer, and synthesizing multiple station beamswithin the primary (tile) beam, then enables us to extract progressively moreaccurate estimates of the power at a greater range of scales and redshifts. wediscuss different observational strategies which compromise between depth ofobservation, sky coverage and frequency coverage. a plan in which lowerfrequencies receive a larger fraction of the time appears to be promising. wealso study the nature of the bias which foreground fitting errors induce on theinferred power spectrum, and discuss how to reduce and correct for this bias.the angular and line-of-sight power spectra have different merits in thisrespect, and we suggest considering them separately in the analysis of lofardata.

1004.0274	constraints on the flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos from wsrt  observations	ultra-high energy (uhe) neutrinos and cosmic rays initiate particle cascadesunderneath the moon's surface. these cascades have a negative charge excess andradiate cherenkov radio emission in a process known as the askaryan effect. theoptimal frequency window for observation of these pulses with radio telescopeson the earth is around 150 mhz. by observing the moon with the westerborksynthesis radio telescope array we are able to set a new limit on the uheneutrino flux. the puma ii backend is used to monitor the moon in 4 frequencybands between 113 and 175 mhz with a sampling frequency of 40 mhz. thenarrowband radio interference is digitally filtered out and the dispersiveeffect of the earth's ionosphere is compensated for. a trigger system isimplemented to search for short pulses. by inserting simulated pulses in theraw data, the detection efficiency for pulses of various strength iscalculated. with 47.6 hours of observation time, we are able to set a limit onthe uhe neutrino flux. this new limit is an order of magnitude lower thanexisting limits. in the near future, the digital radio array lofar will be usedto achieve an even lower limit.

1007.4135	realistic simulations of the galactic polarized foreground: consequences  for 21-cm reionization detection experiments	experiments designed to measure the redshifted 21~cm line from the epoch ofreionization (eor) are challenged by strong astrophysical foregroundcontamination, ionospheric distortions, complex instrumental response and otherdifferent types of noise (e.g. radio frequency interference). the astrophysicalforegrounds are dominated by diffuse synchrotron emission from our galaxy. herewe present a simulation of the galactic emission used as a foreground modulefor the lofar- eor key science project end-to-end simulations. the simulationproduces total and polarized intensity over $10^\circ \times 10^\circ$ maps ofthe galactic synchrotron and free-free emission, including all observedcharacteristics of the emission: spatial fluctuations of amplitude and spectralindex of the synchrotron emission, together with faraday rotation effects. theimportance of these simulations arise from the fact that the galactic polarizedemission could behave in a manner similar to the eor signal along the frequencydirection. as a consequence, an improper instrumental calibration will giverise to leakages of the polarized to the total signal and mask the desired eorsignal. in this paper we address this for the first time through realisticsimulations.

1012.1722	radio interferometric calibration using the sage algorithm	the aim of the new generation of radio synthesis arrays such as lofar and skais to achieve much higher sensitivity, resolution and frequency coverage thanwhat is available now, especially at low frequencies. to accomplish this goal,the accuracy of the calibration techniques used is of considerable importance.moreover, since these telescopes produce huge amounts of data, speed ofconvergence of calibration is a major bottleneck. the errors in calibration aredue to system noise (sky and instrumental) as well as the estimation errorsintroduced by the calibration technique itself, which we call solver noise. wedefine solver noise as the distance between the optimal solution (the truevalue of the unknowns, uncorrupted by the system noise) and the solutionobtained by calibration. we present the space alternating generalizedexpectation maximization (sage) calibration technique, which is a modificationof the expectation maximization algorithm, and compare its performance with thetraditional least squares calibration based on the level of solver noiseintroduced by each technique. for this purpose, we develop statistical methodsthat use the calibrated solutions to estimate the level of solver noise. thesage calibration algorithm yields very promising results both in terms ofaccuracy and speed of convergence. the comparison approaches we adopt introducea new framework for assessing the performance of different calibration schemes.

1205.3449	imaging neutral hydrogen on large-scales during the epoch of  reionization with lofar	the first generation of redshifted 21 cm detection experiments, carried outwith arrays like lofar, mwa and gmrt, will have a very low signal-to-noiseratio per resolution element (\sim 0.2). in addition, whereas the variance ofthe cosmological signal decreases on scales larger than the typical size ofionization bubbles, the variance of the formidable galactic foregroundsincreases, making it hard to disentangle the two on such large scales. the poorsensitivity on small scales on the one hand, and the foregrounds effect onlarge scales on the other hand, make direct imaging of the epoch ofreionization of the universe very difficult, and detection of the signaltherefore is expected to be statistical.despite these hurdles, in this paper weargue that for many reionization scenarios low resolution images could beobtained from the expected data. this is because at the later stages of theprocess one still finds very large pockets of neutral regions in the igm,reflecting the clustering of the large-scale structure, which stays strong upto scales of \sim 120 comoving mpc/h (\sim 1 degree). the coherence of theemission on those scales allows us to reach sufficient s/n (\sim 3) so as toobtain reionization 21 cm images. such images will be extremely valuable foranswering many cosmological questions but above all they will be a verypowerful tool to test our control of the systematics in the data. the existenceof this typical scale (\sim 120 comoving mpc/h) also argues for designingfuture eor experiments, e.g., with ska, with a field of view of at least 4degree.

1209.2615	prospects for detecting the 21cm forest from the diffuse intergalactic  medium with lofar	we discuss the feasibility of the detection of the 21cm forest in the diffuseigm with the radio telescope lofar. the optical depth to the 21cm line has beenderived using simulations of reionization which include detailed radiativetransfer of ionizing photons. we find that the spectra from reionization modelswith similar total comoving hydrogen ionizing emissivity but differentfrequency distribution look remarkably similar. thus, unless the reionizationhistories are very different from each other (e.g. a predominance of uv vs.x-ray heating) we do not expect to distinguish them by means of observations ofthe 21cm forest. because the presence of a strong x-ray background would makethe detection of 21cm line absorption impossible, the lack of absorption couldbe used as a probe of the presence/intensity of the x-ray background and thethermal history of the universe. along a random line of sight lofar coulddetect a global suppression of the spectrum from z&gt;12, when the igm is stillmostly neutral and cold, in contrast with the more well-defined, albeit broad,absorption features visible at lower redshift. sharp, strong absorptionfeatures associated with rare, high density pockets of gas could be detectedalso at z~7 along preferential lines of sight.

1209.4769	the scale of the problem : recovering images of reionization with gmca	the accurate and precise removal of 21-cm foregrounds from epoch ofreionization redshifted 21-cm emission data is essential if we are to gaininsight into an unexplored cosmological era. we apply a non-parametrictechnique, generalized morphological component analysis or gmca, to simulatedlofar-eor data and show that it has the ability to clean the foregrounds withhigh accuracy. we recover the 21-cm 1d, 2d and 3d power spectra with highaccuracy across an impressive range of frequencies and scales. we show thatgmca preserves the 21-cm phase information, especially when the smallestspatial scale data is discarded. while it has been shown that lofar-eor imagerecovery is theoretically possible using image smoothing, we add that waveletdecomposition is an efficient way of recovering 21-cm signal maps to the sameor greater order of accuracy with more flexibility. by comparing the gmcaoutput residual maps (equal to the noise, 21-cm signal and any foregroundfitting errors) with the 21-cm maps at one frequency and discarding the smallerwavelet scale information, we find a correlation coefficient of 0.689, comparedto 0.588 for the equivalently smoothed image. considering only the central 50%of the maps, these coefficients improve to 0.905 and 0.605 respectively and weconclude that wavelet decomposition is a significantly more powerful method todenoise reconstructed 21-cm maps than smoothing.

1209.5727	lofar insights into the epoch of reionization from the cross power  spectrum of 21cm emission and galaxies	using a combination of n-body simulations, semi-analytic models and radiativetransfer calculations, we have estimated the theoretical cross power spectrumbetween galaxies and the 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epochof reionization. in accordance with previous studies, we find that the 21cmemission is initially correlated with halos on large scales (&gt; 30 mpc),anti-correlated on intermediate (~ 5 mpc), and uncorrelated on small (&lt; 3 mpc)scales. this picture quickly changes as reionization proceeds and the twofields become anti-correlated on large scales. the normalization of the crosspower spectrum can be used to set constraints on the average neutral fractionin the intergalactic medium and its shape can be a tool to study the topologyof reionization. when we apply a drop-out technique to select galaxies and addto the 21cm signal the noise expected from the lofar telescope, we find thatwhile the normalization of the cross power spectrum remains a useful tool forprobing reionization, its shape becomes too noisy to be informative. on theother hand, for a lyalpha emitter (lae) survey both the normalization and theshape of the cross power spectrum are suitable probes of reionization. a closerlook at a specific planned lae observing program using subaru hyper-suprime camreveals concerns about the strength of the 21cm signal at the plannedredshifts. if the ionized fraction at z ~ 7 is lower that the one estimatedhere, then using the cross power spectrum may be a useful exercise given thatat higher redshifts and neutral fractions it is able to distinguish between twotoy models with different topologies.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

1301.1630	initial deep lofar observations of epoch of reionization windows: i. the  north celestial pole	the aim of the lofar epoch of reionization (eor) project is to detect thespectral fluctuations of the redshifted hi 21cm signal. this signal is weakerby several orders of magnitude than the astrophysical foreground signals andhence, in order to achieve this, very long integrations, accurate calibrationfor stations and ionosphere and reliable foreground removal are essential. oneof the prospective observing windows for the lofar eor project will be centeredat the north celestial pole (ncp). we present results from observations of thencp window using the lofar highband antenna (hba) array in the frequency range115 mhz to 163 mhz. the data were obtained in april 2011 during thecommissioning phase of lofar. we used baselines up to about 30 km. with about 3nights, of 6 hours each, effective integration we have achieved a noise levelof about 100 microjy/psf in the ncp window. close to the ncp, the noise levelincreases to about 180 microjy/psf, mainly due to additional contamination fromunsubtracted nearby sources. we estimate that in our best night, we havereached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by thenoise from our galaxy and the receivers. our continuum images are several timesdeeper than have been achieved previously using the wsrt and gmrt arrays. wederive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to bemainly due to sources at large angular separation from the ncp.

1303.5627	probing reionization with lofar using 21-cm redshift space distortions	one of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (eor) isthrough radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutralhydrogen. these observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping ofredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities ofthe gas. such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properlyunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale $n$-body and radiative transfersimulations. we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrumby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionizationprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. we go on to study theeffects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations, taking instrumentnoise and foreground subtraction into account. we find that lofar should beable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift spacedistortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$1000 hours of integration time. at larger scales, sample errors become alimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds makethe extraction of the signal problematic. finally, we show how theastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations, and how it canbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

1306.2172	chromatic effects in the 21 cm global signal from the cosmic dawn	the redshifted 21 cm brightness distribution from neutral hydrogen is apromising probe into the cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn, and re-ionization.lofar's low band antennas (lba) may be used in the frequency range 45 mhz to 85mhz (30&gt;z&gt;16) to measure the sky averaged redshifted 21 cm brightnesstemperature as a function of frequency, or equivalently, cosmic redshift. theselow frequencies are affected by strong galactic foreground emission that isobserved through frequency dependent ionospheric and antenna beam distortionswhich lead to chromatic mixing of spatial structure into spectral structure.using simple models, we show that (i) the additional antenna temperature due toionospheric refraction and absorption are at a \sim 1% level--- 2 to 3 ordersof magnitude higher than the expected 21 cm signal, and have an approximate\nu^{-2} dependence, (ii) ionospheric refraction leads to a knee-likemodulation on the sky spectrum at \nu\approx 4\times plasma frequency. usingmore realistic simulations, we show that in the measured sky spectrum, morethan 50% of the 21 cm signal variance can be lost to confusion from foregroundsand chromatic effects. we conclude that foregrounds and chromatic mixing maynot be subtracted as generic functions of frequency as previously thought, butmust rather be carefully modeled using additional priors and interferometricmeasurements.

1307.5580	the brightness and spatial distributions of terrestrial radio sources	faint undetected sources of radio-frequency interference (rfi) might becomevisible in long radio observations when they are consistently present overtime. thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomicalsignals of interest. this issue is especially important for epoch ofreionisation (eor) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted hi signalsfrom the time of the earliest structures in the universe. we explore the rfisituation at 30-163 mhz by studying brightness histograms of visibility dataobserved with lofar, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used incosmology. an empirical rfi distribution model is derived that allows thesimulation of rfi in radio observations. the brightness histograms show an rfidistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponentaround -1.5. with several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniformdistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existingpropagation models. extrapolation of the power law implies that the currentlofar eor observations should be severely rfi limited if the strength of rfisources remains strong after time integration. this is in contrast with actualobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to belimited by rfi. therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there areundetected rfi sources that will become visible in long observations.consequently, there is no indication that rfi will prevent an eor detectionwith lofar.

1312.3640	the spin temperature of high-redshift damped lyman-$\alpha$ systems	we report results from a programme aimed at investigating the temperature ofneutral gas in high-redshift damped lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (dlas). thisinvolved (1) hi 21cm absorption studies of a large dla sample, (2) vlbi studiesto measure the low-frequency quasar core fractions, and (3) optical/ultravioletspectroscopy to determine dla metallicities and velocity widths.  including literature data, our sample consists of 37 dlas with estimates ofthe spin temperature $t_s$ and the covering factor. we find a strong $4\sigma$)difference between the $t_s$ distributions in high-z (z&gt;2.4) and low-z (z&lt;2.4)dla samples. the high-z sample contains more systems with high $t_s$ values,$\gtrsim 1000$ k. the $t_s$ distributions in dlas and the galaxy are alsoclearly (~$6\sigma$) different, with more high-$t_s$ sightlines in dlas than inthe milky way. the high $t_s$ values in the high-z dlas of our sample arise dueto low fractions of the cold neutral medium.  for 29 dlas with metallicity [z/h] estimates, we confirm the presence of ananti-correlation between $t_s$ and [z/h], at $3.5\sigma$ significance via anon-parametric kendall-tau test. this result was obtained with the assumptionthat the dla covering factor is equal to the core fraction. monte carlosimulations show that the significance of the result is only marginallydecreased if the covering factor and the core fraction are uncorrelated, or ifthere is a random error in the inferred covering factor.  we also find evidence for redshift evolution in dla $t_s$ values even for thez&gt;1 sub-sample. since z&gt;1 dlas have angular diameter distances comparable to orlarger than those of the background quasars, they have similar efficiency incovering the quasars. low covering factors in high-z dlas thus cannot accountfor the observed redshift evolution in spin temperatures.

1401.4172	constraining the epoch of reionization with the variance statistic:  simulations of the lofar case	several experiments are underway to detect the cosmic redshifted 21-cm signalfrom neutral hydrogen from the epoch of reionization (eor). due to their verylow signal-to-noise ratio, these observations aim for a statistical detectionof the signal by measuring its power spectrum. we investigate the extraction ofthe variance of the signal as a first step towards detecting and constrainingthe global history of the eor. signal variance is the integral of the signal'spower spectrum, and it is expected to be measured with a high significance. wedemonstrate this through results from a simulation and parameter estimationpipeline developed for the low frequency array (lofar)-eor experiment. we showthat lofar should be able to detect the eor in 600 hours of integration usingthe variance statistic. additionally, the redshift ($z_r$) and duration($\delta z$) of reionization can be constrained assuming a parametrization. weuse an eor simulation of $z_r = 7.68$ and $\delta z = 0.43$ to test thepipeline. we are able to detect the simulated signal with a significance of 4standard deviations and extract the eor parameters as $z_r =7.72^{+0.37}_{-0.18}$ and $\delta z = 0.53^{+0.12}_{-0.23}$ in 600 hours,assuming that systematic errors can be adequately controlled. we further showthat the significance of detection and constraints on eor parameters can beimproved by measuring the cross-variance of the signal by cross-correlatingconsecutive redshift bins.

1402.1373	calibration artefacts in radio interferometry. i. ghost sources in wsrt  data	this work investigates a particular class of artefacts, or ghost sources, inradio interferometric images. earlier observations with (and simulations of)the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) suggested that these were dueto calibration with incomplete sky models. a theoretical framework is derivedthat validates this suggestion, and provides predictions of ghost formation ina two-source scenario. the predictions are found to accurately match the resultof simulations, and qualitatively reproduce the ghosts previously seen inobservational data. the theory also provides explanations for many previouslypuzzling features of these artefacts (regular geometry, psf-like sidelobes,seeming independence on model flux), and shows that the observed phenomenon offlux suppression affecting unmodelled sources is due to the same mechanism. wedemonstrate that this ghost formation mechanism is a fundamental feature ofcalibration, and exhibits a particularly strong and localized signature due toarray redundancy. to some extent this mechanism will affect all observations(including those with non-redundant arrays), though in most cases the ghostsremain hidden below the noise or masked by other instrumental artefacts. theimplications of such errors on future deep observations are discussed.

1408.2200	the intra-hour variable quasar j1819$+$3845: 13-year evolution, jet  polarization structure and interstellar scattering screen properties	we examine the long-term evolution of the intra-hour variable quasar,j1819+3845, whose variations have been attributed to interstellar scintillationby extremely local turbulent plasma, located only 1-3pc from earth. thevariations in this source ceased some time between june 2006 and february 2007.the evolution of the source spectrum and the long-term lightcurve, and thepersistent compactness of the source vlbi structure indicates that thecessation of rapid variability was associated with the passage of thescattering material out of the line of sight to the quasar. we present ananalysis of the linear polarization variations and their relation to totalintensity variations. the proper motion of polarized features in the quasar jetis found to be subluminal. systematic time delays between stokes i, q and u, incombination with the structure of the source obtained from 8.4ghz vlbi data,confirm the estimate of the screen distance: 1-2pc, making the screen one ofthe nearest objects to the solar system.  we determine the physical properties of this scattering material. theelectron density in the scattering region is extremely high with respect to thewarm ionized ism, with an estimated density of $n_e \sim 97 \, l_0^{1/3}{\delta l}_{100}^{-1/2}$cm$^{-3}$, where $l_0$ is the outer scale of theturbulence in au and $\delta l = 100 \delta l_{100}$ au is the depth of thescattering region. if this plasma is in pressure balance with the localmagnetic field, one expects a ~2 rad/m^2 rotation measure change associatedwith the passage of this material past the quasar. we examine the rotationmeasures of sources and the diffuse polarized emission in the surroundingregion. we place a limit of 10 rad/m^2 on the rm change. the variability ofsources near j1819+3845 is used to deduce that the screen must therefore beeither very small (~100 au) or patchy.

1503.01644	polarization leakage in epoch of reionization windows: i. lofar  observations of the 3c196 field	detection of the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization (eor) ischallenging especially because, even after removing the foregrounds, theresidual stokes $i$ maps contain leakage from polarized emission that can mimicthe signal. here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of lofar and presentrealistic simulations of the leakages between stokes parameters. from the lofarobservations of polarized emission in the 3c196 field, we have quantified thelevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of lofar, andcompared it with the eor signal using power spectrum analysis. we found that at134--166 mhz, within the central 4$^\circ$ of the field the $(q,u)\rightarrowi$ leakage power is lower than the eor signal at $k&lt;0.3$ mpc$^{-1}$. theleakage was found to be localized around a faraday depth of 0, and the rms ofthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown tovary between 0.2-0.3\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal ofleakage. moreover, we could define an `eor window' in terms of the polarizationleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the psf-induced wedge and below$k_\parallel\sim 0.5$ mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to$k_\parallel\sim 1$ mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\perp$ when 70\% of the leakage hadbeen removed. these lofar results show that even a modest polarimetriccalibration over a field of view of $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in the future arrayslike ska will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below theexpected eor signal at the scales of 0.02-1 mpc$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0104399	the new two-image gravitational lens system class b2319+051	we report the discovery of a new two-image gravitational lens system from thecosmic lens all-sky survey, class b2319+051. radio imaging with the very largearray (vla) and multi-element radio-linked interferometer network (merlin)shows two compact components with a flux density ratio of 5:1, separated by1.36 arcsec. observations with the very long baseline array (vlba) resolve eachof the radio components into a pair of parity-reversed subcomponents. hubblespace telescope (hst) observations with the near-infrared camera andmulti-object spectrometer (nicmos) show a bright elliptical galaxy (g1)coincident with the radio position, and a second irregular galaxy (g2) 3.4arcsec to the northwest. previous spectroscopic studies have indicated thatthese galaxies are at different redshifts: z(g1) = 0.624, z(g2) = 0.588.infrared counterparts to the lensed radio components are not detected in thenicmos image, and the source redshift has not yet been determined. preliminarymass modeling based on the vlba subcomponent data indicates that the lensingpotential includes a strong external shear contribution. a vla monitoringprogram is currently being undertaken to measure the differential time delay.

astro-ph;0104457	cold gas kinematics in an l* spiral galaxy at z=0.437: the nature of  damped lyman-alpha absorbers	westerbork radio synthesis telescope observations of the redshifted 21cm lineabsorber against the z_em = 0.871 double lobed quasar 3c196 show that theintervening absorber is an l approximately equal l* spiral galaxy (3c196-g1)and that the absorbing layer of cold gas extends to radii of at least 30h_50^-1 kpc. the new data solve several long standing puzzles about this systemby (1) discovering a second 21cm absorption feature, corresponding toabsorption against the ne lobe of the background radio source and (2) spatially``resolving'' the two absorption features to isolate the absorption along thetwo lines of sight to the opposing radio lobes. these findings resolve thedisagreement in redshift between the uv metal and 21cm lines, and as well asdemonstrating that the neutral layer does absorb both lobes of the backgroundradio source. simple kinematic models with an inclined, rotating gas disk matchthe observed 21cm profile and are also compatible with both the redshift andvelocity spread of the absorption measured in uv resonance lines along a third,independent line of sight to the quasar nucleus and with the lack of 21cmabsorption in as earlier vlbi experiment that was sensitive to opacity againstthe hot spot in the northern lobe. the inferred rotation speed and luminosityfor the galaxy are compatible with the z approximately 0 tully-fisher relation.  this system illustrates well how 21cm absorption against extended backgroundradio sources is a powerful tool in determining the nature of the dampedlyman-alpha class of qso absorption line system.

astro-ph;0302189	extrinsic radio variability of jvas/class gravitational lenses	we present flux-ratio curves of the fold and cusp (i.e. close multiple)images of six jvas/class gravitational lens systems. the data were obtainedover a period of 8.5 months in 2001 with the multi-element radio-linkedinterferometer network (merlin) at 5-ghz with 50 mas resolution, as part of amerlin key-project. even though the time delays between the fold and cuspimages are small (&lt;~1 day) compared to the time-scale of intrinsic sourcevariability, all six lens systems show evidence that suggests the presence ofextrinsic variability. in particular, the cusp images of b2045+265 -- regardedas the strongest case of the violation of the cusp relation (i.e. the sum ofthe magnifications of the three cusp images add to zero) -- show extrinsicvariations in their flux-ratios up to ~40 percent peak-to-peak on time scalesof several months. its low galactic latitude of b=-10 degree and aline-of-sight toward the cygnus superbubble region suggest that galacticscintillation is the most likely cause. the cusp images of b1422+231 at b=+69degree do not show strong extrinsic variability. galactic scintillation cantherefore cause significant scatter in the cusp and fold relations of someradio lens systems (up to 10 percent rms), even though these relations remainviolated when averaged over a &lt;~1 year time baseline.

astro-ph;0303201	annual modulation in the scattering of j1819+3845: peculiar plasma  velocity and anisotropy	we present two years of monitoring observations of the extremely variablequasar j1819+3845. we observe large yearly changes in the timescale of thevariations (from ~ 1 hour to ~ 10 hours at 5ghz). this annual effect can onlybe explained if the variations are caused by a propagation effect, and thusaffected by the earth's relative speed through the projected intensity pattern.to account for this effect, the scattering plasma must have a transversevelocity with respect to the local standard of rest.  the velocity calculated from these observations is in good agreement withthat obtained from a two telescope delay experiment (dennett-thorpe &amp; de bruyn2001). we also show that either the source itself is elongated, or that thescattering plasma is anisotropic, with an axial ratio of &gt;6:1. as the source isextended on scales relevant to the scattering phenomenon, it seems plausiblethat the anisotropy is due to the source itself, but this remains to beinvestigated. from the scintillation characteristics we find that thescattering material is a very strong, thin scatterer within ~ten parsecs. wedetermine a source size at 5ghz of 100 to 900microarcsecs, and associatedbrightness temperatures of 10^{10} to 10^{12}k.

astro-ph;0303644	characteristics of the structure in the galactic polarized radio  background at 350 mhz	angular power spectra and structure functions of the stokes parameters q andu and polarized intensity p are derived from three sets of radio polarimetricobservations. two of the observed fields have been studied at multiplefrequencies, allowing determination of power spectra and structure functions ofrotation measure rm as well. the third field extends over a large part of thenorthern sky, so that the variation of the power spectra over galactic latitudeand longitude can be studied. the power spectra of q and u are steeper thanthose of p, probably because a foreground faraday screen creates extrastructure in q and u, but not in p. the extra structure in q and u occurs onlarge scales, and therefore causes a steeper spectrum. the derived slope of thepower spectrum of p is the multipole spectral index, and is consistent withearlier estimates. the multipole spectral index decreases with galacticlatitude (i.e. the spectrum becomes flatter), but is consistent with a constantvalue over galactic longitude. power spectra of the rotation measure rm show aspectral index of about 1, while the structure function of rm is approximatelyflat. the structure function is flatter than earlier estimates from polarizedextragalactic sources, which could be due to the fact that extragalactic sourcerm probes the complete line of sight through the galaxy, whereas as a result ofdepolarization diffuse radio polarization only probes the nearby ism.

astro-ph;0406557	properties of the warm magnetized ism, as inferred from wsrt  polarimetric imaging	we describe a first attempt to derive properties of the regular and turbulentgalactic magnetic field from multi-frequency polarimetric observations of thediffuse galactic synchrotron background. a single-cell-size model of the thingalactic disk is constructed which includes random and regular magnetic fieldsand thermal and relativistic electrons. the disk is irradiated from behind witha uniform partially polarized background. radiation from the background andfrom the thin disk is faraday rotated and depolarized while propagating throughthe medium. the model parameters are estimated from a comparison with 350 mhzobservations in two regions at intermediate latitudes done with the westerborksynthesis radio telescope. we obtain good consistency between the estimates forthe random and regular magnetic field strengths and typical scales of structurein the two regions. the regular magnetic field strength found is a fewmicrogauss, and the ratio of random to regular magnetic field strength is 0.7+/- 0.5, for a typical scale of the random component of 15 +/- 10 pc.furthermore, the regular magnetic field is directed almost perpendicular to theline of sight. this modeling is a potentially powerful method to estimate thestructure of the galactic magnetic field, especially when more polarimetricobservations of the diffuse synchrotron background at intermediate latitudesbecome available.

astro-ph;0408115	structure in the polarized galactic synchrotron emission, in particular  `depolarization canals'	the polarized component of the diffuse radio synchrotron emission of ourgalaxy shows structure, which is apparently unrelated to the structure in totalintensity, on many scales. the structure in the polarized emission can be dueto several processes or mechanisms. some of those are related to theobservational setup, such as beam depolarization -- the vector combination and(partial) cancellation of polarization vectors within a synthesized beam --, orthe insensitivity of a synthesis telescope to structure on large scales, alsoknown as the 'missing short spacings problem'. other causes for structure inthe polarization maps are intrinsic to the radiative transfer of the emissionin the warm ism, which induces faraday rotation and depolarization.  we use data obtained with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope at 5frequencies near 350 mhz to estimate the importance of the various mechanismsin producing structure in the linearly polarized emission. in the two regionsstudied here, which are both at positive latitudes in the second galacticquadrant, the effect of 'missing short spacings' is not important. theproperties of the narrow depolarization 'canals' that are observed in abundancelead us to conclude that they are mostly due to beam depolarization, and thatthey separate regions with different rotation measures. as beam depolarizationonly creates structure on the scale of the synthesized beam, most of thestructure on larger scales must be due to depth depolarization. we do notdiscuss that aspect of the observations here, but in a companion paper wederive information about the properties of the ism from the structure of thepolarized emission.

astro-ph;0507349	faraday rotation measure synthesis	we extend the rotation measure work of burn (1966) to the cases of limitedsampling of lambda squared space and non-constant emission spectra. weintroduce the rotation measure transfer function (rmtf), which is an excellentpredictor of n-pi ambiguity problems with the lambda squared coverage. rotationmeasure synthesis can be implemented very efficiently on modern computers.because the analysis is easily applied to wide fields, one can conduct veryfast rm surveys of weak spatially extended sources. difficult situations, forexample multiple sources along the line of sight, are easily detected andtransparently handled. under certain conditions, it is even possible to recoverthe emission as a function of faraday depth within a single cloud of ionizedgas. rotation measure synthesis has already been successful in discoveringwidespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the perseus cluster (debruyn and brentjens, 2005). in simple, high signal to noise situations it is asgood as traditional linear fits to polarization angle versus lambda squaredplots. however, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarizedemission at high rotation measures is expected, it is the only viable option.

0809.1326	fast large-scale reionization simulations	we present an efficient method to generate large simulations of the epoch ofreionization (eor) without the need for a full 3-dimensional radiative transfercode. large dark-matter-only simulations are post-processed to produce maps ofthe redshifted 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen. dark matter haloes areembedded with sources of radiation whose properties are either based onsemi-analytical prescriptions or derived from hydrodynamical simulations. thesesources could either be stars or power-law sources with varying spectralindices. assuming spherical symmetry, ionized bubbles are created around thesesources, whose radial ionized fraction and temperature profiles are derivedfrom a catalogue of 1-d radiative transfer experiments. in case of overlap ofthese spheres, photons are conserved by redistributing them around theconnected ionized regions corresponding to the spheres. the efficiency withwhich these maps are created allows us to span the large parameter spacetypically encountered in reionization simulations. we compare our results withother, more accurate, 3-d radiative transfer simulations and find excellentagreement for the redshifts and the spatial scales of interest to upcoming 21cmexperiments. we generate a contiguous observational cube spanning redshift 6 to12 and use these simulations to study the differences in the reionizationhistories between stars and quasars. finally, the signal is convolved with thelofar beam response and its effects are analyzed and quantified. statisticsperformed on this mock data set shed light on possible observational strategiesfor lofar.

astro-ph;0610652	a very brief description of lofar - the low frequency array	lofar (low frequency array) is an innovative radio telescope optimized forthe frequency range 30-240 mhz. the telescope is realized as a phased aperturearray without any moving parts. digital beam forming allows the telescope topoint to any part of the sky within a second. transient buffering makesretrospective imaging of explosive short-term events possible. the scientificfocus of lofar will initially be on four key science projects (ksps): 1)detection of the formation of the very first stars and galaxies in the universeduring the so-called epoch of reionization by measuring the power spectrum ofthe neutral hydrogen 21-cm line (shaver et al. 1999) on the ~5' scale; 2)low-frequency surveys of the sky with of order $10^8$ expected new sources; 3)all-sky monitoring and detection of transient radio sources such as gamma-raybursts, x-ray binaries, and exo-planets (farrell et al. 2004); and 4) radiodetection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos (falcke &amp; gorham 2003)allowing for the first time access to particles beyond 10^21 ev (scholten etal. 2006). apart from the ksps open access for smaller projects is alsoplanned. here we give a brief description of the telescope.

0809.2428	detection and extraction of signals from the epoch of reionization using  higher order one-point statistics	detecting redshifted 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the earlyuniverse promises to give direct constraints on the epoch of reionization(eor). it will, though, be very challenging to extract the cosmological signal(cs) from foregrounds and noise which are orders of magnitude larger.fortunately, the signal has some characteristics which differentiate it fromthe foregrounds and noise, and we suggest that using the correct statistics maytease out signatures of reionization. we generate mock datacubes simulating theoutput of the low frequency array (lofar) eor experiment. these cubes combinerealistic models for galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and the noise withthree different simulations of the cs. we fit out the foregrounds, which aresmooth in the frequency direction, to produce residual images in each frequencyband. we denoise these images and study the skewness of the one-pointdistribution in the images as a function of frequency. we find that, undersufficiently optimistic assumptions, we can recover the main features of theredshift evolution of the skewness in the 21cm signal. we argue that some ofthese features - such as a dip at the onset of reionization, followed by a risetowards its later stages - may be generic, and give us a promising route to astatistical detection of reionization.

astro-ph;9512069	a radio search for high redshift hi absorption	ground based optical observations have yielded considerable information onthe statistics of damped-lyman alpha systems. in particular these systems areknown to be the dominant repository of the observed neutral gas at highredshift. however, particularly at high redshift, there is the possibility thatoptical observations could be biased due to the exclusion of damped-lyman alphasystems that contain moderate to significant amounts of dust. independentobservational constraints on the neutral hydrogen content at high redshifts andthe amount of dust in high redshift systems can be obtained from a radio searchagainst the bright lobes of distant radio galaxies (which is less affected bythe presence of dust in foreground damped-lyman alpha systems). we describehere a pilot radio survey along the line of sight to a small sample of highredshift radio galaxies, and also present some preliminary results. the surveyuses a novel observing mode at the wsrt which enables one to make sensitivesearches of a large redshift interval in a modest amount of telescope time.

astro-ph;9801186	the edge-on spiral gravitational lens b1600+434	we present new observations of the gravitational lens (gl) system b1600+434,strongly suggesting that the lens is an edge-on spiral galaxy. theseobservations are used to constrain the mass model of the system, in particularthe oblateness and velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo around thelensing galaxy. from an analytical model we find a lower limit on the halooblateness $q_\rmn{halo}=(c/a)_{\rho}\ga0.4$; more detailed numerical modelsgive a lower limit $q_\rmn{h}\ga0.5$. we determine an average halo velocitydispersion of $\sigma_{halo}=190\pm 15$ km/s over all non-singular isothermalelliptical (nie) halo models. constraining the models to larger and moremassive disks, decreases this average by only 10 km/s. a lower limit of$\sigma_{halo}\ga 150$ km/s is found, even for disk masses larger then the massinside the einstein radius. this lower limit indicates the need for a massivedark matter halo, contributing at least half of the mass inside the einsteinradius. time delay calculations give $(54\pm3)/h_{50}$ days for the nie halomodel and $(70\pm4)/h_{50}$ days for the modified hubble profile (mhp) halomodel. although the time delay for both nie and mhp halo models is wellconstrained on our parameter grid, it strongly depends on the halo surfacedensity profile. we furthermore find that the presence of a flat luminous massdistribution can severely alter the statistical properties of the lens.

astro-ph;9801304	deceleration of relativistic radio components and the morphologies of  gigahertz peaked spectrum sources	a relativistic radio component, which moves in a direction close to the skyplane, will increase in flux density when it decelerates. this effect is thebasis for the qualitative model for gps galaxies we present in this paper,which can explain their low-variability convex spectrum, their compact doubleor compact symmetric morphology, and the lack of gps quasars at similarredshifts. components are expelled from the nucleus at relativistic speeds at alarge angle to the line of sight, and are decelerated (eg. by ram-pressure orentrainment of the external gas) before contributing to a mini-lobe. the youngcomponents are doppler boosted in the direction of motion but appear fainterfor the observer. the non-relativistic mini-lobes dominate the structure andare responsible for the low variability in flux density and the convex radiospectrum as well as the compact double angular morphology. had the same sourcebeen orientated at a small angle to the line of sight, the young componentswould be boosted in the observer's direction resulting in a flat and variableradio spectrum at high frequencies. hence the characteristic convex spectrum ofa gps source would not be seen. these sources at small angles to the line ofsight are probably identified with quasars, and are not recognized as gpssources, but are embedded in the large population of flat spectrum variablequasars and bl lac objects. this leads to a deficiency in gps/csos identifiedwith quasars.

astro-ph;9803140	a new sample of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum radio sources	the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss) has been used to select a sampleof gigahertz peaked spectrum (gps) radio sources at flux densities one to twoorders of magnitude lower than bright gps sources investigated in earlierstudies. sources with inverted spectra at frequencies above 325 mhz have beenobserved with the wsrt at 1.4 and 5 ghz and with the vla at 8.6 and 15 ghz toselect genuine gps sources. this has resulted in a sample of 47 gps sourceswith peak frequencies ranging from ~500 mhz to &gt;15 ghz, and peak flux densitiesranging from ~40 to ~900 mjy. counts of gps sources in our sample as a functionof flux density have been compared with counts of large scale sources fromwenss scaled to 2 ghz, the typical peak frequency of our gps sources. thecounts can be made similar if the number of large scale sources at 2 ghz isdivided by 250, and their flux densities increase by a factor of 10. on thescenario that all gps sources evolve into large scale radio sources, theseresults show that the lifetime of a typical gps source is ~250 times shorterthan a typical large scale radio source, and that the source luminosity mustdecrease by a factor of ~10 in evolving from gps to large scale radio source.however, we note that the redshift distributions of gps and large scale radiosources are different and that this hampers a direct and straightforwardinterpretation of the source counts. further modeling of radio source evolutioncombined with cosmological evolution of the radio luminosity function for largesources is required.

astro-ph;9805356	wnb 0313+683: analysis of a newly discovered giant radio galaxy	we present the results of a detailed analysis of the newly discovered 15arcmin large frii-type radio galaxy wnb 0313+683. it has a redshift of 0.0901+/- 0.0002 and a projected linear size of 2.0 mpc. using multi-frequency radiodata from the wenss and nvss surveys, the vla, the wsrt and the 100m effelsbergtelescope, we have derived the age of the source (1.4 +/- 0.1 x 10^8 yrs) andthe particle densities around the two radio lobes (&gt;1.6 x 10^(-6) per cubic cmfor the southern lobe and &gt;5.8 x 10^(-7) per cubic cm for the northern). fromoptical spectroscopy we find that the h$\alpha$ emission line has a broadcomponent, and that the extinction is large (with colour index e(b-v) = 0.98+/- 0.10 mag), but is probably mostly galactic in origin (b= +9.8 degrees).further, the radio core has an inverted spectrum with a spectral index of +0.42+/- 0.03, suggesting a very compact structure. at 10.5 ghz, it contributes 25%of the total flux density of the source, which is extremely high for radiogalaxies. wnb 0313+683 has a very large optical emission line flux with respectto its estimated jet power, when compared with the correlation between thesetwo properties found by rawlings &amp; saunders (1991). we argue that this,together with the relatively high radio power and the inverted radio spectrumof the radio core, is suggestive of a new phase of radio activity in thissource.

astro-ph;9809069	optical and near-infrared imaging of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum  sources	a sample of 47 faint gigahertz peaked spectrum (gps) radio sources selectedfrom the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss, rengelink et al. 1997), hasbeen imaged in the optical and near infrared, resulting in an identificationfraction of 87%. the r-i and r-k colours of the faint optical counterparts areas expected for passively evolving elliptical galaxies, assuming that theyfollow the r band hubble diagram as determined for radio-bright gps galaxies.we have found evidence that the radio spectral properties of the gps quasarsare different from those of gps galaxies: the observed distribution of radiospectral peak frequencies for gps sources optically identified with brightstellar objects (presumably quasars) is shifted compared with gps sourcesidentified with faint or extended optical objects (presumably galaxies), in thesense that a gps quasar is likely to have a higher peak frequency than a gpsgalaxy. this means that the true peak frequency distribution is different forthe gps galaxies and quasars, because the sample selection effects areindependent of optical identification. the correlation between peak frequencyand redshift as has been suggested for bright sources has not been found inthis sample; no correlation exists between r magnitude (and therefore redshift)and peak frequency for the gps galaxies. we therefore believe that the claimedcorrelation is actually caused by the dependence of the peak frequency onoptical host, because the gps galaxies are in general at lower redshifts thanthe quasars. the difference in the peak frequency distributions of the gpsgalaxies and quasars is further evidence against the hypothesis that they forma single class of object.

astro-ph;9810178	the mpc-scale radio source associated with the gps galaxy b1144+352	we present the results of new observations of the enigmatic radio sourceb1144+352 with the wsrt at 1.4 ghz. the wenss and nvss surveys have revealedfaint extended radio structures on mpc-scales. we have investigated theselarge-scale radio components. one of the radio structures has a leading hotspotand we conclude that this structure is a large radio lobe associated with thegps source. the other contains two separate radio sources which are superposedon the sky: a low-power radio source at a similar redshift (z=0.065) to the gpshost galaxy and an extended radio lobe, which we believe is associated with thegps host galaxy. further, the 1.4-ghz flux density of the core has decreased by70 mjy between 1994 and 1997. we have also retrieved and analysed unpublishedarchival rosat hri data of b1144+352. the source has been detected and appearsto be slightly extended in x-rays. the rosat data have not detected a largeextended x-ray halo surrounding the host galaxy, limiting the luminosity of theintra-cluster gas within a radius of 250 kpc to &lt; 2.3 x 10^42 erg/s. b1144+352is the second gps galaxy known to be associated with a mpc-sized radio source,the other being b1245+676. we argue that the observed structures must be theresult of an interrupted central jet-activity, and that as such these sourcesmay well be the progenitors of double-double radio galaxies.

astro-ph;9811167	b2045+265: a new four-image gravitational lens from class	we have discovered a new gravitational lens in the cosmic lens all-sky survey(class). b2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9arcsec. a fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and itspositional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy stronglysuggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. this implies that theb2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed byanother flat-spectrum radio source. infrared images detect the lensed images ofthe background source and the lensing galaxy. the lensed images have relativepositions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radiowavelengths. spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and asource redshift of z_s=1.28. the image splitting and system redshifts implythat the projected mass inside the einstein radius of the lensing galaxy ism_e=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun. an estimate of the light emitted inside theeinstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame b band of(m/l_b)_e = 20 h (m/l_b)_sun. both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higherthan what is seen in nearby sa galaxies. in fact, the implied rotation velocityfor the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearbyspirals. the large projected mass inside the einstein ring radius may be theresult of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from acompact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentificationof the source redshift. a simple model of the gravitational potential of thelens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required tosatisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. with furtherobservations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of h_0.

astro-ph;9811425	a new radio double lens from class: b1127+385	we present the discovery of a new gravitational lens system with two compactradio images separated by 0.701+-0.001 arcsec. the lens system was discoveredin the cosmic lens all sky survey (class) as a flat spectrum radio source. bothradio components show structure in a vlba 8.4 ghz radio image. no furtherextended structure is seen in either the vla, merlin or vlba images. hubblespace telescope (hst) wfpc2 images in f555w and f814w show two extended objectsclose to the radio components, which we identify as two lens galaxies. theircolours and mass-to-light ratios seem to favour two late-type spiral galaxiesat relatively high redshifts (z_d&gt;~0.5). faint emission is also detected atpositions corresponding to the radio images.  a two-lens mass model can explain the observed vlba structure. the best fitmodel has a reduced chi^2 of 1.1. the relative positions of the vlbasubcomponents are reproduced within 0.08 mas, the flux density ratios within0.19. we also reproduce the position angle and separation of the two vlbasubcomponents in a and b within the observational errors, which we considerstrong evidence for the validity of the lens model. moreover, we find a surfacedensity axis ratio of 0.74^{+0.10}_{-0.12} for the primary lens (g1),consistent with the surface brightness axis ratio of 0.69+-0.15. also, thesurface density position angle of 4.9^{+28.2}_{-22.4} degree of g1 compareswell with the -6+-13 degree position angle of the surface brightnessdistribution. the errors indicate the 99 per cent confidence interval.

astro-ph;9903226	optical spectroscopy of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum sources	we present spectroscopic observations of a sample of faint gigahertz peakedspectrum (gps) radio sources drawn from the westerbork northern sky survey(wenss). redshifts have been determined for 19 (40%) of the objects. theoptical spectra of the gps sources identified with low redshift galaxies showdeep stellar absorption features. this confirms previous suggestions that theiroptical light is not significantly contaminated by agn-related emission, but isdominated by a population of old (&gt;9 gyr) and metal-rich (&gt;0.2 [fe/h]) stars,justifying the use of these (probably) young radio sources as probes of galaxyevolution. the optical spectra of gps sources identified with quasars areindistinguishable from those of flat spectrum quasars, and clearly differentfrom the spectra of compact steep spectrum (css) quasars. the redshiftdistribution of the gps quasars in our radio-faint sample is comparable to thatof the bright samples presented in the literature, peaking at z ~ 2-3. it isunlikely that a significant population of low redshift gps quasars is misseddue to selection effects in our sample. we therefore claim that there is agenuine difference between the redshift distributions of gps galaxies andquasars, which, because it is present in both the radio-faint and brightsamples, can not be due to a redshift-luminosity degeneracy. it is thereforeunlikely that the gps quasars and galaxies are unified by orientation, unlessthe quasar opening angle is a strong function of redshift. we suggest that thegps quasars and galaxies are unrelated populations and just happen to haveidentical observed radio-spectral properties, and hypothesise that gps quasarsare a sub-class of flat spectrum quasars.

astro-ph;9910448	giant and `double-double' radio galaxies: implications for the evolution  of powerful radio sources and the igm	giant radio sources form the linear size extreme of the extra-galactic radiosource population. using the wenss survey, we have selected a complete sampleof these sources. we have investigated the properties of their radiostructures. we find, among other things, that these sources are old (50-100myr) and have higher advance velocities than smaller sources of similar radiopower. we find pressure gradients in their radio lobes, suggesting that thelobes are still overpressured with respect to the environment. further, we findno evidence for a cosmological evolution of the radio lobe pressures withincreasing redshift, at least up to $z\sim 0.4$, other than that caused byselection effects. we argue that a much fainter sample of giant sources thancurrently available is needed to constrain the pressure in their environments,the igm. another extremely important discovery is that of a population of radiosources with a so-called `double-double' structure, i.e. that of a smalltwo-sided radio source embedded inside a much larger two-sided structure. weargue that these sources result from an interrupted central jet-formingactivity. as such, they are the most convincing examples of radio sources witha history of interrupted activity, yet. since the inner lobes advance withinthe outer lobes, high resolution low frequency ($\sim 200$ mhz) polarizationstudies may reveal the constituents of radio lobes and cocoons. we thus arguefor a ska design that can provide low-frequency images at arcsec resolution,but which is also sensitive to structures as large as a few tens of arcminuteon the sky.

astro-ph;9912141	radio galaxies with a `double-double' morphology: i - analysis of the  radio properties and evidence for interrupted activity in active galactic  nuclei	we present four mpc-sized radio galaxies which consist of a pair ofdouble-lobed radio sources, aligned along the same axis, and with a coincidingradio core. we have called these peculiar radio sources `double-double' radiogalaxies (ddrg) and propose a general definition of such sources: a`double-double' radio galaxy consists of a pair of double radio sources with acommon centre. furthermore, the two lobes of the inner radio source must have aclearly extended, edge-brightened radio morphology. adopting this definition wefind several other candidate ddrgs in the literature. we find that in allsources the smaller (inner) pair of radio lobes is less luminous than thelarger (outer) pair, and that the ratio of 1.4-ghz flux density of these twopairs appears to be anti-correlated with the projected linear size of the innersource. also, the outer radio structures are large, exceeding 700 kpc. wediscuss possible formation scenarios of the ddrgs, and we conclude that aninterruption of the jet-forming central activity is the most likely mechanism.for one of our sources (b 1834+620) we have been able to observationallyconstrain the length of time of the interruption to a few myr. we discussseveral scenarios for the cause of the interruption and suggest multipleencounters between interacting galaxies as a possibility. finally, we discusswhether such interruptions help the formation of extremely large radio sources.

astro-ph;9912143	the radio source b 1834+620: a double-double radio galaxy with  interesting properties	we present a study of the peculiar radio galaxy b 1834+620. it ischaracterised by the presence of a 420-kpc large edge-brightened radio sourcewhich is situated within, and well aligned with, a larger (1.66 mpc) radiosource. both sources apparently originate in the same host galaxy, which has ar_s-magnitude of 19.7 and a redshift of 0.5194, as determined from the strongemission-lines in the spectrum. we have determined the rotation measurestowards this source, as well as the radio spectral energy distribution of itscomponents. the radio spectrum of the large outer source is steeper than thatof the smaller inner source. the radio core has a spectrum that peaks at afrequency of a few ghz. the rotation measures towards the four main componentsare quite similar, within $\sim\!2$ rad m$^{-2}$ of 58 rad m$^{-2}$. they areprobably largely galactic in origin. we have used the presence of a brighthotspot in the northern outer lobe to constrain the advance velocity of theinner radio lobes to the range between 0.19c and 0.29c, depending on theorientation of the source. this corresponds to an age of this structure in therange between 2.6 and 5.8 myr. we estimate a density of the ambient medium ofthe inner lobes of $\la 1.6 \times 10^{-30}$ gr\,cm$^{-3}$ (particle density$\la 8 \times 10^{-7}$ cm$^{-3}$). a low ambient density is further supportedby the discrepancy between the large optical emission-line luminosity of thehost galaxy and the relatively low radio power of the inner lobes.

astro-ph;9912218	the discovery of a microarcsecond quasar: j1819+3845	we report on the discovery of a source which exhibits over 300% amplitudechanges in radio flux density on the period of hours. this source, j1819+3845,is the most extremely variable extragalactic source known in the radio sky. webelieve these properties are due to interstellar scintillation, and show thatthe source must emit at least 55% of its flux density within a radius of &lt;16microarcseconds at 5ghz. the apparent brightness temperature is &gt; 5.10^{12} k,and the source may be explained by a relativistically moving source with adoppler factor ~15. the scattering occurs predominantly in material only a fewtens of parsecs from the earth, which explains its unusually rapid variability.if the source pks 0405-385 (kedziora-chudczer et al 1997) is similarly affectedby local scattering material, doppler factors of ~1000 are not required toexplain this source. the discovery of a second source whose properties are wellmodeled by interstellar scintillation strengthens the argument for this as thecause for much of the variations seen in intra-day variables (idv).

0810.4211	wsrt faraday tomography of the galactic ism at \lambda ~ 0.86 m	we investigate the properties of the galactic ism by applying faradaytomography to a radio polarization data set in the direction of the galacticanti-centre. we address the problem of missing large-scale structure in ourdata, and show that this does not play an important role for the results wepresent. the main peak of the faraday depth spectra in our data set is notmeasurably resolved for about 8% of the lines of sight. an unresolved peakindicates a separation between the regions with faraday rotation andsynchrotron emission. however, cosmic rays pervade the ism, and synchrotronemission would therefore also be produced where there is faraday rotation. wesuggest that the orientation of the magnetic field can separate the twoeffects. by modelling the thermal electron contribution to the faraday depth,we map the strength of the magnetic field component along the line of sight.polarized point sources in our data set have rotation measures that arecomparable to the faraday depths of the diffuse emission in our data. ourfaraday depth maps show narrow canals of low polarized intensity. we concludethat depolarization over the telescope beam produces at least some of thesecanals. finally, we investigate the properties of one conspicuous region inthis data set and argue that it is created by a decrease in line-of-sightdepolarization compared to its surroundings.
