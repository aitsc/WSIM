0902.1188	the greater impact of mergers on the growth of massive galaxies:  implications for mass assembly and evolution since z~1	using deep infrared observations conducted with the moircs on the subarutelescope in goods-n combined with public surveys in goods-s, we investigatethe dependence on stellar mass, m_*, and galaxy type of the close pair fraction(5 kpc &lt; r &lt; 20 kpc) and implied merger rate. in common with some recentstudies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in majormergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift toz~1.2, with (1+z)^{1.6 \pm 1.6}. our key finding is that massive galaxies withm_* &gt; 1e11 msun are more likely to host merging companions than less massivesystems (m_* ~ 1e10 msun). we find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red,spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectationsbased on clustering at small scales. so-called "dry" mergers between early-typegalaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with m_* &gt; 3e10 msun at z~0.5, butless than 30% at z~1. this result can be explained by the increasing abundanceof red, early-type galaxies at these masses. we compare the volumetric mergerrate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxyevolution, finding that major mergers cannot fully account for the formation ofspheroidal galaxies since z~1. in terms of mass assembly, major mergerscontribute little to galaxy growth below m_* ~ 3e10 msun but are moresignificant among galaxies with m_* &gt; 1e11 msun, 30% of which have undergonemostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. overall, the relativelymore rapid coalescence of high mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchicalgrowth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if thedownsizing of star formation and morphological evolution involves additionalphysical processes.

0902.2064	photometric h alpha and [o ii] luminosity function of sdf and sxdf  galaxies: implications for future baryon oscillation surveys	efficient selection of emission line galaxies at z &gt; 1 by photometricinformation in wide field surveys is one of the keys for future spectroscopicsurveys to constrain dark energy using the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)signature. here we estimate the h alpha and [o ii] line luminosity functions ofgalaxies at z = 0.5-1.7 using a novel approach where multi-wavelength imagingdata is used to jointly estimate both photometric redshifts and star-formationrates. these photometric estimates of line luminosities at high-redshift usethe large data sets of the subaru deep field and subaru xmm-newton deep field(covering \sim 1 deg^2) and are calibrated with the spectroscopic data of thelocal sloan digital sky survey galaxies. the derived luminosity functions(especially h alpha) are in reasonable agreement with the past estimates basedon spectroscopic or narrow-band-filter surveys. this dataset is useful forexamining the photometric selection of target galaxies for bao surveys becauseof the large cosmological volume covered and the large number of galaxies withdetailed photometric information. we use the sample to derive the photometricand physical properties of emission line galaxies to assist planning for futurespectroscopic bao surveys. we also show some examples of photometric selectionprocedures which can efficiently select these emission line galaxies.

0911.1717	optical and near-ir spectroscopy of candidate red galaxies in two z~2.5  proto-clusters	we present a spectroscopic campaign to follow-up red colour-selectedcandidate massive galaxies in two high redshift proto-clusters surroundingradio galaxies. we observed a total of 57 galaxies in the field of mrc0943-242(z=2.93) and 33 in the field of pks1138-262 (z=2.16) with a mix of optical andnear-infrared multi-object spectroscopy.  we confirm two red galaxies in the field of pks1138-262 at the redshift ofthe radio galaxy. based on an analysis of their spectral energy distributions,and their derived star formation rates from the h-alpha and 24um flux, oneobject belongs to the class of dust-obscured star-forming red galaxies, whilethe other is evolved with little ongoing star formation. this result representsthe first red and mainly passively evolving galaxy to be confirmed as companiongalaxies in a z&gt;2 proto-cluster. both red galaxies in pks1138-262 are massive,of the order of 4-6x10^11 m_sol. they lie along a colour-magnitude relationwhich implies that they formed the bulk of their stellar population around z=4.  in the mrc0943-242 field we find no red galaxies at the redshift of the radiogalaxy but we do confirm the effectiveness of our jhk_s selection of galaxiesat 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.1, finding that 10 out of 18 (56%) of jhk_s-selected galaxies whoseredshifts could be measured fall within this redshift range. we alsoserendipitously identify an interesting foreground structure of 6 galaxies atz=2.6 in the field of mrc0943-242. this may be a proto-cluster itself, butcomplicates any interpretation of the red sequence build-up in mrc0943-242until more redshifts can be measured.

0911.2530	high star formation activity in the central region of a distant cluster  at z=1.46	we present an unbiased deep [oii] emission survey of a cluster xmmxcsj2215.9-1738 at z=1.46, the most distant cluster to date with a detection ofextended x-ray emission. with wide-field optical and near-infrared cameras(suprime-cam and moircs, respectively) on subaru telescope, we performed deepimaging with a narrow-band filter nb912 (lambda_c=9139a, delta_lambda=134a) aswell as broad-band filters (b, z', j and ks). from the photometric catalogues,we have identified 44 [oii] emitters in the cluster central region of 6'x6'down to a dust-free star formation rate of 2.6 msun/yr (3 sigma).interestingly, it is found that there are many [oii] emitters even in thecentral high density region. in fact, the fraction of [oii] emitters to thecluster members as well as their star formation rates and equivalent widthsstay almost constant with decreasing cluster-centric distance up to the clustercore. unlike clusters at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) where star formation activity ismostly quenched in their central regions, this higher redshift 2215 clustershows its high star formation activity even at its centre, suggesting that weare beginning to enter the formation epoch of some galaxies in the cluster coreeventually. moreover, we find a deficit of galaxies on the red sequence atmagnitudes fainter than ~m*+0.5 on the colour-magnitude diagram. this breakmagnitude is brighter than that of lower redshift clusters, and it is likelythat we are seeing the formation phase of more massive red galaxies in thecluster core at z~1. these results may indicate inside-out and down-sizingpropagation of star formation activity in the course of cluster evolution.

0912.2786	panoramic h-alpha and mid-infrared mapping of star formation in a z=0.8  cluster	we present the first wide-field h-alpha imaging survey around the distantcluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81 with a narrow-band filter on moircs/subaru,down to sfr(ha)~1msun/yr. combining with a wide-field mir imaging survey withakari, we compare the unobscured and obscured star formation activities in thecluster. we find that both h-alpha emitters and mir galaxies avoid the clustercentre and their spatial distribution is quite similar. most of the h-alphaemitters show blue colours, but we find some h-alpha emitters on the redsequence. the mir galaxies tend to be systematically redder than the h-alphaemitters probably due to heavy dust extinction. interestingly, the red h-alphaemitters and the red mir galaxies (i.e. dusty red galaxies) are most commonlyseen in the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups andfilaments, where optical colours of galaxies change. we also find that a(ha)exceeds ~3 in extreme cases and that such very dusty galaxies are also locatedin the medium-density environment. these findings suggest that dusty starformation is triggered in the in-fall region of the cluster, implying aprobable link between galaxy transition and dusty star formation. we finallycalculate the cluster total sfr and find that the cluster total sfr based onh-alpha alone can be underestimated more than factor ~2 even after 1 magextinction correction. we suggest that the mass-normalized cluster sfr rapidlydeclines since z~1 following ~(1+z)^6, although the uncertainty is still large.

0707.3161	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). iv. evolution of lya emitters  from z=3.1 to 5.7 in the 1 deg^2 field: luminosity functions and agn	we present luminosity functions (lfs) and various properties of lya emitters(laes) at z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7, in a 1 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey (sxds) field. we obtain a photometric sample of 858 lae candidates basedon deep subaru/suprime-cam imaging data, and a spectroscopic sample of 84confirmed laes from subaru/focas and vlt/vimos spectroscopy in a survey volumeof ~10^6 mpc^3 with a limiting lya luminosity of ~3x10^42 erg/s. we derive thelfs of lya and uv-continuum (~1500 \aa) for each redshift, taking into accountthe statistical error and the field-to-field variation. we find that theapparent lya lf shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 withinfactors of 1.8 and 2.7 in l* and phi*, respectively. on the other hand, the uvlf of laes increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with lyaemission are more common at earlier epochs. we identify six laes with agnactivities from our spectra combined with vla, spitzer, and xmm-newton data.among the photometrically selected laes at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show agnactivities, while the brightest laes with logl(lya) &gt;~ 43.4-43.6 erg/s appearto always host agns. our laes are bluer in uv-continuum color than dropoutgalaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. ourstacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and thef(heii)/f(lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation(+low-luminosity agn) and the primordial population in laes.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1008.1094	galaxy protocluster candidates at 1.6&lt;z&lt;2	we present a study of protoclusters associated with high redshift radiogalaxies. we imaged mrc1017-220 (z=1.77) and mrc0156-252 (z=2.02) using thenear-infrared wide-field (7.5'x7.5') imager vlt/hawk-i in the y, h and ksbands. we present the first deep y-band galaxy number counts within a largearea (200 arcmin2). we then develop a purely near-infrared colour selectiontechnique to isolate galaxies at 1.6&lt;z&lt;3 that may be associated with the twotargets, dividing them into (i) red passively evolving or dusty star-forminggalaxies or (ii) blue/star-formation dominated galaxies with little or no dust.both targeted fields show an excess of star-forming galaxies with respect tocontrol fields. no clear overdensity of red galaxies is detected in thesurroundings of mrc1017-220 although the spatial distribution of the redgalaxies resembles a filament-like structure within which the radio galaxy isembedded. in contrast, a significant overdensity of red galaxies is detected inthe field of mrc0156-252, ranging from a factor of 2-3 times the field densityat large scales (2.5mpc, angular distance) up to a factor of 3-4 times thefield density within a 1mpc radius of the radio galaxy. half of these redgalaxies have colours consistent with red sequence models at z~2, with a largefraction being bright (ks&lt;21.5, i.e. massive). in addition, we also find asmall group of galaxies within 5" of mrc0156-252 suggesting that the radiogalaxy has multiple companions within ~50 kpc. we conclude that the field ofmrc0156-252 shows many remarkable similarities with the well-studiedprotocluster surrounding pks1138-262 (z=2.16) suggesting that mrc0156-252 isassociated with a galaxy protocluster at z~2.

1012.1869	discovery of an excess of halpha emitters around 4c 23.56 at z=2.48	we report the discovery of a significant excess of candidate halpha emitters(haes) in the field of the radio galaxy 4c 23.56 at z=2.483. using the moircsnear-infrared imager on the subaru telescope we found 11 candidateemission-line galaxies to a flux limit of ~7.5 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2, which isabout 5 times excess from the expected field counts with ~3-sigma significance.three of these are spectroscopically confirmed as redshifted halpha at z=2.49.the distribution of candidate emitters on the sky is tightly confined to a1.2-mpc-radius area at z=2.49, locating 4c 23.56 at the western edge of thedistribution. analysis of the deep spitzer mips 24 mu m imaging shows thatthere is also an excess of faint mips sources. all but two of the 11 haes arealso found in the mips data. the inferred star-formation rate (sfr) of the haesbased on the extinction-corrected halpha luminosity (median sfr &gt;~100 m_solaryr-1) is similar to those of haes in random fields at z~2. on the other hand,the mips-based sfr for the haes is on average 3.6 times larger, suggesting theexistence of the star-formation significanly obscured by dust. the comparisonof the halpha-based star-formation activities of the haes in the 4c 23.56 fieldto those in another proto-cluster around pks 1138-262 at z=2.16 reveals thatthe latter tend to have fainter halpha emission despite similar k-bandmagnitudes. this suggests that star-formation may be suppressed in the pks1138-262 protocluster relative to the 4c 23.56 protocluster. this differenceamong the haes in the two proto-clusters at z &gt; 2 may imply that some massivecluster galaxies are just forming at these epochs with some variation amongclusters.

1012.4860	cosmic star formation activity at z=2.2 probed by h-alpha emission line  galaxies	we present a pilot narrow-band survey of h-alpha emitters at z=2.2 in thegreat observatories origins deep survey north (goods-n) field with moircsinstrument on the subaru telescope. the survey reached a 3 sigma limitingmagnitude of 23.6 (nb209) which corresponds to a 3 sigma limiting line flux of2.5 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 over a 56 arcmnin^2 contiguous area (excluding ashallower area). from this survey, we have identified 11 h-alpha emitters andone agn at z=2.2 on the basis of narrow-band excesses and photometricredshifts. we obtained spectra for seven new objects among them, including oneagn, and an emission line above 3 sigma is detected from all of them. we haveestimated star formation rates (sfr) and stellar masses (m_star) for individualgalaxies. the average sfr and m_star is 27.8m_solar yr^-1 and 4.0 x10^10m_solar, respectivly. their specific star formation rates are inverselycorrelated with their stellar masses. fitting to a schechter function yieldsthe h-alpha luminosity function with log l = 42.82, log phi = -2.78 and alpha =-1.37. the average star formation rate density in the survey volume isestimated to be 0.31m_solar yr^-1mpc^-3 according to the kennicutt relationbetween h-alpha luminosity and star formation rate. we compare our h-alphaemitters at z=2.2 in goods-n with narrow-band line emitters in other field andclusters to see their time evolution and environmental dependence. we find thatthe star formation activity is reduced rapidly from z=2.5 to z=0.8 in thecluster environment, while it is only moderately changed in the fieldenvironment. this result suggests that the timescale of galaxy formation isdifferent among different environments, and the star forming activities in highdensity regions eventually overtake those in lower density regions as aconsequence of "galaxy formation bias" at high redshifts.

1103.2180	red star forming galaxies and their environment at z=0.4 revealed by  panoramic h-alpha imaging	we present a wide-field h-alpha imaging survey of the rich clustercl0939+4713 (abell 851) at z=0.41 with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope,using the narrow-band filter nb921. the survey is sensitive to active galaxieswith star formation rates down to ~0.3msun/yr throughout the 27'x27' field, andwe identified 445 h-alpha emitters along the large-scale structures around thecluster. using this sample, we find that (1) the fraction of h-alpha emittersis a strong function of environment and shows a clear decline toward thecluster central region. we also find that (2) the color of h-alpha emitters isclearly dependent on environment. the majority of the h-alpha emitters haveblue colors with b-i&lt;2, but we find h-alpha emitters with red colors as well.such red emitters are very rare in the cluster center or its immediatesurrounding regions, while they are most frequently found in groups located faraway from the cluster center. these groups coincide with the environment wherea sharp transition in galaxy color distribution is seen. this may suggest thatdusty star formation activity tends to be involved in galaxy truncationprocesses that are effective in groups, and it is probably related to the"pre-processing" that generates present-day cluster s0 galaxies. finally, weconfirm that (3) the mass-normalized integrated star formation rate in clusters(i.e. the total star formation rate within 0.5xr200 from the cluster centerdivided by the cluster dynamical mass) rapidly increases with look-back timefollowing approximately ~(1+z)^6, and it is also correlated with the clustermass.

1104.2121	properties of star-forming galaxies in a cluster and its surrounding  structure at z=1.46	we conduct a narrow-band imaging survey of [oii] emitters over a 32'x23' areain and around the xmmxcs j2215.9-1738 cluster at z=1.46 withsubaru/suprime-cam, and select 380 [oii] emitting galaxies down to 1.4e-17erg/s/cm2. among them, 16 [oii] emitters in the cluster central region areconfirmed by nir spectroscopy with subaru/moircs. we find that [oii] emittersare distributed along filamentary large-scale structures around the cluster.the z'-k vs k colour-magnitude diagram shows that a significantly higherfraction of [oii] emitters is seen on the red sequence in the cluster core thanin other environments we define in this paper. it is likely that these redgalaxies are nearly passively evolving galaxies which host [oii] emitting agns,rather than dust-reddened star-forming galaxies. we argue therefore that agnfeedback may be one of the critical processes to quench star formation inmassive galaxies in high density regions. we also find that the cluster hasexperienced high star formation activities at rates comparable to that in thefield at z=1.46. in addition, a mass-metallicity relation exists in the clusterat z=1.46, which is similar to that of star-forming galaxies in the field atz~2. these results all suggest that at z~1.5 star formation activity in thecluster core becomes as high as those in low density environments and there isapparently not yet a strong environmental dependence, except for the redemitters.

0710.0632	dependence of the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation on cluster  richness at z ~ 0.8	we present environmental dependence of the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation (cmr) at z ~ 0.8. it is well established that massive early-typegalaxies exhibit a tight cmr in clusters up to at least z ~ 1. the faint end ofthe relation, however, has been much less explored especially at high redshiftsprimarily due to limited depths of the data. some recent papers have reported adeficit of the faint red galaxies on the cmr at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1, but this has notbeen well confirmed yet and is still controversial. using a deep, multi-colour,panoramic imaging data set of the distant cluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81,newly taken with the prime focus camera (suprime-cam) on the subaru telescope,we carry out an analysis of faint red galaxies with a care for incompleteness.we find that there is a sharp decline in the number of red galaxies toward thefaint end of the cmr below m*+2. we compare our result with those for otherclusters at z ~ 0.8 taken from the literature, which show or do not show thedeficit. we suggest that the "deficit" of faint red galaxies is dependent onthe richness or mass of the clusters, in the sense that poorer systems showstronger deficits. this indicates that the evolutionary stage of less massivegalaxies depends critically on environment.

1204.1165	a large scale structure traced by [oii] emitters hosting a distant  cluster at z=1.62	we present a panoramic narrow-band imaging survey of [oii] emitters in andaround the clg j0218.3-0510 cluster at z=1.62 with suprime-cam on subarutelescope. 352 [oii] emitters were identified on the basis of narrow-bandexcesses and photometric redshifts. we discovered a huge filamentary structurewith some clumps traced by [oii] emitters and found that the clg j0218.3-0510cluster is embedded in an even larger super-structure than the one reportedpreviously. 31 [oii] emitters were spectroscopically confirmed with thedetection of h-alpha and/or [oiii] emission lines by fmos observations. in thehigh density regions such as cluster core and clumps, star-forming [oii]emitters show a high overdensity by a factor of more than 10 compared to thefield region. although the star formation activity is very high even in thecluster core, some massive quiescent galaxies also exits at the same time.furthermore, the properties of the individual [oii] emitters, such as starformation rates, stellar masses and specific star formation rates, do not showa significant dependence on the local density, either. such lack ofenvironmental dependence is consistent with our earlier result by hayashi etal. (2011) on a z=1.5 cluster and its surrounding region. the fact that thestar-forming activity of galaxies in the cluster core is as high as that in thefield at z~1.6 may suggest that the star-forming galaxies are probably just ina transition phase from a starburst mode to a quiescent mode, and are thusshowing comparable level of star formation rates to those in lower densityenvironments. we may be witnessing the start of the reversal of the localsfr--density relation due to the "biased" galaxy formation and evolution inhigh density regions at high this redshift, beyond which massive galaxies wouldbe forming vigorously in a more biased way in proto-cluster cores.

1210.0972	massive starburst galaxies in a z=2.16 proto-cluster unveiled by  panoramic h-alpha mapping	we present a panoramic narrow-band study of h-alpha emitters in the field ofthe z=2.16 proto-cluster around pks1138-262 using moircs on the subarutelescope. we find 83 h-alpha emitters down to a sfr(ha)~10msun/yr across a~7'x7' region centered on the radio galaxy, and identify ~10-mpc scalefilaments of emitters running across this region. by examining the propertiesof h-alpha emitters within the large-scale structure, we find that galaxies inthe higher-density environments at z=2.16 tend to have redder colours andhigher stellar masses compared to galaxies in more underdense regions. we alsofind a population of h-alpha emitters with red colours ((j-ks)&gt;1), which aremuch more frequent in the denser environments and which have apparently veryhigh stellar masses with m*&gt;~10^11msun, implying that these cluster galaxieshave already formed a large part of their stellar mass before z~2. spitzerspace telescope 24-micron data suggests that many of these red h-alpha emittersare bright, dusty starbursts (rather than quiescent sources). we also find thatthe proto-cluster galaxies follow the same correlation between sfr and m* (the"main sequence") of z~2 field star-forming galaxies, but with an excess ofmassive galaxies. these very massive star-forming galaxies are not seen in oursimilar, previous study of z~1 clusters, suggesting that their star-formationactivity has been shut off at 1&lt;~z&lt;~2. we infer that the massive red (butactive) galaxies in this rich proto-cluster are likely to be the products ofenvironmental effects, and they represent the accelerated galaxy formation andevolution in a biased high density region in the early universe.

1212.4905	calibrating [oii] star-formation rates at z&gt;1 from dual h\alpha-[oii]  imaging from hizels	we investigate the relationship between h\alpha\ and [oii](\lambda 3727)emission in faint star-forming galaxies at z=1.47 with dust uncorrected starformation rates (sfrs) down to 1.4 msun/yr, using data in two narrow-bands fromwfcam/ukirt and suprime-cam/subaru. a stacking analysis allows us toinvestigate h\alpha\ emission flux from bright [oii] emitters as well as faintones for which h\alpha\ is not individually detected, and to compare them witha large sample of local galaxies. we find that there is a clear, positivecorrelation between the average h\alpha\ and [oii] luminosities for [oii]emitters at z=1.47, with its slope being consistent with the local relation.[oii] emitters at z=1.47 have lower mean observed ratios of h\alpha/[oii]suggesting a small but systematic offset (at 2.8\sigma\ significance) towardslower values of dust attenuation, a(h\alpha)~0.35, than local galaxies. thisconfirms that [oii] selection tends to pick up galaxies which are significantlyless dusty on average than h\alpha\ selected ones, with the difference beinghigher at z=1.47 than at z=0. the discrepancy of the observed line ratiosbetween [oii] emitters at z=1.47 and the local galaxies may in part be due tothe samples having different metallicities. however, we demonstrate thatmetallicity is unlikely to be the main cause. therefore, it is important totake into account that the relations for the dust correction which are derivedusing h\alpha\ emitter samples, and frequently used in many studies of high-zgalaxies, may overestimate the intrinsic sfrs of [oii]-selected galaxies, andthat surveys of [oii] emission galaxies are likely to miss dusty populations.

1302.5315	on the evolution and environmental dependence of the star formation rate  versus stellar mass relation since z~2	this paper discusses the evolution of the correlation between galaxy starformation rates (sfrs) and stellar mass (m*) over the last ~10 gyrs,particularly focusing on its environmental dependence. we first present themid-infrared (mir) properties of the h-alpha-selected galaxies in a richcluster cl0939+4713 at z=0.4. with a mir stacking analysis, we find that themedian sfr of h-alpha emitters is higher in higher-density environment atz=0.4. we also find that star-forming galaxies in high-density environment tendto have higher specific sfr (ssfr), although the trend is much less significantcompared to that of sfr. this increase of ssfr in high-density environment isnot visible when we consider the sfr derived from h-alpha alone, suggestingthat the dust attenuation in galaxies depends on environment; galaxies inhigh-density environment tend to be dustier (by up to ~0.5 mag). we thendiscuss the environmental dependence of the sfr-m* relation for star-forminggalaxies since z~2, by compiling our comparable, narrow-band selected, largeh-alpha emitter samples in both distant cluster environments (frommahalo-subaru) and field environments (from hizels). we find that the ssfr ofh-alpha-selected galaxies (at the fixed mass of log(m*/msun)=10) rapidlyevolves as (1+z)^3, but the sfr-m* relation is independent of the environmentsince z~2, as far as we rely on the h-alpha-based sfrs (with m*-dependentextinction correction). even if we consider the possible environmentalvariation in the dust attenuation, we conclude that the difference in thesfr-m* relation between cluster and field star-forming galaxies is always small(~&lt;0.2dex level) at any time in the history of the universe since z~2.[abridged]

1303.0118	probing of the interactions between the hot plasmas and galaxies in  clusters from z=0.1 to 0.9	based on optical and x-ray data for a sample of 34 relaxed rich clusters ofgalaxies with redshifts of 0.1-0.9, we studied relative spatial distributionsof the two major baryon contents, the cluster galaxies and the hot plasmas.using multi-band photometric data taken with the uh88 telescope, we determinedthe integrated (two dimensional) radial light profiles of member galaxies ineach cluster using two independent approaches, i.e., the background subtractionand the color-magnitude filtering. the icm mass profile of each cluster in oursample, also integrated in two dimensions, was derived from aspatially-resolved spectral analysis using xmm-newton and chandra data. then,the radially-integrated light profile of each cluster was divided by its icmmass profile, to obtain a profile of "galaxy light vs. icm mass ratio". theratio profiles over the central 0.65 r500 regions were found to steepen fromthe higher- to lower- redshift subsamples, meaning that the galaxies becomemore concentrated in the icm sphere towards lower redshifts. the evolution isalso seen in galaxy number vs. icm mass ratio profiles. a range of systematicuncertainties in the galaxy light measurements, as well as manyradius-/redshift- dependent biases to the galaxy vs. icm profiles have beenassessed, but none of them is significant against the observed evolution.besides, the galaxy light vs. total mass ratio profiles also exhibit gradualconcentration towards lower redshift. we interpret in the context that thegalaxies, the icm, and the dark matter components followed a similar spatialdistribution in the early phase (z&gt;0.5), while the galaxies have fallen towardsthe center relative to the others at a later phase.

1306.4406	on the formation time scale of massive cluster ellipticals based on deep  near-ir spectroscopy at z~2	we present improved constraints on the formation time scale of massivecluster galaxies based on rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies in a formingcluster located at z=2.16. the spectra are obtained with moircs on the subarutelescope with an integration time of ~7 hours. we achieve accurate redshiftmeasurements by fitting seds using the spectra and broad-band photometrysimultaneously, allowing us to identify probable cluster members. clusters atlow redshifts are dominated by quiescent galaxies, but we find that quiescentgalaxies and star forming galaxies co-exist in this z=2 system. interestingly,the quiescent galaxies form a weak red sequence in the process of forming. bystacking the spectra of star forming galaxies, we observe strong emission linessuch as [oii] and [oiii] and we obtain a tentative hint of agn activities inthese galaxies. on the other hand, the stacked spectrum of the quiescentgalaxies reveals a clear 4000a break with a possible caii h+k absorptionfeature and strong emission lines such as [oii] are absent in the spectrum,confirming the quiescent nature of these galaxies. we then perform detailedspectral analyses of the stacked spectrum, which suggest that these massivequiescent galaxies formed at redshifts between 3 and 4 on a time scale of &lt;~0.5gyr. this short formation time scale is not reproduced in recent numericalsimulations. we discuss possible mechanisms for how these galaxies form 10^11msun stellar mass on a short time scale and become red and quiescent by z=2.

1309.0506	a fundamental metallicity relation for galaxies at z = 0.84 - 1.47 from  hizels	we obtained subaru fmos observations of halpha emitting galaxies selectedfrom the hizels narrow-band survey, to investigate the relationship betweenstellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate at z = 0.84 - 1.47, forcomparison with the fundamental metallicity relation seen at low redshift. ourfindings demonstrate, for the first time with a homogeneously selected sample,that a relationship exists for typical star-forming galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5 andthat it is surprisingly similar to that seen locally. therefore, star-forminggalaxies at z = 1 - 1.5 are no less metal abundant than galaxies of similarmass and star formation rate (sfr) at z = 0.1, contrary to claims from someearlier studies. we conclude that the bulk of the metal enrichment for thisstar-forming galaxy population takes place in the 4 gyr before z = 1.5. we fita new mass-metallicity-sfr plane to our data which is consistent with otherhigh redshift studies. however, there is some evidence that themass-metallicity component of this high redshift plane is flattened, at allsfr, compared with z = 0.1, suggesting that processes such as star-formationdriven winds, thought to remove enriched gas from low mass halos, are yet tohave as large an impact at this early epoch. the negative slope of thesfr-metallicity relation from this new plane is consistent with the picturethat the elevation in the sfr of typical galaxies at z &gt; 1 is fuelled by theinflow of metal-poor gas and not major merging.

1309.2587	discovery of nine extended ionized gas clouds in a z=0.4 cluster	from deep h-alpha imaging data of suprime-cam/subaru, we discovered nineextended ionized gas clouds (eig) around galaxies in abell 851 cluster (a851)at z=0.4. we surveyed 30 x 25 arcmin region, and the eigs were found only nearthe cluster center (&lt;2.3 arcmin ~ 750 kpc). the parent galaxies of the eigs arestar-forming or post-starburst galaxies, all of which are spectroscopicallyconfirmed members of the cluster. four out of the nine parent galaxies showdistortion of stellar distribution in the disk, which can be a sign of recentinteraction, and the interaction may have made eigs. on the other hand, sixparent galaxies (one overlaps those exhibiting distortion) show h-alphaemission without stars, which implies a ram pressure stripping.the spe ctrum ofthe brightest parent galaxy shows a post-starburst signature, and resembles theh-alpha stripped galaxies found in the coma cluster. meanwhile, two brightestparent galaxies in a851 are more massive than the eig parent galaxies in thecoma cluster. this is consistent with "downsizing" of star-forming galaxies,though it is still in a statistical fluctuation. we also analyzed suprime-camdata of another z=0.39 cluster, cl0024+17, but found no eigs. the keydifference between a851 and cl0024+17 would be the existence of a subclustercolliding with the main body of a851, in which six or seven out of the nineparent galaxies in a851 exist, and the fraction of eigs in the subcluster issignificantly higher than the main subcluster of a851 and cl0024+17.

1311.4259	nature of h-alpha selected galaxies at z&gt;2. i. main sequence and dusty  star-forming galaxies	we present the results from our narrow-band imaging surveys of haes at z=2.2and z=2.5 in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field with near-infrared cameramoircs on subaru telescope. we have constructed a clean sample of 63star-forming galaxies at z=2.2 and 46 at z=2.5. for 12 (or ~92%) out of 13h\alpha emitters (haes) at z=2.2, their h\alpha emission lines have beensuccessfully detected by the spectroscopy. while about 42% of the red, massivehaes with m_*&gt;10^{10.8} m_\odot contain agns, most of the blue, less massiveones are likely to be star-forming galaxies. this suggests that the agn mayplay an important role in galaxy evolution at the late stage of truncation. forthe haes excluding possible agns, we estimate the gas-phase metallicities onthe basis of [n~{\sc ii}]/h\alpha ratios, and find that the metallicities ofthe h\alpha selected galaxies at z=2.2 are lower than those of localstar-forming galaxies at fixed stellar mass, as shown by previous studies.moreover, we present and discuss the so-called "main sequence" of star-forminggalaxies at z&gt;2 based on our unique sample of haes. by correlating the level ofdust extinction with the location on the main sequence, we find that there aretwo kinds/modes of dusty star-forming galaxies: star-bursting galaxies andmetal-rich normal star-forming galaxies.

1311.4260	nature of h-alpha selected galaxies at z&gt;2. ii. clumpy galaxies and  compact star-forming galaxies	we present the morphological properties of 109 h\alpha-selected galaxies atz&gt;2 in sxdf-uds-candels field. with high-resolution optical/near-infraredimages obtained by hubble space telescope, we identify giant clumps within theh\alpha emitters (haes). we find that at least 41% of our sample show clumpystructures in the underlying disks. the color gradient of clumps is commonlyseen in the sense that the clumps near the galactic center tend to be redderthan those in the outer regions. the mid-infrared detection in galaxies withred clumps and the spatial distribution of h\alpha emission suggest that dustystar-formation activity is probably occurring in the nuclear red clumps. a gassupply to a bulge component through the clump migration is one of the mostpotent physical processes to produce such dusty star-forming clumps and formmassive bulges in local early-type galaxies. they would become large quiescentgalaxies at later times just by consumption or blowout of remaining gas. also,while most of the haes have extended disks, we observe two massive, compacthaes, whose stellar surface densities are significantly higher. they are likelyto be the direct progenitors of massive, compact quiescent galaxies atz=1.5-2.0. two evolutionary paths to massive quiescent galaxies are devised toaccount for both the size growth of quiescent galaxies and their increasednumber density from z~2 to z=0.

1312.1694	star formation in the cluster clg0218.3-0510 at z=1.62 and its  large-scale environment: the infrared perspective	the galaxy cluster clg0218.3-0510 at z=1.62 is one of the most distant galaxyclusters known, with a rich muti-wavelength data set that confirms a maturegalaxy population already in place. using very deep, wide area (20x20 mpc)imaging by spitzer/mips at 24um, in conjunction with herschel 5-band imagingfrom 100-500um, we investigate the dust-obscured, star-formation properties inthe cluster and its associated large scale environment. our galaxy sample of693 galaxies at z=1.62 detected at 24um (10 spectroscopic and 683 photo-z)includes both cluster galaxies (i.e. within r &lt;1 mpc projected clustercentricradius) and field galaxies, defined as the region beyond a radius of 3 mpc. thestar-formation rates (sfrs) derived from the measured infrared luminosity rangefrom 18 to 2500 ms/yr, with a median of 55 ms/yr, over the entire radial range(10 mpc). the cluster brightest fir galaxy, taken as the centre of the galaxysystem, is vigorously forming stars at a rate of 256$\pm$70 ms/yr, and thetotal cluster sfr enclosed in a circle of 1 mpc is 1161$\pm$96 ms/yr. weestimate a dust extinction of about 3 magnitudes by comparing the sfrs derivedfrom [oii] luminosity with the ones computed from the 24um fluxes. we find thatthe in-falling region (1-3 mpc) is special: there is a significant decrement(3.5x) of passive relative to star-forming galaxies in this region, and thetotal sfr of the galaxies located in this region is lower (130 ms/yr/mpc2) thananywhere in the cluster or field, regardless of their stellar mass. in acomplementary approach we compute the local galaxy density, sigma5, and find notrend between sfr and sigma5. however, we measure an excess of star-forminggalaxies in the cluster relative to the field by a factor 1.7, that lendssupport to a reversal of the sf-density relation in clg0218.

1401.3919	mapping the large scale structure around a z=1.46 galaxy cluster in 3-d  using two adjacent narrow-band filters	we present a novel method to estimate accurate redshifts of star-forminggalaxies by measuring the flux ratio of the same emission line observed throughtwo adjacent narrow-band filters. we apply this method to our nb912 and newnb921 data taken with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope of a galaxy cluster,xmmxcs j2215.9-1738, at z=1.46 and its surrounding structures. we obtainredshifts for 170 [oii] emission line galaxies at z~1.46, among which 41galaxies are spectroscopically confirmed with moircs and fmos on the subarumainly, showing an accuracy of $\sigma$((z-z_spec})/(1+z_spec))=0.002. thisallows us to reveal filamentary structures that penetrate towards the centre ofthe galaxy cluster and intersect with other structures, consistent with thepicture of hierarchical cluster formation. we also find that the projectedcelestial distribution does not precisely trace the real distribution ofgalaxies, indicating the importance of the three dimensional view of structuresto properly identify and quantify galaxy environments. we investigate theenvironmental dependence of galaxy properties with local density, confirmingthat the median colour of galaxies becomes redder in higher density regionwhile the star-formation rate of star-forming galaxies does not depend stronglyon local environment in this structure. this implies that the star-formingactivity in galaxies is truncated on a relatively short time scale in thecluster centre.

1402.3568	identification of the progenitors of rich clusters and member galaxies  in rapid formation at z&gt;2	we present the results of near-infrared spectroscopy of h$\alpha$ emitters(haes) associated with two protoclusters around radio galaxies (pks1138-262 at$z$=2.2 and uss1558-003 at $z$=2.5) with multi-object infrared camera andspectrograph (moircs) on the subaru telescope. among the hae candidatesconstructed from our narrow-band imaging, we have confirmed membership of 27and 36 haes for the respective protoclusters, with a success rate of 70 percent of our observed targets. the large number of spectroscopically confirmedmembers per cluster has enabled us for the first time to reveal the detailedkinematical structures of the protoclusters at $z$$&gt;$2. the clusters showprominent substructures such as clumps, filaments and velocity gradients,suggesting that they are still in the midst of rapid construction to grow torich clusters at later times. we also estimate dynamical masses of the clustersand substructures assuming their local virialization. the inferred masses($\sim$10$^{14}$m$_\odot$) of the protocluster cores are consistent with beingtypical progenitors of the present-day most massive class of galaxy clusters($\sim$10$^{15}$m$_\odot$) if we take into account the typical mass growthhistory of clusters. we then calculated the integrated star formation rates ofthe protocluster cores normalized by the dynamical masses, and compare thesewith lower redshift descendants. we see a marked increase of star-formingactivities in the cluster cores, by almost three orders of magnitude, as we goback in time to 11 billion years ago; this scales as (1$+$$z$)$^6$.

1403.0040	evidence for a gas-rich major merger in a proto-cluster at z=2.5	gas-rich major mergers in high-redshift proto-clusters are important events,perhaps leading to the creation of the slowly rotating remnants seen in thecores of clusters in the present day. here, we present a deep jansky very largearray observation of co j = 1-0 emission line in a proto-cluster at z = 2.5,uss1558-003. the target field is an extremely dense region, where 20 h-alphaemitters (haes) are clustering. we have successfully detected the co emissionline from three haes and discovered a close pair of red and blue co-emittinghaes. given their close proximity (~30 kpc), small velocity offset (~300 km/s),and similar stellar masses, they could be in the early phase of a gas-richmajor merger. for the red hae, we derive a total infrared luminosity ofl(ir)=5.1e12 lsun using mips 24 um and radio continuum images. the l(ir)/l'(co)ratio is significantly enhanced compared to local spirals and high-redshiftdisks with a similar co luminosity, which is indicative of a starburst mode. wefind the gas depletion timescale is shorter than that of normal star-forminggalaxies regardless of adopted co-h2 conversion factors. the identification ofsuch a rare event suggests that gas-rich major mergers frequently take place inproto-clusters at z &gt; 2 and may involve the formation processes of slowrotators seen in local massive clusters.

1405.4165	the environmental impacts on the star formation main sequence: an  h-alpha study of the newly discovered rich cluster at z=1.52	we report the discovery of a strong over-density of galaxies in the field ofa radio galaxy at z=1.52 (4c65.22) based on our broad-band and narrow-band(h-alpha) photometry with subaru telescope. we find that h-alpha emitters arelocated in the outskirts of the density peak (cluster core) dominated bypassive red-sequence galaxies. this resembles the situation in lower-redshiftclusters, suggesting that the newly discovered structure is a well-evolved richgalaxy cluster at z=1.5. our data suggest that the color-density and stellarmass-density relations are already in place at z~1.5, mostly driven by thepassive red massive galaxies residing within rc&lt;200 kpc from the cluster core.these environmental trends almost disappear when we consider only star-forming(sf) galaxies. we do not find sfr-density or ssfr-density relations amongst sfgalaxies, and the location of the sf main sequence does not significantlychange with environment. nevertheless, we find a tentative hint thatstar-bursting galaxies (up-scattered objects from the main sequence) arepreferentially located in a small group at ~1-mpc away from the main body ofthe cluster. we also argue that the scatter of the sf main sequence could bedependent on the distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy.

1406.5219	an early phase of environmental effects on galaxy properties unveiled by  near-infrared spectroscopy of protocluster galaxies at z&gt;2	this work presents the results from our near-infrared spectroscopy ofnarrow-band selected h$\alpha$ emitters (haes) in two rich over-densities (pks1138-262 at $z=2.2$ and uss 1558-003 at $z=2.5$) with the multi-object infraredcamera and spectrograph (moircs) on the subaru telescope. these protoclustersare promising candidates for the most massive class of galaxy clusters seentoday (paper i). the confirmed haes in the protoclusters at $z&gt;2$ show highexcitation levels as characterized by much higher [oiii]/h$\beta$ or[oiii]/h$\alpha$ line ratios than those of general galaxies at low-$z$. such ahigh excitation level may not only be driven by high specific star formationrates (ssfrs) and lower gaseous metallicities, but also be contributed by someother effects. we investigate the environmental dependence of gaseousmetallicities by comparing the haes in the protoclusters with those in thegeneral field at similar redshifts. we find that the gaseous metallicities ofprotocluster galaxies are more chemically enriched than those of field galaxiesat a given stellar mass in the range of m$_\star\lesssim10^{11}$ m$_\odot$.this can be attributed to many processes, such as intrinsic (or nature)effects, external (or nurture) effects, and/or some systematic samplingeffects. we also find that the offset of the mass-metallicity relation in denseenvironment becomes larger at higher redshifts. this can be naturallyunderstood by the fact that the in/out-flow rates in star forming galaxies aremuch higher at higher redshifts. therefore the environmental dependence of such"feeding" and "feedback" mechanisms in galaxy formation are probably playingmajor roles in producing the offset of the mass-metallicity relation for theprotocluster galaxies at $z&gt;2$.

1411.1408	correlation between star formation activity and electron density of  ionized gas at z=2.5	in the redshift interval of $2&lt;z&lt;3$, the physical conditions of theinter-stellar medium (ism) in star-forming galaxies are likely to be differentfrom those in the local universe because of lower gaseous metallicities, highergas fractions, and higher star formation activities. in fact, observationssuggest that higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, andharder uv radiation fields are common. in this paper, based on the spectra ofh$\alpha$-selected star-forming galaxies at $z=2.5$ taken with multi-objectspectrometer for infrared exploration (mosfire) on keck-1 telescope, we measureelectron densities ($n_e$) using the oxygen line ratio ([oii]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between theelectron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. as a result, wefind that the specific star formation rate (ssfr) and the surface density ofsfr ($\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}$) are correlated with the electron density at $z=2.5$for the first time. the $\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}-n_e$ relation is likely to belinked to the star formation law in hii regions (where star formation activityis regulated by interstellar pressure). moreover, we discuss the mode of starformation in those galaxies. the correlation between ssfr and$\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}$ suggests that highly star-forming galaxies (with highssfr) tend to be characterized by higher surface densities of star formation($\sigma_\mathrm{sfr}$) and thus higher $n_e$ values as well.

astro-ph;0008139	testing the hypothesis of the morphological transformation from field  spiral to cluster s0	hubble space telescope observations of distant clusters have suggested asteep increase in the proportion of s0 galaxies between clusters at highredshifts and similar systems the present-day. it has been proposed that thisincrease results from the transformation of the morphologies of accreted fieldgalaxies from spirals to s0s. we have simulated the evolution of themorphological mix in clusters based on a simple phenomenological model wherethe clusters accrete a mix of galaxies from the surrounding field, the spiralgalaxies are transformed to s0s (through an unspecified process) and are addedto the existing cluster population. we find that in order to reproduce theapparently rapid increase in the ratio of s0 galaxies to ellipticals in theclusters, our model requires that: (1) galaxy accretion rate has to be high(typically, more than half of the present-day cluster population must have beenaccreted since z~0.5), and (2) most of the accreted spirals, with morphologicaltypes as late as scdm, must have transformed to s0's. although the latterrequirement may be difficult to meet, it is possible that such bulge-weakspirals have already been `pre-processed' into the bulge-strong galaxies priorto entering the cluster core and are eventually transformed into s0's in thecluster environment. on the basis of the evolution of the general morphologicalmix in clusters our model suggests that the process responsible for themorphological transformation takes a relatively long time (1-3gyr) after thegalaxy has entered the cluster environment.

astro-ph;0308130	the ks-band luminosity and stellar mass functions of galaxies in z~1  clusters	we present the near-infrared (ks-band) luminosity function of galaxies in twoz~1 cluster candidates, 3c336 and q1335+28. a third cluster, 3c289, wasobserved but found to be contaminated by a foreground system. our wide fieldimaging data reach to ks=20.5 (5sigma), corresponding to ~m*+2.7 with respectto the passive evolution. the near-infrared luminosity traces the stellar massof a galaxy due to its small sensitivity to the recent star formation history.thus the luminosity function can be transformed to the stellar mass function ofgalaxies using the $j-k$ colours with only a small correction (factor&lt;2) forthe effects of on-going star formation. the derived stellar mass function spansa wide range in mass from ~3 x 10^{11}msun down to ~6 x 10^{9}msun (set by themagnitude limit). the form of the mass function is very similar to lowerredshift counterparts such as that from 2mass/lcrs clusters (balogh et al.2001) and the z=0.31 clusters (barger et al. 1998). this indicates littleevolution of galaxy masses from z=1 to the present-day. combined with colourdata that suggest star formation is completed early (z&gt;&gt;1) in the cluster core,it seems that the galaxy formation processes (both star formation and massassembly) are strongly accerelated in dense environments and has been largelycompleted by z=1. we investigate whether the epoch of mass assembly of massivecluster galaxies is earlier than that predicted by the hierarchical galaxyformation models. these models predict the increase of characteristic mass bymore than factor ~3 between z=1 and the present day. this seems incompatiblewith our data.

astro-ph;0312321	galaxy evolution in three dimensions : time, space and mass	there are three major axes to describe the evolution of galaxies, namely,time (redshift), space (environment) and mass (stellar mass). in this article,one topic each will be presented along these axes. (1) based on the subaruwide-field (30') optical imaging of two distant clusters (z=0.55 and 0.83), weshow the large scale structures in galaxy distributions on a scale greater than10mpc, which serve as an evidence for hierarchical growth of rich clusters ofgalaxies through assembly of surrounding groups. (2) based on the deep nirimaging of high-z clusters at z~1 and 1.5, we show massive galaxies in clustershave assembled most of their mass by z=1.5, which is earlier than thehierarchical model predictions. (3) based on the subaru deep and wide opticalimaging of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field, we show a deficit of red andfaint galaxies and a lack of blue massive galaxies in the high density regionsat z~1, which suggest down-sizing in galaxy formation as apparently opposed tothe cdm-based bottom-up scenario.

astro-ph;0402276	down-sizing in galaxy formation at z~1 in the subaru/xmm-newton deep  survey (sxds)	we use the deep wide-field optical imaging data of the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey (sxds) to discuss the luminosity (mass) dependent galaxy colours down toz'=25.0 (5 x 10^9 h_{70}^{-2} msun) for z~1 galaxies in colour-selected highdensity regions. we find an apparent absence of galaxies on the redcolour-magnitude sequence below z'~24.2, corresponding to ~m*+2 (~10^{10} msun)with respect to passively evolving galaxies at z~1. galaxies brighter thanm*-0.5 (8 x 10^{10} msun), however, are predominantly red passively evolvingsystems, with few blue star forming galaxies at these magnitudes.  this apparent age gradient, where massive galaxies are dominated by oldstellar populations while less massive galaxies have more extended starformation histories, supports the `down-sizing' idea where the mass of galaxieshosting star formation decreases as the universe ages. combined with the lackof evolution in the shape of the stellar mass function for massive galaxiessince at least z~1, it appears that galaxy formation processes (both starformation and mass assembly) should have occurred in an accelerated way inmassive systems in high density regions, while these processes should have beenslower in smaller systems. this result provides an interesting challenge formodern cdm-based galaxy formation theories which predict later formation epochsof massive systems, commonly referred to as ``bottom-up''.

(2) investigating theenvironmental variation of galaxy properties along the structures to study theorigin of the morphology-density and star formation-density relations. someinitial results are presented. on galactic scale, we first present the stellarmass growth of cluster galaxies out to z~1.5 based on the near-infrared imagingof distant clusters and show that the mass assembly process of galaxies islargely completed by z~1.5 and is faster than the current semi-analytic models'predictions. we then focus on the faint end of the luminosity function at z~1based on the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey imaging data. we show the deficit ofred galaxies below m*+2 or 10^{10} msun, which suggest less massive galaxiesare either genuinely young or still vigorously forming stars in sharp contrastto the massive galaxies where mass is assembled and star formation isterminated long time ago.

astro-ph;0506713	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation as a function of  environment	we discuss the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution based on deeppanoramic imaging of two distant clusters taken with suprime-cam as part of thepisces project. by combining with the sdss data as a local counterpart forcomparison, we construct a large sample of galaxies that spans wide ranges inenvironment, time, and stellar mass (or luminosity). we find that colours ofgalaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($m_v&gt;m_v^*+1$), change from blueto red at a break density as we go to denser regions. based on local and globaldensities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, andclusters. we show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already builtat $z=0.83$. in contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnituderelation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and thebuild-up at the faint-end has not started yet. a possible interpretation ofthese results is that galaxies evolve in the 'down-sizing' fashion. that is,massive galaxies complete their star formation first and the truncation of starformation is propagated to smaller objects as time progresses. this trend islikely to depend on environment since the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation is delayed in lower-density environments. therefore, we may suggestthat the evolution of galaxies took place earliest in massive galaxies and inhigh density regions, and it is delayed in less massive galaxies and in lowerdensity regions.

astro-ph;0703135	a deficit of faint red galaxies in the possible large-scale structures  around the rdcs j1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24	(abridged) we report a discovery of possible large-scale structures aroundthe rdcs j1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 based on photometric redshifts. wecarried out multi-band wide-field imaging with suprime-cam on the subarutelescope and wfcam on the united kingdom infra-red telescope (ukirt). thedistribution of photo-z selected galaxies reveals clumpy structures surroundingthe central cluster. we compare the observed structure with an x-ray map andfind that two of the four plausible clumps show significant x-ray emissions andone with a marginal detection, which strongly suggest that they are dynamicallybound systems. following the discovery of the possible large-scale structure,we carried out deeper sofi k_s-band imaging with new technology telescope onthe four plausible clumps. we construct the optical-to-near-infraredcolour-magnitude diagrams of the galaxies in the clumps, and find that thecolour-magnitude relation (cmr) of the red galaxies in the clumps is sharplytruncated below k_s=22. interestingly, the main cluster shows a clear relationdown to k_s=23 (lidman et al. 2004). we suggest that galaxies follow the'environment-dependent down-sizing' evolution. massive galaxies in high densityenvironments first stop forming stars and become red. less massive galaxies inless dense environments become red at later times. based on a few assumptions,we predict that the brightest tip of the cmr appears at z~2.5.

0809.2795	mapping dusty star formation in and around a cluster at z=0.81 by  wide-field imaging with akari	we present environmental dependence of dusty star forming activity in andaround the cluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81 based on wide-field andmulti-wavelength observations with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope and irconboard the akari satellite. our optical data shows that the optical colourdistribution of galaxies starts to dramatically change from blue to red at themedium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and filaments. bycombining with infrared data, we find that 15 micron galaxies tend to haveoptical colours between the red sequence and the blue cloud with a tail intothe red sequence.  the spatial distribution of the 15 micron galaxies over ~200 arcmin^2 aroundthe cluster reveals that few 15 micron galaxies are detected in the clustercentral region. this is probably due to the low star forming activity in thecluster core. however, interestingly, the fraction of 15 micron galaxies in themedium-density environments is as high as in the low-density field, despite thefact that the optical colours start to change in the medium-densityenvironments. furthermore, we find that 15 micron galaxies which have opticallyred colours (candidates for dusty red galaxies) and galaxies with high specificstar formation rates are also concentrated in the medium-density environment.these results imply that the star forming activity in galaxies in groups andfilaments is enhanced due to some environmental effects specific to themedium-density environment, and such a phenomenon is probably directlyconnected to the truncation of star forming activity in galaxies seen as thedramatic change in optical colours in such environments.

astro-ph;9805290	the colour-magnitude relation as a constraint on the formation of rich  cluster galaxies	in this paper, we examine the role that the colour-magnitude relation (cmr)can play in constraining the formation history of rich cluster galaxies.  firstly, we consider the colour evolution of galaxies after star formationceases. we show that the scatter of the cmr places a strong constraint on thespread in age of the bulk of the stellar population. however, although the bulkof stars must be formed in a short period, continuing formation of stars in afraction of the galaxies is not so strongly constrained.  we examine a model in which star formation occurs over an extended period oftime in most galaxies. an extension of this type of star formation historyallows us to reconcile the small present-day scatter of the cmr with theobserved blue galaxy fractions of intermediate redshift galaxy clusters.  secondly, the cmr can also be used to constrain the degree of merging betweenpre-existing stellar systems. this test relies on the slope of the cmr. we showthat random mergers between galaxies very rapidly remove any well-defined cmr.however, we prefer to examine the merger process using a self-consistent mergertree. in such a model there are two effects: massive galaxies preferentiallymerge with systems of similar mass; and the rate of mass growth is considerablysmaller than for the random merger case. as a result of both of these effects,the cmr persists through a larger number of merger steps. the passive evolutionof galaxy colours and their averaging in dissipationless mergers provideopposing constraints on the formation of cluster galaxies in a hierarchicalmodel; but at the level of current constraints, a compromise solution appearspossible.

astro-ph;9806029	secondary episode of star formation in elliptical galaxies	we put upper limits of secondary burst of star formation in ellipticalgalaxies of the gonzalez's (1993) sample, most of which locates in smallgroups, based on the colour dispersion around the u-v versus central velocitydispersion relation, and the equivalent width of hbeta absorption. there aresignificant number of hbeta strong galaxies which have ew(hbeta)&gt;2a, howeverthey do not always have bluer colours in u-v. to be consistent with smallcolour dispersion of u-v, the mass fraction of secondary burst to the totalmass should be less than only 10% at the maximum within recent 2gyr. thisresult suggests that even if recent galaxy merging produce some ellipticals, itshould not have been accompanied by an intensive star burst, and hence it couldnot involve large gas-rich systems. a capture of dwarf galaxy is more likely toexplain dynamical disturbances observed in some elliptical galaxies.  the above analysis based on the u-v is not compatible with the one based onthe line indices, which requires that more than 10% of mass is present in a2gyr old star burst to cover the full range of the observed hbeta (de jong &amp;davies 1997). the discrepancy might be partly explained by the internalextinction localized at the region where young stars form. however, consideringthat the hbeta index might have great uncertainties both in models and inobservational data, we basically rely on u-v analysis.

astro-ph;9806120	a bayesian classifier for photometric redshifts: identification of high  redshift clusters	photometric redshift classifiers provide a means of estimating galaxyredshifts from observations using a small number of broad-band filters.however, the accuracy with which redshifts can be determined is sensitive tothe star formation history of the galaxy, for example the effects of age,metallicity and on-going star formation. we present a photometric classifierthat explicitly takes into account the degeneracies implied by thesevariations, based on the flexible stellar population synthesis code of kodama &amp;arimoto. the situation is encouraging since many of the variations in stellarpopulations introduce colour changes that are degenerate. we use a bayesianinversion scheme to estimate the likely range of redshifts compatible with theobserved colours. when applied to existing multi-band photometry for abell 370,most of the cluster members are correctly recovered with little fieldcontamination. the inverter is focussed on the recovery of a wide variety ofgalaxy populations in distant (z~1) clusters from broad band colours coveringthe 4000 angstrom break. it is found that this can be achieved with impressiveaccuracy ($|\delta z| &lt; 0.1$), allowing detailed investigation into theevolution of cluster galaxies with little selection bias.

astro-ph;9808325	the formation history of early-type galaxies: an observational  perspective	this talk investigates the formation of early-type galaxies from adeliberately observational view point. i begin by reviewing the conclusionsthat can be reached by comparing the detailed properties of galaxies inpresent-day clusters, focusing on the colour-magnitude relation in particular.the overriding picture is one of homogeneity, implying a remarkable uniformityin the formation of these galaxies. this picture contrasts with the increasingactivity seen in clusters as a function of redshift, creating an apparentparadox been the obvious diversity of star formation histories in distantcluster galaxies and their uniformity in local systems. a resolution isfeasible so long as star formation occurs over an extended epoch.  in addition to placing limits on variations in star formation history theexistence of a tight `fundamental relations', such as the colour-magnituderelation, can be used to investigate galaxy mergers and to set limits on thedegree to which present-day clusters galaxies are built by combining systems ofstars formed in smaller units. the final part of this talk turns to early-typegalaxies in the field, and tries to apply the same techniques that have beensuccessful in clusters. this is an emerging field in which appropriatedata-sets are only just becoming available; however, comparison of theformation histories of galaxies in a wide variety of environments is key todistinguishing between the classical and hierarchical models for galaxyformation.

astro-ph;9907437	a rich cluster of galaxies near the quasar b2 1335+28 at z=1.1: color  distribution and star-formation properties	we previously reported a significant clustering of red galaxies (r-k=3.5--6)around the radio-loud quasar b2 1335+28 at z=1.086. in this paper, we establishthe existence of a rich cluster at the quasar redshift, and study theproperties of the cluster galaxies through further detailed analysis of thephotometric data. the color distribution of the galaxies in the cluster isquite broad and the fraction of blue galaxies (\sim 70%) is much larger than inintermediate-redshift clusters. using evolutionary synthesis models, we showthat this color distribution can be explained by galaxies with various amountsof star-formation activity mixed with the old stellar populations. notably,there are about a dozen galaxies which show very red optical-nir colors butalso show significant uv excess with respect to passive-evolution models. theycan be interpreted as old early-type galaxies with a small amount of starformation. the fact that the uv-excess red galaxies are more abundant than thequiescent red ones suggests that a large fraction of old galaxies in thiscluster are still forming stars to some extent. however, a sequence ofquiescent red galaxies is clearly identified on the r-k versus kcolor-magnitude (c-m) diagram. the slope and zero point of their c-m relationappear to be consistent with those expected for the precursors of the c-mrelation of present-day cluster ellipticals when observed at z=1.1. we estimatethe abell richness class of the cluster to be r \sim 1. new x-ray datapresented here place an upper limit of l_x &lt; 2 10^{44} erg s^{-1} for thecluster luminosity. inspections of the wider optical images reveal some lumpystructure, suggesting that the whole system is still dynamically young.

0706.0783	a huge filamentary structure at z=0.55 and star formation histories of  galaxies at z&lt;1	we report a definitive confirmation of a large-scale structure around thesuper rich cluster cl0016+1609 at z=0.55. we made spectroscopic follow-upobservations with focas on subaru along the large filamentary structureidentified in our previous photometric studies. we have confirmed the physicalconnection of the huge filament extending over 20 mpc in the n-s direction, andanother filament extending from the main cluster to the east. based on a simpleenergy argument, we show that it is likely that most of the clumps are bound tothe main cl0016 cluster. this structure is surely one of the most prominentconfirmed structures ever identified in the distant universe, which then servesas an ideal laboratory to examine the environmental variation of galaxyproperties. we draw star formation histories of galaxies from the compositespectra of red galaxies in field, group, and cluster environments. combiningthe results from our previous studies, we find that red galaxies in groups atz~0.8 and red field galaxies at z~0.5 show strong hd absorption lines for theird4000 indices. these are the environments in which we observed the on-goingbuild-up of the colour-magnitude relation in our previous photometric analyses.the strong hd absorption lines imply that their star formation is truncated ona relatively short time scale. we suggest that a galaxy-galaxy interaction isthe most likely physical driver of the truncation of star formation and thusresponsible for the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation since z~1.(abridged)
