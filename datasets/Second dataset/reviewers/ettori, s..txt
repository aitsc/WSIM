0706.2971	entropy profiles in x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z&gt;0.1	[abridged] the entropy distribution of the intracluster gas reflects bothaccretion history of the gas and processes of feedback which provide a furthernon-gravitational energy besides the potential one. in this work, we study theprofiles and the scaling properties of the gas entropy in 24 hot (kt_{gas} &gt; 6kev) galaxy clusters observed with chandra in the redshift range 0.14-0.82 andshowing different states of relaxation. we recover the gas density, temperatureand entropy profiles in a non-parametric way. adding the hydrostaticequilibrium hypothesis, radial profiles are also obtained from the deprojectionof the surface brightness, allowing to verify whether the hydrostaticequilibrium is a tenable hypothesis by comparison with the spectralmeasurements. we confirm that this is the case on scales larger than 100 kpcand discuss the deviations observed in few non-cooling core clusters in theinner regions. we show that the entropy profiles are remarkably similar outsidethe core and can be described by simple power-laws with slope of 1.0-1.2. wemeasure an entropy level at 0.1 r_{200} of 100-500 kev cm^2 and a centralplateau which spans a wide range of value (~ a few-200 kev cm^2) depending onthe state of relaxation of the source. to characterize the energetic of thecentral regions, we compare the radial behaviour of the temperature of the gaswith the temperature of the dark matter t_{dm} by estimating the excess ofenergy delta e = 3/2 k(t_{gas}- t_{dm}). we point out that delta e ranges from~ 0 in typical cooling-core clusters to few kev within 100 kpc in non-coolingcore systems. we also measure a significant correlation between the total ironmass and the entropy outside the cooling region,whereas in the inner regionsthey anti-correlate strongly.

0904.2740	the cluster gas mass fraction as a cosmological probe: a revised study	(abriged) we present the analysis of the baryonic content of 52 x-rayluminous galaxy clusters observed with chandra in the redshift range 0.3-1.273.we use the deprojected x-ray surface brightness profiles and the measuredvalues of the gas temperature to recover the gas and total mass profiles. byassuming that galaxy clusters are representative of the cosmic baryon budget,the distribution of the cluster baryon fraction in the hottest (t&gt; 4 kev)systems as a function of redshift is used to constrain the cosmologicalparameters. we discuss how our constraints are affected by several systematics,namely the isothermality, the assumed baryon fraction in stars, the depletionparameter and the sample selection. by using only the cluster baryon fractionas a proxy for the cosmological parameters, we obtain that omega is very wellconstrained at the value of 0.35 with a relative statistical uncertainty of 11%(1 sigma level; w=-1) and a further systematic error of about (-6,+7)%. on theother hand, constraints on lambda (without the prior of flat geometry) and w(using the prior of flat geometry) are definitely weaker due to the presence oflarger statistical and systematic uncertainties (of the order of 40 per cent onlambda and larger than 50 per cent on w). if the wmap 5-year best-fit resultsare assumed to fix the cosmological parameters, we limit the contributionsexpected from non-thermal pressure support and icm clumpiness to be lower thanabout 10 per cent, leaving also room to accommodate baryons not accounted foreither in the x-ray emitting plasma or in stars of the order of 18 per cent ofthe total cluster baryon budget.

0707.2614	x-mas2: study systematics on the icm metallicity measurements	(abridged)the x-ray measurements of the icm metallicity are becoming morefrequent due to the availability of powerful x-ray telescope with excellentspatial and spectral resolutions. the information which can be extracted fromthe measurements of the alpha-elements, like oxygen, magnesium and silicon withrespect to the iron abundance is extremely important to better understand thestellar formation and its evolutionary history. in this paper we investigatepossible source of bias connected to the plasma physics when recovering metalabundances from x-ray spectra. to do this we analyze 6 simulated galaxyclusters processed through the new version of our x-ray map simulator, whichallows to create mock xmm-newton epic mos1 and mos2 observations. by comparingthe spectroscopic results to the input values we find that: i) fe is recoveredwith high accuracy for both hot (t&gt;3 kev) and cold (t&lt;2 kev) systems; atintermediate temperatures, however, we find a systematic overestimate whichdepends on the number counts; ii) o is well recovered in cold clusters, whilein hot systems its measure may overestimate by a factor up to 2-3; iii) being aweak line, the measurement of mg is always difficult; despite of this, for coldsystems (t&lt;2 kev) we do not find any systematic behavior, while for very hotsystems (t&gt;5 kev) the spectroscopic measurement may be strongly overestimatedup to a factor of 4; iv) si is well recovered for all the clusters in oursample. we investigate in detail the nature of the systematic effects andbiases found. we conclude that they are mainly connected with themulti-temperature nature of the projected observed spectra and to the intrinsiclimitation of the xmm-newton epic spectral resolution that does not alwaysallow to disentangle among the emission lines produced by different elements.

0912.1343	weighing simulated galaxy clusters using lensing and x-ray	we aim at investigating potential biases in lensing and x-ray methods tomeasure the cluster mass profiles. we do so by performing realistic simulationsof lensing and x-ray observations that are subsequently analyzed usingobservational techniques. the resulting mass estimates are compared among themand with the input models. three clusters obtained from state-of-the-arthydrodynamical simulations, each of which has been projected along threeindependent lines-of-sight, are used for this analysis. we find that stronglensing models can be trusted over a limited region around the cluster core.extrapolating the strong lensing mass models to outside the einstein ring canlead to significant biases in the mass estimates, if the bcg is not modeledproperly for example. weak lensing mass measurements can be largely affected bysubstructures, depending on the method implemented to convert the shear into amass estimate. using non-parametric methods which combine weak and stronglensing data, the projected masses within r200 can be constrained with aprecision of ~10%. de-projection of lensing masses increases the scatter aroundthe true masses by more than a factor of two due to cluster triaxiality. x-raymass measurements have much smaller scatter (about a factor of two smaller thanthe lensing masses) but they are generally biased low by 5-20%. this bias isascribable to bulk motions in the gas of our simulated clusters. using thelensing and the x-ray masses as proxies for the true and the hydrostaticequilibrium masses of the simulated clusters and averaging over the clustersample we are able to measure the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium in thesystems we have investigated.

1002.1625	abell 611. ii. x-ray and strong lensing analyses	we present the results of our analyses of the x-ray emission and of thestrong lensing systems in the relaxed galaxy cluster abell 611 (z=0.288). weinfer the x-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profiles ofthe intra-cluster medium within the radius r ~ 700 kpc through a non-parametricapproach; assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adoptinga matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of abell611 via the x-ray data. we derive the total projected mass in the centralregion of abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensingfeatures through the publicly available analysis software lenstool. as a finalstep we compare the results obtained with both methods. we derive a goodagreement between the x-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in thecentral region (i.e. within the radius r ~100 kpc), while a marginaldisagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating thestrong lensing results in the outer spatial range. we suggest that in this casethe x-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrectestimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of thedark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different masscomponents in the strong lensing analysis. we discuss the effect of somepossible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates. we find a slightdependence of the measurements of the x-ray temperatures (and therefore of thex-ray total masses) on the background adopted in the spectral analysis, withtotal deviations on the value of m_200 of the order of the 1-sigma statisticalerror. the strong lensing mass results are instead sensitive to theparameterisation of the galactic halo mass in the central regions, inparticular to the modelling of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) baryoniccomponent.

1006.3255	apparent high metallicity in 3-4 kev galaxy clusters: the inverse  iron-bias in action in the case of the merging cluster abell 2028	recent work based on a global measurement of the icm properties find evidencefor an increase of the iron abundance in galaxy clusters with temperaturearound 2-4 kev up to a value about 3 times larger than that typical of very hotclusters. we have started a study of the metal distribution in these objectsfrom the sample of baumgartner et al. (2005), aiming at resolving spatially themetal content of the icm. we report here on a 42ks xmm observation of the firstobject of the sample, the cluster abell 2028. the xmm observation reveals acomplex structure of the cluster over scale of 300 kpc, showing an interactionbetween two sub-clusters in cometary-like configurations. at the leading edgesof the two substructures cold fronts have been detected. the core of the mainsubcluster is likely hosting a cool corona. we show that a one-component fitfor this region returns a biased high metallicity. this inverse iron bias isdue to the behavior of the fitting code in shaping the fe-l complex. inpresence of a multi-temperature structure of the icm, the best-fit metallicityis artificially higher when the projected spectrum is modeled with a singletemperature component and it is not related to the presence of both fe-l andfe-k emission lines in the spectrum. after accounting for the bias, the overallabundance of the cluster is consistent with the one typical of hotter, moremassive clusters. we caution the interpretation of high abundances inferredwhen fitting a single thermal component to spectra derived from relativelylarge apertures in 3-4 kev clusters, because the inverse iron bias can bepresent. most of the inferences trying to relate high abundances in 3-4 kevclusters to fundamental physical processes will likely have to be revised.

1105.4099	on a novel approach using massive clusters at high redshifts as  cosmological probe	in this work we propose a novel method for testing the validity of thefiducial lcdm cosmology by measuring the cumulative distribution function ofthe most massive haloes in a sample of subvolumes of identical size tiled onthe sky at a fixed redshift. the fact that the most massive clusters probe thehigh-mass tail of the mass function, where the difference between lcdm andalternative cosmological models is strongest, makes our method particularlyinteresting as a cosmological probe. we utilise general extreme valuestatistics (gev) to obtain a cumulative distribution function of the mostmassive objects in a given volume. we sample this distribution functionaccording to the number of patches covered by the survey area for a range ofdifferent "test cosmologies" and for differently accurate mass estimations ofthe haloes. by fitting this sample with the gev distribution function, we canstudy which parameters are the most sensitive with respect to the testcosmologies. we find that the peak of the probability distribution function ofthe most massive halo is well suited to test the validity of the fiducial lcdmmodel, once we are able to establish a sufficiently complete large-area surveywith m_lim=10^14.5 m_sun/h (m_lim=10^14 m_sun/h) at redshifts above z=1(z=1.5). being of cumulative nature the proposed measure is robust and anaccuracy of 20-30% in the cluster masses would be sufficient to test foralternative models. since one only needs the most massive system in eachangular patch, this method would be ideally suited as a first fast consistencycheck before going into a more complex statistical analysis of the observedhalo sample.

1111.1693	pointing to the minimum scatter: the generalized scaling relations for  galaxy clusters	we introduce a generalized scaling law, m_tot = 10^k a^a b^b, to look for theminimum scatter in reconstructing the total mass of hydrodynamically simulatedx-ray galaxy clusters, given gas mass m_gas, luminosity l and temperature t. wefind a locus in the plane of the logarithmic slopes $a$ and $b$ of the scalingrelations where the scatter in mass is minimized. this locus corresponds to b_m= -3/2 a_m +3/2 and b_l = -2 a_l +3/2 for a=m_gas and l, respectively, and b=t.along these axes, all the known scaling relations can be identified (atdifferent levels of scatter), plus a new one defined as m_tot ~ (lt)^(1/2).simple formula to evaluate the expected evolution with redshift in theself-similar scenario are provided. in this scenario, no evolution of thescaling relations is predicted for the cases (b_m=0, a_m=1) and (b_l=7/2,a_l=-1), respectively. once the single quantities are normalized to the averagevalues of the sample under considerations, the normalizations k correspondingto the region with minimum scatter are very close to zero. the combination ofthese relations allows to reduce the number of free parameters of the fittingfunction that relates x-ray observables to the total mass and includes theself-similar redshift evolution.

1211.1695	properties of gas clumps and gas clumping factor in the intra cluster  medium	the spatial distribution of gas matter inside galaxy clusters is notcompletely smooth, but may host gas clumps associated with substructures. theseoverdense gas substructures are generally a source of unresolved bias of x-rayobservations towards high density gas, but their bright luminosity peaks may beresolved sources within the icm, that deep x-ray exposures may be (already)capable to detect. in this paper we aim at investigating both features, using aset of high-resolution cosmological simulations with enzo. first, we monitorhow the bias by unresolved gas clumping may yield incorrect estimates of globalcluster parameters and affects the measurements of baryon fractions by x-rayobservations. we find that based on x-ray observations of narrow radial strips,it is difficult to recover the real baryon fraction to better than 10 - 20percent uncertainty. second, we investigated the possibility of observingbright x-ray clumps in the nearby universe (z&lt;=0.3). we produced simple mockx-ray observations for several instruments (xmm, suzaku and rosat) andextracted the statistics of potentially detectable bright clumps. some of thebrightest clumps predicted by simulations may already have been alreadydetected in x- ray images with a large field of view. however, their smallprojected size makes it difficult to prove their existence based on x-raymorphology only. preheating, agn feedback and cosmic rays are found to havelittle impact on the statistical properties of gas clumps.

1303.6506	large-scale inhomogeneities of the intracluster medium: improving mass  estimates using the observed azimuthal scatter	using a set of hydrodynamical simulations of 62 galaxy clusters and groups westudy the icm of inhomogeneities, focusing on the ones on the large scale that,unlike clumps, are the most difficult to identify. to this purpose we introducethe concept of residual clumpiness, c_r, that quantifies the large-scaleinhomogeneity of the icm. after showing that this quantity can be robustlydefined for relaxed systems, we characterize how it varies with radius, massand dynamical state of the halo. most importantly, we observe that itintroduces an overestimate in the determination of the density profile from thex-ray emission, which translates into a systematic overestimate of 6 (12)% inthe measurement of m_gas at r_200 for our relaxed (perturbed) cluster sample.at the same time, the increase of c_r with radius introduces also a ~2%systematic underestimate in the measurement of the hydrostatic-equilibrium mass(m_he), which adds to the previous one generating a systematic ~8.5%overestimate in f_gas in our relaxed sample. since the residual clumpiness ofthe icm is not directly observable, we study its correlation with the azimuthalscatter in the x-ray surface brightness of the halo and in the y-parameterprofiles. we find that their correlation is highly significant (r_s = 0.6-0.7),allowing to define the azimuthal scatter measured in the x-ray surfacebrightness profile and in the y-parameter as robust proxies of c_r. afterproviding a function that connects the two quantities, we obtain thatcorrecting the observed gas density profiles using the azimuthal scattereliminates the bias in the measurement of m_gas for relaxed objects, whichbecomes (0+/-2)% up to 2r_200, and reduces it by a factor of 3 for perturbedones. this method allows also to eliminate the systematics on the measurementsof m_he and f_gas, although a significant halo to halo scatter remains.(abridged)

1306.2319	the hot and energetic universe: the evolution of galaxy groups and  clusters	major astrophysical questions related to the formation and evolution ofstructures, and more specifically of galaxy groups and clusters, will still beopen in the coming decade and beyond: what is the interplay of galaxy,supermassive black hole, and intergalactic gas evolution in the most massiveobjects in the universe - galaxy groups and clusters? what are the processesdriving the evolution of chemical enrichment of the hot diffuse gas inlarge-scale structures? how and when did the first galaxy groups in theuniverse, massive enough to bind more than 10^7 k gas, form? focussing on theperiod when groups and clusters assembled (0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5), we show that, due to thecontinuum and line emission of this hot intergalactic gas at x-ray wavelengths,athena+, combining high sensitivity with excellent spectral and spatialresolution, will deliver breakthrough observations in view of theaforementioned issues. indeed, the physical and chemical properties of the hotintra-cluster gas, and their evolution across time, are a key to understand theco-evolution of galaxy and supermassive black hole within their environments.

1306.2322	the hot and energetic universe: the astrophysics of galaxy groups and  clusters	as the nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies trace the large-scaledistribution of matter in the universe. they are thus privileged sites in whichto investigate the complex physics of structure formation. however, thecomplete story of how these structures grow, and how they dissipate thegravitational and non-thermal components of their energy budget over cosmictime, is still beyond our grasp. fundamental questions such as how do hotdiffuse baryons accrete and dynamically evolve in dark matter potentials? howand when was the energy that we observe in the icm generated and distributed?where and when are heavy elements produced and how are they circulated? arestill unanswered. most of the cluster baryons exists in the form of a diffuse,hot, metal-enriched plasma that radiates primarily in the x-ray band (theintracluster medium, icm), allowing the x-ray observations of the evolvingcluster population to provide a unique opportunity to address these topics.athena+ with its large collecting area and unprecedented combination of highspectral and angular resolution offers the only way to make major advances inanswering these questions. athena+ will show how the baryonic gas evolves inthe dark matter potential wells by studying the motions and turbulence in theicm. athena+ will be able to resolve the accreting region both spatially andspectroscopically, probing the true nature and physical state of the x-rayemitting plasma. athena+ has the capabilities to permit a definitiveunderstanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structurethrough the study of the cluster population.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

1306.4379	revisiting scaling relations for giant radio halos in galaxy clusters	many galaxy clusters host megaparsec-scale radio halos, generated byultrarelativistic electrons in the magnetized intracluster medium. correlationsbetween the power of radio halos and the thermal properties of the hostingclusters were established in the last decade, including the connection betweenthe presence of a halo and cluster mergers. the x-ray luminosity and redshiftlimited extended gmrt radio halo survey provides a rich and unique dataset forstatistical studies of the halos. we uniformly analyze the radio and x-ray datafor the gmrt cluster sample, and use the new planck sz catalog, to revisit thecorrelations between the power of halos and the thermal properties of galaxyclusters. we find that the radio power of halos at 1.4 ghz scales with thecluster x-ray (0.1--2.4 kev) luminosity computed within r_500 as p_1.4l_500^2.0. our bigger and more homogenous sample confirms that the x-rayluminous (l_500 &gt; 5x10^44 erg/s) clusters branch into two populations --- radiohalos lie on the correlation, while clusters with upper limits to radio-haloemission are well below that correlation. this bimodality remains if we excisecool cores from the x-ray luminosities. correlating with planck data, we findthat p_1.4 scales with the cluster integrated sz signal within r_500 as p_1.4y_500^2.1, in line with previous findings. however, contrary to previousstudies that were limited by incompleteness and small sample size, we find thatthe "sz-luminous" y_500 &gt; 6x10^-5 mpc^2 clusters show a bimodal behaviorsimilar to that in the radio-x-ray diagram. bimodality of both correlations canbe traced to clusters dynamics, with radio halos found exclusively in mergingclusters. these results confirm the key role of mergers for the origin of giantradio halos, suggesting that they trigger the relativistic particleacceleration.

1310.8389	gas clumping in galaxy clusters	the reconstruction of galaxy cluster's gas density profiles is usuallyperformed by assuming spherical symmetry and averaging the observed x-rayemission in circular annuli. in the case of a very inhomogeneous and asymmetricgas distribution, this method has been shown to return biased results innumerical simulations because of the $n^2$ dependence of the x-ray emissivity.we propose a method to recover the true density profiles in the presence ofinhomogeneities, based on the derivation of the azimuthal median of the surfacebrightness in concentric annuli. we demonstrate the performance of this methodwith numerical simulations, and apply it to a sample of 31 galaxy clusters inthe redshift range 0.04-0.2 observed with rosat/pspc. the clumping factorsrecovered by comparing the mean and the median are mild and show a slight trendof increasing bias with radius. for $r&lt;r_{500}$, we measure a clumping factor$\sqrt{c}&lt;1.1$, which indicates that the thermodynamic properties andhydrostatic masses measured in this radial range are only mildly affected bythis effect. comparing our results with three sets of hydrodynamical numericalsimulations, we found that non-radiative simulations significantly overestimatethe level of inhomogeneities in the icm, while the runs including cooling, starformation, and agn feedback reproduce the observed trends closely. our resultsindicate that most of the accretion of x-ray emitting gas is taking place inthe diffuse, large-scale accretion patterns rather than in compact structures.

1401.5067	can agn feedback break the self-similarity of galaxies, groups, and  clusters?	it is commonly thought that agn feedback can break the self-similar scalingrelations of galaxies, groups, and clusters. using high-resolution 3dhydrodynamic simulations, we isolate the impact of agn feedback on the $l_{\rmx}-t_{\rm x} $ relation, testing the two archetypal and common regimes,self-regulated mechanical feedback and a quasar thermal blast. we find that agnfeedback has severe difficulty in breaking the relation in a consistent way.the similarity breaking is directly linked to the gas evacuation within$r_{500}$, while the central cooling times are inversely proportional to thecore density. breaking self-similarity implies thus breaking the cool core,morphing all systems to non-cool-core objects, which is in clear contradictionwith the observed data populated by several cool-core systems. self-regulatedfeedback, which quenches cooling flows and preserves cool cores, prevents thedramatic evacuation and similarity breaking at any scale; the relation scatteris also limited. the impulsive thermal blast can break the core-included$l_{\rm x}-t_{\rm x}$ at $t_{500} &lt; 1$ kev, but substantially empties andoverheats the halo, generating a perennial non-cool-core group, as experiencedby cosmological simulations. even with partial evacuation, massive systemsremain overheated. we show the action of purely agn feedback is to lower theluminosity and heating the gas, perpendicular to the fit.

1403.4979	intra cluster light properties in the clash-vlt cluster macs  j1206.2-0847	we aim at constraining the assembly history of clusters by studying the intracluster light (icl) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction ofbaryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias usingdifferent icl detection techniques. we developed an automated method, galtoicl,based on the software galapagos to obtain a refined version of typical bcg+iclmaps. we applied this method to our test case macs j1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the clash sample. using deepmulti-band subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (sb) profile ofthe bcg+icl and we studied the icl morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to r500. we repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theicl, sblimit method, i.e. a sb cut-off level, to compare the results. the mostpeculiar feature of the icl in macs1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the se direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a post starburst galaxy. this suggests an interactionbetween the bcg and this galaxy that dates back to t &lt;= 1.5 gyr. the bcg+iclstellar content is 8% of m_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. thesblimit method provides systematically higher icl fractions and this effect islarger at lower sb limits. this is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the icl. though more time consuming, thegaltoicl method provides safer icl detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. this is one of the few icl study at redshift z &gt; 0.3. atcompletion, the clash/vlt program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

1408.1394	the stripping of a galaxy group diving into the massive cluster a2142	structure formation in the current universe operates through the accretion ofgroup-scale systems onto massive clusters. the detection and study of suchaccreting systems is crucial to understand the build-up of the most massivevirialized structures we see today. we report the discovery with xmm-newton ofan irregular x-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy clusterabell 2142. the tip of the x-ray emission coincides with a concentration ofgalaxies. the bulk of the x-ray emission of this substructure appears to belagging behind the galaxies and extends over a projected scale of at least 800kpc. the temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 kev, which is a factor of~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma ofa galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13m_sun. for this reason, we interpretthis structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the maindark-matter halo. the x-ray structure trailing behind the group is due to gasstripped from its original dark-matter halo as it moves through theintracluster medium (icm). this is the longest x-ray trail reported to date.for an infall velocity of ~1,200 km s-1 we estimate that the stripped gas hasbeen surviving in the presence of the hot icm for at least 600 myr, whichexceeds the spitzer conduction timescale in the medium by a factor of &gt;~400.such a strong suppression of conductivity is likely related to a tangledmagnetic field with small coherence length and to plasma microinstabilities.the long survival time of the low-entropy intragroup medium suggests that theinfalling material can eventually settle within the core of the main cluster.

1410.8522	the physics inside the scaling relations for x-ray galaxy clusters: gas  clumpiness, gas mass fraction and slope of the pressure profile	in galaxy clusters, the relations between observables in x-ray and millimeterwave bands and the total mass have normalizations, slopes and redshiftevolutions that are simple to estimate in a self-similar scenario. we studythese scaling relations and show that they can be efficiently expressed, in amore coherent picture, by fixing the normalizations and slopes to theself-similar predictions, and advocating, as responsible of the observeddeviations, only three physical mass-dependent quantities: the gas clumpiness$c$, the gas mass fraction $f_g$ and the logarithmic slope of the thermalpressure profile $\beta_p$. we use samples of the observed gas masses,temperature, luminosities, and compton parameters in local clusters toconstrain normalization and mass dependence of these 3 physical quantities, andmeasure: $c^{0.5} f_g = 0.110 (\pm 0.002 \pm 0.002) \left( e_z m / 5 \times10^{14} m_{\odot} \right)^{0.198 (\pm 0.025 \pm 0.04)}$ and $\beta_p = -d \lnp/d \ln r = 3.14 (\pm 0.04 \pm 0.02) \left( e_z m / 5 \times 10^{14} m_{\odot}\right)^{0.071 (\pm 0.012 \pm 0.004)}$, where both a statistical and systematicerror (the latter mainly due to the cross-calibration uncertainties affectingthe \cxo\ and \xmm\ results used in the present analysis) are quoted. thedegeneracy between $c$ and $f_g$ is broken by using the estimates of thecompton parameters. together with the self-similar predictions, these estimateson $c$, $f_g$ and $\beta_p$ define an inter-correlated internally-consistentset of scaling relations that reproduces the mass estimates with the lowestresiduals.

1412.5940	cluster radio halos at the crossroads between astrophysics and cosmology  in the ska era	giant radio halos (rh) are diffuse, mpc-sized, synchrotron radio sourcesobserved in a fraction of merging galaxy clusters. the current scenario for theorigin of rhs assumes that turbulence generated during cluster mergersre-accelerates pre-existing fossil and/or secondary electrons in theintra-cluster-medium (icm) to the energies necessary to produce the observedradio emission. moreover, more relaxed clusters could host diffuse "off state"halos produced by secondary electrons. in this chapter we use monte carlosimulations, that combine turbulent-acceleration physics and the generation ofsecondaries in the icm, to calculate the occurrence of rhs in the universe,their spectral properties and connection with properties of the hostingclusters. predictions for ska1 surveys are presented at low (100-300 mhz) andmid (1-2 ghz) frequencies assuming the expected sensitivities and spatialresolutions of ska1. ska1 will step into an unexplored territory allowing us tostudy the formation and evolution of rhs in a totally new range of clustermasses and redshift, allowing firm tests of the current theoretical hypothesis.in particular, the combination of ska1-low and sur will allow the discovery of~1000 ultrasteep- spectrum halos and to detect for the very first time "offstate" rhs. we expect that at least ~2500 giant rhs will be discovered byska1-low surveys up to z~0.6. remarkably these surveys will be sensitive to rhsin a cluster mass range (down to ~10^14 solar masses) and redshifts (up to ~1)that are unexplored by current observations. ska1 surveys will be highlycompetitive with present and future sz-surveys in the detection ofhigh-redshift massive objects.

1512.03833	the xxl survey iii. luminosity-temperature relation of the bright  cluster sample	the xxl survey is the largest homogeneous survey carried out with xmm-newton.covering an area of 50 deg$^{2}$, the survey contains several hundred galaxyclusters out to a redshift of $\approx$2 above an x-ray flux limit of$\sim$5$\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. this paper belongs to the firstseries of xxl papers focusing on the bright cluster sample. we investigate theluminosity-temperature (lt) relation for the brightest clusters detected in thexxl survey, taking fully into account the selection biases. we investigate theform of the lt relation, placing constraints on its evolution. we haveclassified the 100 brightest clusters in the xxl survey based on their measuredx-ray flux. these 100 clusters have been analysed to determine their luminosityand temperature to evaluate the lt relation. we used three methods to fit thelt relation, with two of these methods providing a prescription to fully takeinto account the selection effects of the survey. we measure the evolution ofthe lt relation internally using the broad redshift range of the sample. takinginto account selection effects, we find a slope of the bolometric lt relationof b$_{\rm lt}=3.08\pm$0.15, steeper than the self-similar expectation (b$_{\rmlt}$=2). our best-fit result for the evolution factor is $e(z)^{1.64\pm0.77}$,consistent with "strong self-similar" evolution where clusters scaleself-similarly with both mass and redshift. however, this result is marginallystronger than "weak self-similar" evolution, where clusters scale with redshiftalone. we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the assumptions made inour model, finding that using an external lt relation as a low-z baseline canhave a profound effect on the measured evolution. however, more clusters areneeded to break the degeneracy between the choice of likelihood model andmass-temperature relation on the derived evolution.

astro-ph;0005224	beta-model and cooling flows in x-ray clusters of galaxies	the spatial emission from the core of cooling flow clusters of galaxies isinadequately described by a beta-model(cavaliere and fusco-femiano 1976).spectrally, the central region of these clusters are well approximated with atwo-temperature model, where the inner temperature represents the multiphasestatus of the core and the outer temperature is a measure of the ambient gastemperature.following this observational evidence, i extend the use of thebeta-model to a two-phase gas emission, where the two components coexist withina boundary radius r_cool and the ambient gas alone fills the volume shell atradius above r_cool. this simple model still provides an analytic expressionfor the total surface brightness profile. based upon a physically meaningfulmodel for the x-ray emission, this formula can be used (i) to improvesignificantly the modeling of the surface brightness profile of cooling flowclusters of galaxies when compared to the standard beta-model results, (ii) toconstrain properly the physical characteristics of the intracluster plasma inthe outskirts, like, e.g., the ambient gas temperature.

astro-ph;0111455	projection effects in x-ray cores of cooling flow galaxy clusters	recent analyses of xmm and chandra data of the cores of x-ray bright clustersof galaxies show that modeling with a multi-phase gas in which severaltemperatures and densities are in equilibrium might not be appropriate.instead, a single-phase model seems able to reproduce properly the spectracollected in annuli from the central region. the measured single-phasetemperature profiles indicate a steep positive gradient in the central 100-200kpc and the gas density shows a flat profile in the central few tens of kpc.given this observational evidence, we estimate the contribution to theprojected-on-the-sky rings from the cluster emissivity as function of the shellvolume fraction sampled. we show that the observed projected x-ray emissionmimics the multi-phase status of the plasma even though the input distributionis single-phase. this geometrical projection affects (i) analyses of data whereinsufficient spatial resolution is accessible, (ii) the central bin when itsdimension is comparable to the extension of any flatness in the central gasdensity profile.

astro-ph;0508585	chandra observation of the multiple merger cluster abell 521	we present the chandra analysis of the galaxy cluster a521 (z=0.247). thehigh resolution of the chandra observation has allowed us to refine theoriginal merging scenario proposed for a521, and to reveal new features in itsx-ray emission. a521 has strongly substructured icm density and temperaturemaps. its x-ray diffuse emission is elongated along a nw/se direction (sx2) andshows two major components, a main cluster and a northern group of galaxies.this latter is in turn substructured, showing a clump of cold and very densegas centred on the bcg, and a northern tail aligned in the sx2 direction. acompression of the x-ray isophotes is also observed south of the bcg. weconclude that the northern group is infalling onto the main cluster along thenw/se direction. this hypothesis is corroborated by the presence of a hot barin the icm temperature map located between the southern and northern regions,as the gas could be compressionally heated due to the subclusters' collision.the hot region corresponds to the eastern part of an over-dense ridge ofgalaxies, along which it was originally suggested that a merging of subclustershas recently occurred along the line of sight. an alternative hypothesis aboutthe origin of the hot central bar is that we could observe in projection theshock fronts due to this older cluster-cluster collision. two other structurespossibly interacting with the main cluster are detected on the west andnorth-east sides of the bcg. we also uncover the presence of two northern edgesin the icm density. a521 is a spectacular example of a multiple merger clustermade up by several substructures converging at different epochs towards thecentre of the system. the very pertubed dynamical state of this cluster is alsoconfirmed by our discovery of a radio relic in its south-east region.

astro-ph;0509024	the baryon fraction in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters	we study the baryon mass fraction in a set of hydrodynamical simulations ofgalaxy clusters performed using the tree+sph code gadget-2. we investigate thedependence of the baryon fraction upon the radiative cooling, star formation,feedback through galactic winds, conduction and redshift. both the cold stellarcomponent and the hot x-ray emitting gas have narrow distributions that, atlarge cluster-centric distances r&gt;r500, are nearly independent of the physicsincluded in the simulations. only the non-radiative runs reproduce the gasfraction inferred from observations of the inner regions (r ~ r2500) of massiveclusters. when cooling is turned on, the excess star formation is mitigated bythe action of galactic winds, but yet not by the amount required byobservational data. the baryon fraction within a fixed overdensity increasesslightly with redshift, independent of the physical processes involved in theaccumulation of baryons in the cluster potential well. in runs with cooling andfeedback, the increase in baryons is associated with a larger stellar massfraction that arises at high redshift as a consequence of more efficient gascooling. for the same reason, the gas fraction appears less concentrated athigher redshift. we discuss the possible cosmological implications of ourresults and find that two assumptions generally adopted, (1) mean value of yb =fb / (omega_b/omega_m) not evolving with redshift, and (2) a fixed ratiobetween f_star and f_gas independent of radius and redshift, might not bevalid. in the estimate of the cosmic matter density parameter, this impliessome systematic effects of the order of delta omega_m/omega_m &lt; +0.15 fornon-radiative runs and delta omega_m/omega_m ~ +0.05 and &lt; -0.05 for radiativesimulations.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;0602434	systematics in the x-ray cluster mass estimators	we examine the systematics affecting the x-ray mass estimators applied to aset of five simulated galaxy clusters. they have been processed through thex-ray map simulator, x-mas, to provide chandra-like long exposures that areanalyzed to reconstruct the gas temperature, density, and mass profiles used asinput. we find that at r_2500 the mass profile obtained via a directapplication of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is consistent within 1sigma with the actual mass; although we notice this estimator shows highstatistical errors due to high level of chandra background. instead, thepoorness of the beta-model in describing the gas density profile makes theevaluated masses to be underestimated by \sim 40 per cent with respect to thetrue mass, both with an isothermal and a polytropic temperature profile. wealso test ways to recover the mass by adopting an analytic mass model, such asthose proposed by navarro et al. (1997) and rasia et al. (2004), and fittingthe temperature profile expected from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation tothe observed one. these methods and the one of the hydrostatic equilibriumequation provide a more robust mass estimation than the ones based on thebeta-model. in the present work the main limitation for a precise massreconstruction is to ascribe to the relatively high level of the backgroundchosen to reproduce the chandra one. after artificially reducing it by a factorof 100, we find that the estimated mass significantly underestimates the truemass profiles. this is manly due (i) to the neglected contribution of the gasbulk motions to the total energy budget and (ii) to the bias towards lowervalues of the x-ray temperature measurements because of the complex thermalstructure of the emitting plasma.

astro-ph;9806375	rosat pspc observations of the outer regions of the perseus cluster of  galaxies	we present an analysis of four off-axis rosat pspc observations of theperseus cluster of galaxies (abell~426). we detect the surface brightnessprofile to a radius of 80 arcmin ($\sim 2.4 h_{50}^{-1}$ mpc) from the x-raypeak. the profile is measured in various sectors and in three different energybands. firstly, a colour analysis highlights a slight variation of $n_{h}$ overthe region, and cool components in the core and in the eastern sector. we applythe $\beta$-model to the profiles from different sectors and present a solutionto the, so-called, $\beta$-problem. the residuals from an azimuthally-averagedprofile highlight extended emission both in the east and in the west, withestimated luminosities of about 8 and 1 $\times 10^{43} erg/s$, respectively.we fit several models to the surface brightness profile, including the oneobtained from the navarro, frenk and white (1995) potential. we obtain the bestfit with the gas distribution described by a power law in the inner, coolingregion and a $\beta$-model for the extended emission. through the best-fitresults and the constraints from the deprojection of the surface brightnessprofiles, we define the radius where the overdensity inside the cluster is 200times the critical value, $r_{200}$, at $2.7 h_{50}^{-1}$ mpc. within $2.3h_{50}^{-1}$ mpc ($0.85 r_{200}$), the total mass in the perseus cluster is$1.2 \times 10^{15} m_{\odot}$ and its gas fraction is about 30 per cent.

astro-ph;9901137	is the butcher-oemler effect a function of the cluster redshift ?	using pspc {\it rosat} data, we measure x-ray surface brightness profiles,size and luminosity of the butcher-oemler (bo) sample of clusters of galaxies.the cluster x-ray size, as measured by the petrosian r_{\eta=2} radius, doesnot change with redshift and is independent from x-ray luminosity. on the otherhand, the x-ray luminosity increases with redshift. considering that fairsamples show no-evolution, or negative luminosity evolution, we conclude thatthe bo sample is not formed from the same class of objects observed atdifferent look-back times. this is in conflict with the usual interpretation ofthe butcher-oemler as an evolutionary (or redshift-dependent) effect, based onthe assumption that we are comparing the same class of objects at differentredshifts. other trends present in the bo sample reflect selection criteriarather than differences in look-back time, as independently confirmed by thefact that trends loose strength when we enlarge the sample with x-ray selectedsample of clusters. the variety of optical sizes and shapes of the clusters inthe butcher-oemler sample, and the malmquist-like bias, are the reasons forthese selection effects that mimic the trends usually interpreted as changesdue to evolution.

astro-ph;9901304	rosat pspc observations of 36 high-luminosity clusters of galaxies:  constraints on the gas fraction	we present a detailed and homogeneous analysis of the rosat pspc surfacebrightness profiles of 36 clusters of galaxies with high x-ray luminosity (l_x&gt; 10^{45} erg s^{-1}) and redshifts between 0.05 and 0.44. using recent ascaestimates of the temperature of the gas for most of the clusters in the sample,we apply both the deprojection technique and model fitting to the surfacebrightness profiles to constrain the gas and dark matter distributions underthe assumption that the gas is both isothermal and hydrostatic.  applying robust estimators, we find that the gas fraction within r_{500} ofthe clusters in our sample has a distribution centred on f_gas(r_{500}) = 0.168h_{50}^{-1.5}. the gas fraction ranges from 0.101 to 0.245 at the 95 per centconfidence level. the values of f_gas show highly significant variationsbetween individual clusters, which may be explained if the dark matter has asignificant baryonic component. within a cluster, the average radial dependenceof the gas mass fraction increases outward as r^s, with s~0.20. combining theseresults with those of primordial nucleosynthesis calculations and the currentestimate of h_0, the above central location implies \omega_{0, m} &lt; 0.56 at the95 per cent confidence level. this upper limit decreases to 0.34 if we take thehighest significant estimates for f_gas.  a significant decrease in cluster gas fraction with redshift from the localvalue, f_{gas, 0}, of 0.21, found assuming \omega_{0, m} =1, is also reduced if\omega_{0, m} is low.

astro-ph;9902159	x-ray and lensing results on the cluster around the powerful radio  galaxy 4c+55.16	we present results from asca and rosat hri observations of the powerful radiogalaxy 4c+55.16 at redshift 0.24. extended soft x-ray emission is imaged by therosat hri. the x-ray brightness profile is sharply peaked on the radio galaxy,characteristic of a strong cooling flow. the x-ray spectrum obtained from ascais consistent with multi-phase intracluster gas. there is evidence for anabsorbed cool component as well as ambient cluster medium in the asca spectrum.a spectral fit, taking a cooling-flow component into account, gives atemperature of kt=5.4(+1.4/-0.9) kev, metal abundance 0.5(+/-0.1)zsun, excessabsorption on the cool component, nh=4.9(+3.4/-1.3)e+21 cm-2, and anabsorption-corrected bolometric luminosity of 2.2e+45 erg/s (h0=50km/s/mpc,q0=0.5). the mass deposition rate is estimated to be about 1100 msun/yr fromthe spectral analysis, in good agreement with that derived from imaginganalysis of the rosat data when corrected for absorption. we tentativelyidentify a blue feature, seen about 15 arcsec from the centre of the radiogalaxy in a published optical image, as a gravitationally-lensed arc. theinferred lensing mass is consistent with the gravitational mass derived fromthe x-ray data. the best-estimate of the redshift of the lensed object is1.5(&gt;0.7). all the observed properties suggest that the environment of 4c+55.16is similar to known massive cooling flow clusters. this is the first massivecooling flow to be found around a powerful, radio source with a compact,ghz-peaked spectrum core.

astro-ph;9911521	zw 1718.1-0108: a highly disturbed galaxy cluster at low galactic  latitude	we report the discovery of highly distorted x-ray emission associated withthe nearby cluster zw1718.1-0108, one of whose dominant members is the powerfulradio galaxy 3c353. this cluster has been missed by previous x-ray clustersurveys because of its low galactic latitude (b = 19.5deg), despite itsbrightness in the hard x-ray band (2-10 kev flux of 1.2e-11 erg/s/cm2). ouroptical ccd image of the central part of the cluster reveals many membergalaxies which are dimmed substantially by heavy galactic extinction. we havemeasured redshifts of three bright galaxies near the x-ray emission peak andthey are all found to be around z=0.028. the asca gis and rosat hri images showthree aligned x-ray clumps embedded in low surface-brightness x-ray emissionextended by about 30 arcmin. the averaged temperature measured with asca iskt=4.3+/-0.2 kev, which appears to be hot for the bolometric luminosity 1.1e+44erg/s, when compared to the temperature-luminosity correlation of galaxyclusters. the irregular x-ray morphology and evidence for a non-uniformtemperature distribution suggest that the system is undergoing a merger ofsubstructures. since the sizes and luminosities of the individual clumps areconsistent with those of galaxy groups, zw1718.1-0108 is interpreted as anon-going merger of galaxy groups in a dark matter halo forming a cluster ofgalaxies and thus is in a transition phase of cluster formation.

0811.2199	reconstructing mass profiles of simulated galaxy clusters by combining  sunyaev-zeldovich and x-ray images	we present a method to recover mass profiles of galaxy clusters by combiningdata on thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) and x-ray imaging, thereby avoiding touse any information on x-ray spectroscopy. this method, which represents adevelopment of the geometrical deprojection technique presented in ameglio etal. (2007), implements the solution of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. inorder to quantify the efficiency of our mass reconstructions, we apply ourtechnique to a set of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. we proposetwo versions of our method of mass reconstruction. method 1 is completelymodel-independent, while method 2 assumes instead the analytic mass profileproposed by navarro et al. (1997) (nfw). we find that the main source of biasin recovering the mass profiles is due to deviations from hydrostaticequilibrium, which cause an underestimate of the mass of about 10 per cent atr_500 and up to 20 per cent at the virial radius. method 1 provides areconstructed mass which is biased low by about 10 per cent, with a 20 per centscatter, with respect to the true mass profiles. method 2 proves to be morestable, reducing the scatter to 10 per cent, but with a larger bias of 20 percent, mainly induced by the deviations from equilibrium in the outskirts. tobetter understand the results of method 2, we check how well it allows torecover the relation between mass and concentration parameter. when analyzingthe 3d mass profiles we find that including in the fit the inner 5 per cent ofthe virial radius biases high the halo concentration. also, at a fixed mass,hotter clusters tend to have larger concentration. our procedure recovers theconcentration parameter essentially unbiased but with a scatter of about 50 percent.

0811.3556	the outer regions of galaxy clusters: chandra constraints on the x-ray  surface brightness	(abridged version) we study the properties of the x-ray surface brightnessprofiles in a sample of galaxy clusters that were observed with chandra andhave emission detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 2 at a radiusbeyond r500 ~ 0.7 r200. our study aims to measure the slopes of the x-raysurface brightness and of the gas density profiles in the outskirts of massiveclusters. these constraints are compared to similar results obtained fromobservations and numerical simulations of the temperature and dark matterdensity profiles with the intention of presenting a consistent picture of theouter regions of galaxy clusters. we extract the surface brightness profilessb(r) of 52 x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z&gt;0.3 from x-ray exposuresobtained with chandra. we estimate r200 using both a beta-model that reproducessb(r) and scaling relations from the literature. the two methods converge tocomparable values. we determine the radius, r_s2n, at which the signal-to-noiseratio is larger than 2 and select the objects in the sample that satisfy thecriterion r_s2n/r200 &gt; 0.7. for the eleven selected objects, we model with apower-law the behaviour of sb(r). we measure a consistent steepening of thesb(r) profile moving outward from 0.4 r200, where an average slope of -3.6(sigma=0.8) is estimated. at r200, we evaluate a slope of -4.3 (sigma=0.9) thatimplies a slope in the gas density profile of -2.6 and a predicted mean valueof the surface brightness in the 0.5-2 band of 2e-12 erg/s/cm2/deg2. combinedwith estimates of the outer slope of the gas temperature profile andexpectations about the dark matter distribution, these measurements allow us todescribe properly how x-ray luminous clusters behave out to the virial radius.
